  <span class='block preamble'>In the Name of God the Clement, the Merciful</span>
  <span class='block dropcap'>
  Praise and thanksgiving be unto Providence that out of all the
  realities in existence He has chosen the reality of man and has
  honored it with intellect and wisdom, the two most luminous lights in
  either world. Through the agency of this great endowment, He has in
  every epoch cast on the mirror of creation new and wonderful
  configurations. If we look objectively upon the world of being, it
  will become apparent that from age to age, the temple of existence
  has continually been embellished with a fresh grace, and
  distinguished with an ever-varying splendor, deriving from wisdom and
  the power of thought.
  </span>
</p>

<p id='2' data-ref='sdc_en-p2'>
This supreme emblem of God stands first in the order of creation and
first in rank, taking precedence over all created things. Witness to
it is the Holy Tradition, “Before all else, God created the mind.”
From the dawn of creation, it was made to be revealed in the temple
of man.</p>

<p id='3' data-ref='sdc_en-p3'>
Sanctified is the Lord, Who with the dazzling rays of this strange,
heavenly power has made our world of darkness the envy of the worlds
of light: “And the earth shall shine with the light of her Lord.” <a data-fnid='1'></a>
and exalted is He, Who has caused the nature of man to be the
dayspring of this boundless grace: “The God of mercy hath taught
the Qur’án, hath created man, hath taught him articulate speech.” <a data-fnid='2'></a>
</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn1'>
Qur’án 39:69.
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn2'>
Qur’án 55:1–3.
</aside>

<p id='4' data-ref='sdc_en-p4'>
O ye that have minds to know! Raise up your suppliant hands to the
heaven of the one God, and humble yourselves and be lowly before Him,
and thank Him for this supreme endowment, and implore Him to succor
us until, in this present age, godlike impulses may radiate from the
conscience of mankind, and this divinely kindled fire which has been
entrusted to the human heart may never die away.</p>

<p id='5' data-ref='sdc_en-p5'>
Consider carefully: all these highly varied phenomena, these
concepts, this knowledge, these technical procedures and
philosophical systems, these sciences, arts, industries and
inventions — all are emanations of the human mind. Whatever people
has ventured deeper into this shoreless sea, has come to excel the
rest. The happiness and pride of a nation consist in this, that it
should shine out like the sun in the high heaven of knowledge. “Shall
they who have knowledge and they who have it not, be treated alike?” <a data-fnid='3'></a>
And the honor and distinction of the individual consist in this, that
he among all the world’s multitudes should become a source of
social good. Is any larger bounty conceivable than this, that an
individual, looking within himself, should find that by the
confirming grace of God he has become the cause of peace and
well-being, of happiness and advantage to his fellow men? No, by the
one true God, there is no greater bliss, no more complete delight.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn3'>
Qur’án 39:12.
</aside>

<p id='6' data-ref='sdc_en-p6'>
How long shall we drift on the wings of passion and vain desire; how
long shall we spend our days like barbarians in the depths of
ignorance and abomination? God has given us eyes, that we may look
about us at the world, and lay hold of whatsoever will further
civilization and the arts of living. He has given us ears, that we
may hear and profit by the wisdom of scholars and philosophers and
arise to promote and practice it. Senses and faculties have been
bestowed upon us, to be devoted to the service of the general good;
so that we, distinguished above all other forms of life for
perceptiveness and reason, should labor at all times and along all
lines, whether the occasion be great or small, ordinary or
extraordinary, until all mankind are safely gathered into the
impregnable stronghold of knowledge. We should continually be
establishing new bases for human happiness and creating and promoting
new instrumentalities toward this end. How excellent, how honorable
is man if he arises to fulfill his responsibilities; how wretched and
contemptible, if he shuts his eyes to the welfare of society and
wastes his precious life in pursuing his own selfish interests and
personal advantages. Supreme happiness is man’s, and he beholds the
signs of God in the world and in the human soul, if he urges on the
steed of high endeavor in the arena of civilization and justice. “We
will surely show them Our signs in the world and within themselves.” <a data-fnid='4'></a>
</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn4'>
Qur’án 41:53.
</aside>

<p id='7' data-ref='sdc_en-p7'>
And this is man’s uttermost wretchedness: that he should live
inert, apathetic, dull, involved only with his own base appetites.
When he is thus, he has his being in the deepest ignorance and
savagery, sinking lower than the brute beasts. “They are like the
brutes: Yea, they go more astray … For the vilest beasts in God’s
sight, are the deaf, the dumb, who understand not.” <a data-fnid='5'></a>
</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn5'>
Qur’án 7:178; 8:22.
</aside>

<p id='8' data-ref='sdc_en-p8'>
We must now highly resolve to arise and lay hold of all those
instrumentalities that promote the peace and well-being and
happiness, the knowledge, culture and industry, the dignity, value
and station, of the entire human race. Thus, through the restoring
waters of pure intention and unselfish effort, the earth of human
potentialities will blossom with its own latent excellence and flower
into praiseworthy qualities, and bear and flourish until it comes to
rival that rosegarden of knowledge which belonged to our forefathers.
Then will this holy land of Persia become in every sense the focal
center of human perfections, reflecting as if in a mirror the full
panoply of world civilization.</p>

<p id='9' data-ref='sdc_en-p9'>
All praise and honor be to the Dayspring of divine wisdom, the
Dawning Point of Revelation (Muḥammad), and to the holy line of His
descendants, since, by the widespread rays of His consummate wisdom,
His universal knowledge, those savage denizens of Ya<u>th</u>rib
(Medina) and Baṭḥá (Mecca), miraculously, and in so brief a
time, were drawn out of the depths of their ignorance, rose up to the
pinnacles of learning, and became centers of arts and sciences and
human perfections, and stars of felicity and true civilization,
shining across the horizons of the world.</p>

<p id='10' data-ref='sdc_en-p10'>
His Majesty the <u>Sh</u>áh <a data-fnid='6'></a>
has, at the present time, [1875] resolved to bring about the
advancement of the Persian people, their welfare and security and the
prosperity of their country. He has spontaneously extended assistance
to his subjects, displaying energy and fair-mindedness, hoping that
by the light of justice he might make Írán the envy of East and
West, and set that fine fervor which characterized the first great
epochs of Persia to flowing again through the veins of her people. As
is clear to the discerning, the writer has for this reason felt it
necessary to put down, for the sake of God alone and as a tribute to
this high endeavor, a brief statement on certain urgent questions. To
demonstrate that His one purpose is to promote the general welfare,
He has withheld His name. <a data-fnid='7'></a>
Since He believes that guidance toward righteousness is in itself a
righteous act, He offers these few words of counsel to His country’s
sons, words spoken for God’s sake alone and in the spirit of a
faithful friend. Our Lord, Who knows all things, bears witness that
this Servant seeks nothing but what is right and good; for He, a
wanderer in the desert of God’s love, has come into a realm where
the hand of denial or assent, of praise or blame, can touch Him not.
“We nourish your souls for the sake of God; We seek from you
neither recompense nor thanks.” <a data-fnid='8'></a>

O people of Persia! Look into those blossoming pages that tell of
another day, a time long past. Read them and wonder; see the great
sight. Írán in that day was as the heart of the world; she was the
bright torch flaming in the assemblage of mankind. Her power and
glory shone out like the morning above the world’s horizons, and
the splendor of her learning cast its rays over East and West. Word
of the widespread empire of those who wore her crown reached even to
the dwellers in the arctic circle, and the fame of the awesome
presence of her King of Kings humbled the rulers of Greece and Rome.
The greatest of the world’s philosophers marveled at the wisdom of
her government, and her political system became the model for all the
kings of the four continents then known. She was distinguished among
all peoples for the scope of her dominion, she was honored by all for
her praiseworthy culture and civilization. She was as the pivot of
the world, she was the source and center of sciences and arts, the
wellspring of great inventions and discoveries, the rich mine of
human virtues and perfections. The intellect, the wisdom of the
individual members of this excellent nation dazzled the minds of
other peoples, the brilliance and perceptive genius that
characterized all this noble race aroused the envy of the whole
world.</p>

<p id='13' data-ref='sdc_en-p13'>
Aside from that which is a matter of record in Persian histories, it
is stated in the Old Testament — established today, among all
European peoples, as a sacred and canonical Text — that in the time
of Cyrus, called in Iranian works Bahman son of Isfandíyár, the
three hundred and sixty divisions of the Persian Empire extended from
the inner confines of India and China to the farthermost reaches of
Yemen and Ethiopia. <a data-fnid='9'></a>  The
Greek accounts, as well, relate how this proud sovereign came against
them with an innumerable host, and left their own till then
victorious dominion level with the dust. He made the pillars of all
the governments to quake; according to that authoritative Arab work,
the history of Abu’l-Fidá, he took over the entire known world. It
is likewise recorded in this same text and elsewhere, that Firaydún,
a king of the Pí<u>sh</u>dádíyán Dynasty — who was indeed, for
his inherent perfections, his powers of judgment, the scope of his
knowledge, and his long series of continual victories, unique among
all the rulers who preceded and followed him — divided the whole
known world among his three sons.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn9'>
2 Chronicles 36:22–23; Ezra 1:2; Esther 1:1; 8:9; Isaiah 45:1, 14;

</aside>

<p id='14' data-ref='sdc_en-p14'>
As attested by the annals of the world’s most illustrious peoples,
the first government to be established on earth, the foremost empire
to be organized among the nations, was Persia’s throne and diadem.</p>

<p id='15' data-ref='sdc_en-p15'>
O people of Persia! Awake from your drunken sleep! Rise up from your
lethargy! Be fair in your judgment: will the dictates of honor permit
this holy land, once the wellspring of world civilization, the source
of glory and joy for all mankind, the envy of East and West, to
remain an object of pity, deplored by all nations? She was once the
noblest of peoples: will you let contemporary history register for
the ages her now degenerate state? Will you complacently accept her
present wretchedness, when she was once the land of all mankind’s
desire? Must she now, for this contemptible sloth, this failure to
struggle, this utter ignorance, be accounted the most backward of
nations?</p>

<p id='16' data-ref='sdc_en-p16'>
Were not the people of Persia, in days long gone, the head and front
of intellect and wisdom? Did they not, by God’s grace, shine out
like the daystar from the horizons of divine knowledge? How is it
that we are satisfied today with this miserable condition, are
engrossed in our licentious passions, have blinded ourselves to
supreme happiness, to that which is pleasing in God’s sight, and
have all become absorbed in our selfish concerns and the search for
ignoble, personal advantage?</p>

<p id='17' data-ref='sdc_en-p17'>
This fairest of lands was once a lamp, streaming with the rays of
divine knowledge, of science and art, of nobility and high
achievement, of wisdom and valor. Today, because of the idleness and
lethargy of her people, their torpor, their undisciplined way of
life, their lack of pride, lack of ambition — her bright fortune has
been totally eclipsed, her light has turned to darkness. “The seven
heavens and the seven earths weep over the mighty when he is brought
low.”</p>

<p id='18' data-ref='sdc_en-p18'>
It should not be imagined that the people of Persia are inherently
deficient in intelligence, or that for essential perceptiveness and
understanding, inborn sagacity, intuition and wisdom, or innate
capacity, they are inferior to others. God forbid! On the contrary,
they have always excelled all other peoples in endowments conferred
by birth. Persia herself, moreover, from the standpoint of her
temperate climate and natural beauties, her geographical advantages
and her rich soil, is blessed to a supreme degree. What she urgently
requires, however, is deep reflection, resolute action, training,
inspiration and encouragement. Her people must make a massive effort,
and their pride must be aroused.</p>

<p id='19' data-ref='sdc_en-p19'>
Today throughout the five continents of the globe it is Europe and
most sections of America that are renowned for law and order,
government and commerce, art and industry, science, philosophy and
education. Yet in ancient times these were the most savage of the
world’s peoples, the most ignorant and brutish. They were even
stigmatized as barbarians — that is, utterly rude and uncivilized.
Further, from the fifth century after Christ until the fifteenth,
that period defined as the Middle Ages, such terrible struggles and
fierce upheavals, such ruthless encounters and horrifying acts, were
the rule among the peoples of Europe, that the Europeans rightly
describe those ten centuries as the Dark Ages. The basis of Europe’s
progress and civilization was actually laid in the fifteenth century
of the Christian era, and from that time on, all her present evident
culture has been, under the stimulus of great minds and as a result
of the expansion of the frontiers of knowledge and the exertion of
energetic and ambitious efforts, in the process of development.</p>

<p id='20' data-ref='sdc_en-p20'>
Today by the grace of God and the spiritual influence of His
universal Manifestation, the fair-minded ruler of Írán has gathered
his people into the shelter of justice, and the sincerity of the
imperial purpose has shown itself in kingly acts. Hoping that his
reign will rival the glorious past, he has sought to establish equity
and righteousness and to foster education and the processes of
civilization throughout this noble land, and to translate from
potentiality into actuality whatever will insure its progress. Not
until now had we seen a monarch, holding in his capable hands the
reins of affairs, and on whose high resolve the welfare of all his
subjects depends, exerting as it would befit him, like a benevolent
father, his efforts toward the training and cultivation of his
people, seeking to insure their well-being and peace of mind, and
exhibiting due concern for their interests; this Servant and those
like Him have therefore remained silent. Now, however, it is clear to
the discerning that the <u>Sh</u>áh has of his own accord determined
to establish a just government and to secure the progress of all his
subjects. His honorable intention has consequently evoked this
present statement.</p>

<p id='21' data-ref='sdc_en-p21'>
It is indeed strange that instead of offering thanks for this bounty,
which truly derives from the grace of Almighty God, by arising as one
in gratitude and enthusiasm and praying that these noble purposes
will daily multiply, some, on the contrary, whose reason has been
corrupted by personal motives and the clarity of whose perception has
been clouded by self-interest and conceit; whose energies are devoted
to the service of their passions, whose sense of pride is perverted
to the love of leadership, have raised the standard of opposition and
waxed loud in their complaints. Up to now, they blamed the <u>Sh</u>áh
for not, on his own initiative, working for his people’s welfare
and seeking to bring about their peace and well-being. Now that he
has inaugurated this great design they have changed their tune. Some
say that these are newfangled methods and foreign isms, quite
unrelated to the present needs and the time-honored customs of
Persia. Others have rallied the helpless masses, who know nothing of
religion or its laws and basic principles and therefore have no power
of discrimination — and tell them that these modern methods are the
practices of heathen peoples, and are contrary to the venerated
canons of true faith, and they add the saying, “He who imitates a
people is one of them.” One group insists that such reforms should
go forward with great deliberation, step by step, haste being
inadmissible. Another maintains that only such measures should be
adopted as the Persians themselves devise, that they themselves
should reform their political administration and their educational
system and the state of their culture and that there is no need to
borrow improvements from other nations. Every faction, in short,
follows its own particular illusion.</p>

<p id='22' data-ref='sdc_en-p22'>
O people of Persia! How long will you wander? How long must your
confusion last? How long will it go on, this conflict of opinions,
this useless antagonism, this ignorance, this refusal to think?
Others are alert, and we sleep our dreamless sleep. Other nations are
making every effort to improve their condition; we are trapped in our
desires and self-indulgences, and at every step we stumble into a new
snare.</p>

<p id='23' data-ref='sdc_en-p23'>
God is Our witness that We have no ulterior motive in developing this
theme. We seek neither to curry favor with any one nor to attract any
one to Ourselves nor to derive any material benefit therefrom. We
speak only as one earnestly desiring the good pleasure of God, for We
have turned Our gaze away from the world and its peoples and have
sought refuge in the sheltering care of the Lord. “No pay do I ask
of you for This … My reward is of God alone.” <a data-fnid='10'></a>
</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn10'>
Qur’án 6:90; 11:31.
</aside>

<p id='24' data-ref='sdc_en-p24'>
Those who maintain that these modern concepts apply only to other
countries and are irrelevant in Írán, that they do not satisfy her
requirements or suit her way of life, disregard the fact that other
nations were once as we are now. Did not these new systems and
procedures, these progressive enterprises, contribute to the
advancement of those countries? Were the people of Europe harmed by
the adoption of such measures? Or did they rather by these means
reach the highest degree of material development? Is it not true that
for centuries, the people of Persia have lived as we see them living
today, carrying out the pattern of the past? Have any discernible
benefits resulted, has any progress been made? If these things had
not been tested by experience, some in whose minds the light of
native intelligence is clouded, might idly question them. On the
contrary, however, every aspect of these prerequisites to progress
have in other countries been time and again put to the test, and
their benefits demonstrated so plainly that even the dullest mind can
grasp them.</p>

<p id='25' data-ref='sdc_en-p25'>
Let us consider this justly and without bias: let us ask ourselves
which one of these basic principles and sound, well-established
procedures would fail to satisfy our present needs, or would be
incompatible with Persia’s best political interests or injurious to
the general welfare of her people. Would the extension of education,
the development of useful arts and sciences, the promotion of
industry and technology, be harmful things? For such endeavor lifts
the individual within the mass and raises him out of the depths of
ignorance to the highest reaches of knowledge and human excellence.
Would the setting up of just legislation, in accord with the divine
laws which guarantee the happiness of society and protect the rights
of all mankind and are an impregnable proof against assault — would
such laws, insuring the integrity of the members of society and their
equality before the law, inhibit their prosperity and success?</p>

<p id='26' data-ref='sdc_en-p26'>
Or if by using one’s perceptive faculties, one can draw analogies
from present circumstances and the conclusions arrived at by
collective experience, and can envisage as coming realities
situations now only potential, would it be unreasonable to take such
present measures as would guarantee our future security? Would it
seem shortsighted, improvident and unsound, would it constitute a
deviation from what is right and proper, if we were to strengthen our
relationships with neighboring countries, enter into binding treaties
with the great powers, foster friendly connections with well-disposed
governments, look to the expansion of trade with the nations of East
and West, develop our natural resources and increase the wealth of
our people?</p>

<p id='27' data-ref='sdc_en-p27'>
Would it spell perdition for our subjects if the provincial and
district governors were relieved of their present absolute authority,
whereby they function exactly as they please, and were instead
limited to equity and truth, and if their sentences involving capital
punishment, imprisonment and the like were contingent on confirmation
by the <u>Sh</u>áh and by higher courts in the capital, who would
first duly investigate the case and determine the nature and
seriousness of the crime, and then hand down a just decision subject
to the issuance of a decree by the sovereign? If bribery and
corruption, known today by the pleasant names of gifts and favors,
were forever excluded, would this threaten the foundations of
justice? Would it be an evidence of unsound thinking to deliver the
soldiery, who are a living sacrifice to the state and the people and
brave death at every turn, from their present extreme misery and
indigence, and to make adequate arrangements for their sustenance,
clothing and housing, and exert every effort to instruct their
officers in military science, and supply them with the most advanced
types of firearms and other weapons?
</p>

<p id='28' data-ref='sdc_en-p28'>
Should anyone object that the above-mentioned reforms have never yet
been fully effected, he should consider the matter impartially and
know that these deficiencies have resulted from the total absence of
a unified public opinion, and the lack of zeal and resolve and
devotion in the country’s leaders. It is obvious that not until the
people are educated, not until public opinion is rightly focused, not
until government officials, even minor ones, are free from even the
least remnant of corruption, can the country be properly
administered. Not until discipline, order and good government reach
the degree where an individual, even if he should put forth his
utmost efforts to do so, would still find himself unable to deviate
by so much as a hair’s breadth from righteousness, can the desired
reforms be regarded as fully established.</p>

<p id='29' data-ref='sdc_en-p29'>
Furthermore, any agency whatever, though it be the instrument of
mankind’s greatest good, is capable of misuse. Its proper use or
abuse depends on the varying degrees of enlightenment, capacity,
faith, honesty, devotion and high-mindedness of the leaders of public
opinion.</p>

<p id='30' data-ref='sdc_en-p30'>
The <u>Sh</u>áh has certainly done his part, and the execution of
the proposed beneficial measures is now in the hands of persons
functioning in assemblies of consultation. If these individuals prove
to be pure and high-minded, if they remain free from the taint of
corruption, the confirmations of God will make them a never-failing
source of bounty to mankind. He will cause to issue from their lips
and their pens what will bless the people, so that every corner of
this noble country of Írán will be illumined with their justice and
integrity and the rays of that light will encompass the whole earth.
“Neither will this be difficult with God.” <a data-fnid='11'></a>
</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn11'>
Qur’án 14:23; 35:18.
</aside>

<p id='31' data-ref='sdc_en-p31'>
Otherwise it is clear that the results will prove unacceptable. For
it has been directly witnessed in certain foreign countries that
following on the establishment of parliaments those bodies actually
distressed and confused the people and their well-meant reforms
produced maleficent results. While the setting up of parliaments, the
organizing of assemblies of consultation, constitutes the very
foundation and bedrock of government, there are several essential
requirements which these institutions must fulfill. First, the
elected members must be righteous, God-fearing, high-minded,
incorruptible. Second, they must be fully cognizant, in every
particular, of the laws of God, informed as to the highest principles
of law, versed in the rules which govern the management of internal
affairs and the conduct of foreign relations, skilled in the useful
arts of civilization, and content with their lawful emoluments.</p>

<p id='32' data-ref='sdc_en-p32'>
Let it not be imagined that members of this type would be impossible
to find. Through the grace of God and His chosen ones, and the high
endeavors of the devoted and the consecrated, every difficulty can be
easily resolved, every problem however complex will prove simpler
than blinking an eye.
</p>

<p id='33' data-ref='sdc_en-p33'>
If, however, the members of these consultative assemblies are
inferior, ignorant, uninformed of the laws of government and
administration, unwise, of low aim, indifferent, idle, self-seeking,
no benefit will accrue from the organizing of such bodies. Where, in
the past, if a poor man wanted his rights he had only to offer a gift
to one individual, now he would either have to renounce all hope of
justice or else satisfy the entire membership.</p>

<p id='34' data-ref='sdc_en-p34'>
Close investigation will show that the primary cause of oppression
and injustice, of unrighteousness, irregularity and disorder, is the
people’s lack of religious faith and the fact that they are
uneducated. When, for example, the people are genuinely religious and
are literate and well-schooled, and a difficulty presents itself,
they can apply to the local authorities; if they do not meet with
justice and secure their rights and if they see that the conduct of
the local government is incompatible with the divine good pleasure
and the king’s justice, they can then take their case to higher
courts and describe the deviation of the local administration from
the spiritual law. Those courts can then send for the local records
of the case and in this way justice will be done. At present,
however, because of their inadequate schooling, most of the
population lack even the vocabulary to explain what they want.</p>

<p id='35' data-ref='sdc_en-p35'>
As to those persons who, here and there, are considered leaders of
the people: because this is only the beginning of the new
administrative process, they are not yet sufficiently advanced in
their education to have experienced the delights of dispensing
justice or to have tasted the exhilaration of promoting righteousness

intent. They have not properly understood that man’s supreme honor
and real happiness lie in self-respect, in high resolves and noble
purposes, in integrity and moral quality, in immaculacy of mind. They

A man should pause and reflect and be just: his Lord, out of
measureless grace, has made him a human being and honored him with
the words: “Verily, We created man in the goodliest of forms” <a data-fnid='12'></a>  — and
caused His mercy which rises out of the dawn of oneness to shine down
upon him, until he became the wellspring of the words of God and the
place where the mysteries of heaven alighted, and on the morning of
creation he was covered with the rays of the qualities of perfection
and the graces of holiness. How can he stain this immaculate garment
with the filth of selfish desires, or exchange this everlasting honor
for infamy? “Dost thou think thyself only a puny form, when the
universe is folded up within thee?” <a data-fnid='13'></a>

Were it not our purpose to be brief and to develop our primary
subject, we would here set down a summary of themes from the divine
world, as to the reality of man and his high station and the
surpassing value and worth of the human race. Let this be, for
another time.</p>

<p id='38' data-ref='sdc_en-p38'>
The highest station, the supreme sphere, the noblest, most sublime
position in creation, whether visible or invisible, whether alpha or
omega, is that of the Prophets of God, notwithstanding the fact that
for the most part they have to outward seeming been possessed of
nothing but their own poverty. In the same way, ineffable glory is
set apart for the Holy Ones and those who are nearest to the
Threshold of God, although such as these have never for a moment
concerned themselves with material gain. Then comes the station of
those just kings whose fame as protectors of the people and
dispensers of divine justice has filled the world, whose name as
powerful champions of the people’s rights has echoed through
creation. These give no thought to amassing enormous fortunes for
themselves; they believe, rather, that their own wealth lies in
enriching their subjects. To them, if every individual citizen has
affluence and ease, the royal coffers are full. They take no pride in
gold and silver, but rather in their enlightenment and their
determination to achieve the universal good.</p>

<p id='39' data-ref='sdc_en-p39'>
Next in rank are those eminent and honorable ministers of state and
representatives, who place the will of God above their own, and whose
administrative skill and wisdom in the conduct of their office raises
the science of government to new heights of perfection. They shine in
the learned world like lamps of knowledge; their thinking, their
attitudes and their acts demonstrate their patriotism and their
concern for the country’s advancement. Content with a modest
stipend, they consecrate their days and nights to the execution of
important duties and the devising of methods to insure the progress
of the people. Through the effectiveness of their wise counsel, the
soundness of their judgment, they have ever caused their government
to become an example to be followed by all the governments of the
world. They have made their capital city a focal center of great
world undertakings, they have won distinction, attaining a supreme
degree of personal eminence, and reaching the loftiest heights of
repute and character.</p>

<p id='40' data-ref='sdc_en-p40'>
Again, there are those famed and accomplished men of learning,
possessed of praiseworthy qualities and vast erudition, who lay hold
on the strong handle of the fear of God and keep to the ways of
salvation. In the mirror of their minds the forms of transcendent
realities are reflected, and the lamp of their inner vision derives
its light from the sun of universal knowledge. They are busy by night
and by day with meticulous research into such sciences as are
profitable to mankind, and they devote themselves to the training of
students of capacity. It is certain that to their discerning taste,
the proffered treasures of kings would not compare with a single drop
of the waters of knowledge, and mountains of gold and silver could
not outweigh the successful solution of a difficult problem. To them,
the delights that lie outside their work are only toys for children,
and the cumbersome load of unnecessary possessions is only good for
the ignorant and base. Content, like the birds, they give thanks for
a handful of seeds, and the song of their wisdom dazzles the minds of
the world’s most wise.</p>

<p id='41' data-ref='sdc_en-p41'>
Again, there are sagacious leaders among the people and influential
personalities throughout the country, who constitute the pillars of
state. Their rank and station and success depend on their being the
well-wishers of the people and in their seeking out such means as
will improve the nation and will increase the wealth and comfort of
the citizens.</p>

<p id='42' data-ref='sdc_en-p42'>
Observe the case when an individual is an eminent person in his
country, zealous, wise, pure-hearted, known for his innate capacity,
intelligence, natural perspicacity — and is also an important member
of the state: what, for such an individual, can be regarded as honor,
abiding happiness, rank and station, whether in the here or the
hereafter? Is it a diligent attention to truth and righteousness, is
it dedication and resolve and devotion to the good pleasure of God,
is it the desire to attract the favorable consideration of the ruler
and to merit the approval of the people? Or would it, rather, consist
in this, that for the sake of indulging in feasts and dissipations by
night he should undermine his country and break the hearts of his
people by day, causing his God to reject him, and his sovereign to
cast him out and his people to defame him and hold him in deserved
contempt? By God, the moldering bones in the graveyard are better
than such as these! Of what value are they, who have never tasted the
heavenly food of truly human qualities, and never drunk of the
crystalline waters of those bounties which belong to the realm of
man?</p>

<p id='43' data-ref='sdc_en-p43'>
It is unquestionable that the object in establishing parliaments is
to bring about justice and righteousness, but everything hinges on
the efforts of the elected representatives. If their intention is
sincere, desirable results and unforeseen improvements will be
forthcoming; if not, it is certain that the whole thing will be
meaningless, the country will come to a standstill and public affairs
will continuously deteriorate. “I see a thousand builders unequal
to one subverter; what then of the one builder who is followed by a
thousand subverters?”</p>

<p id='44' data-ref='sdc_en-p44'>
The purpose of the foregoing statements is to demonstrate at least
this, that the happiness and greatness, the rank and station, the
pleasure and peace, of an individual have never consisted in his
personal wealth, but rather in his excellent character, his high
resolve, the breadth of his learning, and his ability to solve
difficult problems. How well has it been said: “On my back is a
garment which, were it sold for a penny, that penny would be worth
far more; yet within the garment is a soul which, if you weighed it
against all the souls in the world, would prove greater and nobler.”</p>

<p id='45' data-ref='sdc_en-p45'>
In the present writer’s view it would be preferable if the election
of nonpermanent members of consultative assemblies in sovereign
states should be dependent on the will and choice of the people. For
elected representatives will on this account be somewhat inclined to
exercise justice, lest their reputation suffer and they fall into
disfavor with the public.</p>

<p id='46' data-ref='sdc_en-p46'>
It should not be imagined that the writer’s earlier remarks
constitute a denunciation of wealth or a commendation of poverty.
Wealth is praiseworthy in the highest degree, if it is acquired by an
individual’s own efforts and the grace of God, in commerce,
agriculture, art and industry, and if it be expended for
philanthropic purposes. Above all, if a judicious and resourceful
individual should initiate measures which would universally enrich
the masses of the people, there could be no undertaking greater than
this, and it would rank in the sight of God as the supreme
achievement, for such a benefactor would supply the needs and insure
the comfort and well-being of a great multitude. Wealth is most
commendable, provided the entire population is wealthy. If, however,
a few have inordinate riches while the rest are impoverished, and no
fruit or benefit accrues from that wealth, then it is only a
liability to its possessor. If, on the other hand, it is expended for
the promotion of knowledge, the founding of elementary and other
schools, the encouragement of art and industry, the training of
orphans and the poor — in brief, if it is dedicated to the welfare of
society — its possessor will stand out before God and man as the most
excellent of all who live on earth and will be accounted as one of
the people of paradise.</p>

<p id='47' data-ref='sdc_en-p47'>
As to those who maintain that the inauguration of reforms and the
setting up of powerful institutions would in reality be at variance
with the good pleasure of God and would contravene the laws of the
divine Law-Giver and run counter to basic religious principles and to
the ways of the Prophet — let them consider how this could be the
case. Would such reforms contravene the religious law because they
would be acquired from foreigners and would therefore cause us to be
as they are, since “He who imitates a people is one of them”? In
the first place these matters relate to the temporal and material
apparatus of civilization, the implements of science, the adjuncts of
progress in the professions and the arts, and the orderly conduct of
government. They have nothing whatever to do with the problems of the
spirit and the complex realities of religious doctrine. If it be
objected that even where material affairs are concerned foreign
importations are inadmissible, such an argument would only establish
the ignorance and absurdity of its proponents. Have they forgotten
the celebrated ḥadí<u>th</u> (Holy Tradition): “Seek after
knowledge, even unto China”? It is certain that the people of China
were, in the sight of God, among the most rejected of men, because
they worshipped idols and were unmindful of the omniscient Lord. The
Europeans are at least “Peoples of the Book,” and believers in
God and specifically referred to in the sacred verse, “Thou shalt
certainly find those to be nearest in affection to the believers, who
say, ‘We are Christians.’” <a data-fnid='14'></a>
It is therefore quite permissible and indeed more appropriate to
acquire knowledge from Christian countries. How could seeking after
knowledge among the heathen be acceptable to God, and seeking it
among the People of the Book be repugnant to Him?</p>

Furthermore, in the Battle of the Confederates, Abú Sufyán enlisted
the aid of the Baní Kinánih, the Baní Qahtán and the Jewish Baní
Qurayzih and rose up with all the tribes of the Quray<u>sh</u> to put
out the divine Light that flamed in the lamp of Ya<u>th</u>rib
(Medina). In those days the great winds of trials and tribulations
were blowing from every direction, as it is written: “Do men think
when they say ‘We believe’ they shall be let alone and not be put
to proof?” <a data-fnid='15'></a>  The
believers were few and the enemy attacking in force, seeking to blot
out the new-risen Sun of Truth with the dust of oppression and
tyranny. Then Salmán (the Persian) came into the presence of the
Prophet — the Dawning-Point of revelation, the Focus of the endless
splendors of grace — and he said that in Persia to protect themselves
from an encroaching host they would dig a moat or trench about their
lands, and that this had proved a highly efficient safeguard against
surprise attacks. Did that Wellspring of universal wisdom, that Mine
of divine knowledge say in reply that this was a custom current among
idolatrous, fire-worshipping Magians and could therefore hardly be
adopted by monotheists? Or did He rather immediately direct His
followers to set about digging a trench? He even, in His Own blessed
person, took hold of the tools and went to work beside them.</p>

It is moreover a matter of record in the books of the various Islamic
schools and the writings of leading divines and historians, that
after the Light of the World had risen over Ḥijáz, flooding all
mankind with Its brilliance, and creating through the revelation of a
new divine law, new principles and institutions, a fundamental change
throughout the world — holy laws were revealed which in some cases
conformed to the practices of the Days of Ignorance. <a data-fnid='16'></a>
Among these, Muḥammad respected the months of religious truce, <a data-fnid='17'></a>
retained the prohibition of swine’s flesh, continued the use of the
lunar calendar and the names of the months and so on. There is a
considerable number of such laws specifically enumerated in the
texts:</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn16'>
Jáhilíyyih: the period of paganism in Arabia, prior to the advent
	of Muḥammad.
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn17'>
The pagan Arabs observed one separate and three consecutive months
	of truce, during which period pilgrimages were made to Mecca, and
	fairs, poetry contests and similar events took place.
</aside>

<p id='50' data-ref='sdc_en-p50'>
“The people of the Days of Ignorance engaged in many practices
which the law of Islám later confirmed. They would not take in
marriage both a mother and her daughter, and the most shameful of
acts in their view was to marry two sisters. They would stigmatize a
man marrying the wife of his father, derisively calling him his
father’s competitor. It was their custom to go on pilgrimage to the
House at Mecca, where they would perform the ceremonies of
visitation, putting on the pilgrim’s dress, practicing the
circumambulation, running between the hills, pausing at all the
stopping-places, and casting the stones. It was, furthermore, their
wont to intercalate one month in every three-year period, to perform
ablutions after intercourse, to rinse out the mouth and snuff up
water through the nostrils, to part the hair, use the tooth-stick,
pare the nails and pluck the armpits. They would, likewise, cut off
the right hand of a thief.”</p>

<p id='51' data-ref='sdc_en-p51'>
Can one, God forbid, assume that because some of the divine laws
resemble the practices of the Days of Ignorance, the customs of a
people abhorred by all nations, it follows that there is a defect in
these laws? Or can one, God forbid, imagine that the Omnipotent Lord
was moved to comply with the opinions of the heathen? The divine
wisdom takes many forms. Would it have been impossible for Muḥammad
to reveal a law which bore no resemblance whatever to any practice
current in the Days of Ignorance? Rather, the purpose of His
consummate wisdom was to free the people from the chains of
fanaticism which had bound them hand and foot, and to forestall those
very objections which today confuse the mind and trouble the
conscience of the simple and helpless.</p>

<p id='52' data-ref='sdc_en-p52'>
Some, who are not sufficiently informed as to the meaning of the
divine Texts and the contents of traditional and written history,
will aver that these customs of the Days of Ignorance were laws which
had come down from His Holiness Abraham and had been retained by the
idolaters. In this connection they will cite the Qur’ánic verse:
“Follow the religion of Abraham, the sound in faith.” <a data-fnid='18'></a>
Nevertheless it is a fact attested by the writings of all the Islamic
schools that the months of truce, the lunar calendar, and the cutting
off of the right hand as punishment for theft, formed no part of
Abraham’s law. In any case, the Pentateuch is extant and available
today, and contains the laws of Abraham. Let them refer to it. They
will then, of course, insist that the Torah has been tampered with,
and in proof will quote the Qur’ánic verse: “They pervert the
text of the Word of God.” <a data-fnid='19'></a>
It is, however, known where such distortion has occurred, and is a
matter of record in critical texts and commentaries. <a data-fnid='20'></a>

According to some accounts, mankind has been directed to borrow
various good qualities and ways from wild animals, and to learn a
lesson from these. Since it is permissible to imitate virtues of dumb
animals, it is certainly far more so to borrow material sciences and

race and are distinguished by judgment and the power of speech. And
if it be contended that such praiseworthy qualities are inborn in

The most learned and accomplished divines, the most distinguished
scholars, have diligently studied those branches of knowledge the
root and origin of which were the Greek philosophers such as
Aristotle and the rest, and have regarded the acquisition from the
Greek texts of sciences such as medicine, and branches of mathematics
including algebra <a data-fnid='21'></a>  and
arithmetic, as a most valuable achievement. Every one of the eminent
divines both studies and teaches the science of logic, although they
consider its founder to have been a Sabean. Most of them have

sciences but is not well grounded in logic, his opinions, deductions

	early as 300 B.C. If we permit of more or less scientific guessing
	in achieving a solution, algebra may be said to have been known
	nearly 2000 years B.C., and it had probably attracted the attention
	of the intellectual class much earlier … The name ‘algebra’ is
	quite fortuitous. When Mohammed ibn Mûsâ al-Khowârizmî … wrote

The first of these requirements is to guard one’s own self. It is
obvious that this does not refer to protecting oneself from
calamities and material tests, for the Prophets and saints were, each
and every one, subjected to the bitterest afflictions that the world
has to offer, and were targets for all the cruelties and aggressions
of mankind. They sacrificed their lives for the welfare of the
people, and with all their hearts they hastened to the place of their
martyrdom; and with their inward and outward perfections they arrayed
humanity in new garments of excellent qualities, both acquired and
inborn. The primary meaning of this guarding of oneself is to acquire
the attributes of spiritual and material perfection.</p>

<p id='64' data-ref='sdc_en-p64'>
The first attribute of perfection is learning and the cultural
attainments of the mind, and this eminent station is achieved when
the individual combines in himself a thorough knowledge of those
complex and transcendental realities pertaining to God, of the
fundamental truths of Qur’ánic political and religious law, of the
contents of the sacred Scriptures of other faiths, and of those
regulations and procedures which would contribute to the progress and
civilization of this distinguished country. He should in addition be
informed as to the laws and principles, the customs, conditions and
manners, and the material and moral virtues characterizing the
statecraft of other nations, and should be well versed in all the
useful branches of learning of the day, and study the historical
records of bygone governments and peoples. For if a learned
individual has no knowledge of the sacred Scriptures and the entire
field of divine and natural science, of religious jurisprudence and
the arts of government and the varied learning of the time and the
great events of history, he might prove unequal to an emergency, and
this is inconsistent with the necessary qualification of
comprehensive knowledge.</p>

Muslim is better versed in the fundamentals of Christianity than the
Christian priests themselves, and understands the purport of the
Scriptures even better than they, he will gladly accept the Muslim’s

Up to now the religious law has not been given a decisive role in our
courts, because each of the ulama has been handing down decrees as he
saw fit, based on his arbitrary interpretation and personal opinion.
For example, two men will go to law, and one of the ulama will find
for the plaintiff and another for the defendant. It may even happen
that in one and the same case two conflicting decisions will be
handed down by the same mujtahid, on the grounds that he was inspired
first in one direction and then in the other. There can be no doubt
that this state of affairs has confused every important issue and
must jeopardize the very foundations of society. For neither the
plaintiff nor the defendant ever loses hope of eventual success, and
each in turn will waste his life in the attempt to secure a later
verdict which would reverse the previous one. Their entire time is
thus given over to litigation, with the result that their life
instead of being devoted to beneficial undertakings and necessary
personal affairs, is completely involved with the dispute. Indeed,
these two litigants might just as well be dead, for they can serve
their government and community not a particle. If, however, a
definite and final verdict were forthcoming, the duly convicted party
would perforce give up all hope of reopening the case, and would then
be relieved on that score and would go back to looking after his own
concerns and those of others.</p>

The second attribute of perfection is justice and impartiality. This
means to have no regard for one’s own personal benefits and selfish
advantages, and to carry out the laws of God without the slightest
concern for anything else. It means to see one’s self as only one
of the servants of God, the All-Possessing, and except for aspiring
to spiritual distinction, never attempting to be singled out from the
others. It means to consider the welfare of the community as one’s
own. It means, in brief, to regard humanity as a single individual,
and one’s own self as a member of that corporeal form, and to know
of a certainty that if pain or injury afflicts any member of that
body, it must inevitably result in suffering for all the rest.</p>

<p id='72' data-ref='sdc_en-p72'>
The third requirement of perfection is to arise with complete
sincerity and purity of purpose to educate the masses: to exert the
utmost effort to instruct them in the various branches of learning
and useful sciences, to encourage the development of modern progress,
to widen the scope of commerce, industry and the arts, to further
such measures as will increase the people’s wealth. For the mass of
the population is uninformed as to these vital agencies which would
constitute an immediate remedy for society’s chronic ills.</p>

<p id='73' data-ref='sdc_en-p73'>
It is essential that scholars and the spiritually learned should
undertake in all sincerity and purity of intent and for the sake of
God alone, to counsel and exhort the masses and clarify their vision
with that collyrium which is knowledge. For today the people out of
the depths of their superstition, imagine that any individual who
believes in God and His signs, and in the Prophets and divine
Revelations and laws, and is a devout and God-fearing person, must of
necessity remain idle and spend his days in sloth, so as to be
considered in the sight of God as one who has forsaken the world and
its vanities, set his heart on the life to come, and isolated himself
from human beings in order to draw nearer to God. Since this theme
will be developed elsewhere in the present text, We shall leave it
for the moment.</p>

<p id='74' data-ref='sdc_en-p74'>
Other attributes of perfection are to fear God, to love God by loving
His servants, to exercise mildness and forbearance and calm, to be
sincere, amenable, clement and compassionate; to have resolution and
courage, trustworthiness and energy, to strive and struggle, to be
generous, loyal, without malice, to have zeal and a sense of honor,
to be high-minded and magnanimous, and to have regard for the rights
of others. Whoever is lacking in these excellent human qualities is
defective. If We were to explain the inner meanings of each one of
these attributes, “the poem would take up seventy maunds <a data-fnid='26'></a>
of paper.”</p>

The second of these spiritual standards which apply to the possessor
of knowledge is that he should be the defender of his faith. It is
obvious that these holy words do not refer exclusively to searching
out the implications of the law, observing the forms of worship,
avoiding greater and lesser sins, practicing the religious
ordinances, and by all these methods, protecting the Faith. They mean
rather that the whole population should be protected in every way;
that every effort should be exerted to adopt a combination of all
possible measures to raise up the Word of God, increase the number of
believers, promote the Faith of God and exalt it and make it
victorious over other religions.</p>

<p id='76' data-ref='sdc_en-p76'>
If, indeed, the Muslim religious authorities had persevered along
these lines as they ought to have done, by now every nation on earth
would have been gathered into the shelter of the unity of God and the
bright fire of “that He may make it victorious over every other
religion” <a data-fnid='27'></a>  would have
flamed out like the sun in the midmost heart of the world.</p>

Fifteen centuries after Christ, Luther, who was originally one of the
twelve members of a Catholic religious body at the center of the
Papal government and later on initiated the Protestant religious
belief, opposed the Pope on certain points of doctrine such as the
prohibition of monastic marriage, the revering and bowing down before
images of the Apostles and Christian leaders of the past, and various
other religious practices and ceremonies which were accretional to
the ordinances of the Gospel. Although at that period the power of
the Pope was so great and he was regarded with such awe that the
kings of Europe shook and trembled before him, and he held control of
all Europe’s major concerns in the grasp of his might — nevertheless
because Luther’s position as regards the freedom of religious
leaders to marry, the abstention from worshipping and making
prostrations before images and representations hung in the churches,
and the abrogation of ceremonials which had been added on to the
Gospel, was demonstrably correct, and because the proper means were
adopted for the promulgation of his views: within these last four
hundred and some years the majority of the population of America,
four-fifths of Germany and England and a large percentage of
Austrians, in sum about one hundred and twenty-five million people
drawn from other Christian denominations, have entered the Protestant
Church. The leaders of this religion are still making every effort to
promote it, and today on the East Coast of Africa, ostensibly to
emancipate the Sudanese and various Negro peoples, they have
established schools and colleges and are training and civilizing
completely savage African tribes, while their true and primary
purpose is to convert some of the Muslim Negro tribes to
Protestantism. Every community is toiling for the advancement of its
people, and we (i.e., Muslims) sleep on!</p>

<p id='78' data-ref='sdc_en-p78'>
Although it was not clear what purpose impelled this man or where he
was tending, see how the zealous efforts of Protestant leaders have
spread his doctrines far and wide.</p>

<p id='79' data-ref='sdc_en-p79'>
Now if the illustrious people of the one true God, the recipients of
His confirmations, the objects of His divine assistance, should put
forth all their strength, and with complete dedication, relying upon
God and turning aside from all else but Him, should adopt procedures
for spreading the Faith and should bend all their efforts to this
end, it is certain that His divine light would envelop the whole
earth.</p>

<p id='80' data-ref='sdc_en-p80'>
A few, who are unaware of the reality below the surface of events,
who cannot feel the pulse of the world under their fingers, who do
not know what a massive dose of truth must be administered to heal
this chronic old disease of falsehood, believe that the Faith can
only be spread by the sword, and bolster their opinion with the
Tradition, “I am a Prophet by the sword.” If, however, they would
carefully examine this question, they would see that in this day and
age the sword is not a suitable means for promulgating the Faith, for
it would only fill peoples’ hearts with revulsion and terror.
According to the divine law of Muḥammad, it is not permissible to
compel the People of the Book to acknowledge and accept the Faith.
While it is a sacred obligation devolving on every conscientious
believer in the unity of God to guide mankind to the truth, the
Traditions “I am a Prophet by the sword” and “I am commanded to
threaten the lives of the people until they say, ‘There is none
other God but God’” referred to the idolaters of the Days of
Ignorance, who in their blindness and bestiality had sunk below the
level of human beings. A faith born of sword thrusts could hardly be
relied upon, and would for any trifling cause revert to error and
unbelief. After the ascension of Muḥammad, and His passing to “the
seat of truth, in the presence of the potent King,” <a data-fnid='28'></a>
the tribes around Medina apostatized from their Faith, turning back
to the idolatry of pagan times.</p>

Remember when the holy breaths of the Spirit of God (Jesus) were
shedding their sweetness over Palestine and Galilee, over the shores
of Jordan and the regions around Jerusalem, and the wondrous melodies
of the Gospel were sounding in the ears of the spiritually illumined,
all the peoples of Asia and Europe, of Africa and America, of
Oceania, which comprises the islands and archipelagoes of the Pacific
and Indian Oceans, were fire-worshippers and pagans, ignorant of the
divine Voice that spoke out on the Day of the Covenant. <a data-fnid='29'></a>
Alone the Jews believed in the divinity and oneness of God. Following
the declaration of Jesus, the pure and reviving breath of His mouth
conferred eternal life on the inhabitants of those regions for a
period of three years, and through divine Revelation the law of
Christ, at that time the vital remedy for the ailing body of the
world, was established. In the days of Jesus only a few individuals
turned their faces toward God; in fact only the twelve disciples and
a few women truly became believers, and one of the disciples, Judas
Iscariot apostatized from his Faith, leaving eleven. After the
ascension of Jesus to the Realm of Glory, these few souls stood up
with their spiritual qualities and with deeds that were pure and
holy, and they arose by the power of God and the life-giving breaths
of the Messiah to save all the peoples of the earth. Then all the
idolatrous nations as well as the Jews rose up in their might to kill
the divine fire that had been lit in the lamp of Jerusalem. “Fain
would they put out God’s light with their mouths: but God hath
willed to perfect His light, albeit the infidels abhor it.” <a data-fnid='30'></a>
Under the fiercest tortures, they did every one of these holy souls
to death; with butchers’ cleavers, they chopped the pure and
undefiled bodies of some of them to pieces and burned them in
furnaces, and they stretched some of the followers on the rack and
then buried them alive. In spite of this agonizing requital, the
Christians continued to teach the Cause of God, and they never drew a
sword from its scabbard or even so much as grazed a cheek. Then in
the end the Faith of Christ encompassed the whole earth, so that in
Europe and America no traces of other religions were left, and today
in Asia and Africa and Oceania, large masses of people are living
within the sanctuary of the Four Gospels.</p>

It has now by the above irrefutable proofs been fully established
that the Faith of God must be propagated through human perfections,
through qualities that are excellent and pleasing, and spiritual
behavior. If a soul of his own accord advances toward God he will be
accepted at the Threshold of Oneness, for such a one is free of
personal considerations, of greed and selfish interests, and he has
taken refuge within the sheltering protection of his Lord. He will
become known among men as trustworthy and truthful, temperate and
scrupulous, high-minded and loyal, incorruptible and God-fearing. In
this way the primary purpose in revealing the divine law — which is
to bring about happiness in the after life and civilization and the
refinement of character in this — will be realized. As for the sword,
it will only produce a man who is outwardly a believer, and inwardly
a traitor and apostate.</p>

<p id='83' data-ref='sdc_en-p83'>
We shall here relate a story that will serve as an example to all.
The Arabian chronicles tell how, at a time prior to the advent of
Muḥammad, Nu‘mán son of Mun<u>dh</u>ir the Lakhmite — an Arab
king in the Days of Ignorance, whose seat of government was the city
of Ḥírih — had one day returned so often to his wine-cup that his
mind clouded over and his reason deserted him. In this drunken and
insensible condition he gave orders that his two boon companions, his
close and much-loved friends, <u>Kh</u>álid son of Mudallil and ‘Amr
son of Mas‘úd-Kaldih, should be put to death. When he wakened
after his carousal, he inquired for the two friends and was given the
grievous news. He was sick at heart, and because of his intense love
and longing for them, he built two splendid monuments over their two
graves and he named these the Smeared-With-Blood.</p>

<p id='84' data-ref='sdc_en-p84'>
Then he set apart two days out of the year, in memory of the two
companions, and he called one of them the Day of Evil and one the Day
of Grace. Every year on these two appointed days he would issue forth
with pomp and circumstance and sit between the monuments. If, on the
Day of Evil, his eye fell on any soul, that person would be put to
death; but on the Day of Grace, whoever passed would be overwhelmed
with gifts and benefits. Such was his rule, sealed with a mighty oath
and always rigidly observed.</p>

<p id='85' data-ref='sdc_en-p85'>
One day the king mounted his horse, that was called Maḥmúd, and
rode out into the plains to hunt. Suddenly in the distance he caught
sight of a wild donkey. Nu‘mán urged on his horse to overtake it,
and galloped away at such speed that he was cut off from his retinue.
As night approached, the king was hopelessly lost. Then he made out a
tent, far off in the desert, and he turned his horse and headed
toward it. When he reached the entrance of the tent he asked, “Will
you receive a guest?” The owner (who was Ḥanzala, son of
Abí-Ghafráy-i-Ṭá’í) replied, “Yea.” He came forward and
helped Nu‘mán to dismount. Then he went to his wife and told her,
“There are clear signs of greatness in the bearing of this person.
Do your best to show him hospitality, and make ready a feast.” His
wife said, “We have a ewe. Sacrifice it. And I have saved a little
flour against such a day.” Ḥanzala first milked the ewe and
carried a bowl of milk to Nu‘mán, and then he slaughtered her and
prepared a meal; and what with his friendliness and loving-kindness,
Nu‘mán spent that night in peace and comfort. When dawn came,
Nu‘mán made ready to leave, and he said to Ḥanzala: “You have
shown me the utmost generosity, receiving and feasting me. I am
Nu‘mán, son of Mun<u>dh</u>ir, and I shall eagerly await your
arrival at my court.”</p>

<p id='86' data-ref='sdc_en-p86'>
Time passed, and famine fell on the land of Ṭayy. Ḥanzala was in
dire need and for this reason he sought out the king. By a strange
coincidence he arrived on the Day of Evil. Nu‘mán was greatly
troubled in spirit. He began to reproach his friend, saying, “Why
did you come to your friend on this day of all days? For this is the
Day of Evil, that is, the Day of Wrath and the Day of Distress. This
day, should my eyes alight on Qábús, my only son, he should not
escape with his life. Now ask me whatever favor you will.”
</p>

<p id='87' data-ref='sdc_en-p87'>
Ḥanzala said: “I knew nothing of your Day of Evil. As for the
gifts of this life, they are meant for the living, and since I at
this hour must drink of death, what can all the world’s storehouses
avail me now?”</p>

<p id='88' data-ref='sdc_en-p88'>
Nu‘mán said, “There is no help for this.”</p>

<p id='89' data-ref='sdc_en-p89'>
Ḥanzala told him: “Respite me, then, that I may go back to my
wife and make my testament. Next year I shall return, on the Day of
Evil.”</p>

<p id='90' data-ref='sdc_en-p90'>
Nu‘mán then asked for a guarantor, so that, if Ḥanzala should
break his word, this guarantor would be put to death instead.
Ḥanzala, helpless and bewildered, looked about him. Then his gaze
fell on one of Nu‘mán’s retinue, <u>Sh</u>arík, son of ‘Amr,
son of Qays of <u>Sh</u>aybán, and to him he recited these lines: “O
my partner, O son of ‘Amr! Is there any escape from death? O
brother of every afflicted one! O brother of him who is brotherless!
O brother of Nu‘mán, in thee today is a surety for the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>.
Where is <u>Sh</u>aybán the noble — may the All-Merciful favor him!”
But <u>Sh</u>arík only answered, “O my brother, a man cannot
gamble with his life.” At this the victim could not tell where to
turn. Then a man named Qarád, son of Adja‘ the Kalbite stood up
and offered himself as a surety, agreeing that, should he fail on the
next Day of Wrath to deliver up the victim, the king might do with
him, Qarád, as he wished. Nu‘mán then bestowed five hundred
camels on Ḥanzala, and sent him home.</p>

<p id='91' data-ref='sdc_en-p91'>
In the following year on the Day of Evil, as soon as the true dawn
broke in the sky, Nu‘mán as was his custom set out with pomp and
pageantry and made for the two mausoleums called the
Smeared-With-Blood. He brought Qarád along, to wreak his kingly
wrath upon him. The pillars of the state then loosed their tongues
and begged for mercy, imploring the king to respite Qarád until
sundown, for they hoped that Ḥanzala might yet return; but the
king’s purpose was to spare the life of Ḥanzala, and to requite
his hospitality by putting Qarád to death in his place. As the sun
began to set, they stripped off the garments of Qarád, and made
ready to sever his head. At that moment a rider appeared in the
distance, galloping at top speed. Nu‘mán said to the swordsman,
“Why delayest thou?” The ministers said, “Perchance it is
Ḥanzala who comes.” And when the rider drew near, they saw it was
none other.</p>

<p id='92' data-ref='sdc_en-p92'>
Nu‘mán was sorely displeased. He said, “Thou fool! Thou didst
slip away once from the clutching fingers of death; must thou provoke
him now a second time?”</p>

<p id='93' data-ref='sdc_en-p93'>
And Ḥanzala answered, “Sweet in my mouth and pleasant on my
tongue is the poison of death, at the thought of redeeming my
pledge.”</p>

<p id='94' data-ref='sdc_en-p94'>
Nu‘mán asked, “What could be the reason for this
trustworthiness, this regard for thine obligation and this concern
for thine oath?” And Ḥanzala answered, “It is my faith in the
one God and in the Books that have come down from heaven.” Nu‘mán
asked, “What Faith dost thou profess?” And Ḥanzala said, “It
was the holy breaths of Jesus that brought me to life. I follow the
straight pathway of Christ, the Spirit of God.” Nu‘mán said,
“Let me inhale these sweet aromas of the Spirit.”</p>

<p id='95' data-ref='sdc_en-p95'>
So it was that Ḥanzala drew out the white hand of guidance from the
bosom of the love of God, <a data-fnid='31'></a>
and illumined the sight and the insight of the beholders with the
Gospel light. After he had in bell-like accents recited some of the
divine verses out of the Evangel, Nu‘mán and all his ministers
sickened of their idols and their idol-worship and were confirmed in
the Faith of God. And they said, “Alas, a thousand times alas, that
up to now we were careless of this infinite mercy and veiled away
therefrom, and were bereft of this rain from the clouds of the grace
of God.” Then straightway the king tore down the two monuments
called the Smeared-With-Blood, and he repented of his tyranny and
established justice in the land.</p>

Although the noble conduct of the Prophets and Holy Ones of God is
widely known, and it is indeed, until the coming of the Hour, <a data-fnid='36'></a>
in every aspect of life an excellent pattern for all mankind to
follow, nevertheless some have remained neglectful of and separated
from these qualities of extraordinary sympathy and loving-kindness,
and have been prevented from attaining to the inner significances of
the Holy Books. Not only do they scrupulously shun the adherents of
religions other than their own, they do not even permit themselves to
show them common courtesy. If one is not allowed to associate with
another, how can one guide him out of the dark and empty night of
denial, of “there-is-no-God,” into the bright morning of belief,
and the affirmation, “but God.” <a data-fnid='37'></a>
And how can one urge him on and encourage him to rise up out of the
abyss of perdition and ignorance and climb the heights of salvation
and knowledge? Consider justly: had not Ḥanzala treated Nu‘mán
with true friendship, showing him kindness and hospitality, could he
have brought the King and a great number of other idolaters to
acknowledge the unity of God? To keep aloof from people, to shun
them, to be harsh with them, will make them shrink away, while
affection and consideration, mildness and forbearance will attract
their hearts toward God. If a true believer when meeting an
individual from a foreign country should express revulsion, and
should speak the horrible words forbidding association with
foreigners and referring to them as “unclean,” the stranger would
be grieved and offended to such a point that he would never accept
the Faith, even if he should see, taking place before his very eyes,
the miracle of the splitting of the moon. The results of shunning him
would be this, that if there had been in his heart some faint
inclination toward God, he would repent of it, and would flee away
from the sea of faith into the wastes of oblivion and unbelief. And
upon returning home to his own country he would publish in the press
statements to the effect that such and such a nation was utterly
lacking in the qualifications of a civilized people.</p>

If we ponder a while over the Qur’ánic verses and proofs, and the
traditional accounts which have come down to us from those stars of
the heaven of divine Unity, the Holy Imáms, we shall be convinced of
the fact that if a soul is endowed with the attributes of true faith
and characterized with spiritual qualities he will become to all
mankind an emblem of the outstretched mercies of God. For the
attributes of the people of faith are justice and fair-mindedness;
forbearance and compassion and generosity; consideration for others;
candor, trustworthiness, and loyalty; love and loving-kindness;
devotion and determination and humanity. If therefore an individual
is truly righteous, he will avail himself of all those means which

wisdom and learning, of virtue and godliness, we set about mocking
and reviling this one and that. “The ideas of such a one,” we

crumbled, the foundations of faiths have been blown to the winds. The
carpet of belief has been rolled up, the tokens of certitude blotted
out; the whole world has fallen into error; when it comes to
repelling tyranny all are soft and remiss. Days and months have
passed away, and these villages and estates still belong to the same

different governments functioning in good order, but the number has

brainsick with litigation, and now they rest in peace; today the
plaintiff would be defeated and the defendant victorious, tomorrow
the plaintiff won the case and the defendant lost it — but now this

righteousness and its rewards into ways that were dangerous and dark.
A good character is in the sight of God and His chosen ones and the

At a time when the Israelites had multiplied in Egypt and were spread
throughout the whole country, the Coptic Pharaohs of Egypt determined
to strengthen and favor their own Coptic peoples and to degrade and
dishonor the children of Israel, whom they regarded as foreigners.
Over a long period, the Israelites, divided and scattered, were
captive in the hands of the tyrannical Copts, and were scorned and
despised by all, so that the meanest of the Copts would freely
persecute and lord it over the noblest of the Israelites. The
enslavement, wretchedness and helplessness of the Hebrews reached
such a pitch that they were never, day or night, secure in their own
persons nor able to provide any defense for their wives and families
against the tyranny of their Pharaohic captors. Then their food was
the fragments of their own broken hearts, and their drink a river of
tears. They continued on in this anguish until suddenly Moses, the
All-Beauteous, beheld the divine Light streaming out of the blessed
Vale, the place that was holy ground, and heard the quickening voice
of God as it spoke from the flame of that Tree “neither of the East
nor of the West,” <a data-fnid='53'></a>
and He stood up in the full panoply of His universal prophethood. In
the midst of the Israelites, He blazed out like a lamp of divine
guidance, and by the light of salvation He led that lost people out
of the shadows of ignorance into knowledge and perfection. He
gathered Israel’s scattered tribes into the shelter of the unifying
and universal Word of God, and over the heights of union He raised up
the banner of harmony, so that within a brief interval those
benighted souls became spiritually educated, and they who had been
strangers to the truth, rallied to the cause of the oneness of God,
and were delivered out of their wretchedness, their indigence, their
incomprehension and captivity and achieved a supreme degree of
happiness and honor. They emigrated from Egypt, set out for Israel’s
original homeland, and came to Canaan and Philistia. They first
conquered the shores of the River Jordan, and Jericho, and settled in
that area, and ultimately all the neighboring regions, such as
Phoenicia, Edom and Ammon, came under their sway. In Joshua’s time
there were thirty-one governments in the hands of the Israelites, and
in every noble human attribute — learning, stability, determination,
courage, honor, generosity — this people came to surpass all the
nations of the earth. When in those days an Israelite would enter a

meet with some of Israel’s most illustrious scholars and divines,
on his return to Greece established the concept of the oneness of God
and the continuing life of the human soul after it has put off its
elemental dust. Ultimately, the ignorant among the Greeks denounced
this man who had fathomed the inmost mysteries of wisdom, and rose up
to take his life; and then the populace forced the hand of their
ruler, and in council assembled they caused Socrates to drink from
the poisoned cup.</p>

After the Israelites had advanced along every level of civilization,
and had achieved success in the highest possible degree, they began
little by little to forget the root-principles of the Mosaic law and
Faith, to busy themselves with rites and ceremonials and to show
forth unbecoming conduct. In the days of Rehoboam, the son of
Solomon, terrible dissension broke out among them; one of their
number, Jeroboam, plotted to get the throne, and it was he who
introduced the worship of idols. The strife between Rehoboam and
Jeroboam led to centuries of warfare between their descendants, with
the result that the tribes of Israel were scattered and disrupted. In
brief, it was because they forgot the meaning of the law of God that
they became involved in ignorant fanaticism and blameworthy practices
such as insurgence and sedition. Their divines, having concluded that
all those essential qualifications of humankind set forth in the Holy
Book were by then a dead letter, began to think only of furthering
their own selfish interests, and afflicted the people by allowing
them to sink into the lowest depths of heedlessness and ignorance.
And the fruit of their wrong doing was this, that the old-time glory
which had endured so long now changed to degradation, and the rulers
of Persia, of Greece, and of Rome, took them over. The banners of
their sovereignty were reversed; the ignorance, foolishness,
abasement and self-love of their religious leaders and their scholars
were brought to light in the coming of Nebuchadnezzar, King of
Babylon, who destroyed them. After a general massacre, and the
sacking and razing of their houses and even the uprooting of their
trees, he took captive whatever remnants his sword had spared and
carried them off to Babylon. Seventy years later the descendants of
these captives were released and went back to Jerusalem. Then
Hezekiah and Ezra reestablished in their midst the fundamental
principles of the Holy Book, and day by day the Israelites advanced,
and the morning-brightness of their earlier ages dawned again. In a
short time, however, great dissensions as to belief and conduct broke
out anew, and again the one concern of the Jewish doctors became the
promotion of their own selfish purposes, and the reforms that had
obtained in Ezra’s time were changed to perversity and corruption.
The situation worsened to such a degree that time and again, the
armies of the republic of Rome and of its rulers conquered Israelite
territory. Finally the warlike Titus, commander of the Roman forces,
trampled the Jewish homeland into dust, putting every man to the
sword, taking the women and children captive, flattening their
houses, tearing out their trees, burning their books, looting their
treasures, and reducing Jerusalem and the Temple to an ash heap.
After this supreme calamity, the star of Israel’s dominion sank
away to nothing, and to this day, the remnant of that vanished nation
has been scattered to the four winds. “Humiliation and misery were
stamped upon them.” <a data-fnid='54'></a>
These two most great afflictions, brought on by Nebuchadnezzar and
Titus, are referred to in the glorious Qur’án: “And We solemnly
declared to the children of Israel in the Book, ‘Twice surely will
ye commit evil in the earth, and with great loftiness of pride will
ye surely be uplifted.’ And when the menace for the first of the
two came to be executed, We sent against you Our servants endowed
with terrible prowess; and they searched the inmost part of your
abodes, and the menace was accomplished… And when the punishment
threatened for your latter transgression came to be inflicted, then
We sent an enemy to sadden your faces, and to enter the Temple as
they entered it at first, and to destroy with utter destruction that
which they had conquered.” <a data-fnid='55'></a>

When for the second time the unmistakable signs of Israel’s
disintegration, abasement, subjection and annihilation had become
apparent, then the sweet and holy breathings of the Spirit of God
(Jesus) were shed across Jordan and the land of Galilee; the cloud of
divine pity overspread those skies, and rained down the copious
waters of the spirit, and after those swelling showers that came from
the most great Sea, the Holy Land put forth its perfume and blossomed
with the knowledge of God. Then the solemn Gospel song rose up till
it rang in the ears of those who dwell in the chambers of heaven, and
at the touch of Jesus’ breath the unmindful dead that lay in the
graves of their ignorance lifted up their heads to receive eternal
life. For the space of three years, that Luminary of perfections
walked about the fields of Palestine and in the neighborhood of
Jerusalem, leading all men into the dawn of redemption, teaching them
how to acquire spiritual qualities and attributes well-pleasing to
God. Had the people of Israel believed in that beauteous Countenance,

That mighty Jewish nation toppled and crumbled away, but those few
souls who sought shelter beneath the Messianic Tree transformed all
human life. At that time the peoples of the world were utterly

professed belief in the oneness of God and they were wretched
outcasts. These holy Christian souls now stood up to promulgate a
Cause which was diametrically opposed and repugnant to the beliefs of
the entire human race. The kings of four out of the world’s five
continents inexorably resolved to wipe out the followers of Christ,
and nevertheless in the end most of them set about promoting the

Those qualities which the philosophers attained when they had reached

Observe how those souls who drank the living waters of redemption at
the gracious hands of Jesus, the Spirit of God, and came into the
sheltering shade of the Gospel, attained to such a high plane of
moral conduct that Galen, the celebrated physician, although not
himself a Christian, in his summary of Plato’s Republic extolled
their actions. A literal translation of his words is as follows:</p>

<p id='152' data-ref='sdc_en-p152'>
“The generality of mankind are unable to grasp a sequence of
logical arguments. For this reason they stand in need of symbols and
parables telling of rewards and punishments in the next world. A
confirmatory evidence of this is that today we observe a people
called Christians, who believe devoutly in rewards and punishments in
a future state. This group show forth excellent actions, similar to
the actions of an individual who is a true philosopher. For example,
we all see with our own eyes that they have no fear of death, and
their passion for justice and fair-dealing is so great that they
should be considered true philosophers.” <a data-fnid='57'></a>

One demonstration of the excellent character of the Christians in
those days was their dedication to charity and good works, and the
fact that they founded hospitals and philanthropic institutions. For
example, the first person to establish public clinics throughout the
Roman Empire where the poor, the injured and the helpless received
medical care, was the Emperor Constantine. This great king was the
first Roman ruler to champion the Cause of Christ. He spared no
efforts, dedicating his life to the promotion of the principles of
the Gospel, and he solidly established the Roman government, which in
reality had been nothing but a system of unrelieved oppression, on
moderation and justice. His blessed name shines out across the dawn
of history like the morning star, and his rank and fame among the

The noted historians of Europe, in describing the conditions,
manners, politics, learning and culture, in all their aspects, of
early, medieval and modern times, unanimously record that during the
ten centuries constituting the Middle Ages, from the beginning of the
sixth century of the Christian era till the close of the fifteenth,
Europe was in every respect and to an extreme degree, barbaric and
dark. The principal cause of this was that the monks, referred to by
European peoples as spiritual and religious leaders, had given up the
abiding glory that comes from obedience to the sacred commandments
and heavenly teachings of the Gospel, and had joined forces with the
presumptuous and tyrannical rulers of the temporal governments of
those times. They had turned their eyes away from everlasting glory,
and were devoting all their efforts to the furtherance of their
mutual worldly interests and passing and perishable advantages.
Ultimately things reached a point where the masses were hopeless
prisoners in the hands of these two groups, and all this brought down
in ruins the whole structure of the religion, culture, welfare and
civilization of the peoples of Europe.</p>

When the unworthy acts and thoughts and the discreditable purposes of

ignorance and bigotry and of actions that were displeasing to God,
encompassed the earth, then the dawn of hope shone out and the divine
spring drew on; a cloud of mercy overspread the world, and out of the
regions of grace the fecund winds began to blow. In the sign of
Muḥammad, the Sun of Truth rose over Ya<u>th</u>rib (Medina) and
the Ḥijáz and cast across the universe the lights of eternal
glory. Then the earth of human potentialities was transformed, and
the words “The earth shall shine with the light of her Lord,” <a data-fnid='59'></a>
were fulfilled. The old world turned new again, and its dead body
rose into abundant life. Then tyranny and ignorance were overthrown,
and towering palaces of knowledge and justice were reared in their
place. A sea of enlightenment thundered, and science cast down its
rays. The savage peoples of the Ḥijáz, before that Flame of
supreme Prophethood was lit in the lamp of Mecca, were the most
brutish and benighted of all the peoples of the earth. In all the
histories, their depraved and vicious practices, their ferocity and
their constant feuds, are a matter of record. In those days the
civilized peoples of the world did not even consider the Arab tribes
of Mecca and Medina as human beings. And yet, after the Light of the
World rose over them, they were — because of the education bestowed
on them by that Mine of perfections, that Focal Center of Revelation,
and the blessings vouchsafed by the divine law — within a brief
interval gathered into the shelter of the principle of divine
oneness. This brutish people then attained such a high degree of
human perfection and civilization that all their contemporaries
marveled at them. Those very peoples who had always mocked the Arabs
and held them up to ridicule as a breed devoid of judgment, now
eagerly sought them out, visiting their countries to acquire
enlightenment and culture, technical skills, statecraft, arts and
sciences.</p>

let alone a human being, would hate and shrink from but which they in
their extreme degradation considered the ultimate expression of honor

In the early ages of Islám the peoples of Europe acquired the
sciences and arts of civilization from Islám as practiced by the
inhabitants of Andalusia. A careful and thorough investigation of the
historical record will establish the fact that the major part of the
civilization of Europe is derived from Islám; for all the writings
of Muslim scholars and divines and philosophers were gradually
collected in Europe and were with the most painstaking care weighed
and debated at academic gatherings and in the centers of learning,
after which their valued contents would be put to use. Today,
numerous copies of the works of Muslim scholars which are not to be
found in Islamic countries, are available in the libraries of Europe.
Furthermore, the laws and principles current in all European

The beginnings of European civilization date from the seventh century
of the Muslim era. The particulars were these: toward the end of the
fifth century of the hegira, the Pope or Head of Christendom set up a
great hue and cry over the fact that places sacred to the Christians,
such as Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth, had fallen under Muslim
rule, and he stirred up the kings and the commoners of Europe to
undertake what he considered a holy war. His impassioned outcry waxed
so loud that all the countries of Europe responded, and crusading
kings at the head of innumerable hosts passed over the Sea of Marmara
and made their way to the continent of Asia. In those days the
Fátimid caliphs ruled over Egypt and some countries of the West, and
most of the time the kings of Syria, that is the Saljúqs, were
subject to them as well. Briefly, the kings of the West with their
unnumbered armies fell upon Syria and Egypt, and there was continuous
warfare between the Syrian rulers and those of Europe for a period of
two hundred and three years. Reinforcements were always coming in
from Europe, and time and time again the Western rulers stormed and
took over every castle in Syria, and as often, the kings of Islám
delivered them out of their hands. Finally Saladin, in the year 693
A.H., drove the European kings and their armies out of Egypt and off
the Syrian coast. Hopelessly beaten, they went back to Europe. In the
course of these wars of the Crusades, millions of human beings
perished. To sum up, from 490 A.H. until 693, kings, commanders and
other European leaders continually came and went between Egypt, Syria
and the West, and when in the end they all returned home, they
introduced into Europe whatever they had observed over two hundred
and odd years in Muslim countries as to government, social
development and learning, colleges, schools and the refinements of
living. The civilization of Europe dates from that time.</p>

leadership they achieved in the arts of civilization and how many
were the children of Europe’s leading families who were sent to
attend the schools of Cordova and Granada, Seville and Toledo to
acquire the sciences and arts of civilized life. He even records that
a European named Gerbert came to the West and enrolled at the

ignorant.” <a data-fnid='64'></a>  And
likewise: “…who master their anger, and forgive others! God
loveth the doers of good.” <a data-fnid='65'></a>
And again: “There is no righteousness in turning your faces toward
the East or the West, but he is righteous who believeth in God, and
the last day, and the angels, and the Scriptures, and the Prophets;
who for the love of God disburseth his wealth to his kindred, and to
orphans, and the needy and the wayfarer, and those who ask, and for
ransom; who observeth prayer, and payeth the legal alms, and who is
of those who perform their covenant when they have covenanted, and

Sincerity is the foundation-stone of faith. That is, a religious
individual must disregard his personal desires and seek in whatever
way he can wholeheartedly to serve the public interest; and it is
impossible for a human being to turn aside from his own selfish
advantages and sacrifice his own good for the good of the community
except through true religious faith. For self-love is kneaded into
the very clay of man, and it is not possible that, without any hope
of a substantial reward, he should neglect his own present material
good. That individual, however, who puts his faith in God and
believes in the words of God — because he is promised and certain of
a plentiful reward in the next life, and because worldly benefits as
compared to the abiding joy and glory of future planes of existence
are nothing to him — will for the sake of God abandon his own peace
and profit and will freely consecrate his heart and soul to the
common good. “A man, too, there is who selleth his very self out of
desire to please God.” <a data-fnid='68'></a>

There are some who imagine that an innate sense of human dignity will
prevent man from committing evil actions and insure his spiritual and
material perfection. That is, that an individual who is characterized
with natural intelligence, high resolve, and a driving zeal, will,
without any consideration for the severe punishments consequent on
evil acts, or for the great rewards of righteousness, instinctively
refrain from inflicting harm on his fellow men and will hunger and
thirst to do good. And yet, if we ponder the lessons of history it
will become evident that this very sense of honor and dignity is
itself one of the bounties deriving from the instructions of the
Prophets of God. We also observe in infants the signs of aggression
and lawlessness, and that if a child is deprived of a teacher’s
instructions his undesirable qualities increase from one moment to
the next. It is therefore clear that the emergence of this natural
sense of human dignity and honor is the result of education.
Secondly, even if we grant for the sake of the argument that
instinctive intelligence and an innate moral quality would prevent
wrongdoing, it is obvious that individuals so characterized are as
rare as the philosopher’s stone. An assumption of this sort cannot
be validated by mere words, it must be supported by the facts. Let us
see what power in creation impels the masses toward righteous aims
and deeds!</p>

Universal benefits derive from the grace of the divine religions, for
they lead their true followers to sincerity of intent, to high
purpose, to purity and spotless honor, to surpassing kindness and
compassion, to the keeping of their covenants when they have
covenanted, to concern for the rights of others, to liberality, to
justice in every aspect of life, to humanity and philanthropy, to
valor and to unflagging efforts in the service of mankind. It is
religion, to sum up, which produces all human virtues, and it is
these virtues which are the bright candles of civilization. If a man
is not characterized by these excellent qualities, it is certain that
he has never attained to so much as a drop out of the fathomless
river of the waters of life that flows through the teachings of the
Holy Books, nor caught the faintest breath of the fragrant breezes
that blow from the gardens of God; for nothing on earth can be
demonstrated by words alone, and every level of existence is known by
its signs and symbols, and every degree in man’s development has
its identifying mark.</p>

the divine religions, the holy precepts, the heavenly teachings, are

great remedy. This panacea must, however, be administered by a wise

cures that the Lord of men has ever created to heal men’s ills
could produce no health, and would on the contrary only destroy the
helpless and burden the hearts of the already afflicted.</p>

That Source of divine wisdom, that Manifestation of Universal
Prophethood (Muḥammad), encouraging mankind to acquire sciences and

the furthermost reaches of China; yet the incompetent and caviling
doctors forbid this, offering as their justification the saying, “He
who imitates a people is one of them.” They have not even grasped
what is meant by the “imitation” referred to, nor do they know
that the divine religions enjoin upon and encourage all the faithful
to adopt such principles as will conduce to continuous improvements,
and to acquire from other peoples sciences and arts. Whoever
expresses himself to the contrary has never drunk of the nectar of
knowledge and is astray in his own ignorance, groping after the

And again, addressing the Dayspring of all knowledge, the Source of
perfection (Muḥammad), in spite of His being in possession of
universal wisdom, the words are: “and consult them in the

survived, for the governors would select any victim they cared to,
however innocent, and vent their wrath on him and destroy him. Or,

Among those matters which require thorough revision and reform is the
method of studying the various branches of knowledge and the
organization of the academic curriculum. From lack of organization,
education has become haphazard and confused. Trifling subjects which
should not call for elaboration receive undue attention, to such an
extent that students, over long periods of time, waste their minds
and their energies on material that is pure supposition, in no way
susceptible of proof, such study consisting in going deep into
statements and concepts which careful examination would establish as
not even unlikely, but rather as unalloyed superstition, and
representing the investigation of useless conceits and the chasing of
absurdities. There can be no doubt that to concern oneself with such
illusions, to examine into and lengthily debate such idle
propositions, is nothing but a waste of time and a marring of the
days of one’s life. Not only this, but it also prevents the
individual from undertaking the study of those arts and sciences of
which society stands in dire need. The individual should, prior to
engaging in the study of any subject, ask himself what its uses are
and what fruit and result will derive from it. If it is a useful
branch of knowledge, that is, if society will gain important benefits
from it, then he should certainly pursue it with all his heart. If
not, if it consists in empty, profitless debates and in a vain
concatenation of imaginings that lead to no result except acrimony,
why devote one’s life to such useless hairsplittings and disputes.</p>

<p id='188' data-ref='sdc_en-p188'>
Because this matter requires further elucidation and a thorough

the point will, God willing, be developed in a second volume. Our
hope is that a reading of this first volume will produce fundamental
changes in the thinking and the behavior of society, for We have

<p id='189' data-ref='sdc_en-p189'>
To resume: As for that group who maintains that in effecting these
necessary reforms we must proceed with deliberation, exercise
patience and gain the objectives one at a time, just what do they
mean by this? If by deliberation they are referring to that
circumspection which the science of government requires, their
thought is timely and appropriate. It is certain that momentous
undertakings cannot be brought to a successful conclusion in haste;
that in such cases haste would only make waste.</p>

own special form, until at last he reaches the plane where he can
befittingly fulfill the words: “the most excellent of Makers.” <a data-fnid='73'></a>
Just as this is a requirement of creation and is based on the
universal Wisdom, the political world in the same way cannot
instantaneously evolve from the nadir of defectiveness to the zenith
of rightness and perfection. Rather, qualified individuals must
strive by day and by night, using all those means which will conduce
to progress, until the government and the people develop along every

hundred million inhabitants. On this account, its government should
be the most distinguished on earth, its people the most acclaimed.
And yet on the contrary, because of its lack of education in cultural
and material civilization, it is the feeblest and the most helpless
of all weak nations. Not long ago, a small contingent of English and
French troops went to war with China and defeated that country so
decisively that they took over its capital Peking. Had the Chinese
government and people been abreast of the advanced sciences of the
day, had they been skilled in the arts of civilization, then if all
the nations on earth had marched against them the attack would still
have failed, and the attackers would have returned defeated whence
they had come.</p>

<p id='198' data-ref='sdc_en-p198'>
Stranger even than this episode is the fact that the government of
Japan was in the beginning subject to and under the protection of
China, and that now for some years, Japan has opened its eyes and
adopted the techniques of contemporary progress and civilization,
promoting sciences and industries of use to the public, and striving
to the utmost of their power and competence until public opinion was
focused on reform. This government has currently advanced to such a
point that, although its population is only one-sixth, or even
one-tenth, that of China, it has recently challenged the latter
government, and China has finally been forced to come to terms.
Observe carefully how education and the arts of civilization bring

It is, furthermore, a vital necessity to establish schools throughout
Persia, even in the smallest country towns and villages, and to
encourage the people in every possible way to have their children
learn to read and write. If necessary, education should even be made
compulsory. Until the nerves and arteries of the nation stir into
life, every measure that is attempted will prove vain; for the people
are as the human body, and determination and the will to struggle are
as the soul, and a soulless body does not move. This dynamic power is
present to a superlative degree in the very nature of the Persian
people, and the spread of education will release it.</p>

It is certain that if the vigorous intelligence and superior skill of
the nation’s great, and the energy and resolve of the most eminent

have knowledge and capacity, and are well versed in the great laws of
political life, should all be combined, and all should exert every
effort and examine and reflect over every detail as well as on the
main currents of affairs, there is every likelihood that because of
the effective plans they would evolve, some situations would be
thoroughly reformed. In the majority of cases, however, they would
still be obliged to borrow; because, throughout the many-centuried
past, hundreds of thousands of persons have devoted their entire
lives to putting these things to the test until they were able to
bring about these substantial developments. If all that is to be
ignored and an effort is made to re-create those agencies in our own
country and in our own way, and thus effect the hoped-for
advancement, many generations would pass by and still the goal would
not be reached. Observe for instance that in other countries they
persevered over a long period until finally they discovered the power
of steam and by means of it were enabled easily to perform the heavy
tasks which were once beyond human strength. How many centuries it
would take if we were to abandon the use of this power and instead
strain every nerve to invent a substitute. It is therefore preferable
to keep on with the use of steam and at the same time continuously to
examine into the possibility of there being a far greater force
available. One should regard the other technological advances,
sciences, arts and political formulae of proven usefulness in the
same light — i.e., those procedures which, down the ages, have time
and again been put to the test and whose many uses and advantages
have demonstrably resulted in the glory and greatness of the state,
and the well-being and progress of the people. Should all these be
abandoned, for no valid reason, and other methods of reform be
attempted, by the time such reforms might eventuate, and their
advantages might be put to proof, many years would go by, and many
lives. Meanwhile, “we are still at the first bend in the road.” <a data-fnid='76'></a>

ancient pinnacles of glory, and restore this withered land to sweet
new life, and as a spiritual springtime, array those trees which are
the lives of men with the fresh leaves, the blossoms and fruits of
consecrated joy.
