<h2>
    <a name="_Toc154078461">Foreword</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Bahá’ís everywhere will feel a deep sense of gratitude to Canada’s National
    Spiritual Assembly for its decision to republish Messages to Canada,
    letters written by or on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, which has been out of
    print for all too many years. The new edition will be welcomed even more
    enthusiastically because of the fact that the compilation as now made
    available has grown from the thirty communications constituting the
    original publication to a total of over two hundred letters and cables
    addressed to the National Spiritual Assembly itself, to Local Spiritual
    Assemblies and groups, to committees, and to a great many individual
    Canadian believers.
</p>
<p>
    Clearly, the task of identifying and assembling this large body of new
    material and of integrating it into the original volume has been a long and
    painstaking labour of love on the part of the editors. No more appropriate
    occasion could be imagined for the launching of the resulting work than the
    fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of Canada’s National Spiritual
    Assembly as an independent Institution of the Bahá’í Faith and “ninth
    pillar” of the Universal House of Justice. To remember that historic
    occasion is to ponder deeply the significance of the body thus created.
    This meaning is powerfully expressed in words which Amatu’l-Bahá Rúhíyyih
    Khánum addressed to the first national convention assembled in the drawing
    room of her girlhood home in Montreal:
</p>
<p>
    Whenever one thinks of Canada one thinks of cultivation. Out of her virgin
    forests, her wildernesses, her barren North lands and lakes, has already
    been wrung a great and promising nation. The darkness of nature, as the
    Master said, has given way to cultivation and out of imperfection has
    arisen the splendour of government, industry, trade, settlement, and the
    arts and sciences of human life. But spiritually the land is still dark,
    promising, but dark. Primarily the measure of spirituality radiated by your
    national body will be the measure of Bahá’u’lláh’s light directly available
    for Canada. For He created the concept of your institution. You exist
    because of the functions He desired you to perform, and your fundamental
    function is to be the spiritual heart of Canada.
</p>
<p>
    On April 30, 1949, barely twelve months after the new National Spiritual
    Assembly had come into existence, it was formally incorporated by special
    Act of Parliament, an event twice hailed by Shoghi Effendi in the documents
    published here as “a magnificent victory unique in the annals of East and
    West”. In retrospect, the achievement provided a dramatic illustration of
    the immense potentialities with which, as the Guardian repeatedly reminded
    Canadian believers, Providence has endowed their community and their
    country. Today, as Canadian Bahá’ís contemplate the results of fifty years
    of struggle and sacrifice they begin to catch a glimmer of the dazzling
    panorama that lay open to the eyes of Shoghi Effendi as he penned the words
    of appeal, advice, and encouragement that constitute the heart of this
    book: Local Spiritual Assemblies established in the most remote corners of
    a vast land—the second largest on the face of the planet; an enviable
    record of work carried out quietly but with great effect by succeeding
    generations of Canadian pioneers and travel teachers in every part of the
    world; an outpouring of funds that has nourished the activities of the
    Cause at its World Centre and throughout the globe and that truly merits
    the term sacrificial; the impetus given to the international community’s
    proclamation of Bahá’u’lláh’s message by Canadian Bahá’í creativity in the
    arts and the media; and the growing involvement in the work of the Faith on
    the part of believers from Canada’s many ethnic and cultural backgrounds, a
    hope which is the unflagging theme of so many of Shoghi Effendi’s letters.
</p>
<p>
    Canadian readers who note the Guardian’s poignant references to the
    suffering of their fellow Bahá’ís in the land of their Faith’s birth will
    derive a feeling of profound satisfaction from the leadership which both
    their community and their nation have since demonstrated in mobilizing
    international condemnation of such persecution, in providing homes for
    several thousand of the victims, and in winning the agreement of many other
    nations to similarly open their own doors.
</p>
<p>
    Above all, given the letters’ urgent emphasis on the qualities of
    “loyalty”, “vigilance”, and “unswerving fidelity”, Canadian Bahá’ís will
    reserve their deepest expressions of gratitude to Bahá’u’lláh for the
    Divine protection which, since the moment of the Faith’s arrival in their
    country a hundred years ago, has so remarkably shielded their community
    from all efforts to undermine its record of unyielding commitment to the
    Covenant.
</p>
<p>
    All of these developments were possible because of the hours of patient
    care which Shoghi Effendi devoted to the community’s development at the
    very dawn of its collective history as a distinct national community. It
    was the blazing ardour of these messages that inspired Canadian Bahá’í
    pioneers to endure years of isolation in Arctic posts, remote island
    settlements, and regions of the earth which seemed initially to display as
    little in the way of spiritual receptivity as they offered with respect to
    the comforts of life. It was letters in this book—cherished treasures in
    homes across the country, treasures grown fragile through constant
    re-reading—which awoke in individual believers the courage to look within
    themselves for capacities quite outside their daily experience. Through the
    guidance the messages contained, Local Spiritual Assemblies learned
    gradually to be patient not only with the failings of the communities
    entrusted to their care, but also with the slow processes of their own
    institutional growth.
</p>
<p>
    At all times, Shoghi Effendi held up before the eyes of Canadian
    believers—conditioned by everything in their culture to the virtues of
    modesty and prudence, and confirmed in this mindset by sobering historical
    experience—the breathtaking mandate which has been conferred on them by the
    Centre of the Covenant. They must strive to appreciate, he insisted, that
    they are a “co-heir” of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, “chosen
    prosecutors” of that Plan, “sole partner” and “chief ally” of their sister
    community in the United States in its worldwide implementation, and endowed
    with that “primacy with which the twin Bahá’í national communities
    labouring in the North American continent have been invested by the
    unerring Pen of the Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant”.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever response was unduly slow or energies flagged, Shoghi Effendi was
    in no way reluctant to press those matters which deeply concerned him.
    Perhaps the most vexed single issue was the difficulty which the National
    Spiritual Assembly appeared to have in acquiring a suitable site for its
    first Mashriqu’l-Adhkár and even an appropriate property for its national
    Hazíratu’l-Quds. As delay followed delay and one after another of the
    Assembly’s optimistic expectations proved illusory, letters from the
    Guardian’s secretaries expressed growing concern. Eventually, Shoghi
    Effendi himself addressed the subject in the course of a major message in
    1955:
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    [The] purchase of the site of the Mother Temple of the Dominion of Canada
    and the establishment of the national Hazíratu’l-Quds constitute a double
    task that can brook no further delay, as the entire Bahá’í world, having
    hailed the erection of such an indispensable institution in no less than
    eighteen countries scattered throughout the continents and oceans of the
    Globe, is now intently fixing its eye on this community, so richly blessed
    by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá....
</p>
<p>
    Principally, however, one is struck by the gentleness and restraint that
    the messages display over failures which, however serious in themselves,
    were clearly seen by Shoghi Effendi as the result not of obduracy or folly,
    but of ineptitude on the part of a very young community desperately
    concerned to learn and to fulfil the expectations of the incomparable
    figure on whom all its love and hope were fixed.
</p>
<p>
    A startling feature of Shoghi Effendi’s letters to Canada—and indeed of the
    Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that inspired them—is their linking of the
    spiritual destiny of the country with its brilliant material future.
    Repeatedly, the Guardian returns to the theme of the Master’s emphasis on
    this dual process. In an especially provocative passage, he points to the
    vital role which, in the fullness of time, the Bahá’í community itself is
    destined to play not only in the nation’s spiritual development, but in its
    social and economic advance:
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian]
</p>
<p>
    May this community, the leaven placed by the hands of Providence in the
    midst of a people belonging to a nation, likewise young, dynamic, richly
    endowed with material resources, and assured of a great material prosperity
    by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, play its part not only in lending a notable impetus to the
    world-wide propagation of the Faith it has espoused, but contribute, as its
    resources multiply and as it gains in stature, to the spiritualization and
    material progress of the nation of which it forms so vital a part.
</p>
<p>
    Here, we touch with that mystery that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá termed “the secret of
    Divine civilization”. Increasingly, Bahá’ís will feel impelled to consider
    the impact on Canadian consciousness of Shoghi Effendi’s messages and the
    long term effects on the nation’s life. Prior to World War II it might well
    have been impossible to identify a society more provincial, more resolutely
    self-absorbed than that of Canada. Today, in its place, stands a nation for
    whom a global perspective is the norm, that has established a perhaps
    unparalleled record of service to the cause of international peacekeeping,
    and that is justly renowned for its willingness to provide economic
    assistance without attaching to it political or other conditions.
</p>
<p>
    Readers will note that the major messages in the book were all written
    during the nine year period—1948 to 1957—which coincided with this great
    turning point in the orientation of Canada’s people. The letters’ immediate
    effects can be traced in the lives of only the several hundred persons to
    whom they were directly addressed. Their broader influence, an influence
    deriving its force from the direct intervention in Canadian history of the
    Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, was prefigured in words with which
    ‘Abdu’l-Bahá described the significance of the brief but incalculably
    precious days He spent in the country:
</p>
<p>
    The time of sojourn was limited to a number of days, but the results in the
    future are inexhaustible.... Again I repeat, that the future of Canada,
    whether from a material or spiritual standpoint, is very great. Day by day
    civilization and freedom shall increase. The clouds of the Kingdom will
    water the seeds of guidance which have been sown there.

<p>
    It is with immense joy that we release this new edition of Messages to
    Canada. The publication of this commemorative edition of communications
    from Shoghi Effendi is particularly momentous in this auspicious year when
    the Canadian Bahá’í Community celebrates the hundredth anniversary of the
    introduction of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh to Canada and the fiftieth
    anniversary of the election of Canada’s independent National Spiritual
    Assembly.
</p>
<p>
    The edition published in 1965 contained thirty letters and cablegrams,
    which, other than the Guardian’s first letter to Canada, were concentrated
    in the period after Canada’s National Spiritual Assembly came into being.
    Since then, a substantial number of additional letters from the Guardian to
    individuals, Groups and Local Spiritual Assemblies, as well as to the
    National Spiritual Assembly, have been collected and catalogued. As a
    result we are pleased to include 278 letters and cablegrams in this
    edition.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[†]</a>
</p>
<p>
    The letters contained in this volume are written by the Guardian or on his
    behalf by his various secretaries. Those written by the Guardian himself
    have a unique character and a greater authority than messages written on
    his behalf, but the latter constitute authoritative Bahá’í text, as noted
    in a letter dated 25 February 1951, written on behalf of the Guardian to a
    National Spiritual Assembly: “Although the secretaries of the Guardian
    convey his thoughts and instructions and these messages are authoritative,
    their words are in no sense the same as his, their style certainly not the
    same, and their authority less, for they use their own terms and not his
    exact words in conveying his messages.”
</p>
<p>
    The messages are presented in chronological order. In accordance with
    guidance of the Universal House of Justice, addressees and other
    individuals have not been identified, except in circumstances where “it
    would seem strange or inappropriate to omit a particular believer’s name.”
    All cablegrams received from Shoghi Effendi have been presented in the
    original form and without interpolation.
</p>
<p>
    The variety of spelling, capitalization and punctuation used by the
    Guardian’s secretaries has been standardized to the form most often used by
    the Guardian himself. The texts remain as written, and have been checked
    against the originals or authenticated copies of originals. The names used
    in the text to designate various groups have been retained, notwithstanding
    that these designations are no longer in common use.
</p>
<p>
    We would like to thank Judith Oppenheimer in the Archives office of the
    Bahá’í World Centre, and Roger Dahl in the National Bahá’í Archives of the
    United States, for providing additional texts beyond those in our own
    archives. We would like to extend our deep appreciation to the diligent and
    enthusiastic project manager, Ailsa Hedley, who operated under the
    supervision of an advisory committee of the National Spiritual Assembly. We
    are also grateful for the proofreading and research assistance of Pixie
    MacCallum, Jayne Long, Michael Rochester, Jean McKeever, Anne Banani and

    <a name="_Toc154078463">Foreword to the 1965 edition</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Few tasks have given such pleasure to the National Spiritual Assembly as
    the publication of this book. The thirty messages which it contains are
    collated from letters and cablegrams sent to the Canadian Bahá’í community
    by Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Cause. They span virtually the entire
    thirty-six years of his ministry, but the reader will not fail to note that
    apart from the first letter (written in January 1923, shortly after Shoghi
    Effendi assumed his responsibilities at the World Centre) the messages are
    concentrated in the nine years from 1948 to 1957. The explanation lies, of
    course, in the fact that prior to April 1948, Canadian and American Bahá’ís
    were members of a single community embracing the two countries. The great
    body of messages addressed to that community have found permanence in
    several other volumes,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[‡]</a> and
    are now a part of the heritage of the entire Bahá’í world. The Canadian
    National Spiritual Assembly has long desired to contribute to that
    inheritance this final share of the trust left to it by the Guardian. No
    more fitting occasion could be found than the inauguration of the first of
    the global plans designed by the Universal House of Justice and inspired by
    just such undertakings as form the subject of much of this book.
</p>
<p>
    For those believers who were members of the Faith before November 1957,
    this book will have a special dimension. For them, the messages will always
    be letters, inseparable in memory from climactic moments at conventions,
    conferences, and assembly meetings; for some among them, they will be even
    more closely interwoven with memories of the personal decisions which
    helped to translate the plans of the messages into the reality of a
    world-wide community; for a fortunate few, these letters will speak with an
    unforgettable voice and face and hands remembered from all too brief
    evenings at the dinner table in Haifa. The messages have significance,
    however, far beyond the circumstances in which they were issued. Perhaps
    the most obvious, to a Canadian, is the unique contribution which they make
    to the history of the Cause in this country. As a nation, Canada has not
    had a strong sense of mission or identity, and its history has frequently
    appeared to be a sequence of reactions to events occurring in other
    countries. For Canadian Bahá’ís, however, the messages of Shoghi Effendi
    and the statements of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on which they are based provide glimpses
    of the foundations of their community and of its mission in the world which
    are the very essence of history. Shoghi Effendi speaks in moving language
    of the promises of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; of the role of the Canadian community as
    “co-heir” with the American believers to the Tablets of the Divine Plan; of
    the “imperishable record of international service” associated with such
    names as May Maxwell and Sutherland Maxwell, Marion Jack, Fred
    Schopflocher, Louis Bourgeois, and Rúhíyyih Khánum, “my helpmate, my shield
    ... my tireless collaborator”; of the “initiation of [Canada’s] glorious
    mission, far beyond the borders of the Dominion”; of the significance of
    the 1949 Act of Parliament incorporating the National Spiritual Assembly, a
    “magnificent victory unique annals East West”; and of the special role
    which the community must play in the establishment of the Faith among
    aboriginal peoples and particularly among the Eskimos.
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately, however, the messages are the property of the Bahá’í world
    community. On the one hand, they provide authoritative guidance for both
    individuals and assemblies on issues which in several instances may have
    been dealt with nowhere else. On the other, they speak in a spirit of
    understanding which will infinitely reward any effort to appreciate and
    express it. Local assemblies, like national assemblies, will benefit from a
    study of the Guardian’s repeated urging that we “avoid ... rules and
    regulations” as stifling to “the spirit of the Cause”, and deal instead
    with each case on its individual merits in the light of the principles of
    the Faith. The individual believer will be interested in the reflection in
    several of the letters of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s appeal that we refrain from moral
    judgements on other people. Assemblies and individuals alike will not fail
    to remark the extreme caution which the Guardian counsels us to use in the
    disciplinary functions of an administrative body. Finally, the letters
    provide a remarkable glimpse into the world of the spirit in such passages
    as those in which the Guardian stresses the long term significance of the
    goals established in the remote and inhospitable regions of Canada’s
    northland.
</p>
<p>
    In one of the most challenging passages of this book, Shoghi Effendi
    writes: “Above all, the utmost endeavour should be exerted by your Assembly
    to familiarize the newly enrolled believers with the fundamental and
    spiritual verities of the Faith, and with the origins, the aims and
    purposes, as well as the processes of a divinely appointed Administrative
    Order.... For as the body of the avowed supporters of the Faith is enlarged
    ... a parallel progress must be achieved, if the fruits already garnered
    are to endure, in the spiritual quickening of its members and the deepening
    of their inner life.”
</p>
<p>
    There can be no doubt in the mind of anyone who has read them that these
    messages themselves provide a priceless opportunity for the spiritual
    quickening to which their author refers. They constitute a part of that
    imperishable legacy which, without a written Will, the Guardian of the
    Cause has left to the entire world, a legacy which will continue to enrich
    future generations of Bahá’ís throughout the centuries of this
    Dispensation.

        Introduction to the 1965 edition By Hand of the Cause, John A. Robarts
    </a>
</h2>
<p>
    The communications in this book were written by Shoghi Effendi to the
    Bahá’ís of Canada, mostly through the National Spiritual Assembly. The
    first message dated January 2nd, 1923, the Guardian wrote when he was
    twenty-five years old, and in the beginning of his ministry. The others,
    dating from April 1948, when Canada became an independent Bahá’í Community,
    continued until almost that tragic day of his death, November 4th, 1957.
</p>
<p>
    ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in His Will and Testament, wrote of Shoghi Effendi, His
    eldest and dearly loved grandson: “Salutation and praise, blessing and
    glory rest upon that primal branch of the Divine and Sacred Lote-Tree, ...
    the most wondrous, unique and priceless pearl that doth gleam from out the
    Twin surging seas; ...Well is it with him that seeketh the shelter of his
    shade that shadoweth all mankind ... as he is the sign of God, the chosen
    branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God....”
</p>
<p>
    Until 1948, the Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada had been one
    Community. In April of that year, acting upon the instructions of the
    Guardian, we passed the stage of infancy, attained the status, and assumed
    the functions, of an independent existence within the Bahá’í World
    Community. We held our own National Convention in the Maxwell Home, in
    Montreal, elected our National Spiritual Assembly, the ninth in the Bahá’í
    world, and were given a Five Year Plan by the Guardian. We proudly became
    the ninth pillar of the Institution of the Universal House of Justice.
</p>
<p>
    The Five Year Plan called for the incorporation of our National Spiritual
    Assembly; the establishment of National Bahá’í endowments; doubling the
    number of our fifteen Local Spiritual Assemblies and raising to one hundred
    the total number of localities where Bahá’ís reside; the constitution of a
    group in Newfoundland and the formation of a nucleus of the Faith in
    Greenland, and the participation of Eskimos and Red Indians in membership
    to share administrative privileges in local Institutions of the Faith in
    Canada.
</p>
<p>
    For the mere handful of Bahá’ís scattered across Canada, this Plan seemed a
    colossal task. But, as a reading of these messages will reveal, the
    Guardian knew the goals were attainable. He gave us a glimpse of his great
    vision of the Cause. He reminded us of the promises of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “The
    future of the Dominion of Canada ... is very great and the events connected
    with it infinitely glorious....” He showed us that dedication and service
    to the Cause of God must come first in our lives. His stirring appeals, his
    unwavering faith in us, his love and his prayers for us, his keen interest
    in the execution of all phases of the Plan, his constant encouragement, his
    sympathy and understanding in our difficulties, his deep appreciation,
    gratitude and pride in every victory, his reminding us of the promises of
    Divine assistance, brought us to April 1953, with our Five Year Plan
    completed.
</p>
<p>
    To our sixth National Convention he cabled: “Overjoyed grateful triumphant
    conclusion Five Year Plan most momentous enterprise launched Canadian
    Bahá’í history initiated morrow emergence independent existence Canadian
    Bahá’í Community....”
</p>
<p>
    In that same cable he announced details of our part of the Ten Year World
    Crusade, “constituting prelude mightier undertaking designed consolidate
    magnificent victories achieved homefront inaugurate Community’s historic
    mission beyond confines Dominion. Ten Year Plan its valiant members now
    embarking upon enabling them push outposts Faith northernmost territories
    Western Hemisphere associating them members seven other sister Communities
    raising aloft banner Faith Pacific Islands....”
</p>
<p>
    These messages contain both instruction and inspiration. The Guardian gave
    us a deeper understanding of the Faith. We are very proud that he paid such
    loving tributes to a number of Canadian Bahá’ís: Sutherland and May
    Maxwell, their daughter now Rúhíyyih Khánum, Siegfried (Freddie)
    Schopflocher, Marion Jack, and others.
</p>
<p>
    While we suffered the devastating loss of our cherished Guardian at almost
    the halfway point of the Crusade we are happy that the goals have been
    achieved. We know that he will be overjoyed and grateful for the triumphant
    conclusion of his Ten Year World Crusade, “the greatest spiritual drama the
    world has ever witnessed”. We will now go forward with our fifty-five
    sister Communities of the Bahá’í world to establish the Kingdom of God upon
    the earth.
</p>
<p>
    A fuller perspective of the work of Shoghi Effendi is obtained by reading
    these messages in conjunction with those he wrote before 1948, to the
    Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada, and from 1950, to the Bahá’ís of
    the world. For thirty-six years he was the Divine Tree that shadowed all
    mankind. He was the most wondrous, unique and priceless being. He was
    indeed the Guardian of the Cause of God.

    The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout Canada
</p>
<p>
    c/o the members of the Spiritual Assembly in Montreal
</p>
<p>
    Dear friends!
</p>
<p>
    It is a great pleasure and privilege to me to enter into direct and I trust
    permanent correspondence with those faithful friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who,
    though few in number and scattered over that vast and flourishing country,
    will I trust act as a powerful leaven to the mass of that
    spiritually-minded people.
</p>
<p>
    Though its people be firmly entrenched in their religious sectarianism and
    strongly attached to their religious doctrines and traditions, yet who can
    doubt that with courage and persistence, kindliness and wisdom, the
    all-conquering words of Bahá’u’lláh can fail to break down all these
    barriers of prejudice and religious exclusiveness and conquer this
    long-standing stronghold of sectarian belief!
</p>
<p>
    Surely the efficacy of the universal Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, as applied
    to the cherished and time-honoured religious traditions of the East, has
    been sufficiently demonstrated to justify at present our confident hopes
    for the future and speedy reawakening of that land.
</p>
<p>
    May the small company of the steadfast followers of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Canada
    be filled with the outpourings of the Divine Grace that are being showered
    so mightily in these days upon the friends of God the world over, and may
    they arise with undiminished fervour to carry out to their fullest measure
    the last wishes and instructions of our departed Master for that great and
    flourishing Dominion!

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    My dearly beloved friends!
</p>
<p>
    I was deeply interested and immensely gratified to read the newly received
    messages and letters from that distant land, all testifying to the growth
    of a new spirit of enthusiasm and fellowship recently kindled in the hearts
    of those few, yet earnest, workers for the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. The report
    sent to me recently by the Secretary of the Montreal Spiritual Assembly, as
well as the letters which our beloved spiritual sister, Mrs. Schopflocher,    <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[§]</a> has received from
    America, all gave me the assurance that a new era of spiritual activity is
    dawning upon the people of that land. May the repeated promises of
    ‘Abdu’l-Bahá regarding the ultimate religious revival of that spiritually
    conservative country, and the universal and whole-hearted response of its
    people to the Call of Yá-Bahá’u’l-Abhá be speedily fulfilled!
</p>
<p>
    It behoves us, now that the signs of that glorious and promised Day are
    fast appearing, to arise, with utter selflessness, unity and determination,
    to promote and consolidate the Work which He has Himself established in the
    heart of that vast Dominion, and prove ourselves, by our wisdom,
    moderation, and constancy, worthy of the many bestowals He has showered
    upon us in the past. If we but follow in His Way, regard at all times the
    dignity of the Cause, guard sedulously its unity and vital principles, and
    exercise the utmost endeavour to keep its Spirit pure, effective, and
    unobscured, then, and only then, can we hope to achieve the immediate
    spread and triumph of the Cause.
</p>
<p>
Our beloved Bahá’í sister, Mrs. May Maxwell,    <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[**]</a> the pioneer of the Cause
    in Canada, will soon be with us in the Holy Land, and I trust that after
    her visit to the Three Holy Shrines, she may be enabled to return,
    invigorated and refreshed, ready to continue, in collaboration with you
    all, the great mission which the Master has destined her to fulfill in this
    world. May I assure you again of my constant prayers for your success, and
    of my desire to hear from you all, individually and collectively, regarding
    the progress of your labours, and the plans you contemplate for the further
    advancement of the Movement in those regions.

    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    My dear Bahá’í Sister,
</p>
<p>
    Your spiritually beautiful letter of December 16th sent through our beloved
brother, Mr. F. Schopflocher    <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[††]</a> to our dear Guardian,
    Shoghi Effendi, has been received. He was deeply impressed with the spirit
    of your devotion and attachment to the Holy Cause of God and lofty
    aspirations to serve humanity which is the fundamental aim of the Bahá’í
    Movement.
</p>
<p>
    He has instructed me to answer your letter and convey to you his loving
    greeting. He assures you that he remembers you in his ardent prayers at the
    Holy Shrine of our Master, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, so that you may day by day grow
    stronger and stronger in your understanding the realities of the heavenly
    teachings.
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi approves of your consideration for your husband. He hopes
    that through your wise conduct and loving-kindness to him, he will also
    gradually understand the significance of the Holy Cause. People are not
    naturally against the Truth. There are obstacles between them and the
    Truth. These obstacles must be wisely removed and then they surely will be
    attracted to the Cause. The magnet for this attraction is real love and
    tolerance towards the ideas and customs of the people. We must follow our
    Lord, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who taught us to be well-wishers of mankind
    disregarding religious and racial differences. Our love must be so spacious
    as to engulf the whole of the people of the world. With love and only with
    unlimited love we have been and will be able to conquer the hearts of the
    people and direct the current of their sentiments along the channel of the
    happiness of mankind and thus usher in the era of the regeneration of man.
    It is unlimited love which is the Elixir that turns the common metals of
    the human being into pure gold.
</p>
<p>
    Dear sister, the Jewish nation are a religious people. They are strong in
    their faith. When they become Bahá’ís, they are apt to become strong in the
    Cause too. We have thousands of Jewish Bahá’ís in Persia, who have broken
    the barriers of exclusiveness from other people and are most active in the
    service of the Cause. Shoghi Effendi’s desire is that you ought still to be
    more considerate and kind to your husband and relatives. This is Bahá’í
    spirit.
</p>
<p>
    For several days we have had the pleasure of having our dear brother, Mr.
    Schopflocher,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[‡‡]</a> with us. We
    are impressed deeply with his love, devotion and sincerity or in other
    words, with his Bahá’í spirit. We are sure that when he returns to Canada,
    through the inspiration he has received from his personal touch with our
    beloved Guardian and from the Holy Shrine of our Master, he will be able to
    reach the hearts of the people with a greater power than ever before.
</p>
<p>
    Be assured dear sister, that I will not also forget you in my humble
    prayers and I am cherishing the hope that you will succeed in bringing up
    your dear children to become good Bahá’ís and servants of the world of
    humanity.
</p>
<p>
    With Bahá’í love and greeting, I remain,

<p>
    Your humble brother in His love and service,

    treading the Path our Beloved has pursued throughout His heroic life, that
    your fortitude, your perseverance, your services, your loyalty to Him will
    be abundantly rewarded in the world to come in His Divine Presence. Be
    then, cheerful, radiant and resolute and persevere to the very end and be

promising disciple of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, our dearly beloved Mr. Schopflocher    <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[§§]</a> has served to remind me
    of my Canadian friends, who are destined and chosen by Bahá’u’lláh to
    prepare the way for the ultimate triumph of His Cause in that great and
    vast Dominion.
</p>
<p>
    I have received from him the assurance of your warm and abiding affection,
    of your unflinching faith and noble resolve to carry on the work so
    heroically begun by the Báb, so securely established by Bahá’u’lláh, and so
    widely and powerfully promoted by His beloved Son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In my hours
    of association with your beloved representative I could not but feel deeply
    impressed by the sweetness of his nature, his ardour, his humility and
    selflessness, his clear understanding of, and entire devotion to, the
    interests of our beloved Cause. True, his has not been the privilege to
    gaze at our Beloved’s face, yet who that has seen him can but for a moment
    doubt that his soul is aglow with the flame of our Master’s love, that in
    him the Spirit of our departed Master abides in all its power and beauty?
</p>
<p>
    I am confident that his radiant heart is but the reflecting mirror of that
    undying Fire, lit by our Beloved’s hand in the heart of your country, and
    destined one day to blaze forth and illumine all the Dominion of Canada—nay
    the whole of the Western continent. My prayers at the three Holy Shrines
    are that the Almighty may guide you and enable you to adhere steadfastly to
    the admonitions and counsels of our All-Wise Master, that you may combine
    and harmonize the essential qualities of prudence and courage, discretion
    and candour, dignity and lowliness, fidelity and goodwill, that thus you
    may guard His Cause and promote its interests at all times and under all
    conditions.
</p>
<p>
    I am glad to convey to you the glad news of the improving health of that
loved one of God, our dear Mrs. Maxwell.    <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[***]</a> That pioneer worker of
    the Cause, so precious an asset to the Movement in Canada, will soon be in
    your midst, refreshed and restored. I am waiting with intense expectation
    to see your individual activities and talents all merged into one motive
    force, sustained by your combined efforts, directed by a unified purpose,
    and inspired by one common aim. Then will the showers of His grace rain
    upon you, and the unfailing promises of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá be speedily and
    effectively fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
    That His Word will eventually be spread and firmly established none of us
    can ever doubt; my only yearning and hope is that we may through sustained
    effort and prayer be graciously aided to hasten by our words and deeds the
    advent of this glorious and long-awaited Day.

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister,
</p>
<p>
    Your highly spiritual letter of August 24th written to our beloved
    Guardian, expressing your deep attachment to the Beloved of our hearts and
    His Will, arrived and impressed him very much. He was also very glad to
    learn that the dear friends are doing their best to make Green Acre the
    focal centre from which the heavenly Teachings may radiate to all parts of
    America.
</p>
<p>
    Yesterday he instructed me to write a few words in answer to your letter
    conveying his profound affection to you and make you and your beloved
    husband assured that he remembers you both in his ardent prayers at the
    Holy Shrines. He wishes you both to be always two burning sparks in the
    Cause of God so that you may kindle the love of God in anybody with whom
    you may come in contact. He expects you also to often write to him and tell
    him how you are.
</p>
<p>
    The Greatest Holy Leaf, the Holy Mother and the other Holy Leaves are well
    and send you their tender love. They pray for your happiness and success
    too.

</h3>
<p>
    January 1926
</p>
<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    My dear Mr. ... :
</p>
<p>
    After reading your short yet delightful letter, Shoghi Effendi passed it
    over to me to acknowledge its receipt. He was most pleased to hear that the
    Cause has lately aroused some interest among the people in Canada. This has
    been the case everywhere. This last world war together with the treaty of
    peace and its consequences have taught humanity that unless national,
    religious and political prejudices be abolished, unless universal
    brotherhood be established, unless spiritual civilization be given an equal
    footing with material civilization and thereby change the standard of
    individual, national and international morality, the world is doomed to
    failure and society to utter destruction. Confirming this idea, Mr. Lloyd
    George, in one of his late addresses, stated that one morning he had
    invited some church dignitaries for breakfast to Downing Street. Their talk
    was about the real need of England. The church dignitaries were almost
    unanimous in their view that the real need of England was a political
    revival. Mr. Lloyd George, who was the only layman present, and was at that
    time the British Prime Minister, stated that the real and only need of
    England was a religious revival, because religion changes the character of
    the individual, and once the individual changes the nation changes, and
    once the nation changes the government has to change and follow a new code
    of laws in its dealings towards other nations. Thus we see that even those
    who hold the reins of world politics believe that religion is essential for
    human welfare. If so what religion is more broad in its views, more liberal
    in its ideas, and more modern and scientific in its principles than the
    Bahá’í Religion?
</p>
<p>
    The reason why the Cause has not spread more than it has is that the world
    up to the present has not really felt its critical position and the friends
    not done their best. It is the duty of the Bahá’ís, the world over, to
    study the Teachings, become versed in the principles and history of the
    Cause, catch the spirit of the Movement and then arise to service. This was
    the Master’s last word of command, this is Shoghi Effendi’s first desire.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever Shoghi Effendi visits the Blessed Shrines, and kneels at those
    Sacred Thresholds, he earnestly prays and asks God to help the friends in
    this great work and pave the way for their service. Had it not been for his
    tremendous work, Shoghi Effendi would have written to the friends
    individually and nerved them to action. Yet his correspondence with the
    Assemblies does not permit him as yet to attend to the letters of the
    individual friends, so he tells us who are around him to take up that part
    of his work and put on paper what he communicates to us orally.
</p>
<p>
At present we are having Mrs. Maxwell<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[†††]</a> and Mrs. Schopflocher    <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[‡‡‡]</a> with us. They tell us
    about your Assemblies in Canada and the wonderful success you have had in
    teaching and interesting the people. I really hope your group will increase
    from day to day and achieve great things in the path of God.
</p>
<p>
    With best wishes to you as well as to your family, I beg to remain,
</p>
<p>
    Yours most sincerely,
</p>
<p>
    Ruhi Afnan

<p>
    9 August 1926
</p>
<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    My dear Mr. ...:
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated
    June 19th 1926. The sentiment it expressed, the feeling it revealed, the
    words used all seemed to go down into one’s heart. Here stands the Bahá’í
    Cause with absolute need of true and ardent servants who are ready to raise
    its call and invite the heedless people to the acceptance of its teachings.
    Few are those who have already taken their allegiance to the Master. But
    even smaller in number is that group of those who have also the freedom to
    go out and teach it to others.
</p>
<p>
    There is, however, one hope. God is not heedless to the sighings of the
    soul. When we desire such an altruistic thing, when we pray for it ardently
    and truly seek some outlet for the realization of our hopes, sooner or
    later the occasion will present itself. We are told that the way to
    Paradise is thorny, but we are also assured that if we persist we shall
    attain it and obtain our victory.
</p>
<p>
    So, Shoghi Effendi prays that, though at present circumstances may prevent
    you from rendering those services you desire, you will keep up the hope and
    await that moment. It will undoubtedly come and bear you the fruit of
    anxious waiting. The Master surely knows your heart’s desire and grants it
    to you; especially as it is for better service to His Cause.
</p>
<p>
    With deepest love I remain,
</p>
<p>
    Yours in His Name,
</p>
<p>
    Ruhi Afnan

    you to withstand and overcome the trials that are sent you by the All-Wise
    for your ultimate deliverance, regeneration and victory. Do not despair,
    remember the sufferings of our Beloved and rest assured in my sympathy,
    affection and prayers for you. Persevere in your labours for our beloved
    Cause.

    Dear co-worker:
</p>
<p>
    Your welcome letter, breathing the spirit of loving devotion to the
    interests of humanity, has touched my heart.
</p>
<p>
    I am greatly pleased to learn of your awakened interest in the Divine
    Message Bahá’u’lláh has given to the world, and of your keen desire to
    investigate and study it. You have truly grasped its essence when you
    characterized it as a Faith so new and fresh in its vitality and yet so old
    in the truth upon which it is based.
</p>
<p>
    I am convinced that as you travel, whether in America, Europe, Asia, or
    Australasia, and get in contact with its fervent and devoted followers in
    the divers regions of the world you will increasingly realize the unique
    potency, the transforming power, the all-unifying force which distinguish
    the Bahá’í Faith from the religious and humanitarian movements of this age.
</p>
<p>
    I shall be delighted to meet you in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s home here in the Holy
    Land, and I cannot tell whether future developments will enable me to seek
    a much needed rest during the hot summer months. If I can at all manage to
    get the rest I need, I will certainly be back by the middle of October at
    which time I trust you will be able to visit Palestine.
</p>
<p>
    I wish to assure you of my best wishes for your success, happiness and
    spiritual advancement and of my joy and hope to accord you a warm welcome
    in our home.

    necessary for the healing of the spiritual sickness of the world.
</p>
<p>
    Please accept my warm good wishes for your Assembly. Many years ago, about
    thirty years ago I should think, I visited your beautiful city! It was then

</p>
<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother,
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi thanks you very much for your letter to him dated March 20th
    1927.
</p>
<p>
    He rejoices to hear that through the influence of your devout and Christian
    parents and family your life has been guided by the Hand of God, until you
    have now received and accepted the message of God in this Day and the
    inspired teachings of the Bahá’í revelation.
</p>
<p>
    You are indeed most blessed through receiving at this time in your life,
    when you are entering upon the full responsibilities and duties of
    manhood—these sacred teachings and principles—which should be an
    inspiration to you to put forth your utmost efforts to draw other souls
    into this radiant light.
</p>
<p>
    As you realize, these principles can only be rendered attractive when they
    are exemplified by a life lived wholly in accordance with these heavenly
    counsels. Then they will have their full effect. Many years ago, when as a
    young believer I asked of the beloved ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructions as to the
    method of teaching and attracting souls to the Light—He replied in a
    beautiful Tablet describing the life of detachment, purity, and dedication
    to the service of God, which should be lived by the one who was desirous of
    teaching. And now, in this time of grave difficulties and trials which
    surround all the peoples of the world, our first duty is to teach, and gain
    adherents for our Bahá’í Faith and the life-giving precepts and principles
    given to us by Bahá’u’lláh, and the beloved Master ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
</p>
<p>
    ‘Abdu’l-Bahá once said to me that we should use the Hidden Words as a
    mirror—comparing our actions and thoughts with what is there revealed—and
    if they did not match, so to speak, and fully reflect these Divine
    Counsels—then we must change our actions and conduct until they were in
    perfect harmony and agreement with these heavenly exhortations.
</p>
<p>
    With all Bahá’í greetings, and wishing you every success in your
    endeavours,
</p>
<p>
    Your sincere fellow-worker in this great Service,
</p>

    My dear spiritual brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter has brought joy to my heart. I will pray for you from the
    bottom of my heart that the Beloved may pour upon you His richest
    blessings, guide your steps, sustain your faith, deepen your understanding,
    and remove every obstacle from your way. I urge you to study the Teachings
    and particularly ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Some Answered Questions and Dr. Esslemont’s
    Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, two of the outstanding books in our Bahá’í
    Literature. I hope to meet you some day in Haifa in the Beloved’s home.

</p>
<p>
    Dear Spiritual brothers and sisters:
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated
    March 18, 1927. He hopes and prays that through your endeavours and the
    Master’s ever-showering blessings you will succeed to make of this first
    Convention held in Canada a true and brilliant success; that the result of
    the conferences will be to begin a new era in the spiritual life of that
    land, and hoist the flag of peace and brotherhood as never before.
</p>
<p>
    There are some important questions that await immediate settlement and we
    hope that the deliberations made there will give them a true and final
    solution. In short the eye of the Bahá’í world is now anxiously following
    the steps you are taking and the decisions you are to attain.
</p>
<p>
    The members of the Master’s family are all well and join in wishing you the
    greatest success. Their only hope rests in seeing the friends set aside
    their petty differences and in one accord and with a firm determination
    carry the burdens bequeathed to them by their dear Master.

<p>
    My dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    I fear this letter will reach you after the closing of the Convention, but
    I hope it will serve to assure you of the necessity of adopting for future
    Conventions the essential method of a full, frank and unhampered
    consultation between the National Assembly and the assembled delegates. It
    is the vital duty of the delegates to unburden their hearts, state their
    grievances, disclose their views, and explain their motives. It is the duty
    of the National Assembly to give earnest, prompt and prayerful
    consideration to the views of the delegates, weigh carefully their
    arguments and ponder their considered judgements, before they resort to
    voting and undertake to arrive at a decision according to the dictates of
    their conscience. They should explain their motives and not dictate, seek
    information and invite discussion.
</p>
<p>
    Wishing you the fullest success,
</p>

    Unfortunately pressure of work and later his absence for the summer from

    Your account of the Bahá’í Convention at Montreal, the measure of its

    and our Guardian awaits with expectant eyes to see those hopes realized in

    Naturally it depends mostly upon the individual effort of the friends,
    their zeal and enthusiasm which must sustain their endeavours in serving

</p>
<p>
    My dear Friend,
</p>
<p>
    I am instructed by Shoghi Effendi to thank you for your welcome letter of
    February 17th.
</p>
<p>
    He read with interest and pleasure your short account of the stages you had
    passed ever since your youth, the thoughts and feelings that occupied you
    in your earnest pursuit of what could bring you contentment and peace. He
    is now gratified to learn that the path you chose when you were still so
    young in years has finally led you to the Fountain-head from which you can
    drink deep and which can satisfy the genuine hunger of your soul. He would
    be very glad to help you in the study and understanding of the Bahá’í
    teachings and would welcome you as a fellow-worker in the happy task of
    carrying to others the “Light” that we have seen and in trying to reflect
    in our humble lives the glory that it claims.
</p>
<p>
    He would be always interested and glad to hear from you and of your doings
    and trusts that the Bahá’ís in Montreal will find in you a devoted, sincere
    and able friend and collaborator.
</p>
<p>
    He wishes me to assure you of his heartfelt good wishes and prayers, that
    you may succeed in the realization of all that your earnest soul asks for.
</p>
<p>
    With many greetings and loving regards,
</p>
<p>

    obtain a clearer vision of the mission and significance of the Faith.

<p>
    My dear ...,
</p>
<p>
    I am instructed by Shoghi Effendi to thank you for your letter of the 9th
    instant.
</p>
<p>
    He was very much touched by your letter so full of hope, of faith and
    encouragement and he does not doubt for a moment that the Bahá’í youth of
    today, they are the men upon whom shall fall one of the happiest and yet
    one of the most difficult duties that the Cause requires of us, and it is
    in them that he lays his greatest hope for the future.
</p>
<p>
    That is why the assurance of your hope to do your part is so deeply
    appreciated and he would be always glad to co-operate with you.
</p>
<p>
    He is very glad to learn of the possibility of your visit to Haifa in the
    near future, and he wishes me to extend to you a most hearty welcome. It
    will be a pleasure to him to hear from you and of your doings and he
    trusts, that in the near future, you will render valuable and permanent
    services to a Cause that is so near and dear to your heart.

</p>
<p>
    My dear Bahá’í Sister,
</p>
<p>
    I am instructed by our Guardian to thank you for your welcome letter of
    April 13th with enclosure.
</p>
<p>
    He was much interested in what you had written him as regards oil mines in
    your and neighbouring properties and I must say at the beginning that he
    has been deeply touched by the spirit in which you had written your letter
    and by your desire that in accordance with Bahá’í teachings, if the mines
    prove valuable, the proper proportion may go for public Bahá’í utilities.
</p>
<p>
    Whether the lots prove valuable commercially or not, the fact still remains
    that your gesture in writing to our Guardian is truly worthy of a Bahá’í
    and is sufficient to prove your eagerness to apply the teachings of the
    Bahá’í Faith and not profess it by name.
</p>
<p>
    As regards the exploitation of the lots, and their value from a practical
    point of view, of course our Guardian would not wish to say much and would
    advise you to seek expert advice on the subject. Perhaps in the few words
    he will append to this letter, he will suggest the name of one of the
    friends who could help and advise you in the matter.
</p>
<p>
    Please accept the love and good wishes of the Master’s family for yourself,
    your husband and children and permit me to assure you of Shoghi Effendi’s
    heartfelt greetings.

    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter to him
    dated August 7th. He very much appreciates the constant efforts you are
    making in arousing the interest of the friends on the subject of the
    Temple. Those who are fortunate enough as to attend the Convention should
    on their return home carry with them the spirit they have experienced there

    a concerted effort be made and a unity in thought and action be obtained at
    least along the main issues of the year.

</p>
<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    My Dear Mr. ...,
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to hasten and thank you for your good letter of
    February 23rd which he has been so glad to receive.
</p>
<p>
    The news of the co-operation of the Bahá’í young men and women in Montreal,
    their establishment of a group for study and discussion, the sane and sober
    expression of their methods as expressed in the programme you had enclosed,
    and their thoughtful and enthusiastic outlook upon the future, all these
    have helped to create the liveliest hopes and the deepest satisfaction in
    the heart of our Guardian. It is indeed with no little pleasure that he
    welcomes the active co-operation of his young friends in Montreal, and he
    sincerely trusts that with an adequate study of the proper teachings and
    its spiritual significance coupled with a sufficient knowledge of the
    problems and perplexities that the world is beset with, you will be able to
    render great services to the Cause and therefore to humanity.
</p>
<p>
    He considers it a splendid idea to keep in touch and if possible
    communicate with other youth organizations in Canada and the United States.
    It may open immense fields for service at a time when beneath a casual
    indifference there often lies searching and serious thought.
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to express his appreciation of your own personal
    efforts and to ask you to convey his sincere good wishes to every member of
    your group. It will be always a pleasure to him to learn of your work and
    for your communications he will always have time.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    I was delighted by the tone of your letter, and the news it conveyed and
    the assurances it gave greatly heartened me in my task. The youthful and
    eager workers for the Cause in Montreal occupy a warm place in my heart. I
    will remember their hopes, their plans, their activities in my hours of
    prayer at the Holy Shrines. I urge them to study profoundly the revealed
    utterances of Bahá’u’lláh and the discourses of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and not to
    rely unduly on the representation and interpretation of the Teachings given
    by the Bahá’í speakers and teachers. May the Almighty sustain you and guide
    you in your work.

    Dear Fred:

<p>
    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to thank you for your letter dated May 19th as
    well as for the trouble you have undertaken to obtain for him the papers.
    The colour seems to be the most fitting and he hopes to receive them in due
    time. In case he leaves for his summer vacation he will not be here when
    they arrive but proper care will be taken of them, you may rest assured.
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi as well as the others were very glad to hear of your
    election as member of the National Spiritual Assembly. The spirit of
    co-operation you have been showing and the wonderful sacrifices you have
    been making are fully appreciated by the friends and your election is only
    a token of that.
</p>
<p>
    We all hope and pray that you may succeed in your work, both materially and
    spiritually, for as you have shown the object of both is the advancement of
    the interests of the Cause.

    In close may I assure you of Shoghi Effendi’s prayers and extend to you his

<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    My dear Mrs. ...,
</p>
<p>
    I am directed by our Guardian to thank you for your letter of July 9th.
</p>
<p>
    He has read your letter with great interest and pleasure and he admires its
    spirit—so frank, so thoughtful and as regards the Cause, with such
    abounding hopefulness.
</p>
<p>
    In connection with your dear husband, Shoghi Effendi would consider it in
    full and happy accord with the expressed desire of the Master that every
    man should have some permanent work. Much as he desires to see you both
    devote your entire energies to a well thought out, progressive and
    attractive presentation of the Cause—a thing he feels we lack lamentably—he
    would be very pleased to see your husband follow what the Master often
    repeated even to His own immediate family, namely the necessity of a
    profession. Of course you know that He always said His had been mat-making.
</p>
<p>
    As to your entrance to Reed College as an undergraduate, he also feels that
    it would be a very nice idea if it is possible and if it meets with the
    wishes of your husband. No one could think more than the Master did of the
    great need for capacity, knowledge and a broad scientific outlook in the
    service of the Cause, but as against the hard and dry intellectuals, he
    wished such knowledge to be coupled with an intense love for the welfare of
    humanity. Perhaps the enlightened world already suffers because it has too
    much of the former and very little of the latter, but could it be that we
    suffer a bit because we have too much of the latter and too little of the
    former?
</p>
<p>
    I am also asked to express Shoghi Effendi’s deep appreciation of your kind
    sentiments and of your husband’s and your own burning desire to devote your
    hearts and thoughts to the progress of the Cause.
</p>
<p>
    With warm regards and greetings to you both.

    You cannot imagine the great pleasure it gives me to acknowledge the
    receipt of your letter to Shoghi Effendi dated October l8th, 1929. It
    reminds me of those meetings I attended in Montreal and of the wonderful
    friendships I cultivated among its Bahá’í group.
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi wants me to assure you of his prayers for he has great hopes
    in those young persons who do not let their worldly desires and needs stand
    in their way in serving the movement and spreading its teachings. He hopes
    that in due time your numbers will increase and you will count among your
    group youthful souls who are determined to work for the inauguration of the
    era of peace and goodwill.
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi hopes that you will not merely interest the young people
    that come to your meetings, but that you will also exert your efforts in
    awakening them to the full import and station of Bahá’u’lláh, for it is
    only by coming in touch with the source of light and inspiration that a
    soul can appreciate the full significance of the Cause. The task is surely
    harder but the fruits will be so much greater.

    Shoghi Effendi gave me your letter of December 20th, 1931, sent through the
    kindness of Mr. Dewing, to read. First let me say that Shoghi Effendi would
    like me to extend to you his loving greetings and assure you of his

    your work as well as in your services to the Cause.
</p>
<p>
    Concerning the Tablet of the Master explaining one of the doctrines of
    Sufism, which He revealed during His youth at the demand of Ali Shawka
    Pasha: this is published in the second volume of His Tablets published in
    Egypt. Unfortunately it has not been translated into English. It is an
    epistle of about fifty pages, otherwise I would have attempted to translate
    it for you. It is not however very important from a Bahá’í point of view
    for He says at the end that His object was merely to state the Sufi view
    and not to criticize it in the light of the Bahá’í teachings. Moreover, the
    task would be very difficult for I am unfamiliar with the terminology used.
    It needs a scholar on Sufism to render the Tablet into English.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Dewing is now with us in Haifa. He has given us very encouraging news
    about the progress of the movement in Montreal, especially in the work that
    the young people are doing. I sincerely hope your daughter ... is taking an
    active part, for I am sure she could do much. Please give her my love and

    Dear Mr. ...:
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated
    March 11th, 1932 as well as the enclosed copy of the report of the activity
of the Bahá’í young people in Montreal. He is sure that Mr. Horace Holley    <a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[†††††]</a> will find in it
    many interesting facts to incorporate in his review of the progress of the
    Faith during the last two years.
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi was very glad to read it and obtain first hand information
    as to the way the young people in Montreal have succeeded to attract many
    souls and inspire them with the spirit of service to our beloved Faith.
    Once the youth learns that this Cause is their Cause, and that through it
    they can ensure their future social tranquillity and spiritual progress,
    then they will arise and consecrate their life to the promotion of this
    Faith. And as you clearly state in your report, no one can awaken the youth
    of the world to a consciousness of this road to salvation except from their
    own numbers—youths already inspired with the Bahá’í spirit.
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi will remember you and the other members of your group in his
    prayers, and ask for you all divine guidance and help in this all-important
    task.

    Yours ever sincerely,

    services to His Cause. I will pray that each one of you may be graciously
    assisted to become a living embodiment of the ennobling principles
    inculcated by the Message of Bahá’u’lláh.

    dated March 21st, 1932. He trusts that, with the aid and blessings of the
    Master, you will succeed to realize your hopes and create a great impetus
    among the friends that will ultimately lead towards the completion of that
    noble and beautiful edifice. It is only through such a general sacrifice
    that we can bring that task to a successful completion.
</p>
<p>
    Consider what a wonderful prestige we will create for the Cause in the eyes
    of the public! At a time when stupendous undertakings are being given up
    for lack of funds, when all the human institutions are crumbling down and
    failing to inspire hope in their followers, the world will see our Temple
    completed, not through the donations of wealthy people, but through the
    sacrifices of humble souls who have the love of God burning in their
    hearts.
</p>
<p>
    In Persia the Cause was established through the blood of the martyrs shed
    in its path; in the West it seems it shall prosper as the result of
    constant sacrifice on the part of its handful of followers. It is only by
    dedicating our life to the Cause of teaching and our means to establish its
    Institutions that the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh will conquer the West.
</p>
<p>
    In his moments of prayer at the blessed Shrines Shoghi Effendi will think
    of you and ask God to guide and assist you. The spirit of the Master, he
    trusts, will enable you to advance the cause of peace and good-will in that
    city and at the same time make you set an example of service for all the
    friends in that continent.
</p>
<p>
    With best wishes and loving greetings,
</p>

    Dearly-beloved co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    I was greatly touched by your message and wish to assure you in person of
    my deepest appreciation of your collective and untiring efforts for the
    spread of our beloved Cause. The Bahá’ís of Montreal are often in my
    thoughts and occupy a warm and abiding place in my heart. They are the
    object of my continued prayers at the Holy Shrines, and constitute the
    vanguard of that spiritual host which will, in the fullness of time,
    achieve signal victories for the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in that promising
    country. May they, by their high, their self-sacrificing endeavours, be
    enabled to contribute a notable share to the heroic efforts which the
    American believers are now exerting for the completion of the
    Mashriqu’l-Adhkár,
</p>
<p>
    Your true brother,

<p>
    To individual believers
</p>
<p>
    Beloved Friends in the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh,
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi was deeply touched by your letter of July 18th, 1932 and he
    has charged me to thank you on his behalf and express his lively
    appreciation of your heartfelt sympathy at the great loss which the Faith
    has come to suffer through the sudden passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf.
</p>
<p>
    Your beautiful words, which eloquently testified to your genuine love for
    our departed Khánum, have immensely relieved the burden of sorrow that
    weighs so heavily upon our Guardian’s heart and have given him the
    assurance that the friends are amply sharing his grief at this cruel hour.
    For in this great calamity his share is, perhaps, the greatest as he had
    found in the Greatest Holy Leaf the only one who could sustain his energies
    and inspire him with hope and vigour. Her departure, at this critical hour,
    will, undoubtedly, continue to be deeply felt for many long years.
</p>
<p>
    The removal of her physical presence from our midst, however, though a
    source of immeasurable sorrow, will ultimately serve to rekindle the flame
    of faith in our hearts and inspire us with a fresh resolve to promote and
    safeguard the very best interests of the Cause. Through intense sufferings
    and hardships this Faith of God has been able to win its immortal victories
    and it has always welcomed such moments of profound and well-nigh
    demoralizing sorrow as providential means whereby its vitality can be best
    safeguarded.
</p>
<p>
    Might not this calamity serve to intensify our devotion to the Cause and by
    deepening our spiritual insight make us worthy instruments for the
    promotion and the consolidation of the Faith?
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian is anxiously waiting to see the friends once more united and
    whole-heartedly striving to spread those teachings and principles through
    which an ailing humanity can alone find the real path to salvation.

</p>
<p>
    Beloved co-workers in the Faith,
</p>
<p>
    It was with a great satisfaction and joy that Shoghi Effendi received your
    message of condolence dated August 5th, 1932 written through Mr. E.
    Harrison, your secretary. He was greatly pleased to see how faithfully the
    friends are sharing his grief. His sole comfort now is to see you all as
    ever devotedly working for the realization of our departed Khánum’s dearest
    wishes. Surely, from the Realm Beyond she is watching over us all and is
    continuously sending us her blessings. May we prove worthy of such manifold
    bounties.
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi hopes that this overwhelming grief caused by the unexpected
    ascension of the Greatest Holy Leaf will serve to release forces of such
    vigour as would tend to speed up and consolidate the work so gloriously
    undertaken by our American friends.

    The messages of sympathy, sent by an Assembly which has distinguished
    itself by its eminent services to the Cause, has brought solace and
    strength to my heart and eased the burden of my sorrow. I value the
    sentiments you expressed, and the assurances you gave me. I will continue
    to pray for you from the depths of my heart. Persevere, and never allow the
    sense of your grievous loss to damp your zeal or to influence your
    determination to prosecute the task to which you are committed. I will pray
    that you may be enabled to perpetuate the glorious memory of our beloved
    Greatest Holy leaf, and to diffuse, far and wide, the knowledge of her
    inspiring life.

</h3>
<p>
    21 October 1932
</p>
<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Mr. ...:
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated
    September 12th, 1932. He was very glad to know that the teaching work was
    progressing fairly rapidly and that there is all reason to hope that good
    results will be obtained. In his moments of prayer at the Shrines he will
    think of you as well as of the other members of the committee and ask for
    you all divine guidance and confirmation in the very important work you are
    directing.
</p>
<p>
    As regards the meaning of the Bahá’í Covenant: The Guardian considers the
    existence of two forms of Covenant both of which are explicitly mentioned
    in the literature of the Cause. First is the covenant that every prophet
    makes with humanity or more definitely with His people that they will
    accept and follow the coming Manifestation Who will be the reappearance of
    His reality. The second form of covenant is such as the one Bahá’u’lláh
    made with His people that they should accept the Master. This is merely to
    establish and strengthen the succession of the series of Lights that appear
    after every Manifestation. Under the same category falls the covenant the
    Master has made with the Bahá’ís that they should accept His administration
    after Him.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian has on various occasions made it clear that the friends should
    abstain from voting for any political posts unless this abstinence would be
    considered as civil disobedience and punishable by law which I believe does
    not exist anywhere.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
</p>
<p>
    To divide the inheritance as it is prescribed by Bahá’u’lláh we have to
    divide it into 2520 shares. But we can also divide it into forty-two shares
    (not forty as you mention in your letter). Then every one of the
    beneficiaries will take so many of these shares. These numbers form like a
    highest denominator for the different fractions which represent the shares
    of the different individuals that will benefit in case of intestacy. In
    case of the non-existence of one class of inheritors the Aqdas mentions how
    it should be divided. As a general rule a part goes to the House of
    Justice, a part to the children.
</p>
<p>
    As to your fourth question, Shoghi Effendi believes that it is preferable
    not to confuse the methods explained by the Master with present systems.
    They may have many resemblances but also many points of difference.
    Moreover these general statements we have in the teachings have to be
    explained and applied by the House of Justice before we can really
    appreciate their significance.
</p>
<p>
    Assuring you of Shoghi Effendi’s prayers and best wishes I remain,
</p>
<p>
    Yours ever sincerely,

    Dear ...:
</p>
<p>
    If Shoghi Effendi knew the address of the place where you order his
    stationery for him he would surely not give you that trouble. But
    unfortunately he does not, and knows what a pleasure it gives you to render
    him this added service.
</p>
<p>
    He will, therefore, be very thankful if you order for him two thousand
    papers and two thousand envelopes of each of the two specimens I enclose
    for you—that is two thousand of the white sheets with the red engraving of
    the Greatest Name, and two thousand of the creamy colour paper with the
    blue engraving. Please remember that the envelope of the white sheets only
    have the Greatest Name on the back, while the other kind of envelope is
    ordinary and without the Greatest Name.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian sincerely hopes that the Convention now sitting will
    inaugurate a new era in the history of the Cause in America and that
    momentous decisions will be taken. His thoughts are all with you and he
    wishes you success from the bottom of his heart.

    constantly rendering to the Faith, I remain,

    The Guardian has directed me to acknowledge on his behalf the receipt of

    In regard to Mr. ... , Shoghi Effendi is deeply grieved to learn that his

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friend,
</p>
<p>
    I am directed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge on his behalf the
    receipt of your deeply-appreciated letter dated May 22nd, together with the
    enclosed report written by you on this year’s Annual Convention which he
    has specially enjoyed reading, and for which he wishes me to convey to you
    his deepest thanks. Your report is, indeed, quite comprehensive and highly
    illuminating, and must have been surely read with profoundest interest and
    appreciation by those who have not had the privilege of attending the
    sessions of the Convention. You have, therefore, rendered a real and most
    valuable service to them in this connection.
</p>
<p>
    With regard to your suggestion relative to the translation of Bahá’í
    literature from Arabic into English by orientalists, Shoghi Effendi does
    not think it advisable the friends should take such a step at present. He
    feels that the matter of translations, particularly when it involves the
    rendering of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and the Master, is such a
    difficult and highly responsible task that only believers who are deeply
    versed in Arabic and English, and who are also thoroughly familiar with the
    Writings, can possibly undertake it.

<p>
    Dear Mr. Spendlove,
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian is in receipt of your welcome message of the 19th November
    with enclosures, and is indeed pleased to learn that you have joined the
    staff of the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology in Toronto. For although
    he had suggested to you at the beginning to return to England, provided it
    would be financially possible, he now feels that your stay in such a town
    as Toronto where there is as yet no well-established group of believers can
    be equally fruitful and of high value to the promotion of the teaching
    work. Do not feel worried, therefore, if circumstances did not prove to be
    favourable to your return to England. In Canada there are still so many
    places to which the Message has not yet been carried. It is perhaps as
    virgin a soil as many parts of Great Britain. The essential for you now is
    to make every effort in order to increase the number of confirmed souls in
    Toronto and thus pave the way for the formation of an Assembly in that
    centre.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian is pleased that your labours in this connection will not be
    unaided, but will be reinforced through the close and continued
collaboration of Messrs. William Suter    <a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="">[†††††††]</a> and Gerrard
    Sluter,<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> the only
    active believers besides you in Toronto. It is his fervent hope that your
    united endeavours will greatly stimulate the promotion of the teaching work
    in that centre. May Bahá’u’lláh send down upon you His confirmations, and
    assist you in the attainment of this supreme objective.
</p>

    by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá regarding the future of the Cause in that land may be
    speedily and completely realized.

    Dear Bahá’í Brother,

<p>
    The Guardian wishes me to thank you for your welcome letter dated June 9th
    informing him of your plan to visit Europe in the next fall and requesting
    his permission to also visit Haifa. He would be indeed delighted to meet
    you in the Holy Land, and cherishes the hope that your pilgrimage to the
    Holy Shrines will fill you with renewed energy and a stronger determination
    than ever to serve and promote the interests of the Faith in your country.

<p>
    Dear Miss ... ,
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian has been most pleased to receive your message of the 23rd
    January last informing him of your absolute acceptance of the Bahá’í Cause,
    and pledging yourself to devote all your time and energies to its service.
</p>
<p>
    He rejoices to know that through the devoted and valuable efforts of dear
    Mrs. Ives<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">[********]</a> a group
    of thirteen believers has been formed in Moncton, and he cherishes the hope
    that this truly splendid start that has been made will be followed up by
    careful and well-planned teaching activity. He would urge you and each one
    of your fellow-believers to gird the loins of endeavour in this path, and
    to exert yourselves day and night until this supreme task is accomplished.
</p>
<p>
    He will specially pray on your behalf at the Holy Shrines, that you may
    meet with increasing success in your activities for the spread of the Faith
    in Moncton and in the adjoining centres, and that your highest hopes of
    serving the Cause may be thus fulfilled.

</p>
<p>
    Dear Miss ...,
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi was indeed pleased to receive your letter of the ninth
    instant, and has read its contents with attention and deep interest.
</p>
<p>
    He was particularly rejoiced to know of the experiences you have passed
    through, and to realize that they all have served to draw you nearer to the
    Bahá’í Cause. He cherishes the hope that the spiritual forces latent in
    your heart will continue gaining in intensity and will lead you eventually
    to fully recognize and wholeheartedly embrace the Message of the New Day.
</p>
<p>
    Now that you have opened your heart to the light of Divine Truth, and have
    not resisted the flow of Divine grace into it, you should consider it your
    duty to also endeavour consciously and persistently to investigate the
    Teachings, so that your mind also may comprehend them. Personal effort is
    indeed a vital prerequisite to the recognition and acceptance of the Cause
    of God. No matter how strong the measure of Divine grace, unless
    supplemented by personal, sustained and intelligent effort it cannot become
    fully effective and be of any real and abiding advantage.
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi hopes therefore that you will continue in your efforts to
    study the Bahá’í Teachings, and trusts that through such deep and
    concentrated study you will become increasingly penetrated with their
    spirit, and will be led to eventually embrace the Faith.

<p>
    Dear Mr. ...,
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian was indeed pleased to receive your letter of the 25th
    February, and to know of your safe return to Montreal, and to realize that
    the impressions you had carried back from your visit to the Holy Land are
    still very vivid in your mind. He hopes as years go by your realization of
    the great privilege you have had of visiting these Holy Spots will deepen,
    and that you will be increasingly stimulated as a result to work with added
    devotion and with a clear vision of the task that lies ahead of you.
</p>
<p>
    It is now that you are back home that you can look at your visit in its
    true perspective, and appreciate its full significance. Gradually you will
    also be able to find the answer to certain questions which may still puzzle
    you. These inner struggles of the soul are indeed a necessary part of the
    spiritual development of a believer, and if faced and overcome with
    resolute will and deep faith they can be of an immense asset to his growth
    in the Cause. You need not feel perturbed therefore, but be confident that
    the outcome of the experiences you have been passing through will be to
    further strengthen and enlighten your soul, and to make it worthy of the
    love which you cherish for Bahá’u’lláh and His Faith.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian will specially remember you in his prayers at the Holy
    Shrines, asking the Beloved to continue showering upon you His richest
    blessings and His most inestimable favours.

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister,
</p>
<p>
    It is with profoundest sorrow that the Guardian has learned from your
    letter of March 29th that your mother is suffering from an acute case of
    cancer, and he wishes me to hasten to assure you of his brotherly sympathy
    in this truly grievous situation with which you are faced.
</p>
<p>
    He feels that although the physicians have found the disease too advanced,
    and pronounced her condition as hopeless, you should still endeavour, by
    means of sustained and concentrated prayer, to bring about her cure. Now
    that no material effort can be of any effectiveness you still have one more
    way open before you, namely that of prayer, and you should therefore
    continue to supplicate from all your heart that, if it be Gods Will, your
    mother may be restored to full health, and regain all her forces.
</p>
<p>
    Bahá’u’lláh has revealed special prayers for both spiritual and material
    healing, and it is therefore your bounden duty to use such prayers on
    behalf of your mother, and thus put all your trust in the all-sustaining
    and all-healing power of God. It matters not whether you are endowed with
    high spirituality or not. The essential is that you pray with sincerity and
    with full purity of heart, and with the one desire of knowing and accepting
    His Will.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian too will pray for your mother at the Holy Shrines, that she
    may be given strength, patience and faith to meet her destiny with absolute
    courage and complete fortitude.

<p>
    He has noted with deep satisfaction in your last letter that the sum which

<p>
    Beloved Bahá’í Sister,
</p>
<p>
    I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge with thanks the
    receipt of your letter dated June 17th, which you had been requested to
    address to him by the St. Lambert Assembly conveying your condolences and
    sympathy on the occasion of the ascension of the Holy Mother. He indeed
    values the feelings of profound sorrow which you have expressed at her
    passing, and will pray that the grief which has so sadly overtaken your
    hearts may be transmuted into a peaceful and abiding joy, and stimulate you
    to greater heights of service to our beloved Cause.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian wishes me to take this opportunity of extending through you to
    the newly-elected Assembly in St. Lambert the expression of his cordial
    good wishes and heartfelt congratulations upon your first local elections
    during last April—which occasion, he believes, marked an important event in
    the history of the Faith in Canada. He now hopes that through your efforts
    other centres in the vicinity will be gradually opened to the Cause, and
    that henceforth through the instrumentality of our Canadian believers, who
    though few in numbers are so aflame with the desire to serve and who have
    already rendered such eminent services in the field of teaching, that
    through them the promises of our beloved Master regarding the glorious
    future awaiting their country will be completely fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian will specially pray on behalf of you all that your Assembly
    may steadily develop, and be enabled to accomplish its allotted task under
    the Seven Year Plan, which is now being vigorously pursued and actively
    supported by all the friends throughout America.

<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother,
</p>
<p>
    Your welcome communication of the 18th December has duly reached the
    Guardian, and he is indeed rejoiced at your determination to work in the
    field of pioneer teaching. Your offer is the more welcome and appreciated
    in view of the increasing demand for pioneer activity necessitated by the
    heavy responsibilities assumed by the American believers under the teaching
    program of the Seven Year Plan. During the two years that have elapsed
    since the inauguration of this teaching campaign considerable progress has
    been achieved and exemplary self-sacrifice, determination and courage
    evinced by the believers. But the ground that still remains to be covered
    is so vast that much greater resourcefulness and consecration than have so
    far been displayed are needed on the part of every responsible Bahá’í
    individual and group if this teaching programme is to be fully carried out
    and completed at its appointed time.
</p>
<p>
    Your offer to assist in ensuring the realization of this teaching task is
    therefore most opportune, and will be received with profoundest gratitude
    by all the friends, and in particular by the National Spiritual Assembly,
    who have been repeatedly urging the believers to offer their services in
    the field of pioneer teaching.
</p>
<p>
    While the Guardian would advise you to definitely settle in one of the
    provinces of Canada where there are no resident believers, he prefers to
    leave it to your discretion as to what particular town or locality in these
    provinces you should choose to fix your permanent residence.
</p>
<p>
    In case you find such plan impracticable however he would suggest that you
    should teach instead in either one of the Republics of Central America
    where the teaching work has very little advanced so far.
</p>
<p>
    This is, of course, in case you find it financially and materially feasible
    to undertake the journey which is both long and arduous. The Guardian
    leaves the final decision to you, that you may act as you deem best under
    your present circumstances. But he will pray, in the meantime, that you may
    be guided in choosing the best and wisest plan, and be assisted in carrying
    it through with the fullest vigour and determination.
</p>
<p>
    Assuring you once more of his best thanks for your most cordial and
    inspiring message,
</p>
<p>
    Yours in His Service,

<p>
    I will assuredly and most fervently pray for you in your new field of
    service, whatever it may be, and feel certain that if you persevere the
    blessings of Bahá’u’lláh will be showered upon you. I deeply appreciate the
    spirit that so powerfully animates you, and am proud of your aims and of
    your determination. Rest assured and be happy.

    28 April 1939
</p>
<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister,
</p>
<p>
    Your welcome letter of the 17th March addressed to our beloved Guardian has
    been duly received, and it pleased him very deeply indeed to know of your
    appointment as chairman of the Temple Guide Committee, in which capacity,
    he hopes and will fervently pray, you will be able to render outstanding
    services to the Faith.
</p>
<p>
    The work which the Bahá’í guides at the Temple are called upon to undertake
    is truly difficult and delicate, and requires such combination of qualities
    as sound knowledge of the Teachings, ability, tact and wisdom for their
    adequate and effective presentation as few believers can claim to possess.
    Only those who are considered well equipped, both intellectually and
    spiritually, should be selected for this type of work, and it is the duty
    of the Temple Guide Committee to exercise the utmost care in making such
    selection.
</p>
<p>
    Those serving as Temple guides should, in all their contacts with the
    visitors, maintain the full dignity of the Cause, and provide the inquirers
    with accurate information regarding the Faith, and stress the universal
    aspects of the Teachings such as world unity, and its various implications.
    Political questions and all controversial subjects touching current
    political affairs should be strictly avoided. The conflicting political
    systems and philosophies of the day should neither be praised, nor
    censured, but the fact should be stressed that whatever the political
    regime under which it is enforced no purely national programme can be
    considered as adequate and self-sufficient. It is on the higher plane of
    international co-operation that the problems and difficulties now facing
    the world should be discussed and solved, and nothing short of the fire of
    a universal ordeal can succeed in infusing the right spirit in the hearts
    of the masses and leaders alike.
</p>
<p>
    The station of Bahá’u’lláh, and the significance of the age in which He has
    appeared, together with the supreme and infallible remedy which His
    Teachings offer to ailing humanity should be equally stressed, in a clear
    and unequivocal language.
</p>
<p>
    Those inquirers who are found to be receptive should be given more detailed
    information, and presented, on demand, with comprehensive and authoritative
    literature on the Faith.
</p>
<p>
    With regard to your activities in connection with the training and
    education of Bahá’í children: needless to tell you what a vital importance
    the Guardian attaches to such activities, on which so much of the strength,
    welfare and growth of the Community must necessarily depend. What a more
    sacred privilege, and also what a weightier responsibility than the task of
    rearing up the new generation of believers, and of inculcating into their
    youthful and receptive minds the principles and teachings of the Cause, and
    of thus preparing them to fully assume, and properly discharge the weighty
    responsibilities and obligations of their future life in the Bahá’í
    Community.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian wishes you and your dear co-workers in this field continued
    success in your highly-meritorious services, and will specially pray for
    the guidance and confirmation of your efforts. He further wishes me to
    assure you of his prayers for the realization of your hope of visiting the
    Holy Shrines, together with your dear husband.

    would eventually develop into a group of interested and confirmed
    believers, and possibly into a duly-constituted and properly-functioning
    Bahá’í Assembly in a not too distant future.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding Mr. ...: the Guardian would urge you to strive making him a firm
    believer, and to create in him the desire to dedicate himself heart and
    soul to the service of the Cause. Also with regard to your contacting the
    women’s clubs of Nova Scotia: there would be certainly no objection to your
    desire to do so, but it would be preferable that you concentrate on a
    selected few individuals who are sincere and truly receptive and to
    endeavour confirming them in the Faith. Personal contacts with limited, but
    eager and spiritually-minded persons, are often much more effective and
    fruitful than addressing large audiences. In your talks and lectures you
    should, for the present, avoid referring to labour problems, or to any
    governmental scheme regarding labour issues, as such considerations might
    lead you into the discussion of political questions which, of course, as a
    believer, you should by all means strictly avoid and disregard.
</p>
<p>
    As regards your daughter ...: the Guardian will pray for her that her
    devotion to the Cause, and her zeal to promote its knowledge may be
    deepened, and that she may gradually be inspired to take an active part in
    teaching the Faith. He would advise you not to press her unduly, but to
    carefully watch over her, so that she may gradually, of her own accord,
    arise and lend you full support in your teaching work.
</p>
<p>
    As to your wish to enter into some kind of business, so as to be
    independent financially, while continuing your teaching work: he highly
    approves of this wish you have expressed which should be indeed the ideal
    of every Bahá’í pioneer. Assuring you, in closing, of his prayers for the
    confirmation of your services, and with cordial greetings,
</p>
<p>
    Yours most sincerely,

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister,
</p>
<p>
    Our beloved Guardian has received your kind and most welcome message of the
    13th July, and noted its contents with feelings of utmost joy and
    gratitude.
</p>
<p>
    He is indeed happy to hear of your good news, and grateful that you should
    have written him in such moving and assuring tone, expressing such deep
    longing to become of increasing service to him and to the Cause.
</p>
<p>
    He profoundly appreciates these noble sentiments that so powerfully animate
    and sustain you in your Bahá’í life, and will assuredly pray to Bahá’u’lláh
    that He may, in His unfailing love and protection, bestow upon you such
    measure of guidance, and such strength of body, mind and spirit as would
    enable you to translate these high aspirations of your heart into deeds of
    loving and loyal service to His Faith.
</p>
<p>
    Do feel happy, confident, and persevere in whatever share of service it may
    be your great privilege to render the Cause at present.
</p>
<p>
    Yours most sincerely,

</p>
<p>
    To Doris Skinner<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister,
</p>
<p>
    Your delightful message of July 23rd addressed to our beloved Guardian was
    most welcome indeed, and he wishes me to hasten to thank you for it, and to
    express his satisfaction and gratitude at the admirable work you have been
    accomplishing for the Faith in Calgary during the past few months. He hopes
    that before long you will succeed in establishing an Assembly in that
    centre, and wishes you from now on to concentrate all your efforts to that
end with the help of Miss Dorothy Sheets,    <a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title="">[§§§§§§§§§]</a> whom you have
    already confirmed, this goal should not prove impossible of attainment, and
    it is to be hoped that as soon as the holiday season is over you will
    jointly endeavour to start a regular study group which will form the
    nucleus of the future Bahá’í Assembly of Calgary.
</p>
<p>
    Your desire to also assist in spreading the Cause throughout the province,
    and in the prairie cities, is indeed most commendable, and the Guardian
    would certainly urge you to persevere in carrying out your plans in this
    connection, and would also suggest that you endeavour to contact the
    Germans and Ukrainians who form the largest section of the foreign
    population of that region.
</p>
<p>
    Now regarding your questions: the Guardian has considered them carefully,
    and wishes me to answer them in the order in which they have been put.
</p>
<p>
    The question of whether capital punishment should be inflicted on the
    criminally insane is one for the Universal House of Justice to decide. Such
    people, however, not being responsible for their actions, will not suffer
    any spiritual effect from acts committed while mentally deranged....
</p>
<p>
    Regarding “mercy killings” or legalized euthanasia; this is also a matter
    which the Universal House of Justice will have to legislate upon.
</p>
<p>
    Suicide is forbidden in the Cause. God Who is the Author of all life can
    alone take it away, and dispose of it in the way He deems best. Whoever
    commits suicide endangers his soul, and will suffer spiritually as a result
    in the other Worlds Beyond.
</p>
<p>
    As regards the sterilization of the mentally deficient or the physically
    unfit; the Teachings bear no direct reference to the subject, and it
    therefore devolves on the Universal House of Justice to decide and
    legislate on this matter.
</p>
<p>
    With the assurances of the Guardian’s prayers for the confirmation of your
    services to the Cause, and also for the spiritual enlightenment and
    progress of your dear mother in the World Beyond, and with very warm
    greetings,
</p>

</p>
<p>
    To the Bahá’ís of Montreal
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian has instructed me to answer your welcome letter addressed to
    him on the occasion of the meeting of the newly elected Montreal Assembly,
    on May 12th, which he has just received.
</p>
<p>
    He will indeed pray for special blessings to be vouchsafed for your work of
    spreading the Faith in Montreal and surrounding districts throughout the
    coming year. Montreal, being as it is the mother Assembly of the Dominion
    of Canada, should receive every help and encouragement the friends can give
    it, that it may grow to be at once the first and one of the largest centres
    of the Faith in Canada.
</p>
<p>
    The marked progress the Cause has made in recent years in that country
    should be a source of pride and happiness to all the friends. The Guardian
    feels that your Assembly, with the advice and aid of the regional and the
    national Teaching Committees, should exert every effort to increase the
    number of centres in Quebec, to encourage the visits of prominent teachers,
    and to reach—difficult as the task may be—the French-speaking population of
    that Province.
</p>
<p>
    The believers of Montreal have contributed many active and outstanding
    workers in the Faith, whether teachers, pioneers or administrators; and
    Shoghi Effendi assures you all that you are very close to his heart and
    often in his prayers.
</p>
<p>
    With the assurance of his abiding love and prayers, and with warm Bahá’í
    greetings,
</p>
<p>
    Yours in His service,
</p>

</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dearly-beloved co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    I was so pleased and touched to receive your most welcome message and the
    noble assurances it contained. You are often in my thoughts and prayers, as
    I attach the utmost importance to your centre, recall the part it has
    played in the past and cherish bright hopes for its future. The great and
    distinguished services which individual members of your Assembly have
    rendered in the past, and are still rendering at present are assets that I
    greatly value. The example these have set and the work they have achieved
    are a source of profound and enduring satisfaction. May the Beloved
    sustain, guide and aid you to extend rapidly the range of your services, to
    proclaim far and wide the truths of this glorious Revelation, and lend a
    mighty impetus to its onward march.
</p>

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of September 14th has been just received, and the Guardian has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He has been very pleased over recent news of the progress of the teaching
    work in Canada, and is happy to note that you and your dear husband are
    again active in spreading the Cause there. He feels sure that your devotion
    and the added experience gained through your pioneer work in Venezuela will
    enable you both to contribute richly to the progress of the work in Canada.
</p>
<p>
    Canada must not be allowed to lag behind in the all-important work of the
    Seven Year Plan. She is a vast and promising country, and is entitled to
    her full share of spiritual enlightenment, and the Guardian hopes that you
    will give as much of your time as possible to virgin territories
    there—aiding in opening them up and establishing nuclei of future Spiritual
    Assemblies.
</p>
<p>
    He most deeply appreciated your self-sacrificing labours in South America,
    and trusts that you will win ever greater victories in service to the Faith
    you love so dearly and have so wholeheartedly dedicated yourself to.
</p>
<p>
    Rest assured that the selfless persistence with which you are serving our
    beloved Faith is deeply appreciated by Shoghi Effendi, and indeed helps to
    lighten his burden of cares and responsibility.
</p>
<p>
    He will supplicate the blessings of Bahá’u’lláh for your work, and you will
    both be remembered in his loving prayers.

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:

    Your letter of January 1st was received by the Guardian, and I have been
    instructed by him to answer you.
</p>
<p>
    He is delighted to hear of your pioneer activities, and hopes that you will
    meet with great success and be enabled to crown your part of the Seven Year
    Plan with a notable victory for that Province in the form of a Spiritual
    Assembly!
</p>
<p>
    Though it is premature to try and endeavour to foresee on what basis
    various nations would be represented on any international council, or in
    any international form of government, it is clear that from the Bahá’í
    standpoint it could only be carried out on a basis of true justice; and
    justice does not imply one race having a preponderating vote over some
    other race’s representatives, and thus being in a position to dominate
    them.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian will pray for those friends whom you have mentioned in your
    letter, as well as for you, that your work—of such great importance at this
    time—may be richly blessed by Bahá’u’lláh.

    Your letter of December 14th has just arrived, and the Guardian has

</p>
<p>
    He was most happy to hear of how enthusiastically you are serving the Faith
    in Canada, and the report of the various conferences that have been held
    was most encouraging to him.
</p>
<p>
    The Faith, at last, seems to be really becoming more widely known and
    embraced in the Dominion, and the Guardian hopes that, in spite of the
    difficulties that face you all, the Canadian friends will succeed in
    fulfilling in its entirety the teaching part of the Seven Year Plan in
    their Provinces. This is of the utmost importance, and every Canadian
    believer should make it the very centre of his conscious activities, and
    determine to see that nothing prevents him from ensuring that the Canadian
    share of glory, in the fulfilment of the Plan by the first centenary of the
    Faith, is not lost.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian was also very pleased to hear that your wife and sister have
    both recovered health and can continue their devoted services to the Cause.

    He received many flattering reports of the last year’s Ontario Summer

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of February 15th reached the Guardian yesterday, and he has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He was very happy to hear from you. He has been following your activities,
    through various reports, with deep interest, and the news of the formation
    of a Spiritual Assembly in Winnipeg this spring greatly cheered him. This
    is, indeed, a victory of major importance to the Seven Year Plan, and more
    particularly to the Faith in Canada.
</p>
<p>
    The progress which the Canadian believers, so few, relatively, in numbers,
    have been making is truly remarkable, and the Guardian hopes that this year
    they will succeed in doing twice as much as last year! This year is, he
    feels, the most important one as upon its success and failures depends the
    entire Plan’s success or failure. Of course, needless to say, the Guardian
    is not envisaging the possibility of failure at all. But the great drive
    forward towards our goal must be mainly carried on this year, as there will
    still be a great deal of consolidation work needed to round off what has
    already been accomplished.
</p>
<p>
    He is pleased to hear that you have fully recovered your health, and he
    hopes that your efforts during the coming year will be even more richly
    blessed than in the past.
</p>
<p>
    His prayers will often be offered for you, and he welcomes news of your
    activities.

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of August 16th has just reached the beloved Guardian, and he
    has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He was very happy to hear from you and he welcomes you into the world-wide
    Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, and hopes you will be able to carry its light to many
    other sincere and seeking souls like yourself.
</p>
<p>
The news you gave him of dear Mr. Schopflocher<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> and his wife    <a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> was most
welcome. He is, indeed, a very devoted Bahá’í, as is Ernest Harrison    <a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title="">[************]</a> also, and
    the Guardian is happy to know you have been able to study the teachings
    with such fine believers as these.
</p>
<p>
    He assures you that he will pray for the protection of your son, and that
    God may guide him to the Truth in this day as He has guided you to it.

</p>
<p>
    Your letter of September 17th has been received, and the Guardian has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He was sorry to hear of the serious state of health of Mrs. ... whom you
    mention as being such a fine soul, and he will certainly pray for her in
    the Holy Shrines that she may accept this great bounty from God of the
    knowledge of His Manifestation, and find happiness and comfort in it.
</p>
<p>
    He deeply appreciates all you and your husband are doing in the service of
    the Faith at this critical period in the world’s history, and he hopes you
    will both redouble your efforts, and stimulate the other dear Canadian
    friends to do likewise, so that the teaching work in Canada may fulfil all
    its objectives under the Seven Year Plan.
</p>
<p>
    The work already achieved is something to be proud of, and he feels
    confident the friends can, through united effort, win through to a glorious

<p>
    Your warm letter was received, and, although the Guardian answered your
    first letter to him, it seems to have gotten lost. This last letter of
    yours, dated December 28th, and which I am answering on his behalf, only
    arrived two days ago. He hopes this time his reply will reach you safely.
</p>
<p>
    He is happy to hear of your great devotion to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh and
    how clearly you have grasped the fundamental truth that all the Prophets
    are from One Essence and one in spirit. This is one of the greatest
    blessings the Faith has to offer to people—the knowledge of the unity of
    all religions.
</p>
<p>
    He will certainly pray that God may watch over your sons and bring them

    say, all are not yet ready for it, and though they need it their eyes are

</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian is very busy these days with all his worldwide

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian has instructed me to answer your letter dated November 11th.
</p>
<p>
    He feels that, since the National Spiritual Assembly has requested you to
    remain away from the Bahá’í meetings for a period of a year, you should
    obey them implicitly. This does not mean spiritual death, nor that you are
    not a believer in the Faith.
</p>
<p>
    He does not wish you to be sad, but rather to prepare yourself to take your
    place again in the Bahá’í Community, and work with all the friends in a
    spirit of love and harmony. Every stumbling-block in this world can be made
    a stepping-stone to progress and development.

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of February 20th, enclosing that of your husband, has been
    received, and the Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He hastens to assure you that he will supplicate in the Shrines for that
    spiritual insight to be given to your husband which he is seeking with so
    much humility and sincerity.
</p>
<p>
    The Mormons are a people with high principles and ideals, and the step
    spiritually into the Cause is not as difficult for them as for many others
    not possessing their faith and devotion. However, the very zeal with which
    they serve their own Faith makes it difficult for them to grasp the greater
    vision of our Holy Cause. He hopes that Mr. ..., so obviously a devout
    Christian, will, through studying the Bahá’í teachings on Christ and the
    prophecies in the Bible concerning His Second Coming, and through a study
    of the life and spirit of Bahá’u’lláh, come to see that Christ, far from
    being lost to Bahá’ís, is enthroned in their hearts more deeply than ever
    through recognizing Him in this new Manifestation.
</p>
<p>
    He deeply appreciates the tireless devotion with which you are serving the
    Cause, and he will pray that your heart’s desires may be realized and your
    husband feel moved, of his own free will, to join you in its service.

    6 July 1944
</p>
<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of June 6th has been received, and the Guardian has instructed
    me to answer it on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding your questions concerning the advisability of changing the basis
    of the National Assembly’s election and confining it to the body of
    delegates or of limiting the term of office: He feels that as any such
    changes are of a radical nature and should therefore also apply to the
    National Spiritual Assemblies of other countries they are inadvisable and
    premature, both for this reason and because of their very nature.
</p>
<p>
    What is needed is to get the Administration in its present form to run more
    efficiently and at the same time to build up a higher sense of
    responsibility among the body of the believers. They should be encouraged
    to think more, not only about the qualifications of members of their
    elected bodies, but also about such things as you mention, the law of
    averages, the age and indisposition of some of the members, etc.
</p>
<p>
    When we look back and see what the Administration has accomplished in
    twenty-odd years, indeed what it has done in the last seven years, we see
    what strides forward have been made. Far greater tasks lie ahead; but the
    Guardian does not feel that the way to meet them is to change the present
    system but rather to perfect it by educating the believers and training
    them, holding more conferences, publishing more news for Bahá’ís, getting
    more people active.
</p>
<p>
    He wants you to know that he deeply values your and your dear wife’s
    tireless and devoted services to our beloved Cause, and he will continue to
    pray for you both.

</p>
<p>
    The graphic and to-the-point description you have given him of the

<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter dated September 8th was most welcome, and the beloved Guardian
    assures you he would have answered you sooner only he has been so very busy
    this past year.
</p>
<p>
    He followed your and your dear husband’s South American tour with great
    interest, and was delighted at the number of centres you were able to
    visit; your trip will surely produce good results in the teaching field,
    and stimulate the pioneers and local believers to redouble their efforts.
</p>
<p>
    You should never feel discouraged, for your devoted and ceaseless services
    are much appreciated, and have been of great help to the work in many
    places.
</p>
<p>
    Now that Canada is so soon to have its own National Assembly, he urges you
    and your dear husband to concentrate your efforts on strengthening and
    multiplying the Canadian Assemblies. This is of the utmost importance, as a
    preparation for this historic step so soon to take place.
</p>
<p>
    Assuring you of his loving prayers on your behalf and for the success of
    your labours,
</p>
<p>
    Yours with warm Bahá’í love,

    Assuring you of my heartfelt appreciation of your splendid services to our
    beloved Faith, and of my loving and ardent prayers that you and your dear
    husband may be enabled to enrich the record of your notable services, and
    to fulfil every desire you cherish for the promotion of the Cause and its
    institutions,

</p>
<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter (with copies of others enclosed) dated October 18th, has been
    received, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his
    behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He fully realizes what a great shock you have sustained through the death
    of this son over whom your heart had yearned for so many years, especially
    under such tragic circumstances, and he assures you of his deep sympathy
    and his loving prayers for the progress and happiness of ... ’s soul....
</p>
<p>
    Surely the way you can now be of the greatest help to your son’s soul is to
    serve the Cause and promote its interests. The Master has often pointed out
    that deeds we do for, or contributions we make to, the Cause of God in the
    name of a departed person, aid that person’s soul in the World Beyond. This
    is one of the mercies of God!
</p>
<p>
    Before you and your dear mother-in-law make any definite plans for a Bahá’í
    summer school, he feels you should consult the Assembly. In this way you
    will be guided to do that which is best for the beloved Faith, and will be
    able to find a way of serving it in the memory of your son.
</p>
<p>
    He hopes you will be able to not only help guide many young people and
    children into the Cause, but also to assist the parents to both embrace the
    Message and, through its teachings, bring their children up in the spirit
    of the New Day.
</p>
<p>
    He assures you and Mr. ... of his loving prayers for you both, for the
    success of your Bahá’í work, and, especially, for ... ’s soul in the World
    Beyond.
</p>
<p>
    With warm Bahá’í love,

    fulfil your heart’s desire in its service,

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letters dated October 16th and December 19th, with enclosures, were
    both received, and our beloved Guardian regrets very much the unavoidable
    delay in answering you, caused by pressure of certain urgent matters that
    arose.
</p>
<p>
    He feels that there must have been some misapprehension on your part of his
    statements regarding future Guardians: they cannot “abrogate” the
    interpretations of former Guardians, as this would imply not only lack of
    guidance but mistakes in making them; however they can elaborate and
    elucidate former interpretations, and can certainly abrogate some former
    ruling laid down as a temporary necessity by a former Guardian.
</p>
<p>
    You asked his views about your statement on the Bahá’í Faith and Communism:
    frankly he feels that the less the friends discuss Communism, and the Faith
    in connection with it, the better these days, as the subject is a burning
    issue, and no matter how discreet we are we run the risk of being involved
    in this highly political issue.
</p>
<p>
    He wishes you to know that he very deeply appreciates the innumerable
    services you and your dear wife render the Faith. Reports of your South
    American work have reached him, as well as your own report of your fifth
    western trip, and he is delighted to see the response you are getting from
the public. Your book    <a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> has,
    likewise, been a very useful addition to the teaching literature of the
    Faith in English, and you must rejoice to see the way God is blessing your
    labours for His Cause.
</p>
<p>
    Tremendous work still remains to be done in Canada before the approaching
    election of its first National Spiritual Assembly; he hopes you and Mrs.
    Sala will devote as much of your time to this field as you can.
</p>
<p>
    Assuring you of his loving prayers on your behalf, and for the success of
    your services.

    learned of your joint gift of a property to the Cause in Canada for a

    a fine institution in the future!

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of January 15th was received, and our beloved Guardian was very
    happy to hear from you. He has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    The desire you have to return to Finland and teach your sisters and other
    people this wonderful Message meets with his full approval, and he hopes
    you will make every effort to do so. This would be rendering your native
    land a great spiritual service of historic importance.
</p>
<p>
    Finland is so far away, and so few of the Bahá’ís have been able to visit
    it or to speak its language, that it has been very difficult until now to
    teach there. What is needed are believers like yourself and Miss ..., who
    speak the language and who have the longing to teach the Finnish people.
</p>
<p>
    He will certainly pray that the way may open for you to return to Finland
    and establish the Cause there on a firm basis.

<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter dated March 10th has been received, and our beloved Guardian
    has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He quite understands how you feel, and you must have been shocked to find
    something in the teachings you love so dearly which savoured of church
    fines! But he assures you this is due to a misapprehension caused by a very
    bad translation of the Aqdas.
</p>
<p>
    The fines specified by Bahá’u’lláh are very much the same in principle as
    those applied by common law as a punishment for breaking the law. No one
    can possibly associate these necessary checks on law-breaking with a church
    fine of any sort.
</p>
<p>
    If you study the Bahá’í teachings deeply you will see that the laws of the
    Aqdas, as they will be applied in future, are really the protective
    framework of the New World Order, and have nothing to do with the
    ecclesiastical practices of the past.
</p>
<p>
    He will pray that you may become an able and gifted teacher and promoter of
    our beloved Faith.

</p>
<p>
    He is very happy to learn of your determination to enter the field of
    pioneer service, certainly the most thrilling and one of the worthiest
    branches of Bahá’í service!
</p>
<p>
    As to your question regarding the Fast: if there is any doubt in the mind
    of a person as to whether it will really be bad for that person’s health to
    keep it, the best doctor’s advice should be obtained. But generally
    speaking most people can keep it, anywhere in the world, with no detriment
    to their health. It is very good for the health and, once one forms the
    habit, each year it becomes easier to keep, unless one is run down. No one
    is obliged to keep it if it really harms them.

</p>
<p>
    There is a great deal of interesting historic data preserved in old
    photographs of the Cause, and it would certainly be useful to use some of
    these in the manner you have in mind. Unfortunately at the present time it
    is not possible here to go through stored material, have copies made and

    20 April 1947
</p>
<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter dated February 7th was received and our beloved Guardian has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Since you have turned to him for advice he will give it to you quite
    frankly: he feels that, now that Canada is so soon to have her own National
    Spiritual Assembly, you should remain in the Dominion and serve there.
    There are so few Canadian Bahá’ís, relatively speaking, and they are
    scattered over such a vast territory, that to lose such an active worker as
    yourself would constitute a weakening of their forces. Where you serve he
    feels is up to you to decide; no doubt in Eastern Canada the need for help
    is greatest, but you should make your own choice.
</p>
<p>
    It is very difficult to know what choices to make in life, and they are
    always conditioned by our own state of spiritual advancement; what would
    constitute an impossible sacrifice for one soul would seem to another a
    very small step to take!
</p>
<p>
    There is certainly no reason why you should not go through life with a
    companion; Bahá’u’lláh strongly upholds the institution of marriage, and it
    need not hinder the service of an active Bahá’í if he married the right
    person. He assures you he deeply values your devotion and loyalty to the
    Faith and your readiness to put all personal desires aside in order to
    serve it. You may be sure his most loving prayers will be offered for your
    guidance, success and your happiness.

    Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated September 28th has been

</p>
<p>
    He feels, in regard to the question you asked him, that under no
    circumstances should such a subject be discussed in the presence of
    non-Bahá’ís, as it might give them the impression we are fanatics. In
    teaching people, when they begin to seriously study the Faith, there is no
    objection to impressing upon them that this Message involves great
    spiritual responsibility, and should not be either accepted or cast aside
    lightly. But we must be very gentle, tactful and patient, and not
    administer shocks to people.
</p>
<p>
    Bahá’u’lláh teaches that the Mercy of God exceeds His Justice. Ultimately
    there is hope for every soul of progress and forgiveness. But at the same
    time to turn aside from this Cause, once we have really contacted its
    spirit, is a grave error and one not to be minimized. But although we
    Bahá’ís know this, we cannot thrust such a statement on non-Bahá’ís. We
    must always teach constructively, and be very sure that none of us, through
    disagreement among ourselves or indiscretion, cool off the souls of the
    seekers.
</p>
<p>
    He assures you all of his loving prayers for the advancement of the Cause
    in Hamilton.

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated November 27th, has been
    received, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the questions you asked: self has really two meanings, or is used
    in two senses, in the Bahá’í writings; one is self, the identity of the
    individual created by God. This is the self mentioned in such passages as
    “he hath known God who hath known himself”, etc. The other self is the ego,
    the dark, animalistic heritage each one of us has, the lower nature that
    can develop into a monster of selfishness, brutality, lust and so on. It is
    this self we must struggle against, or this side of our natures, in order
    to strengthen and free the spirit within us and help it to attain
    perfection.
</p>
<p>
    Self-sacrifice means to subordinate this lower nature and its desires to
    the more godly and noble side of our selves. Ultimately, in its highest
    sense, self-sacrifice means to give our will and our all to God to do with
    as He pleases. Then He purifies and glorifies our true self until it
    becomes a shining and wonderful reality.
</p>
<p>
    He assures you of his loving prayers for the success of your Bahá’í
    services.
</p>
<p>
    With warmest greetings,
</p>
<p>

<p>
Dear Bahá’í Sister:    <a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title="">[***************]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated October 6th, has been received,
    and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the matter of the young men you have raised in your letter: he
    feels that they should be treated like any other people seeking admittance
    to the Faith, and be accepted on the same basis. Our teachings, as outlined
    in the Advent of Divine Justice, on the subject of living a chaste life,
    should be emphasized to them just as every other applicant, but certainly
    no ruling whatsoever should be laid down in this matter. The Bahá’ís have
    certainly not yet reached that stage of moral perfection where they are in
    a position to too harshly scrutinize the private lives of other souls, and
    each individual should be accepted on the basis of his faith, and sincere
    willingness to try to live up to the Divine Standards; further than this we
    cannot go at present....
</p>
<p>
    Now that your Assembly is formed, and is embarking on its independent
    existence as a National Body, he wishes to emphasize a point which he is
    constantly stressing to other National Bodies: you must avoid issuing rules
    and regulations. The fundamentals laid down in the Bahá’í Administration
    must, of course, be adhered to, but there is a tendency for Assemblies to
    constantly issue detailed procedures and rules to the friends, and he
    considers this hampers the work of the Cause, and is entirely premature. As
    far as is possible cases which come up should be dealt with and settled as
    they arise, and not a blanket ruling be laid down to cover all possible
    similar cases. This preserves the elasticity of the Administrative Order
    and prevents red tape from developing and hampering the work of the Cause.
    You must likewise bear in mind that you are now a wholly independent
    National Body, and must consider the administration of the affairs of the
    Faith within your jurisdiction as your separate problem. There is no more
    need for you to follow every single rule laid down by the American National
    Spiritual Assembly, than there is for the British or the Australian and New
    Zealand National Spiritual Assemblies to do this. Uniformity in
    fundamentals is essential, but not in every detail. On the contrary,
    diversity, the solving of the local situation in the right way, is
    important.
</p>
<p>
    He will be very happy to receive reports of the measures you are taking to
    carry out your important Five Year Plan. You have the unique distinction of
    being the first National Body, yet formed, to be born with a Plan in its
    mouth! And you may be sure your fellow Bahá’ís, East and West, are watching
    your progress with keen interest, not unmixed with curiosity, to see how
    well you fare in your historic work and your newly created independence.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian has high hopes for the achievements of the Canadian Bahá’ís.
    Their national character, which so fortuitously combines the
    progressiveness and initiative of the Americans, and the stability and
    tenacity of the British, fits them to make great contributions to the
    progress of the Faith, both in Canada and throughout the world.
</p>
<p>
    He urges you to keep in close touch with him, and assures you that you, and
    your labours, are very dear to his heart, and he is ardently praying for
    your success in every field of your manifold activities.
</p>
<p>
    With warm Bahá’í love,
</p>
<p>
    R. Rabbani
</p>
<p>
    P.S. Unfortunately your letter was not received in time to cable your
    October 14th meeting an answer.
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    I hail with a joyous heart and confident spirit the truly compelling and
    almost simultaneous evidences of the creative, the irresistible power of
    the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh as witnessed by the formation of the first
    Canadian National Bahá’í Assembly and the inauguration of the Five Year
    Plan, designed to orient its members toward and canalize the energies of
    the entire Canadian Bahá’í Community in support of the immediate tasks
    lying before them. So auspicious a beginning, in the life of a community
    attaining adulthood, under the influence of the processes set in motion as
    the result of the progressive unfoldment of the Divine Plan, in a territory
    of such vast dimensions, blessed through both the mighty utterances, and
    the personal visit of the One Who fostered it from the hour of its birth,
    and Whose Plan enabled it to reach maturity, may well be regarded as one of
    the most momentous happenings immortalizing the opening years of the second
    Bahá’í Century.
</p>
<p>
    The responsibility shouldered by an institution ranking as one of the
    sustaining pillars of the future Universal House of Justice is indeed
    staggering. The Plan entrusted to its infant hands is, in both its
    magnitude and implications tremendously vast. The anxieties, the strenuous
    exertions attendant upon the proper guidance, the effectual development and
    the sound consolidation of a community emerging into independent national
    existence, are inevitably trying. The numerical strength of that community,
    the immensity of the area serving as the field for the operation of its
    Plan, the meagerness of the resources now at its disposal, the relative
    inexperience of its newly-recruited members, the perils overhanging the
    territory in which they reside in the event of a future global conflict,
    the intensity of opposition which the unfoldment of its mission may provoke
    in the strongholds of religious orthodoxy inimical to the liberalizing
    influences of the Faith it represents—all these offer a challenge at once
    severe, inescapable and soul uplifting.
</p>
<p>
    The eyes of its twin-sister community in the North American continent,
    which assisted it in achieving its independence, are fixed upon it, eager
    to beho1d, and ready to aid it in its march to glory. Its sister
    communities in Latin America, whose coming of age is as yet unattained,
    watch with mingled curiosity and envy, its first strides along the steep
    path which they themselves are soon to tread. Other sister communities in
    the European, African, Asiatic and Australian continents, some of venerable
    age, others rich in experience, and resources, still others tried and
    tested by the fires of persecution, observe with keen anticipation in their
    hearts and benediction on their lips, the manner in which this youngest
    recruit to their ranks will launch upon its career, the resolution with
    which it will face its problems, the spirit which will animate it in its
    battles and the stupendousness of the efforts required to win its
    victories. Above and beyond them the Spirit of a Master Who nursed it in
    its infancy and to Whose Plan it now has consecrated its mature energies,
    overshadows it with that self-same solicitude that called it into
    existence, that stimulated His tender care in its infancy, that inspired
    His written promises, that prompted His lavish praise, that impelled Him to
    cast the radiance of His person, in the evening of His life, on its mother
    city,<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title="">[†††††††††††††††]</a> and
    induced Him, ere His passing, to bequeath to it so rich a legacy in what
    may be regarded as one of the mightiest repositories of His last wishes. No
    one, of the galaxy of immortal heroes, now gathered to the glory of
    Bahá’u’lláh, can contemplate with greater delight the advances which this
    community has made, or intercede with greater efficacy on its behalf than
    she<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> who
    has won the peerless title of the Mother of that community, the initial
    phase of whose career was signalized by the founding of the mother
    community in the European continent, and the conclusion of which was
    crowned by a death cementing the spiritual bonds now indissolubly uniting
    the North and South American continents.
</p>
<p>
    The Five Year Plan, now set in motion, must under no circumstances be
    allowed to lag behind its schedule. A befitting start should be made in the
    execution of the Plan in all its aspects. The initial steps should be
    relentlessly followed by additional measures designed to hasten the
    incorporation of your Assembly, to accelerate the multiplication of Local
    Assemblies, groups and isolated centres, throughout the Provinces of the
    Dominion, to insure the stability of the outpost of the Faith which must be
    established in Newfoundland, and to incorporate a steadily growing element,
    representative of both the Indian and Eskimo races, into the life of the
    community.
</p>
<p>
    Obstacles, however formidable, will have to be determinedly surmounted. Any
    reverses that sooner or later may be suffered should be met with stoic
    fortitude, and speedily offset by victories in other fields. The glorious
    vision now unveiled to your eyes must never be dimmed. The illuminating
    promises enshrined in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets should not be forgotten for a
    moment. The quality of the success already achieved by so small a number,
    over so extensive a field, in so brief a period, at so precarious an hour
    in the destinies of mankind, should spur on the elected representatives of
    this now fully fledged community to achieve in as short a period, over
    still more extensive an area, and despite a severer crisis than any as yet
    encountered, victories more abiding in their merit and more conspicuous in
    their brilliance than any as yet won in the service and for the glory of
    the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.

<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your letters to our beloved Guardian, dated October 19 and December 11,
    1948 and March 30, 1949, have been received, with their enclosures, as well
    as the material you sent under separate cover....
</p>
<p>
    Your Assembly has much to be congratulated upon for your victories during
    the past Bahá’í Year have been memorable. The passing, in both Houses, of
    the Bill<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title="">[****************]</a>
    relating to the official status of your Assembly was a cause for great
    rejoicing, as this is the first time in Bahá’í history that any government
    has taken such action in relation to our Faith’s status. He would like, if
    possible, to receive duplicates of the official Gazette and all publicity
    given this matter, as the copies you sent were placed in the Mansion at
    Bahji, but he wishes to have these documents at hand in his personal files
    as well.
</p>
<p>
    The increase in membership in the Canadian Bahá’í Community this past year
    was also most encouraging. It shows that there is, primarily, unity among
    the believers, for where this fundamental quality is lacking in a Bahá’í
    community any real growth is impossible. That is why the beloved Master so
    constantly admonished the friends to be as one soul in different bodies,
    for this love and unity constitutes their spiritual health and gives them
    the strength to overcome all obstacles in their path.
</p>
<p>
    He fully realizes how great are the tasks facing your Assembly, but feels
    confident that the Canadian Bahá’ís will be able to accomplish them and
    will, indeed, set an example to their sister communities in different parts
    of the world. The people of that country, the national character, are such
    as to hold high promise for the future of the Cause there, and the great
    range covered by your Plan is stimulating in the extreme. To be the
    Trustees of such a Faith, in such a place, at such a time is a marvellous
    privilege, and he is looking forward to your next achievements with
    confidence and keen interest.
</p>
<p>
    You may be sure his loving prayers are with you in all you do for the
    beloved Faith.
</p>
<p>
    With warmest greetings,
</p>
<p>
    R. Rabbani
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    The progress achieved in the course of the opening year of the Five Year
    Plan, to which the newly emerged independent Canadian Bahá’í Community is
    solemnly committed, is such as to excite the admiration, and merit the
    gratitude, of the entire Bahá’í world. A community, so small in numbers, so
    restricted in resources, labouring over so extensive a field, shouldering
    such weighty responsibilities, has passed through the initial stage of its
    task and discharged its duties with such distinction as to be worthy of the
    glowing promises and weighty utterances recorded in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets
    regarding the material as well as the spiritual potentialities with which
    that great and promising Dominion has been endowed.
</p>
<p>
    Through the swift and marvellous increase in its membership; through its
    faithful and uncompromising adherence to both the spiritual and
    administrative principles of the Faith it so nobly serves; through the
    multiplication of its administrative centres from the Atlantic to the
    Pacific seaboard; through the steady consolidation of its local and
    national Funds designed to sustain its ever-unfolding activities; through
    the spirit consistently manifested by the small yet eager and valiant band
    of its pioneers and administrators; and more recently through the official
    recognition providentially accorded the body of its national elected
    representatives by both chambers of the Legislature in that Dominion—an act
    wholly unprecedented in the annals of the Faith in any country, in either
    East or West—this vigorous, divinely sustained, resistlessly advancing
    community, has not only fulfilled the expectations and hopes that greeted
    its birth, but set a brilliant example to its sister communities in both
    the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.
</p>
<p>
    The task which it has so splendidly inaugurated and which is being now
    prosecuted with such vigour, devotion, single-mindedness, harmony and
    determination, is still in the initial stage of its development. The
    process that has stimulated the growth and increased the number of its
    administrative centres must be accelerated no matter how great the
    sacrifice involved. The development of the local and national Funds must be
    continuously maintained as a prelude to the establishment of local and
    national endowments and the ultimate erection of a House of Worship that
    will incarnate the soul of a flourishing nation-wide community. The
    initiation of a systematic and sustained campaign beyond the frontiers of
    that Dominion, and in obedience to the Mandate of the Author of the Divine
    Plan, to which it stands inescapably pledged, and aiming at the
    introduction of the Faith in Greenland and the conversion of the Eskimos
    still remains to be undertaken. The consolidation of the summer school, the
    gradual incorporation of firmly established, properly functioning
    Assemblies are, moreover, objectives that must under no circumstances be
    overlooked or neglected.
</p>
<p>
    As the operation of the Plan gathers momentum the members of this community
    must evince a still greater measure of solidarity, rise to higher levels of
    heroism, demonstrate a greater capacity for collective achievement, and
    attract still more abundant blessings on the varied enterprises on which
    they have embarked.
</p>
<p>
    I am following the unfoldment of their Plan with eager and sustained
    interest. My ardent prayers will surround and accompany its prosecutors at
    every stage of their historic undertaking. My confidence in their ultimate
    success is not only unshaken, but bas been immensely reinforced. May He Who
    watches over them guide every step they take, bless every measure they
    adopt, remove every obstacle that impedes their onward march, and fulfil
    every desire they cherish for the future glory, honour and greatness of
    their beloved Faith in that vast and richly blessed Dominion.

<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear ...:
</p>
<p>
    Your letters to our beloved Guardian, dated April 19 and June 15, with copy
    of the By-Laws enclosed, and other material sent, have been received, and
    he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He approves of the By-Laws of the Canadian National Spiritual Assembly, and
    is immensely pleased over this remarkable witness to our Faith’s growing
    importance as evidenced through the passing of the Bill regarding them in
    both Houses at Ottawa. As he has already stated, this is a unique
    precedent, and one which in time to come will no doubt be of great
    assistance in similar cases in other countries. You must be very happy
    indeed to see the way your tireless efforts have been crowned with such
    success in this important matter.
</p>
<p>
    It is these evidences of the progress of the Cause which bring the greatest
    joy to his heart, as he is often weary, and feels the weight of the years
    of Guardianship very keenly at times. The many problems which beset the
    Faith, especially in the Eastern countries, the actions of those who have
    been disloyal to the Master, the ever-increasing amount of work, weigh upon
    him heavily. Such news therefore, you convey from Canada, lightens his
    heart.
</p>
<p>
    Dear ..., he is glad to hear you are well and constantly devoting yourself
    to serving the Cause, and hastening the fulfilment of the Five Year Plan,
    in Canada. There is much to be done, but he feels the Canadian National
    Spiritual Assembly is alert and devoted, and intent upon reaching all the
    goals set in good time. The spread of the Cause there is truly remarkable
    and promising. After all the years when the Faith seemed to barely move
    forward, it is now leaping ahead in that Dominion, which shows the
    patiently laid foundation was well laid, and the superstructure can now
    rise rapidly.
</p>
<p>
    His loving thoughts are often with you, you may be sure.

<p>
    Your recent and splendid accomplishments in connection with the
    incorporation of the Canadian National Assembly and the formulation of its
    By-laws are services of which I feel truly proud, and for which I will
    always feel grateful. You have indeed enriched the long and splendid record
    of your services to our beloved Cause. The Beloved will surely reward you
    abundantly for all that you have achieved. I will continue to remember you
    in my prayers, and will supplicate for you the Master’s richest blessings.

</p>
<p>
    He wishes you and your son every success in this new undertaking, and hopes
    it will be a place where young minds can be guided into the right path—for
    they sorely need it in an age when the parents themselves are often
    confused, and can provide no moral inspiration for their children, and no
    proper example.

    Your letter of June 28, 1949, was received, and our beloved Guardian has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    In regard to your going to Newfoundland: he feels that since someone else
    is willing and eager to proceed there, and you would lose a great deal by
    giving up your present employment, it is better for you to postpone going
    there and in the mean time try and see if the government would not be able
    to give you a job there in its service, and by which you would not forfeit
    your pension. Also, you might be able to arrange to spend your vacations
    there and thus directly help the work.
</p>
<p>
    The work you have done in Ottawa is very deeply appreciated by the
    Guardian, and he feels sure that wherever you are, you will constantly be
    supporting and expanding the work of the Faith.

</p>
<p>
    Dear Spiritual Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter dated June 13 has been received by the Guardian, and he has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf, and to thank you for the
    interesting material you forwarded with it.
</p>
<p>
    He can only offer you, sincerely, his advice, which is to overcome whatever
    obstacles are hindering you from active membership in the Bahá’í Community.
    Man-made things are one thing, and God-given things another. It is not
    spiritually healthy to recognize the Revelation of God for this age—or at
    any period in history to recognize a Revelation sent by God for our good
    and development—and not embrace it. There is no middle course open for the
    soul who has found the Eternal Beloved. He must serve Him, or he will grow
    cold and spiritually confused.
</p>
<p>
    As you obviously seem to have taken these teachings to heart he feels you
    should now become active in the service of the Cause.
</p>
<p>
    He will pray for your progress and happiness and that you may be able to
    take this next step on your spiritual journey through life.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    Your welcome letter of August 22 has been received, and our beloved
    Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He was very happy to hear the good news you conveyed in your letter,
    especially about the prospect of being able to arrange a pioneer for
    Greenland, as he attaches the greatest importance to this work, a work he
    feels which would particularly rejoice ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s heart. He hopes the
    Canadian National Spiritual Assembly will be able to follow up this
    possibility and crown it with success.
</p>
<p>
    You are welcome to write to him, but please do not feel he does not
    appreciate it if his answer is not always prompt.
</p>
<p>
    Your trip will no doubt be of great interest to the friends in Canada and
    stimulate them, when they hear of the solid accomplishments of the European
    friends, in their own labours to fulfil their Plan.

<p>
    30 September 1949
</p>
<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated August 16, reached him and he
    has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He was grieved to hear of some of the things you describe. It shows great
    spiritual immaturity on the part of some of the Bahá’ís and an astonishing
    lack of understanding and study of the teachings. To live up to our Faith’s
    moral teachings is a task far harder than to live up to those noble
    principles the Moral Re-Armament inculcates, fine and encompassing as they
    are! Every other word of Bahá’u’lláh’s and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s writings is a
    preachment on moral and ethical conduct; all else is the form, the chalice,
    into which the pure spirit must be poured, without the spirit and the
    action which must demonstrate it, it is a lifeless form.
</p>
<p>
    He judges, from what you say, that the friends have not or at least many of
    them have not, been properly taught in the beginning.
</p>
<p>
    There is certainly no objection to stressing the “four standards” of the
    Moral Re-Armament—though any teaching of our precious Faith would go much
    more deeply into these subjects and add more to them.
</p>
<p>
    When we realize that Bahá’u’lláh says adultery retards the progress of the
    soul in the afterlife—so grievous is it—and that drinking destroys the
    mind, and not to so much as approach it, we see how clear are our teachings
    on these subjects.
</p>
<p>
    You must not make the great mistake of judging our Faith by one community
    which obviously needs to study and obey the Bahá’í teachings. Human
    frailties and peculiarities can be a great test. But the only way, or
    perhaps I should say the first and best way, to remedy such situations, is
    to oneself do what is right. One soul can be the cause of the spiritual
    illumination of a continent. Now that you have seen, and remedied, a great
    fault in your own life, now that you see more clearly what is lacking in
    your own community, there is nothing to prevent you from arising and
    showing such an example, such a love and spirit of service, as to enkindle
    the hearts of your fellow Bahá’ís.
</p>
<p>
    He urges you to study deeply the teachings, teach others, study with those
    Bahá’ís who are anxious to do so, the deeper teachings of our Faith, and
    through example, effort and prayer, bring about a change.
</p>
<p>
    With Bahá’í love,
</p>
<p>
    R. Rabbani
</p>
<p>
    P.S. He feels your experience at the Temple should be regarded as in part
    an emotional reaction produced by disappointment and the fact you were
    still exalted by your happy days at the Moral Re-Armament camp. No doubt,
    if you visit the Temple under different circumstances, you will feel there
    an entirely different atmosphere—the one you expected to find, and which
    does exist.
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    May the Almighty guide, bless and sustain you, remove all obstacles from
    your path, and enable you to serve, effectively and at all times, the vital

    he has been very busy of late.
</p>
<p>
    In regard to the question you asked him: he feels that if this annuity is
    paid to you by the Government direct, as a recompense for services you
    rendered, and in return for contributions you yourself made towards
    receiving it, there is no objection to your accepting it. But, if it is
    being given to you under the apprehension you are still a member of the
    church, he feels that is not proper, as, of course, you no longer are a
    church adherent.
</p>
<p>
    He will certainly pray for the progress of the work in Regina, and he
    deeply appreciates the many devoted services you render our glorious Faith.

<p>
    Your letter of November 11 has been received by our beloved Guardian, and
    he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    If there is any such movement, such as the one your friend believes exists,
    he is not aware of it. He does not know if there is any foundation of truth
    in this matter or not.
</p>
<p>
    However, he feels that the Bahá’ís have a Plan, a solution to the world’s
    problems given by the Prophet of God for this day. Their best way of
    serving the world is through the positive and constructive medium of the
    Cause, and not though the negative approach of fear of any one group. We
    have not the power—in the material sense of that word—to do any good in
    combatting many of the evils in the world today, economic or political or
    social, but we can do a unique service through our Bahá’í work, for this
    way we release the power of God, which is the only Force that can redeem
    men and carry us forward to an ultimate victory over the evil of today. He
    therefore urges you to devote your mind to peacefully serving the Cause and
    not worry over whether such a destructive group does or does not exist.

    <a name="_Toc154078601">Letter of 23 June 1950</a>
</h3>
<p>
    23 June 1950
</p>
<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your letters dated June 21, October 3, December 20, 1949, and February 15,
    April 10, and May 14, 1950 as well as various other material, have been
    received by our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on
    his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He feels sure you will understand the reason for the delay in answering
    your letters—and, indeed, all the other National Spiritual Assemblies’
    letters—when he explains that not only has this been a terrific winter of
    work in connection with the construction of the Shrine, but since the
beginning of April my dear father, Mr. Maxwell,    <a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title="">[*****************]</a> has
    been dangerously and desperately ill. The anxiety this caused us all, and
    the constant coming and going of doctors, nurses, and two periods in
    hospital, has necessitated putting aside all correspondence for months.
    Now, however, thank God, Mr. Maxwell is slowly improving, and the threads
    of normal existence can be taken up again by us all.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian was very happy to note the community increased this year by
    sixty-six. He was also delighted to see your Assembly arranged for all
    delegates to be present. This is very important, especially during this
    period when full consultation and co-operation is necessary amongst all the
    far-flung Canadian Assemblies and groups, as well as isolated believers, in
    order to ensure the success of your first and so important Plan.
</p>
<p>
    He approves of the measures you have inaugurated for intensive teaching
    during the coming year, and trusts they will meet with great success.
</p>
<p>
    The British victories, in the face of great obstacles, and the consistent
    success across the border in the United States, must be at once an
    inspiration and a challenge to the Canadian friends. There is no doubt they
    can succeed if the entire Community applies itself eagerly and confidently
    to its task.
</p>
<p>
The Guardian is immensely pleased over the settlement of pioneers    <a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title="">[†††††††††††††††††]</a> in
    Newfoundland; this has accomplished one of the specific desires of the
    beloved Master, and will redound to the glory of the Canadian Bahá’ís.
</p>
<p>
The next, most important task is to get Miss Gates    <a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> into
    Greenland. This is fraught with many difficulties, but he urges your
    Assembly to persevere and exert its utmost to remove every obstacle. He
    will specially pray that a way may open for her to enter that country.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding your question about contributions: it is up to the individual to
    decide; if he wishes to devote a sum to a specific purpose, he is free to
    do so; but the friends should recognize the fact that too much labelling of
    contributions will tie the hands of the Assembly and prevent it from
    meeting its many obligations in various fields of Bahá’í activity.
</p>
<p>
    Concerning the points your Assembly raised in the letter of December
    20,1949:
</p>
<p>
    1. The Guardian considers this a purely secondary question of
administrative procedure which your Assembly can decide upon for itself.    <a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> He is
    very anxious that no new rules and regulations should be introduced. As far
    as possible each National Spiritual Assembly should decide secondary
    matters for itself, and not try to lay down a rule general in application.
2. No fixed rule should be laid down about this either.    <a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title="">[******************]</a> 3.
    Bahá’u’lláh gives no right of appeal to the law that both parents must give
    permission to the marriage, if they are living. Bahá’í marriages should be
    referred to Assemblies to officiate; where there is no Assembly to
    officiate your body is free to decide what procedure should be followed.
    Whether it is the chairman or secretary or some other person who actually
    conducts the marriage is, likewise, a matter for your body to decide. The
    Guardian feels that next Convention you should permit only Assemblies to
    send delegates. This will encourage the various Provinces to ensure they do
    have an Assembly and consequently a delegate, or delegates.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian has not found it desirable, for various reasons, to send a
    recorded message to any Convention.
</p>
<p>
The work being done by various Bahá’ís, including our dear Indian believer    <a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title="">[††††††††††††††††††]</a> who
    returned from the United States in order to pioneer amongst his own people,
    in teaching the Canadian Indians, is one of the most important fields of
    activity under your jurisdiction. The Guardian hopes that ere long many of
    these original Canadians will take an active part in Bahá’í affairs and
    arise to redeem their brethren from the obscurity and despondency into
    which they have fallen.
</p>
<p>
    The desire of your Assembly to remain in the closest touch with the
    Guardian pleases him very much—he assures you that the desire is mutual!
</p>
<p>
    With the assurance of his loving prayers for you all,
</p>
<p>
    Yours in His service,
</p>
<p>
    R. Rabbani
</p>
<p>
    The maps you forwarded were of great interest, and he thanks you for them.
    He intends to have one of them published in the next edition of Bahá’í
    World.
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    The progress achieved in various fields by the members of the Canadian
    Bahá’í Community under the direction of its national elected
    representatives, since the inception of the Five Year Plan, merits the
    highest praise, and augurs well for its success in the years that lie
    immediately ahead. The spontaneity with which the members of this
    community, on the morrow of its having attained an independent national
    existence, have arisen to execute the Plan designed for the furtherance of
    its interests and the consolidation of its newly-born institutions, the
    zeal and resolution which have characterized the prosecution of the task
    entrusted to their care, the notable success they have already achieved in
    the initial stages of their enterprise, have served to heighten my feelings
    of admiration for those who have directed its course and participated in
    its unfoldment, and to evoke the unstinted praise of all sister communities
    in both the East and the West.
</p>
<p>
    Though much has been achieved in the course of the two years that have
    elapsed since the formulation of the Plan, the objectives that the members
    of this struggling, youthful and valiant community have set themselves to
    attain are still far from being fulfilled. Though the process of the
    multiplication of Bahá’í centres, over the length and breadth of so vast a
    territory, has been, steadily and speedily, gathering momentum, the number
    of groups that have achieved Assembly status is still relatively
    insignificant, while the pioneer activity designed to awaken and stimulate
    the interest of the Eskimos in the Faith and enlist their support may
    hardly be said to have been vigorously and adequately launched. The call to
    which this newly-fledged community has been summoned is admittedly urgent
    and challenging. The character of the tasks allotted to it is, in many
    respects, unique. The resources at its disposal for the discharge of its
    peculiar responsibilities are no doubt as yet inadequate. The obstacles
    that stand in its way and obstruct its path seem almost insurmountable. Its
    membership, when viewed in relation to the range over which it operates, is
    no doubt wholly inadequate. Yet the spirit which has consistently animated
    the members of the entire community, and the energy and determination which
    have distinguished their elected representatives in the discharge of their
    sacred duties, are such as to fortify the hopes which I, as well as their
    fellow-workers in both hemispheres, have cherished in our hearts, since the
    inauguration of their first collective enterprise in a land so rich in
    promise, so vast in its potentialities, and so honoured by the visit of the
    Centre of the Covenant Himself as well as by the glowing references made to
    it by Him in His immortal Tablets.
</p>
<p>
    As the centenary of the birth of Bahá’u’lláh’s prophetic Mission
    approaches, as the first historic Plan, signalizing the birth and rise of a
    highly privileged community, the sole partner of its great sister community
    in the South in the prosecution of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan, gathers
    momentum and enters the concluding stages in its evolution, a dedication
    even more conspicuous than that already manifested in the hour of the
    launching of the Plan must needs be displayed by all those who are called
    upon to participate in its prosecution. A sterner resolve, a nobler
    heroism, a greater unanimity in sacrifice, a further intensification of
    effort must be manifested, as the first stage in the evolution of the
    mission of the Canadian Bahá’í Community draws to a close, and paves the
    way for the inauguration of still more splendid enterprises along the path
    laid down for them by the unerring hand of the Author of the Divine Plan.
</p>
<p>
    That this community will never relax in its high endeavours, that the
    vision of its glorious mission will not be suffered to be dimmed, that
    obstacles, however formidable, will neither dampen its zeal or deflect it
    from its purpose, is my confident hope and earnest prayer. He Who watches
    over its destinies, from Whose pen testimonies so significant and soul
    thrilling have flowed, will no doubt continue to direct its steps, to
    shower upon it His loving bounties, to surround it with His constant care,
    and to enable it to scale loftier heights on its ascent towards the summit
    of its destiny.
</p>
<p>
    With a heart brimful with gratitude for all that this community has so far
    achieved, and throbbing with hope for the future exploits that will
    distinguish its record of stewardship to the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, I pray
    that by its acts, this community will prove itself worthy of the trust
    confided to its care, and the station to which it has been called,
</p>
<p>
    Your true and grateful brother,
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of June 24, with the interesting enclosure, was received, and
    our beloved Guardian was delighted to hear from you, as he followed with
    interest your trips abroad and your teaching activities.
</p>
<p>
    Although it is a considerable disappointment to have all doors seemingly
closed in the face of Nancy Gates,    <a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> it is
wonderful news you give him that Mr. Fuller    <a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title="">[*******************]</a> will
    be in Greenland for nine months! God seems to have arranged for one
    believer to be on the spot until your Assembly can get a real pioneer
    there.
</p>
<p>
    It would be a great help if Mrs. Jensen of Copenhagen could enlist the
    sympathy of her sister, and perhaps even visit her there, and thus procure
    an opening for some believer from Denmark to get a job in Greenland?
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian very deeply appreciates the services you are rendering the
    Cause, and have rendered it in the past. You may be sure he will support
    you with his loving prayers.

    He wishes you to please have these circulated as far as possible amongst

    most and be able to enjoy them.

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    This is just a short note in reply to your letter of June 17 to our beloved
    Guardian, as he is so overworked and exhausted that he can barely keep up
    with his mail. In fact it begins to look as if he could no longer do so!
</p>
<p>
    He thanks you for the book you are sending him. He sees no reason why you
    should not tell the Bahá’ís that cancer seems to be successfully treated by
    this method sometimes. But as we are a religion and not qualified to pass
    on scientific matters we cannot sponsor different treatments. We are
    certainly free to pass on what we have found beneficial to others.

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of July 14 has been received, and our beloved Guardian has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf. As he is very busy and overtired
    he wishes you to please consider this as an appendix to the letter recently
    mailed you, as that makes it easier for him.
</p>
<p>
    He feels your Assembly’s best hope for Greenland seems to be the
    possibility of getting a Danish Bahá’í to go there as your deputy. If some
    believer from Denmark could get employment, or at least permission to
    proceed there, the details could no doubt be worked out.
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, any Canadian Bahá’í who could qualify for scientific work there
    should make every effort to get in.
</p>
<p>
He is pleased to hear that at least Mr. Bond    <a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††]</a> and
Mr. Fuller    <a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> will

to please express to Miss Nan Brandle    <a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> his
    deep appreciation of the unique service she is rendering the Cause, and of
    the exemplary spirit which is animating her. He hopes other believers will
    follow in her footsteps, and arise to do work in this very important field
    of Bahá’í activity.
</p>
<p>
    He was also pleased to see that your Assembly had increased the annual
    budget, as this expresses the determination of the Canadian believers to
    expand their activities and carry on their work on a larger scale than ever
    before.
</p>
<p>
He was also very pleased to see that Mr. Bond    <a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> had
    gone north and had been able to contact the Arctic Eskimos. He hopes that
    the way will open for this devoted believer to establish a more permanent
    contact in that area in some field of government work.
</p>
<p>
    He considers the policy of your Assembly of helping delegates from distant
    points to attend the Convention, an excellent one, as the attendance of
    these delegates enables them to carry back a very real awareness of the
    work in hand and the needs of the hour, to their local Communities.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian feels that, although the Canadian Bahá’ís are making excellent
    progress in consolidating their National Assembly and its subsidiary
    committees, in holding Conferences and Summer Schools, in sending forth
    travelling teachers, and in contacting the important minority groups, the
    Eskimos and Indians, that they are not making sufficient progress in the
    all-important field of pioneer activity. If they are to succeed in
    accomplishing their plan, a far greater number of Canadian Bahá’ís will
    have to arise and go into the pioneer field. He feels sure that they can do
    this, as they have already had the stirring example of how much was done in
    the British Isles by a Community of about their size. In comparing the
    problem which faced the British Bahá’ís under their Six Year Plan, and that
    which faces the Canadian Bahá’ís under their Five Year Plan, the friends
    should bear in mind that they were spared the severest ordeals of the war,
    the extreme restrictions and rationing which the British believers had to
    put up with. If the British Bahá’ís, with all their handicaps and suffering
    real physical and nervous exhaustion from the long war years, could
    accomplish so much, then surely the Canadian Bahá’ís, who were spared these
    conditions, are in a much better state to carry on and prosecute their
    tasks. What was done at the very breaking point in England, Ireland,
    Scotland and Wales could be done—must be done—by the Canadian believers,
    with much less effort. Although sacrifice is required, he feels sure that
    the friends are ready and willing to make the necessary sacrifice, and
    arise to ensure that the very first Plan, the very first organized work
    undertaken by them as an independent national Bahá’í Community, will be
    carried forward and victory ensured by the appointed time.
</p>
<p>
    He assures all the members of your Assembly, and through you, the Community
    that you serve and represent, that your work is very dear to his heart, and
    that you are often remembered in his prayers. He is waiting to receive the
    good news that many more objectives have been achieved during this coming
    Bahá’í year.

    P.S. The Guardian has no objection to your publishing the excerpt from his
    letter dated August 25, 1939.
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    The energy, fidelity and courage, with which the Canadian Bahá’í Community
    has, in the course of this past year, faced its problems, discharged its
    duties and expanded the scope of its teaching and administrative activities
    merit the highest praise, and have greatly raised my hopes for the eventual
    consummation of the Plan which its members are so steadfastly prosecuting.
    Though unable, owing to a chain of circumstances beyond my control, to
    address them more frequently and convey to them my feelings of gratitude
    and admiration for their recent achievements, I have followed closely the
    course of their manifold activities, perused, with care and interest, the
    various publications which testify to their unremitting labours, and
    remembered them in my prayers in the Holy Shrines.
</p>
<p>
    This community, though still in its infancy, is manifesting, in the course
    of the first years of its existence as an independent administrative
    entity, a virility, a steadfastness of purpose, a dedication to the Cause
    it serves, an organizing ability in the administration of its affairs that
    augur well for the glorious destiny disclosed by the Pen of the Author of
    the Divine Plan in His epoch-making Tablets. Already in the early stages of
    its life, when its administrative machinery was still merged with the
    institutions evolved by the followers of the Faith residing in the Great
    Republic of the West, its fame, through a series of memorable events and
    noble exploits that have greatly enriched the annals of the Cause of God,
    had spread far and wide and the shadow of its future glory had run before
    it to the remotest corners of the Bahá’í world. For was it not
    ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own pen which, as far back as the dark years of the first
    World War, had forecast the splendour of the memorable achievements which,
    spiritually and materially, would distinguish and illuminate its annals in
    the years to come? “The future of the Dominion of Canada ... is very great
    and the events connected with it infinitely glorious... Again I repeat that
    the future of Canada is very great, whether from a material or a spiritual
standpoint.”    <a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" title="">[*********************]</a>
</p>
<p>
It was a Canadian,    <a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††]</a> of
    French extraction, who through his vision and skill was instrumental in
    conceiving the design, and delineating the features, of the first
    Mashriqu’l-Adhkár of the West, marking the first attempt, however
    rudimentary, to express the beauty which Bahá’í art will, in its plenitude,
unfold to the eyes of the world. It was a Canadian woman,    <a href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> one
    of the noblest in the ranks of Bahá’í pioneers, who alone and
    single-handed, forsook her home, settled among an alien people, braved with
    a leonine spirit the risks and dangers of the world conflict that raged
    around her, and who now, at an advanced age and suffering from infirmities,
    is still holding the Fort and is setting an example, worthy of emulation by
all her fellow pioneers of both the East and the West. It was a member    <a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a> of
    that same community who won the immortal distinction of being called upon
    to be my helpmate, my shield in warding off the darts of Covenant-breakers
    and my tireless collaborator in the arduous tasks I shoulder. It was a
Canadian subject,    <a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title="">[**********************]</a>
    the spiritual mother of that same community, who, though fully aware of the
    risks of the voyage she was undertaking, journeyed as far as the capital of
    Argentina to serve a Cause that had honoured her so uniquely, and there
    laid down her life and won the everlasting crown of martyrdom. It was,
moreover, a Canadian    <a href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86" title="">[††††††††††††††††††††††]</a>
    who more recently achieved the immortal renown of designing the exquisite
    shell destined to envelop, preserve and embellish the holy and priceless
    structure enshrining the dust of the Beloved Founder of our Faith.
</p>
<p>
    A community which, in the course of less than fifty years, has to its
    credit such an imperishable record of international service, and standing
    now on the threshold of a new epoch in its evolution, recognized as a
    self-governing member of the family of Bahá’í national communities,
    functioning according to a Plan of its own conceived for its orderly and
    efficient development, must, if it is to maintain the standard of
    excellence it has already attained, display on a still wider front, and
    continue to demonstrate, a no less profound spirit of dedication, as it
    forges ahead, in the years to come, along the road laid down for it by the
    Centre of the Covenant Himself in His historic Tablets.
</p>
<p>
    As co-partner with the American Bahá’í community in the execution of the
    Divine Plan, it must evince in both the administrative and pioneer fields,
    a heroism that may be truly worthy of its high calling. In the remote and
    inhospitable regions of the North, amidst the Eskimos of Greenland and the
    Indians of the Dominion of Canada; throughout the Provinces of a far flung
    territory where newly fledged Assemblies, and nuclei of future Bahá’í
    institutions in the form of groups and isolated centres, lie scattered; in
    its relationships and negotiations with the local, provincial and national
    representatives of civil authority in issues affecting matters of personal
    status and the independence of the Faith and the establishment of its
    endowments; in its contact with the masses and in its effort to publicize
    the Faith, enhance its prestige and disseminate its literature, this
    community, so young, so vibrant with life, so laden with blessings, so rich
    in promise, must rise to such heights and achieve such fame as shall
    eclipse the radiance of its past administrative and pioneer achievements.
</p>
<p>
    Then and only then will this community acquire the spiritual potentialities
    that will enable it to discharge, as befits a co-heir of the Tablets of the
    Divine Plan, the tremendous responsibilities, and fulfil the functions,
    devolving upon it beyond the oceans, and in all the continents of the
    globe.
</p>
<p>
    May this community, the leaven placed by the hands of Providence in the
    midst of a people belonging to a nation, likewise young, dynamic, richly
    endowed with material resources, and assured of a great material prosperity
    by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, play its part not only in lending a notable impetus to the
    world-wide propagation of the Faith it has espoused, but contribute, as its
    resources multiply and as it gains in stature, to the spiritualization and
    material progress of the nation of which it forms so vital a part.

    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of May 21 has been received, and our beloved Guardian has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf, and to also forward to you the
    enclosed receipt for your generous and loving contribution towards the
    building of the Holy Shrine.
</p>
<p>
He has been in touch with Mr. Bischoff,    <a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]</a>

</h3>
<p>
    30 October 1951
</p>
<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your letters of March 29 and July 22 have been received, with enclosures,
    and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the question of Mr. and Mrs. ...: the Administrative Order is not
    a governmental or civic body, it is to regulate and guide the internal
    affairs of the Bahá’í community; consequently it works according to its own
    procedure, best suited to its needs. A Bahá’í who does more than visit
    temporarily a Community is considered for our administrative purposes as a
    resident and can vote and serve accordingly. Students in foreign lands,
    most obviously not residents, are registered as local Bahá’ís, and
    therefore entitled to do their share of work and play their part in the
    local Community life. This should be pointed out to ... who seem to be
    confusing our internal administration with external practices which have no
    relation to it. As regards their personal attitudes the Guardian,
    remembering what a devoted worker ... has been in the past, is very sorry
    to see she is no longer active. He does not feel this will lead to either
    her happiness or that of...; for, whenever we compromise with what is
    noblest and best in ourselves, we are the losers invariably.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian was delighted to hear the friends are at last responding to
    the urgent needs of the Plan and going forth as pioneers. Plans are
    concrete things, and not mere honours, and victories—like all other
    achievements in life—must be purchased at the cost of persistent effort! He
    feels sure the Canadian Bahá’ís, perhaps slow to get under way, will
    display the counterpart of this British characteristic, and cling like bull
    dogs to their tasks, once they do get under way.
</p>
<p>
The departure of Mr. Bond    <a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" title="">[***********************]</a>
    for the Arctic made the Guardian very happy; this, as well as the sailing
of Mr. Bischoff    <a href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††]</a>
    for Greenland, marks the opening stage of the campaign to carry the Faith
    to the Eskimos, a plan set forth by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and very dear to His
    heart.
</p>
<p>
    Encouraging as these steps are, they do not take care of the main body of
    the work—the establishment of new Assemblies and groups. In order to
    accomplish this the entire Canadian Community will have to rise to a new
    level of activity, consciousness, and sacrifice, just as did the British
    Bahá’í Community during their Six Year Plan. Their success is perhaps one
    of the most remarkable ever achieved in the Bahá’í world because they were
    few in number, run down in health from the long years of suffering during
    the war, and poor in financial resources. Their determination, dedication
    and moral stamina, however, carried them through, and Bahá’u’lláh gave them
    the victory. He will give the same victory to everyone who shows the same
    characteristics. Success breeds success, and this same Community, now
    rightfully proud and conscious of its importance, is carrying on its
    African work in a brilliant manner. The Canadian Bahá’ís, more prosperous,
    less restricted, and equally capable, can accomplish just as much if they
    unitedly determine to do so.
</p>
<p>
    The response made by the Canadian friends to the Guardian’s appeal for
    support of the Shrine work has touched him very much. He wishes to thank
    all those who contributed for their loving generosity, and to assure them
    that their co-operation in this wonderful task has added to the spiritual
    beauty of an Edifice already so Holy and so beloved by all the believers
    the world over.
</p>
<p>
    He wishes you all every success in the discharge of your arduous duties,
    and is praying for a marked quickening in the pace of the Five Year Plan.
</p>
<p>
    With Bahá’í love,
</p>
<p>
    R. Rabbani
</p>
<p>
    P.S. The Guardian has received no copy of his last letter to you, sent last
    spring, and thinks perhaps the material was lost. Will you please send him
    a copy in whatever form it was circulated amongst the believers?
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    The Plan on which the attention of the Canadian Bahá’í Community is
    focused, and upon the success of which must depend its immediate destinies,
    is now entering a critical stage, demanding increasing vigilance on the
    part of all its members, utter consecration to the Plan’s objectives, and a
    determined inflexible resolve to carry it to a successful conclusion.
</p>
<p>
    Little over a year separates this valiant community, still in the earliest
    stage of its independent existence, from the fateful hour that will mark
    the termination of the first collective enterprise undertaken in its
    history. The vastness of the field in which its infant strength is being
    tested is indeed staggering. The resources it can command are severely
    limited. The number of active participators, whether as pioneers or
    administrators, is admittedly small. The experience of the vast majority of
    its supporters is inadequate to the tremendous obligations it has assumed.
    The obstacles confronting it whether in Greenland, or among the Indians and
    the Eskimos of the extreme North, are truly formidable. Yet the potency
    infused into this community, through the Revelation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
    Divine Plan, and the spiritual capacity engendered in its earliest members
    through His visit to their native land—distinctions which it fully shares
    with its sister community in the Great Republic of the West—empower it to
    discharge—if it but rise to the occasion—all the responsibilities it has
    undertaken and consummate the task to which it stands pledged.
</p>
<p>
    The eyes of the Bahá’í world are expectantly turned towards this newly
    erected pillar, designed to sustain in conjunction with other National
    Assemblies the weight of the Supreme Legislative Body of the World Order of
    Bahá’u’lláh. Sister communities in both the East and the West, less
    privileged than it and deprived of the primacy with which the twin Bahá’í
    national communities labouring in the North American continent have been
    invested by the unerring Pen of the Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, yet
    able to achieve, under circumstances no less challenging, a success wholly
    out of proportion to their numbers, are eagerly awaiting the outcome of
    this initial crusade embarked upon by this blessed, this envied community
    in conformity with the Mandate issued by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His immortal
Tablets.    <a href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
    He Himself Who nourished and watched over it with such loving care from the
    earliest days of its inception, Who, in unmistakable language and on more
    than one occasion, foreshadowed its glorious future, both materially and
    spiritually, is from His station on high, gazing down upon the youthful
    efforts exerted by a community so dear to His heart, so newly launched upon
    a course which He Himself has charted.
</p>
<p>
    This final phase of the first Plan, undertaken by a newly fledged,
    repeatedly blessed community, as it speeds to a close, must witness an
    upsurge of spirit, of courage and determination, a display of activity, a
    demonstration of self-sacrifice and of solidarity such as to eclipse its
    brightest achievements in the past. The highly meritorious tasks initiated
    in both Greenland and Newfoundland need not be enlarged at the present
    hour, but should, under no circumstances, be allowed to suffer any setback.
    The work started among the Eskimos and Indians should be maintained at its
    present level, and should not be permitted to decline. An extraordinary
    concentration of effort, systematic, determined and sustained, is however
    required throughout all the nine provinces of the Dominion, aiming at an
    unprecedented flow of contributions by the entire body of the believers,
    each according to his or her means, into the National Treasury; a marked
    increase in the number of pioneers; a much greater dispersion; a higher
    degree of austerity; a still nobler display of consecration—all of which
    must result in a speedy multiplication of Assemblies and groups, which
    constitutes the core of the Plan, and on which hinges its fortunes.
</p>
<p>
    The fleeting months ahead will be truly decisive. Upon the success of the
    present Plan must depend, not only the joint tribute to be paid by the
    Canadian Bahá’í Community to the memory of the Founder of the Faith on the
    occasion of the centenary of the Birth of His Revelation, but also the
    rapid unfoldment of subsequent stages of the Mission which the Tablets of
    ‘Abdu’l-Bahá so clearly and emphatically entitle it to fulfil.
</p>
<p>
    The opportunity given to this Community is precious, unutterably precious.
    The fate of this first historic Plan now hangs in the balance. The present
    chance, if lost, cannot be retrieved. The issues on which hinge the
    successful prosecution of the Plan are so weighty that none can assess them
    at present. The needs of a sorely-stricken society, groping in its distress
    for God’s redemptive Message, are growing more acute with every passing
    hour. The Canadian Bahá’í Community, newly emerged as an independent member
    of the Bahá’í World Community, so richly blessed through its elevation to
    the rank of a chosen prosecutor of a Divine Plan, unique, in many respects,
    among its sister communities in both Hemispheres in the manifold blessings
    bestowed upon it, can neither afford to flinch for a moment or hesitate in
    the discharge of its sacred duty. Every effort exerted by this community,
    during these fate-laden months, every sacrifice willingly endured by its
    members, will, if they but persevere, be richly blessed by Him Who brought
    it into being, who nursed it through His love, Who conferred upon it so
    distinguished a Mission, Who made such magnificent promises regarding its
    future, and Who will continue to sustain it though His unfailing, His
    abounding grace and favour.
</p>
<p>
    May this Community, ever aware of the position it occupies, and of the
    bright prospects unfolding before it, brace itself for one, last, supreme
    effort, and ensure, while there is yet time, the complete and total success
    of the enterprise to which it stands committed.

    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to acknowledge on his behalf your
    letter of November 11th, together with the loving contribution you have
    enclosed for the Shrine of the You will find a receipt attached.
</p>
<p>
    The work on the Shrine is steadily progressing; and this holy enterprise is
    serving to draw the believers all over the world closer to the heart and
    centre of their Faith.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian assures you he will pray for the assistance of the devoted
    Canadian friends in achieving their goal, which includes a strong Halifax
    Assembly.
</p>
<p>
    He trusts the Canadian Bahá’í Convention, which will be held in Halifax in
    April, will prove to be a great success and a mighty force to stimulate all
    the Bahá’ís to redouble their efforts.

<p>
    Your letter of May 4th has been received, and the beloved Guardian has

</p>
<p>
    He deeply appreciates your great devotion to the Faith. The Guardian was
    happy to learn of the success you are having in your teaching work,
    especially with the Jewish people. He wishes me to assure you that he will
    pray for those whom you have succeeded in attracting to the Cause of

and May 15, 1952 signed by Ross Woodman,    <a href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" title="">[*************************]</a>
    with their various enclosures, have been received, and the beloved Guardian
    has requested me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He was very happy to hear that the Convention had been such a success, and
    above all, that the delegates had realized how urgent are the teaching
    tasks still facing the Canadian Community. He hopes that they will carry
    back to their local Communities a sense of this urgency, and stimulate the
    friends to make a heroic last effort and succeed. They say success breeds
    success; and there can be no doubt that, upon the accomplishment of the
    present goals must depend the work in the immediate future—both the degree
    of spiritual help that will be vouchsafed by God, and the number of tasks
    that will be entrusted to the Canadian Bahá’ís. He feels sure that if the
    believers become sufficiently aroused to an awareness of the critical
    nature of the coming months, they will take the necessary action, however
    great the sacrifice involved.
</p>
<p>
    As he cabled you, he feels that Charlottetown, representing as it does one
    of the Canadian provinces, must be maintained at any cost.
</p>
<p>
    In regard to the question you asked about the holding of the Canadian
    Convention in Wilmette, this would not be possible, as the National Body
    must hold its Convention in its own country. He suggests, however, that you
    make an effort to coordinate the dates in such a way that the friends can
    later proceed to Wilmette for the Intercontinental Teaching Conference and
    the dedication of the Temple. As long as it is held within the Ridván
    period, the dates can be arranged any way that suits your convenience, and
    of course the Convention can be convened any place in Canada your Assembly
    decides upon, even on the American frontier at a point en route to Chicago.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian was most happy to hear of the excellent work some of the
    Bahá’ís are doing with the Eskimos and the Indians, and considers their
    spirit most exemplary. They are rendering a far greater service than they,
    themselves, are aware of, the fruits of which will be seen, not only in
    Canada, but because of their repercussions, in other countries where
    primitive populations must be taught.
</p>
<p>
    He feels that the opening for a Canadian believer to visit the Governor of
    Greenland and his wife is extremely important.
</p>
<p>
    The personality of the Bahá’í who accepts this invitation should be
    carefully considered, because to be a guest of people in a different
    climate and environment, of a different nationality and speaking a
    different language, so far away, might be a little trying, and of course
    the impression that this Bahá’í creates will be of infinite importance to
    the Faith in its future development in Greenland. Whether ... makes the
    sacrifice and goes, or some other individual is chosen, he urges your
    Assembly to above all consider this matter tactfully and from the human
    standpoint, rather than the religious one, if one can put it that way.
</p>
<p>
    He sees no objection to circulating the Tablet and the Prayer translated by
Dr. Ali Kuli Khan.    <a href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98" title="">[†††††††††††††††††††††††††]</a>
    The word that you marked in red is “Ark”.
</p>
<p>
    Your Assembly must decide, as the Guardian already told dear Mr.
Schopflocher    <a href="#_ftn99" name="_ftnref99" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a>
    when he was here, upon the advisability of maintaining the Laurentian
    School,
    <a href="#_ftn100" name="_ftnref100" title="">
        [§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]
    </a>
    in an objective spirit. The Guardian can only outline to you the principle,
    which is that Bahá’í funds should not be invested in building up a place
    that has dear associations for a number of the friends, but is not going to
    really serve a large group of the believers. We are all familiar with the
    tremendous sums that have gone into the upkeep of Green Acre over the
    years, without so far bringing returns commensurate with the investment of
    our limited Bahá’í monies. However Green Acre, through its close
    association with the Master, undoubtedly has historic importance, and for
    this reason cannot be abandoned.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian’s point is that National Bodies when creating national
    institutions, should use sound judgement, because of the financial
    investment involved. This is only reasonable.
</p>
<p>
    Your Assembly must therefore decide what to do about the Laurentian School,
    and you are free to make your own decisions.
</p>
<p>
    He would be very happy to have the National Assembly maintain the grave of
    dear Sutherland Maxwell.
    <a href="#_ftn101" name="_ftnref101" title="">
        [**************************]
    </a>
    His association, not only with Canada and the inception of the Faith there,
    but with the World Centre and the Shrine of the Báb, naturally endears him
    to all the friends, and his grave should be a national memorial. When the
    time comes to erect the tomb-stone, the question of receiving contributions
    from your Body can be considered.
</p>
<p>
    He feels that the Canadian Community, old in the Northern Hemisphere, but
    young in its independence, is showing great promise, and he is proud of it
    and of the spirit that animates both its National Assembly and its members.
    He also feels confident it will distinguish itself, not only during the
    coming year, but during the next ten years before our Most Great Jubilee
    falls due in 1963.
</p>
<p>
    With warm Bahá’í love,
</p>
<p>
    R. Rabbani
</p>
<p>
    P.S.—Regarding your question concerning St. John’s, Newfoundland and the
    believers living outside the town limits: no exception to the general rule
    can be made in this case.
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    The Plan, with which the immediate destinies of the valiant, newly emerged,
    independent, highly promising Canadian Bahá’í Community are linked is, as
    it approaches its closing stage, passing through a very critical period in
    its unfoldment. Proclaiming as it does the formal association of the second
    Bahá’í community to attain an independent status in the Western Hemisphere
    with its sister communities who, in various parts of the Bahá’í world, are
    prosecuting specific Plans designed to foster their organic development,
    signalizing the alignment of this community as the sole ally of the Chief
    Executors of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Master Plan, this collective fate-laden
    enterprise upon which this youthful and virile member of the World Bahá’í
    Family has so whole-heartedly and enthusiastically launched—an enterprise
    on the successful consummation of which the effective initiation of its
    glorious mission, far beyond the borders of the Dominion of Canada, must
    ultimately depend—such an enterprise, however vast the field in which it
    operates, and no matter how circumscribed the resources of the small band
    of stalwart pioneers engaged in its prosecution—must, under no
    circumstances, be allowed to register a failure.
</p>
<p>
    In Newfoundland, in Greenland, among the Eskimos and Indians, through the
    incorporation of its National Assembly, the immediate objectives have been
    practically attained. The attention of the entire community must, in the
    remaining months ahead, be focused on the dire necessity of multiplying, at
    whatever cost, the number of pioneers, the rapid formation of groups, and
    the conversion of groups into Assemblies, so that the complete and total
    success of the Plan may be assured, and a triumphant community may step
    forward, confident and unencumbered by any liabilities, into a vast arena
    of service, prosecute a still more glorious mission, and win still mightier
    victories.
</p>
<p>
    While the energy of this community is being expended on the conduct of this
    fateful undertaking, marking the baptism of this community, a collateral
    effort must, owing to unforeseen circumstances, be exerted for the
    establishment of an institution which, though not an integral part of the
    Plan formulated for that community, is nonetheless regarded as
    indispensable owing to its emergence into an independent existence, and the
    necessity of its following the lead of its sister-communities in East and
    West, which have, at various stages in their development, adopted this
    vital measure for the consolidation of their national institutions and the
    raising of the prestige of the Faith in their respective countries. The
    selection of the city to serve as the seat of the national Hazíratu’l-Quds
    in the Dominion of Canada; the purchase of either a plot to serve as a site
    for the construction of this Edifice, or, preferably, of a building to
    serve as a provisional national administrative headquarters for a rising,
    steadily expanding community; the association of all other National
    Assemblies throughout the Bahá’í world in contributing towards this highly
    meritorious enterprise; my own association with The Bahá’ís the world over
    in providing for the early emergence of such a Centre towards which the
    manifold activities initiated throughout the length and breadth of a vast
    Dominion must converge, and from which the impulses generated by a rapidly
    evolving, divinely appointed Administrative Order must radiate—these
    constitute the imperative needs of the present hour. The consummation of
    this added undertaking, the prompt discharge of this additional
    responsibility will, no doubt, constitute a befitting contribution by one
    of the youngest national communities in the Bahá’í world to the world-wide
    celebrations that are to commemorate the centenary of the birth of
    Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission, and which will parallel the termination of the
    fifty-year-old enterprise of the first Mashriqu’l-Adhkár of the West and
    its official opening for public Bahá’í worship.
</p>
<p>
    In conjunction with the various National Administrative Headquarters
    purchased or constructed, in the course of the last three decades, in five
    continents of the globe, and for the most part in the capital cities of
    several countries in the Eastern Hemisphere, this latest Edifice in the
    chain of Bahá’í national institutions linking five continents will, no
    doubt, serve to enhance the growing prestige of a world-wide Faith and
    consolidate the foundations of its administrative Structure. From far-off
    Sydney, on the shores of the South Pacific Ocean, and successively through
    New Delhi in the heart of the Indian subcontinent, Tihran, the capital of
    Bahá’u’lláh’s native land, Baghdad, the Iraqi capital enshrining His most
    holy House, Cairo, the Egyptian capital, the admitted centre of both the
    Arab and Muslim worlds, the city of Frankfurt in the heart of both Germany
    and of the European continent, and as far as the heart of the North
    American continent and in the neighborhood of the first Bahá’í centre
    established in the Western Hemisphere, this chain of Bahá’í bastions of a
    world-encircling Order, must be further extended through an additional link
    to be forged in the northern part of the Western Hemisphere, and its
    subsequent prolongation into Latin America as far as the Republics of South
    America.
</p>
<p>
    One more word in conclusion. The passing, at this juncture, of one who,
    through a long career of distinguished service to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh,
    not only since the birth of this community but in more recent years in the
    heart and centre of the Bahá’í world, has left an indelible mark on the
    annals of the Faith, has evoked not only the deepest sorrow but the utmost
    regret at a time when this community is beginning to reap at long last the
    first fruits of its stewardship to the Cause of God, and the whole Bahá’í
    world is on the eve of celebrating one of its greatest Jubilees. By reason
    of his own saintly life, his self-effacement, gentleness, loving kindness
    and nobility of soul; by virtue of his remarkable endowments which he so
    devotedly consecrated to both the embellishment of the slopes of God’s holy
    mountain and the creation of a befitting design for the second most holy
    Bahá’í Edifice embosomed in its very heart; and because of his kinship, on
    the one hand, with a wife
    <a href="#_ftn102" name="_ftnref102" title="">
        [††††††††††††††††††††††††††]
    </a>
    whom posterity will regard, not only as the mother both of the Canadian
    Bahá’í Community and of the first Bahá’í centre established on the European
    continent but also as one of the foremost pioneers and martyrs of the
    Faith, and, on the other with a daughter,
    <a href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103" title="">
        [‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]

    life, has earned her the title already conferred on her father—Sutherland

        [§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]
    </a>
    has left a legacy, and achieved a position excelled by only a few among the
    supporters of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh throughout the eleven decades of its
    existence.
</p>
<p>
    Inspired by the example and the accomplishments of those of its members who
    have distinguished themselves in the Holy Land, on the European continent
    and in both the northern and southern continents of the Western Hemisphere,
    this community must forge on, with added determination, with increasing
    dedication, with thanksgiving and redoubled zeal, on the road leading it to
    a still more glorious destiny in the years immediately ahead. That it may
    press forward, conquer still greater heights, plumb greater depths of
    consecration, spread wider and wider the fame of the Cause of God is the
    cherished desire of my heart and the object of my constant supplication.

    The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you in his behalf, to
    request that the information relating to Canada and its activities,

    wishes the information as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Briefly, the information which your National Spiritual Assembly is to
    provide, brought up to date as of May 1, 1952, is as follows:
</p>
<p>
    Incorporated Local Spiritual Assemblies.
</p>
<p>
    Localities where Bahá’ís reside in Canada, showing various Provincial
    divisions, such as is done in page 24 of the present book.
</p>
<p>
    Any information not immediately available should be handled by telegraph,
    but such information as is available should not be delayed for any one or
    two delinquents. You can appreciate that if the booklet is to be published
    early in the Holy Year, the information should reach the Guardian at a very
    early date.

    The teaching activities in Canada are of the greatest importance,
    particularly in and around Toronto. The Guardian therefore hopes that all
    of the friends will devote their energies to the diffusion of the Faith.
</p>
<p>
    The work on the glorious Shrine of the Báb is proceeding. The stone work on
    the drum is being put in place. The Guardian is very hopeful that this work
    may continue uninterruptedly until the entire building is completed.

<p>
    To the Treasurer of the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of July 14th has been received by the beloved Guardian,
    and he has asked me to acknowledge it in his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    The contributions which have been made to the Shrine of the Báb are deeply
    appreciated by him. Receipts are enclosed herewith, which he would
    appreciate your giving to the contributors.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian is very deeply impressed with the wonderful work being done by
    the Canadian Bahá’ís. With their limited numbers and resources, they are
    rendering unique and outstanding services. Certainly they will be richly
    blessed and confirmed by the Master.
</p>
<p>
    He is hoping that additional victories will be gained by the Canadian
    Bahá’ís during the present year, so as to lay the proper foundation for the
    great Teaching Crusade of the next ten years, and the important part that
    Canada must play in this world undertaking.
</p>
<p>
    The work on the drum of the Shrine is proceeding rapidly now, and its
    beauty is more evident as the work progresses. The beloved Guardian is very
    hopeful that the work can continue on the Shrine uninterruptedly until both
    the drum and the dome have been finished.
</p>
<p>
    With warm Bahá’í greetings,

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of July 18th has been received by the beloved Guardian,
    and he has asked me to acknowledge it in his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Your contribution to the Shrine of the Báb is very deeply appreciated.
    Receipt is enclosed herewith.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian is very happy indeed to learn that, since becoming a Bahá’í,
    you are very anxious to serve the Faith. It would be very wonderful if you
    could undertake the translation of one or two pamphlets into Finnish after
    consultation with the European Teaching Committee, and carry on
    correspondence with any friends you might have in Finland concerning the
    Bahá’í Teachings.
</p>
<p>
    There is a small beginning in Helsinki. The Guardian is very anxious that
    the Faith be spread in your land.
</p>
<p>
    He will pray for your guidance and success.
</p>
<p>
    You will be interested to know that work on the Shrine of the Báb is going
    forward quite rapidly at this time. The drum is taking shape, and adds to
    the beauty of the building. The beloved Guardian hopes the work may
    continue until it is entirely completed.

<p>
    5 August 1952
</p>
<p>
    To the National Teaching Committee
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter, on behalf of the National Teaching Committee, dated June 27,
    has been received, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it
    on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    It would seem as if the Canadian Community strongly resembles the British
    Community, very slow to move, but indomitable once it gets under way. But,
    whereas the work in Britain lay dormant for about forty years, the Canadian
    friends have only shown a relatively slight inertia for four years. He
    feels sure they will overcome it, and when they do, they will undoubtedly
    be launched down a path along which they will travel with ever greater
    momentum and glory.
</p>
<p>
    Their consciousness of full national responsibility is still so fresh in
    their minds that they seem not yet fully aware of the fact that all their
    affairs and their destiny are now in their own hands exclusively; there is
    no one to fall back on and do it for them!
</p>
<p>
    However, they can boast a great deal more experience, forming as they did
    until recently, an integral part of the American Bahá’í Community in
    existence since 1894, than their sister-communities in Latin America, who
    have chosen for themselves recently two plans, much more difficult of
    accomplishment than the remaining tasks that lie ahead of the Canadian
    Bahá’ís, in order to complete their Five Year Plan. Shall they then fail?
    It seems utterly out of the question, and the Guardian is confident they
    will not.
</p>
<p>
    If each Canadian Bahá’í would decide that the fulfilment of the remaining
    goals lies solely with him, and no one else, then there would be no room
    for failure. The Guardian will pray that this consciousness may come to all
    the friends.
</p>

    The work on the drum of the Shrine is going forward rapidly. The

</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian has received your loving letter of August 9th, and has
    instructed me to write you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He was most happy to learn that it was possible for so large a number of

    amongst them; also that a number of the attracted friends have been so
    touched by the spirit of the Conference, that they have declared their
    intention of enlisting their services in the Pathway of Bahá’u’lláh.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian was made happy also to learn that several of the believers
    have responded to the call for pioneers. A great bounty and a great
    responsibility will be given the Canadian believers within the coming few
    months, with the launching of the Ten Year Plan, and a firm foundation in

    To an individual
</p>
<p>
    Dear Spiritual Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter dated February 13th, 1952, has been received by Shoghi Effendi,
    and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    We are always happy to have friends of the Bahá’í Faith, and have counted
    amongst them many fine souls who for one reason or another cannot seem to
    take the step forward of working actively for that which we cherish so
    highly.
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi is pleased to see that you are a staunch friend of the
    Canadian Bahá’ís; for truly in their struggles, the more friends they have
    amongst the general public, the better.
</p>
<p>
    There are, no doubt, always grounds for criticism. The Bahá’ís are not
    perfect, and are not able, at present at least, to put into practice all
    the things they stand for. However, he feels that if you compare them to
    the people of the world in general, you will find a high average of
    sincerity and dedication to a great ideal, and a tangible effort being made
    on their part to live up to that which they preach. As time goes by, and
    there are larger communities of Bahá’ís believing in the same things, it
    will obviously become easier for them to put them into community practice.
    Perhaps sometime you will feel moved to help them. Your collaboration would
    be most welcome.
</p>
<p>
    He will pray that the dearest wishes of your heart may be realized, and
    sends you his kind regards.

    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    The Beloved Guardian sends his loving greetings to you.
</p>
<p>
    Shoghi Effendi asked me to send you with his love the enclosed photograph,
    which shows the new Gates which have been installed facing the entrance
    door of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. The Guardian wanted you to know he has
    used some of the gold you have sent on this Gate, which is clearly visible,
    and greatly enhances its beauty.
</p>
<p>
    Now that the Ten Year Crusade has been so auspiciously launched, and the
    confirming spirit of Bahá’u’lláh released in such volume, he hopes the
    Friends everywhere will arise, and with a superhuman effort, quickly start
    the initial phase of the Crusade, which is to get their pioneers into the
    fields assigned to them, and to initiate strong teaching methods at home.
    Of particular moment now is entering the virgin areas, assigned to each
    Assembly. He is sure Canada will respond to this urgent need, and lay the
    firm foundation for its successful prosecution.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian will pray for the Friends, and for your guidance and
    confirmation; that the blessings of Bahá’u’lláh may reach you in rich
    abundance.

    Faithfully yours,

</h3>
<p>
    8 June 1953
</p>
<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Our Beloved Guardian has been greatly encouraged by reports reaching him
    from all parts of the Bahá’í world; of the victories already gained, and
    the plans being laid for the prosecution of the Ten Year Crusade.
</p>
<p>
    They have evoked his awe-inspiring, and soul-stirring cablegram of May
    28th, calling for the immediate settlement of all the 131 virgin areas of
    the Plan, just as quickly as possible. He is convinced, that the Friends
    will arise and translate their enthusiasm into Action, because the Keynote
    of the Crusade must be Action, Action, Action!
</p>
<p>
    The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write your Assembly to amplify some
    of the aspects of his dynamic message.
</p>
<p>
    The settlement of these virgin areas is of such an emergency nature, that
    he feels pioneering in one of them takes precedence over every other type
    of Bahá’í service—whether it be in the teaching or administrative fields of
    the Faith. So important is it that the National Assembly may delay
    initiation of steps to fulfil other phases of the Plan, until all these
    areas are conquered for the Faith. Nothing, absolutely nothing, must be
    allowed to interfere with the placing of pioneers in each of the 131 goal
    countries.
</p>
<p>
    In the United States some 150 people have volunteered for pioneer service,
    and some of them already are preparing to leave for their posts. The
    Beloved Guardian fully expects the dear Friends in Canada, to follow this
    example, and quickly settle the areas allotted to them.
</p>
<p>
    Because of it being the Chief Executor of the Divine Plan, and having so
    many pioneers available, the Guardian has given permission to the United
    States to send pioneers into any area of the Globe regardless of whom it
    may be assigned to. Thus pioneers from the United States may ask permission
    to settle in one of the Areas assigned to your Assembly. If this is done,
    you should assist them in every way possible.
</p>
<p>
    There are some general observations which the Guardian shares with you, and
    then some specific suggestions which are enumerated below.
</p>
<p>
    1. Every individual who has offered to pioneer must be encouraged in every
    way by the National Assembly.
</p>
<p>
    2. The National Assembly should assist each pioneer, so they may be placed
    in their post just as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
    3. The handling of each application for pioneering service must be
    expedited, and not allowed to be bogged down for any reason, or in the
    hands of Committees.
</p>
<p>
    4. The National Assembly should make it their first order of business to
    follow up actively this most important task. They must make it the first
    order of business at each Assembly meeting, to see that each application is
    being processed rapidly. This does not mean the special committees should
    not handle the details; but it does mean the Assembly itself must review
    each application at each meeting; and see that the pioneer gets into the
    field as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
    5. A large number of pioneers should not be sent to any one country. One,
    or even two, will be sufficient for the time being. Later on, if
    supplementary assistance is needed, that of course can be taken care of.
    The all important thing now is to get at least one pioneer in each of the
    131 virgin areas.
</p>
<p>
    6. The National Assembly may exercise its prerogatives and suggest to
    applicants where their services are most needed. This, of course, applies
    particularly to pioneers, where a large number wish to go to the same
    place.
</p>
<p>
    The specific suggestions of the Guardian are:
</p>
<p>
    a. Areas close at hand and easy of settlement should be filled first. Then
    the areas more difficult, and finally, those which will be difficult.
</p>
<p>
    b. Whenever a pioneer enters a new territory, a cable should be sent at
    once to the Guardian, giving the name, place, and any pertinent
    information.
</p>
<p>
    c. A monthly report of progress is to be sent by your Assembly to the
    Secretary-General of the International Bahá’í Council. Special matters of
    [a] report nature, for the Guardian, in connection with the plan of
    settling these 131 areas, should be sent to the Secretary-General of the
    Council also.
</p>
<p>
    d. This does not mean that any administrative matters in connection with
    the settlement of pioneers should be handled with the Council. These should
    continue to be handled with the Guardian direct. The Council is simply to
    coordinate reports, consolidate them, keep maps up to date, etc. for the
    Guardian, and your reports will enable them to do this.
</p>
<p>
    e. The Guardian feels the following areas should be easily settled, and he
    would appreciate your early cable advice of such new victories: Anticosti
    Island, Baranof Island, Cape Breton Island, Magdalen Islands, Miquelon
    Island, and St. Pierre Island, followed by other areas in the American
    Continent. Precedence should, however, be given to those listed above, as
    they appear the easiest of accomplishment, at the moment.
</p>
<p>
    f. As his dramatic cable indicates, the Guardian will have prepared an
    illuminated “Roll of Honour” on which will be inscribed the names of the
    “Knights of Bahá’u’lláh”, who first enter these 131 virgin areas. This
    “Roll of Honour” will be placed inside the entrance door of the Inner
    Sanctuary of the Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh.
</p>
<p>
    From time to time, the Guardian will announce to the Bahá’í world the names
    of those Holy Souls who arise under the conditions outlined in his message,
    and settle these areas and conquer them for Bahá’u’lláh.
</p>
<p>
    Now is the time for the Bahá’ís of the world to demonstrate the spiritual
    vitality of the Faith, and to arise as one soul to spread the Glory of the
    Lord over the face of the Earth. The Guardian is sure that the Bahá’ís of
    Canada who have served and sacrificed so long for the Faith, will continue
    their glorious record by winning many new victories for the Faith.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian will pray fervently for the Bahá’ís of Canada, and for the
    success of their efforts.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian will pray for the members of the Assembly, whose sacrificial
    efforts he greatly values.
</p>

    Faithfully yours,

    20 June 1953
</p>
<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letters of August 18, September 16, October 17, November 17, 1952, and
    January 19, March 12, 13 and 18 and April 22, 1953 have been received by
    the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He regrets very much the delay in answering your letters. Unfortunately he
    has had to delay in replying to all national bodies during the last year,
    because of the pressure of work here, which has steadily increased during
    this Holy Year.

    he feels, was an important milestone in the history of the Faith in Canada,
    and he hopes that it will be put to good use, during the coming years, by
    your Assembly. To this institution you will soon be adding the Maxwell Home

    in Montreal, which should be viewed in the nature of a national Shrine,
    because of its association with the beloved Master, during His visit to
    Montreal. He sees no objection to having one room in the house being used
    as a little museum associated with Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell.

</p>
<p>
    He was most happy to hear that all of your goals were achieved. This augurs
    well for the future of your activities, especially during the Ten Year Plan
    just launched. He wishes through your body to thank all the pioneers,
    teachers and Bahá’ís who helped achieve this great victory. They have every
    reason to feel proud of themselves, and grateful to Bahá’u’lláh.
    Undoubtedly His divine assistance, combined with their determination and
    faith, enabled them to fulfil their objectives.
</p>
<p>
    He was very happy to know that Charlottetown not only achieved Assembly
    status, but that the believers there are mostly self-supporting, as this is
    a sound basis for the expansion of the work in any place, especially in
    such a difficult one.
</p>
<p>
    The Bahá’í Exhibit held at the Canadian National Exhibition was an
    excellent means of obtaining publicity. He hopes that advantage will be
    taken of similar opportunities in the future.
</p>
<p>
    He urges your Assembly to press for recognition of the Bahá’í marriage in
    Ontario,
    <a href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118" title="">
        [††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]
    </a>
    and, gradually, where the Cause is strong enough, in other Provinces.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the question you asked him about one of the believers who seems
    to be flagrantly a homosexual—although to a certain extent we must be
    forbearing in the matter of people’s moral conduct because of the terrible
    deterioration in society in general, this does not mean that we can put up
    indefinitely with conduct which is disgracing the Cause. This person should
    have it brought to his attention that such acts are condemned by
    Bahá’u’lláh, and that he must mend his ways, if necessary consult doctors,
    and make every effort to overcome this affliction, which is corruptive for
    him and bad for the Cause. If after a period of probation you do not see an
    improvement, he should have his voting rights taken away. The Guardian does
    not think, however, that a Bahá’í body should take it upon itself to
    denounce him to the Authorities unless his conduct borders on insanity.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian attaches the greatest importance, during this opening year of
    the Ten Year Campaign, to settling the virgin areas with pioneers. He has
    informed, or is informing, the other National Assemblies that there is no
    reason why believers from one country should not fill the goals in other
    countries. In other words, Canada could receive foreign pioneers for her
    goals, who would operate under her jurisdiction; likewise, Canadians could
    go forth and pioneer in other countries’ goal territories if the way opened
    for them to do so. Naturally, they must feel their first responsibility
    should be toward the Canadian part of the Plan, as they are Canadians, but
    sometimes health, business openings or family connections might take people
    into other goal countries.
</p>
<p>
    He realizes that the objectives in the far north are perhaps the hardest.
    On the other hand, the harder the task, the more glorious the victory.
</p>
<p>
    You may be sure that he is praying for your success, and, what is more, he
    is confident that this young, virile Canadian Community can and will
    succeed in carrying out its share of the World Spiritual Crusade, so vast
    and challenging, upon which we are now launched.
</p>
<p>
    With warmest Bahá’í love,
</p>
<p>
    R. Rabbani
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    The brilliant success achieved by the Canadian Bahá’í Community, marking
    the triumphant conclusion of the Plan formulated on the morrow of the
    emergence of the community as an independent member of the international
    Bahá’í Family, is to be regarded as a milestone of far-reaching importance
    in the evolution of the Faith not only in the Dominion of Canada but
    throughout the entire Western Hemisphere. The vitality displayed so
    strikingly by this youthful community, the exemplary fidelity demonstrated
    by its members to the spiritual as well as administrative principles of the
    Faith in the conduct of their manifold activities; the splendid
    co-operation with their national and local elected representatives which
    they have invariably shown, at every stage in the development of the Plan;
    the sacrifices they have repeatedly made; the vigilance and care which they
    have exercised while discharging their sacred and weighty responsibilities;
    the soundness of judgement, the enthusiasm and perseverance that have
    distinguished them in the pursuance of their tasks—all these have, in
    recent years, contributed, in no small measure, to the raising of the
    prestige of this community in the eyes of its sister communities in both
    the East and the West, and in evoking feelings of profound admiration in
    the hearts of the followers of the Faith in every continent of the globe.
</p>
<p>
    I myself am deeply touched, and feel a profound gratitude for the superb
    contribution made by this community, still in the early years of its
    development, to the world-wide progress of the Faith achieved since the
    inception of the successive Plans undertaken by various National Assemblies
    for the systematic propagation of the Faith throughout the world.
</p>
<p>
    The great strides which this virile and highly promising community has made
    in so short a period, over so vast a continent, despite such formidable
    obstacles, and in the service of so glorious a Cause, fill my heart with
    confidence that the tasks it has now assumed, on the morrow of the
    successful termination of the first collective enterprise undertaken in
    Canadian Bahá’í history, will be consummated in a manner that will redound
    to the glory of the Faith to which its members are so wholly dedicated.
</p>
<p>
    The Ten Year Plan which your Assembly has now launched, in its capacity as
    the elected representatives of the Canadian Bahá’í Community—the recognized
    allies of the chief executors of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan—and which
    constitutes so important a phase of the Global Spiritual Crusade on which
    the followers of the Faith have embarked, marks the inauguration of the
    initial stage in the unfoldment of the glorious Mission of this community,
    a Mission which will enable it to implant, in collaboration with its
    sister-community in the Great Republic of the West, and with the support of
    the Latin American Bahá’í Communities associated in the execution of the
    Divine Plan, the standard of the Faith in all continents of the Globe.
</p>
<p>
    Of all the objectives of this momentous Ten Year Plan, with which the
    immediate destinies of this firmly-grounded, fully consecrated,
    high-minded, spiritually quickened community are so closely linked, the
    purchase of the site of the Mother Temple
    <a href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119" title="">
        [‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]
    </a>
    of the Dominion of Canada and the settlement of pioneers in the thirteen
    virgin territories and islands, eleven of which are situated in North
    America and two in the South Pacific Ocean, may be regarded as the most
    important.
</p>
<p>
    Prompt and effective measures must, no matter how great the sacrifice
    involved, be taken to ensure that, ere the termination of the first two
    years of the Plan, these two paramount objectives, which constitute the
    opening phase of the Plan, will have been fully attained. The entire
    Community must arise, as it has never risen before, to meet the challenge
    of the present hour. The time fixed for the achievement of the initial
    victories of the Plan is admittedly brief. The prizes to be won in distant
    fields, under the most trying circumstances, by the members of a community
    so youthful, so circumscribed in number and resources, are so precious that
    none of them can as yet even dimly imagine their transcendent glory. On the
    homefront, as well as in the far-off islands of the Pacific Ocean, in both
    the teaching and administrative fields, the Canadian Bahá’í Community must
    labour incessantly in anticipation of the fulfilment of the inspiring
    prophecies made by the Centre of the Covenant Who, repeatedly and in
    unmistakable language, promised to this Community a glorious future, and
    predicted both the material and spiritual advancement of the nation of
    which it forms a part.
</p>
<p>
    On the success of this initial stage in the unfoldment of its Mission in
    foreign fields—a stage which will witness the departure of the Canadian
    pioneers from their homeland, in the northern regions of the Western
    Hemisphere, to the South Sea Islands—must depend the degree to which they
    will be active in days to come in other continents of the globe and their
    neighbouring islands. As the chosen allies of the chief executors of the
    Master’s Divine Plan, they shoulder a responsibility which is at once
    staggering, sacred and inescapable. The greater their exertions, the more
    abundant will be the outpouring of celestial grace vouchsafed to them by
    the Author of the Plan Himself, Who in His immortal Tablets has more than
    once assured of His unfailing aid all who arise to serve His Father’s
    Cause.
</p>
<p>
    Now is the hour to demonstrate to the entire Bahá’í world those qualities
    which the heroes of God, unfurling in the Western Hemisphere the banners of
    a World Crusade destined to be carried over the entire surface of the
    globe, must possess in order to accomplish their exalted Mission. The
    Canadian Bahá’í Community must stand in the vanguard of this conquering
    army of Bahá’u’lláh. They must prove themselves increasingly worthy of
    their high calling as this momentous Crusade steadily unfolds. They must
    put their entire trust in Him Who guides its destinies from His station on
    high. They must dedicate themselves heart and soul to the fulfilment of all
    its objectives without delay, without any exception.
</p>
<p>
    That they may acquit themselves of their task, as befits their high station
    in this great spiritual adventure, that they may enrich their heritage, and
    noise abroad the fame of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh through a whole-hearted
    and valiant participation in this world-girdling spiritual Crusade, is the
    object of my constant prayer and one of my most cherished hopes.

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian has received your loving letter of June 26th,
    enclosing contributions from Assemblies and individuals, for the Shrine of
    the Báb Fund, and has asked me to acknowledge it on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He greatly appreciates the devotion which these contributions represent.
    Enclosed are receipts for them. The Guardian asks that you send them to the
    contributors, with his loving appreciation.
</p>
<p>
    The reports which are being received in connection with the Ten Year
    Crusade indicate splendid results. The Guardian has been pleased with the
    cable which has been received from the Inter-Territorial Committee, telling
    of the progress of the settlement of the Canadian pioneers. He greatly
    values the sacrifices and the devotion of the Canadian believers. They have
    great responsibilities, but he knows they will fulfil all of the tasks
    assigned to them.
</p>
<p>
    He certainly will pray at the Shrines for the guidance and confirmation of
    the Canadian Bahá’í Community as a whole, and the Bahá’ís, individually.
</p>
<p>
    The Shrine of the Báb is progressing very rapidly at this time. The golden
    tiles are more than half laid on the dome, adding to the splendour of the
    Shrine each day.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian sends his loving greetings to all of you.

</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of June 19th has been received by the beloved Guardian,
    and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian was indeed happy to hear of the visit made to you recently by

    </a>
    and of the warm love he carried to you from the Guardian, and of the
    happiness and inspiration he brought you in his own loving spirit.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps you have been informed by this time that this dear brother and
    devoted Hand of the Cause has just recently passed to the Abhá Kingdom. Now
    he will reap the reward of his years of ceaseless and outstanding services
    to our beloved Faith. He was truly a dedicated soul, and his physical
    presence will be sadly missed by all the friends. You should be very happy
    that you have such precious memories to cherish, of his visit; which will
    always be a source of joy and help to you. No doubt from the invisible
    worlds, he will continue to assist you in your work.
</p>
<p>
    If it is not possible for you to be among the pioneers who go forth to
    virgin areas, you must not feel disheartened, but must remember that there
    must be a strong home-front, as this will aid those who go forth to foreign
    fields, in their teaching work. The Guardian urges you to redouble your
    efforts in the teaching of the Cause, as teaching is of the greatest
    importance in this day, and it is the power which attracts to the believers
    the bounties of Bahá’u’lláh.
</p>

    The Guardian sends you and your dear husband his loving greetings, and
    assures you of his prayers on your behalf.

</p>
<p>
    Your letter of October 5th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and
    he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding your questions: As you know, each Manifestation of God brings
    secondary laws, suitable for the age in which He appears. The laws of
    divorce, as given by Christ and Muhammad, have been changed by Bahá’u’lláh.
</p>
<p>
    Divorced people can remarry either other divorced people, or people who
    have never been divorced; but divorce is strongly condemned in the
    Teachings, even though it is permitted.
</p>
<p>
    In the Bahá’í Faith, concubinage is not permitted. It is only permitted to
    have sexual relations with one’s own wife or husband.

<p>
    The best thing would be to make friends, and, through your liberality and
    tolerance of their point of view, ... win over the hearts of the people,
    and then gradually, when you find those who have faith and are receptive,
    to teach them quietly in your home.
</p>
<p>
    You should not give any publicity to your work at all. You should keep in
    touch with the Guardian, and also with the National Spiritual Assembly of
    the Bahá’ís of India, Pakistan and Burma.
</p>
<p>
    Your services are very, very deeply appreciated; and the Guardian is very
    happy indeed that the Canadian National Assembly has had a part through its
    members in carrying out the work of the great Crusade.
</p>
<p>
    He will pray for your success in your historic venture.

<p>
    2 January 1954
</p>
<p>
    To the Treasurer of the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friend:
</p>
<p>
    The Beloved Guardian greatly appreciated your loving letter of November
    5th, enclosing contribution for various funds on behalf of the Canadian
    National Spiritual Assembly, as well as various Local Assemblies and
    individuals. Receipt cards are enclosed herewith.
</p>
<p>
    Will you please send the receipts to the Assemblies and individuals, and
    express to them the Guardian’s appreciation.
</p>
<p>
    The Beloved Guardian is very happy with the development of the teaching
    work in the virgin areas of the Ten Year Crusade. Over seventy of the
    countries have now been settled, bringing the number of countries within
    the pale of the Faith to over two hundred. All the areas have either been
    settled, or assigned to pioneers, with the exception of the Iron Curtain
    countries.
</p>
<p>
    The Ten Year Crusade is dual in nature. Teaching in foreign fields, and
    teaching on the home front. Now that the work is going ahead nicely abroad,
    the Guardian is hoping the Friends at home will arise with the same spirit
    of sacrifice and determination as the pioneers abroad have evinced. The
    reservoir at home must be kept filled to overflowing, if the work abroad is
    to prosper. More Bahá’ís, more Groups, more Assemblies is the immediate
    goal before the friends at home. The Guardian feels sure all the Friends
    will arise as never before, and filled with the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
    quicken the seeking souls, and lead many to the bourne of Immortality.
</p>
<p>
    Dedication to the heavenly task, complete consecration to the noble
    mission, and living the Life, are the requirements for success in the
    teaching field. May we all be confirmed in achieving this glorious goal, so
    the hosts of heaven may be able to confirm the souls through our humble
    efforts.
</p>
<p>
    Faithfully yours,
</p>
<p>

<p>
    The sudden passing of the honoured and greatly confirmed Hand of the Cause
    of God, dear Dorothy Baker,
    <a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125" title="">
        [********************************]
    </a>
    is a great loss to the work of the Faith, particularly in the teaching
    field, where she rendered such tireless and invaluable services, and where
    the need for such dedicated Bahá’ís is at the present time so great.
    However, we can be sure that her pure spirit can reinforce the work of the
    believers on this plane, and that she is now receiving her reward.
</p>
<p>
    Such happenings must serve to spur the friends on to ever greater efforts

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of January 15th has been received, and, as the beloved Guardian
    has been very busy, that is why you have not heard from him before, about
    your plans.
</p>
<p>
    He is very happy to hear that there seems a prospect of useful occupation
    for your dear husband, once you reach the Comoro Islands. To get settled
    permanently on a sound basis is certainly one of the most important aspects
    of pioneering.
</p>
<p>
    He has been deeply moved by this self-sacrificing response you have both
    made to the demands of the Ten Year Plan; and he feels sure that this will
    be in the end a great bounty and blessing to both of you, as well as to the
    work of the Cause.
</p>
<p>
    He feels that if it is at all possible for you to arrive in the Comoro
    Islands before the end of this Bahá’í year, which is the first year of the
    Ten Year Plan, that this would be highly meritorious. He hopes that all of
    the goals, outside those of the Soviet and satellite countries, will be
    filled, and thus establish a glorious record at the beginning of this great
    World Campaign; but, if all are not feasible, then he is hoping that most
    of the posts will be filled by their pioneers.
</p>
<p>
    No doubt the Canadian Bahá’ís will feel your absence keenly. On the other
    hand, it will force others to arise and take your place; and this is always
    stimulating in the Community life.
</p>
<p>
    You may be sure that his loving prayers will surround you both, and that he
    will supplicate in the Holy Shrines that your way may be smooth, and your
    services meet with speedy success.

    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of March 15th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he
    has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He is very sorry to hear that Anticosti is proving so extremely difficult
    to get into. Perhaps if Mr. Rakovsky
    <a href="#_ftn129" name="_ftnref129" title="">
        [*********************************]
    </a>
    succeeds in going on a hunting trip there (providing his recent flight
    there has not shown him some other way of ingress to the land, or one of
    the other friends), he will find some means of contact and a possible
    opening.
</p>
<p>
    There is no doubt that a few of the islands and territories embodied in the
    Plan are extremely difficult “nuts to crack”. As he attaches great
    importance to filling all the goals as soon as possible, he feels sure your
    Committee will continue to do its utmost.
</p>
<p>
    He was very happy to hear of the pioneers who are going to Labrador and
    Magdalen Islands. The Canadian Bahá’ís are certainly pushing their Plan
    forward successfully and effectively.
</p>
<p>
    He assures you of his loving prayers for your success, and his appreciation
    of your unflagging efforts.

    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of March 9th to the beloved Guardian has been received
    by him. He has directed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    The contributions which have been made by the National Assembly of Canada,
    various Assemblies and individuals are deeply appreciated by the Guardian.
    Receipts are enclosed herewith. Will you please pass them on to each
    Assembly or individual concerned.
</p>
<p>
    As previously advised, the Shrine of the Báb Fund does not exist any
    longer, inasmuch as the Shrine has been finished. However, these
    contributions have been placed in the International Fund, which is being
    used for the development of the Faith at the World Centre.
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian has been greatly pleased with the results of the first
    year of the Ten Year Crusade. He feels that even greater victories will be
    achieved as the Crusade is underway.
</p>
<p>
    Now that the initial task of introducing the Faith in the virgin areas has
    been virtually concluded, he feels the friends one and all must turn their
    attention to teaching on the home front, and consolidating the victories
    won in the virgin areas. He feels sure the friends will arise to the
    opportunity afforded them, and achieve even greater victories in this
    second phase of our work.

    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your letters, one from Mrs. Sala, dated February 20th, and two from Mr.
    Sala, dated March 25th and April 15th, have been received by the beloved
    Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He fully realizes how deep your disappointment has been that you are not
    able to secure your visa for the Comoro Islands. He himself was deeply
    disappointed also. However, some of these places are extremely difficult to
    enter; and he hopes that where you have failed, at least for the time
    being, someone else will prove successful at a later date.
</p>
<p>
    He urges you, upon your arrival in Zululand, to find out the status of the
    Cause in neighbouring places, and, if it is possible for you to settle in
    one of the neighbouring countries where the Centre is much weaker, and
    where it is more difficult for people to get established, and there is a
    better possibility for people like yourselves to build up a business and
    remain, that you by all means go to the weaker Centre, in preference to
    Zululand, which now has a certain number of pioneers.
</p>
<p>
    He assures you that the example that you and the Robarts
    <a href="#_ftn132" name="_ftnref132" title="">
        [§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]
    </a>
    have shown has moved him very deeply, and he hopes it will stir the
    Canadian Community, and impress upon them the advisability of answering the
    pioneer call now, while the field is open, and the opportunities and the
    rewards so glorious.
</p>
<p>
    You are often remembered in his prayers in the Holy Shrines, and he is
    supplicating that you may be richly blessed, and meet with success in both
    your teaching efforts and in your personal affairs.

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friend:
</p>
<p>
    Thank you for your loving letter of April 26th, giving a detailed report
    concerning the settlement work carried forward so efficiently by your
    important committee.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian wishes to have a street address in all of the countries where
    Bahá’ís are located; and for that reason, he would appreciate it if it is
    possible for you to give him the street address or Post Office address in
    Labrador of Mr. Gilliland.
    <a href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133" title="">
        [**********************************]
    </a>
    Of course, being in the military service, this may be impossible. On the
    other hand, perhaps you can give the exact location of Bruce Matthew,
    <a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" title="">

    who is in Goose Bay.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian has been hoping that Mr. Rakovsky
    <a href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135" title="">
        [‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]
    </a>
    might be able to achieve success in connection with the location of someone
    in Anticosti. He realizes that this is a very difficult assignment, but
    feels that the hand of Bahá’u’lláh will assist those who arise to carry on
    this work, and that the doors will open, somehow or other. He hopes your
    committee and the National Assembly will realize the great importance of
    someone being settled in Anticosti, and will continue to press the matter.
</p>
<p>
    With regard to the plan of Miss Edythe MacArthur
    <a href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136" title="">
        [§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§]
    </a>
    to leave the Queen Charlotte Islands in order to settle in some more
    distant area, it appears that Miss MacArthur is the only Bahá’í in the
    Queen Charlotte Islands and, inasmuch as this is one of the virgin areas of
    the Crusade, it would seem inadvisable for her to leave unless of course
    there are other pioneers who could enter it, or unless she has confirmed
    two or three of the people living permanently in that island.
</p>
<p>
    As I have written all National Assemblies, the Guardian attaches the
    greatest importance to the teaching work in these newly-settled virgin
    areas, and has written every National Assembly to see that the pioneers do
    not leave unless there is some emergency involved.
</p>
<p>
    So far as Africa is concerned, the countries are now fairly well settled on
    an initial basis. The only area not settled is Spanish Guinea, and if Miss
    MacArthur could settle there, and your committee can send another pioneer
    to the Queen Charlotte Islands, he feels that would be permissible and
    highly meritorious.
</p>
<p>
    As you know, the Guardian attaches the utmost importance to Greenland, and
    he therefore hopes that if Mr. Palle Bischoff
    <a href="#_ftn137" name="_ftnref137" title="">
        [***********************************]
    </a>
    does leave Greenland this summer, that your committee will undertake to
    have a new pioneer there before he leaves. The teaching work in that
    important country must go forward, and the Guardian is hopeful that nothing
    whatsoever will prevent this being done.
</p>

    With loving Bahá’í greetings, I am,

    Your letter of March 17th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he

<p>
    He deeply appreciates your desire to pioneer, and your unrestricted offer
    to do whatever you can in whatever field he advises.

    He will be very happy to see you in the pioneer field. However, he
    considers that at the present time the national work in Canada has been
    weakened through Freddie’s

<p>
    In view of this, he advises you to continue living where you are and
    helping with the national work, which, if weakened to too great an extent
    through the departure of all the most active members of the National
    Assembly, will suffer spiritually, and even endanger, he fears, the success
    of their part of the Ten Year Plan. Perhaps, at a later date, when the
    national work is in a stronger position, it will be possible for you to
    enter the pioneering field.
</p>
<p>

    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of April 19th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he
    has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He is very happy to have this opportunity of welcoming you personally into
    the service of our Faith; and hopes that, both in your professional career
    as a social worker, and in your life as a Bahá’í, you will be able to help
    many needy and troubled souls.
</p>
<p>
    Amongst the many other evils afflicting society in this spiritual low water
    mark in history, is the question of immorality, and overemphasis of sex.
    Homosexuality, according to the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, is spiritually
    condemned. This does not mean that people so afflicted must not be helped
    and advised and sympathized with. It does mean that we do not believe it is
    a permissible way of life; which, alas, is all too often the accepted
    attitude nowadays.
</p>
<p>
    We must struggle against the evils in society by spiritual means, and
    medical and social ones as well. We must be tolerant but uncompromising,
    understanding but immovable in our point of view.
</p>
<p>
    The thing people need to meet this type of trouble, as well as every other
    type, is greater spiritual understanding and stability; and of course we
    Bahá’ís believe that ultimately this can only be given to mankind through
    the Teachings of the Manifestation of God for this Day.
</p>
<p>
    He will pray that you may be successful in your services to mankind as a
    Bahá’í.
</p>

    With kind regards,

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of May 13th with enclosures has been received by the beloved
    Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    The Bahá’í rosary has no significance, whatsoever, except to enable the
    person who is repeating something a set number of times to concentrate on
    the meaning of the words, and not have to count at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    It does not matter in the least how the rosaries are made up, or whether
    one uses one or not. Some people seem to be able to concentrate, and at the
    same time remember the number, without any difficulty.
</p>
<p>
    If you like to make rosaries and share them with your friends, that is your
    privilege. He certainly, however, does not see why it should in any way be
    a bone of contention.

    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of May l8th, giving your permanent postal address, has
    just come to hand.
</p>
<p>
    The Beloved Guardian was very happy to learn of the recovery of Ted, and of
    your happiness, and feeling of being at “home” in the far north country.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf; that every obstacle
    may be overcome, and you win new and fresh victories for the Faith. The
    Guardian welcomed advice of the teaching work you are doing. He urges you
    to concentrate on the native population, as it is for that reason that we
    have opened new countries to the Faith. After all, Europeans, Americans,
    etc., can become Bahá’ís in their home lands. We have entered new fields
    all over the world, to bring the light of Divine Guidance, to the native
    populations; who have thus far been deprived of the spiritual teachings of
    Bahá’u’lláh.
</p>
<p>
    May you be confirmed in this teaching effort among the natives. The great
    goal would be an Assembly in Whitehorse, made up of native Bahá’ís, or at
    least the majority natives.

    The Guardian sends you his loving greetings.

    To the Treasurer of the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of April 26th, enclosing contribution to the
    International Fund of $355.00, which included contributions from the
    Assemblies of Ottawa and Hamilton, and gifts from Miss ..., and Mr. ...,
    has been received by the Beloved Guardian, and he has directed me to
    acknowledge it on his behalf. The contributions to the International Fund
    are deeply appreciated. Receipts are enclosed herewith. Will you please
    send them on to the donors, with the Guardian’s appreciation.
</p>
<p>
    The Friends in Canada have acquitted themselves marvellously during the
    First Year of the Ten Year Crusade, which has given the Guardian much
    happiness. He is looking expectantly to Canada, and the Canadian friends to
    carry the Banner of the Faith, to new heights, during the second phase of
    the Crusade, now opening. The keynote of this second phase, is more
    Assemblies, more Groups, more Isolated Centres. A rapid multiplication of
    Bahá’í Centres is most important. The peoples of the world are now prepared
    for the Message. It remains for the Bahá’ís to arise with determination,
    consecration, and devotion, to zealously teach the Faith and quicken the
    souls.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian will pray for the success of the sacrificing efforts of the
    Friends. He sends the members of the National Assembly, his loving
    greetings.

<p>
    15 June 1954
</p>
<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    The letters of your Assembly dated June 1, July 1 and 29, August 7 and 31,
    October 4 and 19 and November 27, 1953, and January 27, March 25 and 29,
    April 2 and 22 and May 8, and May 18, May 25 (two), 1954, with enclosures,
    have all been safely received, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me
    to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Although a number of the matters raised in your various letters have been
    attended to by cable, he is sorry that he has not been able to answer the
    letters of your Assembly sooner. It is becoming increasingly difficult for
    him to get around to National Assembly letters at all.
</p>
<p>
    During the past year, the Canadian Bahá’í Community has gone through a
    great many experiences of both a sad nature and a pleasant one.
</p>
<p>
    The loss of the dear Hand of the Cause, Freddie Schopflocher,
    <a href="#_ftn143" name="_ftnref143" title="">
        [‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]
    </a>
    is going to be much felt. He was so intensely loyal, so vigilant in
    watching over the interests of the Faith, so steadfast and tenacious in
    serving it, that he will be much missed in the national work. For over
    thirty years, he promoted, not only the interests of the Faith, but those
    of the Canadian Bahá’í Community, and rendered on a national and an
    international scale, through contributions and many teaching trips,
    valuable services to the Cause of God.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian was very happy that dear Fred could be buried so close to
    Sutherland Maxwell.
    <a href="#_ftn144" name="_ftnref144" title="">

    Montreal has indeed been blessed in more ways than one; and, as the Mother
    Community of Canada, should become increasingly active and united, and live
    up to the high expectations the Master cherished for her future, and prove
    herself worthy of the many blessings she has already received....
</p>
<p>
    Another thing which your community has had to pass through this year—both a
    blessing and a calamity—is the departure of so many active members
    <a href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145" title="">
        [*************************************]
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="#_ftn146" name="_ftnref146" title="">

    </a>
    of your National Body for pioneer fields abroad. It should be a source of
    great pride that one-third of the membership of your Body set sail for such
    distant goals, and will render services during the Ten Year Crusade, of
    such a nature, he feels sure, as to bestow honour upon the entire Canadian
    Community.
</p>
<p>
    He likewise feels that you have every reason to be satisfied over the
    progress which has been made during the first year of the Plan in settling
    the goals entrusted to your care. It is very unfortunate that Anticosti
    should prove such a hard nut to crack. He appreciates very much the
    determined efforts which your Body, and particularly Mr. Rakovsky,
    <a href="#_ftn147" name="_ftnref147" title="">
        [‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]
    </a>
    made to get a pioneer into it before last Ridván. No doubt eventually your
    efforts will be crowned with success; but you will have to be very tactful
    and careful in order not to arouse a permanently resistant attitude on the
    part of the Company that owns the Island.
</p>
<p>
    In regard to the question you asked about jurisdiction, the area of
    jurisdiction is related to the National Spiritual Assembly responsible for
    the teaching work in the goal country in question, and has nothing to do
    with what nation the territory belongs to. All Canadian goals are therefore
    under the jurisdiction of your National Body, and their pioneers must
    report to you, and people, whose declarations are accepted, should be
    registered by your National Body, or the Committee in charge of the work,
    as the case may be.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding the question as to whether your Assembly need do anything about
    its Israel Branch here: this is a matter which concerns entirely local
    legal procedures. Your Canadian Branch has now been legally established,
    and is entitled to hold property in this country; and he is planning at an
    early date to register a piece of land in its name. He will send you the
    title deed as soon as all formalities have been carried out.
</p>
<p>
    As he has already informed you by cable, he feels that the land which you
    proposed as a Temple and National Hazíratu’l-Quds site was altogether too
    large, too expensive, and above all, too far from the city limits. He has
    given similar instructions to a number of other national bodies who were
    pursuing their investigations in a direction much the same as your own. He
    realizes that it is difficult, and much more expensive, to find a plot
    close to the heart of the city. On the other hand, he feels that even a
    small plot, near to town, is much more reasonable from every standpoint
    than a large plot way out in the country. The friends must remember that
    they have to be able to get out to their National Centre and their National
    Temple and use them; and, as Bahá’ís are all busy, hardworking people for
    the most part, the time involved must inevitably influence their attendance
    at Bahá’í meetings in the Hazíratu’l-Quds, and later, Bahá’í services in
    the Temple.
</p>
<p>
    If the filling of the goals and the purchase of the Temple site can be
    accomplished before the lapse of two years from the inception of the Plan,
    he feels you will have carried out his instructions to the letter, and he
    will indeed be very happy.
</p>
<p>
    He thinks that it is very befitting that your Body, as representatives of
    the Canadian Bahá’ís, should be responsible for the erection of a tombstone
    over dear Fred Schopflocher’s grave.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148" title="">

    </a>
</p>
<p>
    As you no doubt are aware, he cherishes the very brightest hopes for the
    future of the Canadian Bahá’ís. They are a fortunate people, possessing
    many of the virtues and few of the faults of both the new and old worlds.
    He remembers them in his prayers in the Holy Shrines, and prays that they
    may speedily advance in the service of the Cause, and accomplish the tasks
    outlined in the Ten Year Plan as their particular portion of the work.
</p>
<p>
    He would like to call your attention, and indeed the attention of all the
    friends, to the fact that it is time for the Bahá’ís everywhere, including
    Canada, to devote themselves to the consolidation work. The goals on the
    homefront are going to be, in some ways, even harder to achieve than those
    abroad. They will require an increase of membership in the community, which
    means patient and devoted teaching, the multiplication of both Assemblies
    and groups, the incorporation of many Spiritual Assemblies, etc. They now
    have nine years in which to do it, but the sooner they get some of the work
    finished and behind them, the better! We can never tell what the situation
    may be at a later date, and whether we will not have to carry on our
    labours under much more difficult circumstances than those prevailing at
    present.

</p>
<p>
    P.S.—Regarding the contribution which Mrs. ... wishes to make to the Faith,
    the Guardian is deeply touched by the spirit which has motivated her; and
    he feels that she could spend it in no better way than to give it to the
    British National Spiritual Assembly for their National Hazíratu’l-Quds.
    They are much in need of money, and it would be of real help in purchasing
    this important and historic institution.
</p>
<p>
    Please assure her of his admiration for her services, and his loving
    prayers.
</p>
<p>
    I notice that I have neglected to answer your question concerning Mrs. ...
    consent to her daughter’s marriage: this must be given in order to be a
    Bahá’í Marriage. Bahá’u’lláh requires this and makes no provision about a
    parent changing his or her mind. So they are free to do so. Once the
    written consent is given and the marriage takes place, the parents have no
    right to interfere any more.
</p>
<p>
    P.S.—The Guardian was very pleased about the publications in Ukrainian and
    will place copies in the Mansion Library. Please thank the dear believer

    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    The Canadian Bahá’í Community, having recently entered the second phase of
    the World Spiritual Crusade so auspiciously launched by the followers of
    the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, on the morrow of the hundredth anniversary of the
    birth of His prophetic Mission, may well pride itself on the quality as
    well as the number of achievements which, in both the teaching and
    administrative spheres of Bahá’í activity, have distinguished its
    stewardship to His Cause ever since its emergence as an independent
    national entity in the world-encompassing Bahá’í Brotherhood. Its mission
    in foreign lands has been befittingly inaugurated in the course of the
    opening phase of this world-girdling Crusade. The expansion and
    consolidation of its activities on the homefront have kept pace with the
    progress of the work initiated by its pioneers beyond the borders of its
    homeland in both the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific Islands. It has,
    moreover, launched upon its twofold historic enterprise aiming at the
    acquisition of its new national administrative Headquarters and the
    purchase of the site of its future Temple. It has, in addition, been
    enriched through the donation and legal transfer of a House
    <a href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150" title="">
        [††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††]
    </a>
    uniquely associated with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s historic visit to the Dominion of
    Canada, and destined to be regarded as the foremost Bahá’í Shrine
    throughout that Dominion.
</p>
<p>
    The years immediately ahead must witness an intensification of effort, on
    the part of all of its members, as well as its elected national
    representatives, which will at once safeguard the prizes won in distant
    fields, and lend a notable impetus to the consolidation of its
    administrative institutions within its borders.
</p>
<p>
    The selection of the site for the national Hazíratu’l-Quds and for the
    first Mashriqu’l-Adhkár in Canada must be made with the utmost care and
    promptitude. Measures must, without delay, be taken for the construction of
    the administrative Headquarters of its National Assembly. The process of
    multiplication of isolated centres, groups and Assemblies must gather
    momentum in the course of the current year. The incorporation of firmly
    established Local Spiritual Assemblies must simultaneously be accelerated,
    in order to strengthen the structure of these newly established
    institutions, and pave the way for the establishment of local Bahá’í
    endowments. The one remaining virgin territory assigned to it must be
    speedily opened, and every precaution taken to ensure its preservation in
    the future. Particular attention should be directed to Iceland and
    Greenland, as the two foremost objectives of this community in connection
    with the work of consolidation assigned to its members. The meritorious
    effort exerted so devotedly and patiently by its national elected
    representatives for the purpose of obtaining official recognition by the
    Civil Authorities for the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate

        [‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]
    </a>
    should be pursued with the utmost diligence, vigilance and caution.
</p>
<p>
    While the members of this valiant, this highly gifted, forward marching and
    deeply consecrated community, and particularly its alert and zealous
    national representatives, labour to attain these immediate goals, that
    constitute the distinguishing features and the prime objectives of this
    newly opened phase of the Crusade, the measures initiated recently in the
    Holy Land to transfer eventually part of the international Bahá’í
    endowments on Mount Carmel to the name of the newly-established Branch of

    African continent—such a community can well assert its capacity and
    determination to consummate, within the allotted time, the laborious and
    mighty task it has risen to shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    The rapidity of its expansion, its sound development, the steadiness, the
    single-mindedness, the tenacity, the enthusiasm, the unity and staunchness
    of its members, augur well for the remarkable material and spiritual
    progress which the nation to which it belongs must achieve in the years to
    come, in accordance with the explicit promise enshrined in the Tablets of
    the Divine Plan by the Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant.
</p>
<p>
    May this community march forward on its destined path with renewed vigour,
    with undimmed vision, with complete unity, with utter consecration, and be
    enabled to play an immortal part in the execution of the great tasks ahead,
    and worthily contribute to the prodigious efforts now being collectively
    exerted by the followers of the Most Great Name, in every continent of the
    globe, for the world-wide establishment and ultimate triumph of a
    long-persecuted, divinely impelled, world-redeeming Faith.

<p>
    30 June 1954
</p>
<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of June 14th has been received by the beloved Guardian,
    and he has directed me to answer it on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Your contribution to the International Interests of the Faith, made in
    memory of your mother, is deeply appreciated. Receipt is enclosed. This
    gift will certainly help your dear one to progress in the realms beyond.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian is very happy with the results of the first year of the Ten
    Year Crusade. 101 virgin areas have been settled, bringing the number of
    countries within the Faith up to 229.
</p>
<p>
    The second year of the Crusade calls for the rapid growth and expansion of
    the Faith in the consolidation areas, and on the home fronts. Each person
    must arise with renewed vigour to teach the Cause of God. Everyone who
    possibly can should disperse to one of the goal cities, either on the home
    front or in the consolidation areas abroad. If the friends everywhere arise
    with the same spirit of devotion, sacrifice and dedication as the pioneers
    in the virgin areas, then victory will surely be achieved in many fields
    during the coming year.
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian assures you of prayers in your behalf. He will pray
    that every obstacle may be removed from your path, so that you may be able
    to serve the Cause diligently and effectively.
</p>
<p>
    The true goal for an individual to seek is to become so filled with the
    spirit that it radiates through him at all times. Dedication and
    consecration are necessary. As one applies himself, gradually what is hard
    at first becomes a habit, and then it becomes a simple matter to carry on
    with good deeds and good service.
</p>
<p>
    You should not become discouraged in any way, but you should each day
    endeavour to become more centred in the Faith; and as you become more
    centred, you will find it becomes a part of your life, and thus there will
    be no difficulty because of outside distractions.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian will pray for the progress of the soul of your dear mother in
    the realms beyond.
</p>
<p>
    Faithfully yours,

<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of August 3rd came duly to hand, and the questions which
    you have raised were presented to our beloved Guardian.
</p>
<p>
    About a year ago, there was some correspondence with your Assembly with
    regard to the Bahá’ís who are in the virgin territories of the Ten Year
    Crusade, etc.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian renews the advice given at that time, that all pioneers in
    virgin areas, or new Bahá’ís who are confirmed in those virgin areas, are
    not part of the National Canadian Bahá’í Community, and cannot vote in
    elections.
</p>
<p>
    The virgin areas are separate, administratively, and under the jurisdiction
    of the National Spiritual Assembly responsible for their development. The
    same ruling applies to any Assemblies which might develop in these virgin
    areas. They do not become part of the National Canadian Bahá’í Community.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian was distressed to learn of the problems which arose concerning
    the election of the Spiritual Assembly of... However, the ruling is quite
    definite, that an Assembly must be elected on the first day of Ridván,
    April 21st. Regretful as it is, ... must now be considered a Group, until
    the elections which take place April 21, 1955.
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian assures you all of his prayers in your behalf. He
    sends you his loving greetings.

</p>
<p>
    Your letter of September 17th has been received by the beloved Guardian,

</p>
<p>
    He considers it will be excellent if you go to Windhoek, as much help is
    needed there.
</p>
<p>
    On your arrival, you should exert every effort to secure some sort of
    employment and establish yourself, so that you may be in a position to lend
    your assistance to the work there, and help to confirm in the Faith a
    number of native believers.

</p>
<p>
    The Guardian urges you to use great caution and tact in making contacts in
    this new field, to proceed with your teaching work with great wisdom; but,
    at the same time, with persistence and perseverance. You should have
    complete confidence in the power of Bahá’u’lláh, regardless of whatever
    difficulties may be encountered.

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of August 31st has been received by the beloved Guardian,
    enclosing contributions from the National Assembly, various Local
    Assemblies and individuals, to the International Bahá’í Fund.

<p>
    These contributions are deeply appreciated by the beloved Guardian.

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian has directed me to write you in connection with a
    recent communication you submitted to him, in which you stated that you
    were pleased to note that the Israel Branch of the National Spiritual
    Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Canada was to be established, and land on Mount
    Carmel registered in your name.
</p>
<p>
    In the Guardian’s Ridván Message of April, 1954, you will note he has
    advised that the Israel Branch of the Bahá’ís of Canada was formed. The
    actual date of the formation was November 20,1953.
</p>
<p>
    The land on Mount Carmel, which the Guardian had instructed be registered
    in the name of the Israel Branch of the Canadian Assembly, was transferred
    to the title of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Canada,
    Israel Branch, on October 1, 1954.
</p>
<p>
    I am attaching hereto, for preservation in your files, the title deed
    covering this particular piece of land, which is Parcel No. 304, Block

    guest of a family living there.
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian is anxious to know if this represents permanent
    settlement of the Anticosti Islands by Miss Zabolotny, or if this

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:

<p>
    Your letter of January 8th with enclosures has been received by the beloved
    Guardian, and he has instructed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.

<p>
    He deeply appreciates the various contributions to the International
    Interests of the Faith. Receipts are enclosed herewith. Will you please
    send to each one of the donors his receipt, with the Guardian’s
    appreciation.
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian has been greatly encouraged by the reports reaching
    him from all parts of the world in connection with the various goals of the
    Ten Year Crusade. The one remaining area of service which is lagging is
    teaching on the home front. He sincerely hopes that all the friends will
    arise as never before and, while there is yet time, actively carry the
    banner of the Faith to new heights.
</p>
<p>
    The Bahá’ís of Canada have shown great strength in their teaching work. He
    feels that the spiritual future of Canada is very bright. The degree to
    which the friends disperse and teach is the degree to which the spirit of
    Bahá’u’lláh will quicken all of Canada. This is the hour of dispersal, and
    the Guardian hopes your Assembly will be able to encourage the friends
    everywhere to open up new cities, towns and villages.

    He will pray for the success of your work, and sends you his loving
    greetings.

</p>
<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you on his behalf and bring
    to your attention a certain matter.
</p>
<p>
    He has heard from a number of sources that some of the Canadian believers
    have been deprived of their voting rights; and he feels that all National
    Spiritual Assemblies should bear in mind that this is the heaviest sanction
    we possess at present in the Faith, short of excommunication, which lies
    within the powers of the Guardian alone; and is consequently a very weighty
    weapon to wield.
</p>
<p>
    He considers that under no circumstances should any Bahá’í ever be
    suspended from the voting list and deprived of his administrative
    privileges for a matter which is not of the utmost gravity. By that he
    means breaking of laws, such as the consent of parents to marriage etc., or
    acts of such an immoral character as to damage the good name of the Faith.
</p>
<p>
    He has informed, some years ago, the American National Spiritual Assembly
    that, before anyone is deprived of their voting rights, they should be
    consulted with and lovingly admonished at first, given repeated warnings if
    they do not mend their immoral ways, or whatever other extremely serious
    misdemeanour they are committing, and finally, after these repeated
    warnings, be deprived of their voting rights.
</p>
<p>
    He feels that a great many problems within the Communities would be solved
    if the believers would more constructively devote their attention to the
    teaching work and carrying out the provisions of the Ten Year Plan as they
    affect Canada. The leadership of your Assembly in these matters will no
    doubt be of great help and inspiration to the friends; and he on his part
    will reinforce you with his prayers.

    The beloved Guardian has been very anxious indeed, as you know, to see the
    purchase of the Hazíratu’l-Quds and Temple Land in Toronto concluded at the
    earliest possible date. He certainly felt that both of these transactions
    would be concluded before the close of the present Bahá’í year. The
    Guardian feels the Faith will be harmed if they are not consummated
    promptly. He feels the prestige of the Cause is at stake.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian requests that the National Spiritual Assembly itself consider
    these projects the most important of any of their responsibilities at the
    present time, and devote such time as is necessary to their conclusions.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian has written to the American National Spiritual Assembly as per

    possible in the attainment of these goals, either through advice, or the

    The beloved Guardian has been greatly concerned over the delay in the

</p>
<p>
    The Canadian National Spiritual Assembly has the funds for these projects,
    but for some reason, the goals are not attained.

    The Guardian has requested your Assembly to render the Canadian Assembly
    every assistance, either through advice or through the visit of one of your
    members, particularly one who has real estate experience, so that these
    projects can be concluded at an early date. He has been hoping they would
    have been concluded quite some time ago, and certainly during the present

    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>

    Your letter of April 10th has been received, and the beloved Guardian was
    very touched by the sentiments you expressed in it, and he has instructed
    me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He suggests that you get in touch with Mr. John Robarts,

        [‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]
    </a>
    and discuss with him the possibility of ... getting a job in Bechuanaland,
    a difficult territory, and where there are only the Robarts pioneering at
    present.
</p>
<p>
    If the way opened, and this seemed the right move for you to take, it might
    lead to greater service to the Faith throughout the African area, at least
    the southern part of it.
</p>
<p>
    If it is not possible to secure a job in Bechuanaland or neighbouring
    territories needing pioneers, he certainly approves of your moving to
    Calgary, and helping to reestablish the Assembly there.
</p>
<p>
    You may be sure he will pray that your services to the Faith may be richly
    blessed wherever you are, and that the way may open for you to render ever
    greater service as time goes by. Wherever you are, you can all be of help
    to the Cause, in Canada with the Indians, or if possible in Africa with the
    Negroes.

    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of April 21st with photographs enclosed has been received, and,
    in spite of the fact that he is extremely busy, the beloved Guardian has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He was very happy to see that you and your husband are united in serving
    the Faith in Prince Edward Island, a centre which is very important, as it
    has been very hard to establish the Assembly there and maintain it. He
    hopes that you both will be instrumental in bringing in new souls, and in
    promoting unity amongst the believers, as this is the basis of all healthy
    Bahá’í community life.
</p>
<p>
    He will pray for you both, for your daughter, and for your success in the
    teaching work.
</p>
<p>
    With Bahá’í greetings,

<p>
    To the Treasurer of the National Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of April 27th has been received by the beloved Guardian,
    together with enclosures; and he has asked me to thank you for the
    contributions which have been made by the National Spiritual Assembly to
    the National Fund, likewise from various individuals, Groups and
    Assemblies, all of which are deeply appreciated by him. Receipts are
    enclosed herewith. He would appreciate your sending the receipts to the
    various contributors.
</p>
<p>
    The entire world is saddened by the reports that have been received of the
    persecutions of the firm believers in Persia, the Cradle of the Faith.
    Certainly these persecutions will release a very strong spiritual influence
    throughout the world; and the Bahá’ís everywhere, outside of Persia, should
    arise with renewed effort, in order to take advantage of this spiritual
    power, and teach the Cause very vigorously. If the Faith spreads rapidly in
    all other parts of the world, then it will mean that the Persian believers
    will not have suffered in vain.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian hopes that the believers who have relative freedom will
    realize under what difficulties the main body of believers are serving in
    Persia, and will therefore arise, in accordance with the spirit of the
    time, to disperse to new centres, to establish Spiritual Assemblies and to
    increase the Bahá’í fold.

<p>
    16 July 1955
</p>
<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letters of July 12, August 15 with enclosures, October 5, 11 (two) and
    26, and December 15, 1954, and February 18 (two), March 23, 31, April 6,
    May 3, 25, 26 1955, have been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He considers the revised criteria you sent him for the Temple and
    Hazíratu’l-Quds land, as outlined in your letter of December 15,
    satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
    He is extremely anxious to have these properties purchased, either together
    in one place, or if this is not feasible, then in two separate places, as
    he has already informed you. Eight of the eleven Temple sites have been
    purchased, and many of them in very difficult places; and he feels very
    strongly that it is a great pity that Canada should be behind-hand in this
    matter, in view of the fact that she is one of the oldest Bahá’í
    Communities in the western world. No doubt the problem is more difficult
    for you to solve, owing to special conditions in Toronto and vicinity; but
    we know that all problems are solvable for the Bahá’ís, with the power of
    God to help them; and he is eagerly awaiting news of your success.
</p>
<p>
    As regards your question about the nature of the endowment, which is one of
    the objectives of your part of the Ten Year Crusade: although the Maxwell
    house
    <a href="#_ftn160" name="_ftnref160" title="">

    </a>
    in Montreal is really a national endowment he feels in conformity to the
    policy being pursued in other countries Canada should acquire one also at
    this time. This may be a small piece of land purchased for Two Thousand
    Dollars or even less, or for that matter, given to the National Assembly as
    a gift. The important point is that Canada should have its own National
    Endowment, as distinguished from the school property.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian does not feel that it is possible or right to change Anticosti
    and to substitute another goal in its place. He fully realizes the
    difficulties involved; but feels convinced that sooner or later, through
    perseverance and prayer, a way will open and a believer will be able to get
    into the Island on a more-or-less permanent basis.
</p>
<p>
    As regards the money you have received on account of the estate of dear
    Fred Schopflocher:<a href="#_ftn161" name="_ftnref161" title="">[*]</a>
    this your Body is free to use for the purposes of the Faith, at its
    discretion.
</p>
<p>
    He hopes that the National Assembly, through its love, wisdom, patience and
    leadership, will carry the members of the Canadian Community forward during
    the coming year on the difficult road leading to the achievement of their
    goals. The spirit of enthusiasm and consecration which animates the
    Canadian Bahá’ís will, he feels sure, bring forth a warm and generous
    response to all the plans made by your Assembly for obtaining your
    objectives.
</p>
<p>
    He assures you, and through you all the members of the Canadian Community,
    that the work in Canada is very dear to his heart, and that he will
    remember you all in his loving prayers in the Holy Shrines.
</p>
<p>
    With warm Bahá’í love,
</p>
<p>
    R. Rabbani
</p>
<p>
    P.S.—He is very happy to see you are expediting building Mr. Schopflocher’s
    grave. The details he leaves to the discretion of your Assembly, as he is
    too busy to go into such matters. The most suitable passages should be
    chosen from his cable regarding Freddie at the time of his death, and
    engraved on the tombstone of this distinguished Hand of the Cause.
</p>
<p>
As regards building the grave of Mr. Maxwell,    <a href="#_ftn162" name="_ftnref162" title="">[†]</a> this has already been
    taken care of by his family. However, he thanks you for the loving offer.
</p>
<p>
    He approves of your taking steps right away to erect a worthy monument on
the grave of dear and heroic Marion Jack.    <a href="#_ftn163" name="_ftnref163" title="">[‡]</a>
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    The steady progress of the manifold activities in which the Canadian Bahá’í
    Community is now so devotedly and unflaggingly engaged is a source of great
    joy and satisfaction to all who have, in recent years, observed its growth
    and noted its consolidation throughout that vast and promising Dominion.
</p>
<p>
    Though some of its most capable and active members have, urged by a
    compelling force to forsake their homes and settle in distant fields,
    ceased to lend to the members of this brave and greatly consecrated
    community their valued support, and though a few others to be reckoned
    among its oldest and most distinguished supporters have passed to the Abhá
    Kingdom, leaving a gap difficult indeed to fill, yet the body of the
    Canadian believers, far from flinching or relaxing in its noble endeavours,
    has amply demonstrated its capacity to assume and discharge its heavy and
    multiple responsibilities, has steadily enlarged the scope of its
    achievements, has preserved its unity, and coherence, and set an inspiring
    example to Bahá’í communities, both young and old, throughout all the
    continents of the globe.
</p>
<p>
    The superb feats achieved by this community’s indomitable pioneers far
    beyond the Arctic Circle, in neighbouring islands of both the Atlantic and
    Pacific Oceans, as well as in far off isolated territories; the
    incorporation of the elected body of its national representatives; the
    notable increase in the number of its members; its response to the urgent
    needs of the National Fund; and the rapid enlargement in the scope of its
    teaching and administrative activities, are all evidences of the intense
    vitality of the faith which animates it, and of the firm attachment of its
    members to the Cause which it has espoused.
</p>
<p>
    Though much bas been achieved in various fields, the work that still
    remains unaccomplished is so vital and urgent that none of its members can
    afford to relax for a moment, or to lose sight of the significance and
    sacredness of the immediate tasks now confronting it.
</p>
<p>
    The virgin areas, so laboriously opened, must, under no circumstances, be
    neglected; nay rather constant attention must be focused upon them in order
    to consolidate the glorious historic work initiated in those areas. The
    island of Anticosti, the one remaining goal as yet unattained, and the only
    island in the Atlantic Ocean as yet unopened in pursuance of the Ten Year
    Plan, should continue to be the object of the special solicitude of the
    national elected representatives of this community. The purchase of the
    site of the Mother Temple of the Dominion of Canada and the establishment
    of the national Hazíratu’l-Quds constitute a double task that can brook no
    further delay, as the entire Bahá’í world, having hailed the erection of
    such an indispensable institution in no less than eighteen countries
    scattered throughout the continents and oceans of the Globe, is now
    intently fixing its eyes on this community, so richly blessed by
    ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, eager to witness this twofold consummation destined to
    considerably enrich the record of the services rendered by its members. The
    acceleration in the process of incorporating firmly established Local
    Assemblies is yet another objective to which the closest attention must be
    paid—a task which will, to a very great extent, contribute, from a legal
    standpoint, to the consolidation of these Assemblies. No less important and
    vital is the multiplication of isolated centres and groups, the rapid
    increase in the number of Local Assemblies, and the steady numerical growth
    of the community—the one enduring foundation on which the security and
    future prosperity of the community must ultimately rest.
</p>
<p>
    The sudden and indeed tragic turn of events in the land of the birth of our
    Faith<a href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164" title="">[§]</a> must act as an
    unprecedented and powerful stimulus to the spirit which animates the
    members of the Canadian Bahá’í Community. It must not, indeed it cannot for
    a moment, dampen their ardour, deflect them from their purpose, or weaken
    their resolve to accomplish the tasks assigned to them under the Ten Year
    Plan.
</p>
<p>
    Conscious of their inescapable, their sacred and multiple responsibilities;
    spurred on by the realization of the great and varied sacrifices being
    made, and the vicissitudes experienced, by the great mass of their
    long-suffering brethren in Bahá’u’lláh’s native land; mindful of the
    prophecies made by the Centre of the Covenant regarding the spiritual and
    material destiny of their country; following the noble and immortal example
    set by the founder<a href="#_ftn165" name="_ftnref165" title="">[**]</a> of
their community and by the two Hands of the Cause    <a href="#_ftn166" name="_ftnref166" title="">[††]</a> ranking among its
    foremost members; encouraged by their own splendid achievements in recent
    years; thankful for the unrestricted freedom enabling them to proclaim,
    unreservedly and far and wide, the fundamental verities of their Faith; and
    fully aware of the shortness of the time allotted to them for the
    performance of their arduous and mighty task, the members of the Canadian
    Bahá’í Community must arise, at this very hour, and evince such a
    wholehearted dedication to the mission they have pledged themselves to
    carry out as to astonish the entire Bahá’í world, and bring everlasting
    consolation to the hearts of the persecuted followers of the Faith in the
    land of its birth.
</p>
<p>
    That this community may rise to this occasion, and may befittingly fulfil
    this glorious mission, and enrich immeasurably the record of its splendid
    and unforgettable achievements is the object of my constant prayer and the
    dearest wish of my heart.

    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian has received your letter of August 8th, and has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He urges you to strive in every possible way to arrange to settle in
    Bechuanaland. This country should be given preference, as it is most
    important to place pioneers there now.
</p>
<p>
    If you find, after making every effort, that you cannot accomplish this,
    then you should bend all your energies toward settling in one of the
    Rhodesias.
</p>

    The beloved Guardian has received your letter of September 25th, and has

</p>
<p>
    As he has already cabled you, he approves of your moving to Calgary, from
    which point you will be working with the Indians in Alberta and
    Saskatchewan, and at the same time reinforcing the efforts of the friends

</p>
<p>
    The teaching of the Indians is of the utmost importance. Although much
    contact work has been done, yet the Red Indian believers are very few in
    number. The Guardian would be very happy indeed to see a large number of
    the Indian race become Bahá’ís, so that the Indians may be properly

</p>
<p>
    To the New Territories Committee
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of October 19th came duly to hand, and its contents were
    presented to the beloved Guardian. The Guardian has instructed me to give
    you the following answers to the questions which you raised:
</p>
<p>
    1. Special situations exist in Alaska, in consideration of which the
    Guardian permitted individuals living in military establishments situated
    close to cities with Bahá’ís to be included in the area of the Assembly of
    that city.
</p>
<p>
    He feels the same situation does not exist in the Yukon, and therefore does
    not approve of this principle for the Yukon Territory. He feels that the
    Bahá’ís must be resident in any city in order to be members of that
    Assembly.
</p>
<p>
    2. The Guardian instructs that in Samoa all of the Holy Days should be
    celebrated in accordance with the Solar calendar, in accordance with the
    practice of the Western Bahá’ís. The Guardian of course has in mind that
    the Bahá’ís in the East follow the Lunar calendar, for certain of the Holy
    Days. He has in mind especially the instructions in the Aqdas with regard
    to the Twin Festivals. However as the Faith develops around the world there
    are many problems involved in the observance of certain of the Holy Days,
    particularly the Twin Festivals according to the Lunar Calendar.
</p>
<p>
    In the future, no doubt all of the Holy Days will follow the Solar
    calendar, and provisions be made as to how the Twin Festivals will be
    celebrated universally.
</p>
<p>
    As indicated above, there are many problems involved in the application of
    the statements concerning the Twin Festivals, which will have to be worked
    out by the House of Justice.
</p>
<p>
    Thus for the present, in all of the western world, and in all of the virgin
    areas as they become settled, even if by pioneers from the East and the
    West, the Solar or Western calendar should be observed.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian sends you and the members of your distinguished committee his
    loving greetings.

</p>
<p>
    Dearly beloved Friends:
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian is very anxious that the purchase of the Temple land
    and the Hazíratu’l-Quds be concluded at an early date.
</p>
<p>
    Canada is the only country which has had funds available for both of these
    important projects. Eleven Temple lands were to be purchased during the Ten
    Year Crusade; and while funds were not available for the other Temple
    lands, yet nine of them have been purchased, and the tenth one is under
    negotiation at the present time.
</p>
<p>
    The entire Bahá’í world is waiting for word that the Temple Lands goal of
    the Ten Year Crusade has been won—and therefore he hopes your Assembly
    itself will look upon this project as its most important task at the
    present time.
</p>
<p>
    Will you please write me for the Guardian just what the present status is,
    and what the National Spiritual Assembly itself can do to bring these
    matters to a successful conclusion—both the purchase of the Temple Land—and
    the Hazírá.

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you the following:
</p>
<p>
    He was sorry to hear that the piece of plaster from the walls of the Prison
of Máh-kú had not been placed in the grave of Mr. Maxwell;    <a href="#_ftn169" name="_ftnref169" title="">[***]</a> and he would like
    the National Assembly, with the greatest of care, to see that somehow or
    other in the foundation of the monument this piece of plaster is carefully
    inserted and preserved; if necessary, the head-stone can be removed, and it
    can be put under it, and the head-stone rebuilt in such a way as not to
    damage the head-stone.
</p>
<p>
    He has decided that, in view of the fact that Anticosti is so extremely
    difficult to get into, the Canadian Assembly can choose some other goal as
    substitute for Anticosti. In other words, a territory or an island in the
    vicinity of Canada, which has never been opened to the Faith, may be opened
    in the place of Anticosti, and thus the goals of the Ten Year Plan will not
    be decreased.<a href="#_ftn170" name="_ftnref170" title="">[†††]</a> On the
    other hand, Anticosti should be maintained as an objective; and every
    effort be made to get a Bahá’í in there.
</p>
<p>
At present, Mr. Allan Raynor    <a href="#_ftn171" name="_ftnref171" title="">[‡‡‡]</a> of your Assembly is
    visiting here, and, although unfortunately he has been laid up with a cold,
    it has been a great pleasure to have a Canadian Assembly member here.
</p>
<p>
    With warmest Bahá’í greetings,
</p>
<p>
    R. Rabbani

<p>
    To the Treasurer of the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letters of January 14th have been received by the Beloved
    Guardian, and he has directed me to respond in his behalf. The
    contributions made to the International Fund are greatly appreciated.
    Receipts are enclosed herewith. Will you please send these receipts to the
    donors, with a note of his appreciation.
</p>
<p>
    The Cause of God is moving rapidly everywhere, especially in the foreign
    fields. The goals in the new countries are rapidly being won. On the home
    fronts, however, the Teaching work seems not to go forward, and the
    Guardian therefore hopes everyone at home will arise with renewed effort to
    teach the Faith and convey the message. Dedication, consecration, and
    perseverance are essential. Until the Friends become reeds through which
    the confirming power of the Holy Spirit may flow, the victories will not be
    won.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf, and in behalf of
    all the Friends. He hopes they will be guided and confirmed in their work.
    He sends each and all his loving greetings.
</p>
<p>
    Faithfully yours,
</p>

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian has been reviewing the progress of the teaching work,
    particularly in the goal areas during the Ten Year Crusade.
</p>
<p>
    Tremendous progress has been achieved. If the few remaining virgin goals of
    the Ten Year Crusade could be promptly settled, and those which were
    settled and again became virgin areas, could again be settled, it would be
    a great victory at this time.
</p>
<p>
    The virgin areas coming under the jurisdiction of the Canadian National
    Spiritual Assembly are Anticosti and Marquesas Islands. Likewise he feels
    it important that Greenland, Newfoundland, Mackenzie and the Yukon be
    reinforced.
</p>
<p>
    It will be appreciated if you will let me know as promptly as possible what
    can be done to establish the Faith solidly in these areas.
</p>

    The beloved Guardian greatly values the devoted services of the Canadian

    To the Treasurer of the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friend:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of May 30th was received by the Beloved Guardian, and he
    has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf. Your contributions sent by
    Mr. ..., Mr. ..., Mr. ..., the Magdalen Islands Group and the Ottawa Local
    Spiritual Assembly, are greatly appreciated. Receipts are enclosed.
</p>
<p>
    The spirit of the hour is teaching on the Home Fronts. Its goal can only be
    won by a new spirit of dedication and consecration on the part of the
    Friends at home. Miraculous victories are being won, in the difficult
    virgin areas, because the pioneers have consecrated their lives to the
    Noble Mission they have embarked upon. The Friends at home must display
    this same consecration and dedication. Never must they let a day pass,
    without teaching some soul, hoping that Bahá’u’lláh will cause each seed to
    grow. The Friends should seek pure souls, gain their confidence and then
    teach that person carefully until he becomes a Bahá’í—and then nurture him
    until he becomes a firm and active supporter of the Faith.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian assures each of you of his prayers in your behalf; that you
    may become a channel for the Holy Spirit, so it may quicken many souls
    through you.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian asks that you express his appreciation of the devotion of the
    Friends making these contributions. Above all he values the spirit that
    animates them. This spirit is the basis of true Bahá’í service. He will
    pray for them and the success of their work.

    26 June 1956
</p>
<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    Your communications with their enclosures and material sent under separate
    cover have all been safely received by the beloved Guardian; and he has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf, and to acknowledge receipt of
    your letters dated: June 1 and 29, July 5, August 5, September 1, October 6
    (two), November 29 and December 2 (three), 1955, and January 30, February
    11 and 29, May 1 (two).
</p>
<p>
The recent news that Anticosti had at last received a pioneer    <a href="#_ftn176" name="_ftnref176" title="">[§§§§]</a> was immensely
    welcome, and enabled the Guardian to take off his list one of the few
    remaining virgin territories (aside from those under Soviet domination) on
    the list of countries to be opened to the Faith under the Ten Year Plan.
</p>
<p>
    The remarkable achievements of the friends during the last three years in
    opening the virgin areas no doubt will be looked back upon by posterity
    with astonishment and admiration; and the Canadian friends have certainly
    played an active part in this process and forged ahead in carrying out
    their own Plan.
</p>
<p>
    He is particularly eager that Iceland should have a Bahá’í nucleus formed,
    a country which has for many years had the blessing of knowing about the
    Faith,<a href="#_ftn177" name="_ftnref177" title="">[*****]</a> but never
    the blessing of resident local Bahá’ís. It deserves particular attention at
    this time.
</p>
<p>
    The achievement of the friends in the far northern territories is a source
    of great pride to him; and his warm admiration surrounds the valiant
    pioneers who, forgetful of self, have arisen to follow ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
    expressed wishes.
</p>
<p>
    Another achievement during the past year of the Canadian friends has been
    the publication of literature in Ukrainian and in some of the Indian
    languages. He feels sure that this will speed up their teaching work
    immensely amongst both of these minorities; and he hopes that more of the
    Bahá’ís will make a special effort to get jobs in the reservations or
    amongst Indian people, so that they can carry to them the Message of
    Bahá’u’lláh.
</p>
<p>
    He was glad to know that a number of Spiritual Assemblies have been
    incorporated, and hopes that this process will also be accelerated during
    the coming months, and that all of the Assemblies that seem to have a firm
    foundation, however small the community may be, will take out their
    incorporation papers.
</p>
<p>
    He hopes that it has been possible to make the arrangements to have Miss
    Jack’s<a href="#_ftn178" name="_ftnref178" title="">[†††††]</a> grave
    built. This is a task which is indeed a precious trust for your Assembly.
    When the friends realize that her grave will become in the future a place
    of visitation, they will appreciate the bounty bestowed upon the Canadian
    Community through being able to claim one of the most distinguished of all
    pioneers as a member of their Community.
</p>
<p>
It was a great pleasure to him to have Mr. Raynor,    <a href="#_ftn179" name="_ftnref179" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡]</a> a member of your
    Assembly, as his guest here in the Holy Land, and he feels sure that this
    contact has forged yet another link between the Canadian Bahá’ís and the
    World Centre.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding various matters raised in your letters: there is nothing in the
    Teachings to prevent a Bahá’í from willing his body for medical research
    after death. However, it should be made clear that the remains must be
    buried eventually and not cremated, as this is according to Bahá’í law.
</p>
<p>
    He was very sorry to hear of the prolonged inharmony in the ... Bahá’í
    Community.... Some of the younger believers, from letters and reports
    received here, seem to lack a firm grounding on such matters as the Will
    and Testament and the deeper spiritual teachings of the Faith. Whenever the
    grasp of these fundamentals is weak, the friends are almost sure to pay
    undue attention to secondary procedures, to quibble over details, to lose
    themselves in personalities, and to founder in a sea of unnecessary
    inharmony. This has nothing to do with their devotion, their loyalty, their
    zeal, their eagerness to serve. It is merely a question of not having
    received, perhaps through lack of sufficient teachers to carry on the
    all-important work of deepening the friends in their own faith, a strong
    enough education in the Covenant before the duties and responsibilities of
    the Administrative Order were thrust upon them.
</p>
<p>
    He has the greatest confidence in the abilities, and the loyalty and
    devotion of the Canadian friends. They have proved themselves over and over
    again, and distinguished their community through acts of great sacrifice,
    vision, courage and devotion. He hopes that, during the coming year, your
    Assembly will be able to send out more teachers, to assist the friends in
    grasping the fundamentals of the Faith, in uniting them, and stimulating
    their desire to do more in the teaching field. If the supply of teachers is
    limited in Canada—and the area to be covered is certainly vast!—perhaps
    your Sister Assembly in the United States can help through lending visiting
    teachers.
</p>
<p>
    He assures all the members of the National Assembly of his loving prayers
    for the success of your indefatigable labours.
</p>
<p>
    With warm Bahá’í love,
</p>
<p>
    R. Rabbani
</p>
<p>
    P.S.—As regards the question about a person who is mentally ill attending
    the Feasts, anybody who is well enough mentally to attend a Bahá’í Feast
    and understand what it is all about is certainly well enough to be a voting
    member. Only people who are very seriously deranged mentally and confined
    to institutions or under constant supervision should be deprived of their
    voting rights.
</p>
<p>
    Regarding your question of applying the sanction of suspension of voting
    rights to people who marry without the consent of parents, this should be
    done from now on. The law of the Aqdas is explicit and not open to any
    ambiguity at all. As long as the parents are alive, the consent must be
    obtained; it is not conditioned on their relationship to their children. If
    the whereabouts of the parents is not known legally, in other words, if
    they are legally dead, then it is not necessary for the children to obtain
    their consent, obviously. It is not a question of the child not knowing the
    present whereabouts of its parents, it is a question of a legal thing—if
    the parents are alive, they must be asked.
</p>
<p>
    As regards the question of alcohol, the Guardian explained this to Mr.
    Raynor,<a href="#_ftn180" name="_ftnref180" title="">[§§§§§]</a> and he
    feels that his understanding of it is quite correct. The Assemblies must be
    wise and gentle in dealing with such cases, but at the same time must not
    tolerate a prolonged and flagrant disregard of the Bahá’í Teachings as
    regards alcohol.
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    The Canadian Bahá’í Community, whose members are so valiantly participating
    in the furtherance of the World Spiritual Crusade, now claiming the
    attention of the entire body of followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in
    all continents of the globe, has ever since the inception of this
    world-embracing enterprise, proved itself capable of carrying its share of
    responsibility in the accomplishment of this collective, colossal task, and
    has rendered services that have enriched the annals of the Faith, not only
    in a land so dear to the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but in far-off islands and
    territories which it is the mission of this Community to illuminate and
    conquer.
</p>
<p>
    Ever since the emergence of this progressive, youthful and dynamic
    community, as an independent entity, and particularly since the inception
    of the Ten Year Plan, it has demonstrated, on several occasions, those
    qualities which alone can provide the guarantee of success in carrying out,
    as a worthy ally of her sister community in the Great Republic of the West,
    the sacred and historic Mission assigned to it by the Author of the Tablets
    of the Divine Plan. The staunchness of the faith of its members, their
    unyielding resolve, their ceaseless efforts, their willingness to
    sacrifice, their exemplary loyalty, their steadfast courage, have, time and
    again, been strikingly displayed, and served to fortify the hopes which I
    have always cherished for their future destiny.
</p>
<p>
    The vastness of the field in which this firmly knit, irresistibly
    advancing, steadily consolidating community now operates, stretching as it
    does from the Atlantic to the Pacific seaboards, and touching, on the one
    hand, the fringes of the Arctic Region, and extending, on the other, as far
    as the islands of the South Pacific, contrasts with the extremely
    restricted area, in which, for so many years, and until recently, the
    administrative activities of this community were confined. The diversity
    and multiplicity of the enterprises in which it finds itself now engaged,
    the manner in which it is consolidating its strength, enlarging its
    membership, safeguarding the unity of its members, and noising abroad its
    fame, may be regarded as additional evidences of its spiritual vigour, and
    of its rapid rise to maturity at so significant a period in the evolution
    of the Faith throughout the Western Hemisphere.
</p>
<p>
    At this crucial hour, when the Plan to which this highly promising
    community stands committed is entering on the third phase in its
    unfoldment, the responsibilities confronting its members are at once
    manifold, pressing and inescapable. The situation on the homefront, so
    extensive and so varied in character, calls for careful consideration and
    energetic action on the part of your Assembly. The steady increase in the
    number of those enlisted under the banner of the Faith must be paralleled
    by a multiplication of Assemblies, groups and isolated centres. The
    incorporation of all firmly established Assemblies must simultaneously be
    accelerated. The virgin areas now opened, and particularly Anticosti,
    Greenland, Iceland and Franklin, as well as those territories deprived
    recently of the benefits of a resident pioneer, must be made the object of
    the special attention and solicitude of your Assembly, for upon the
    preservation of these hard-won prizes must depend the ultimate triumph of
    this community’s collective and historic task, and the enhancement of the
    prestige it has deservedly won in recent years throughout the Bahá’í world.
</p>
<p>
    Of equal importance is the strenuous yet highly meritorious obligation to
    add, steadily and rapidly, to the number of the American Indian and Eskimo
    adherents of the Faith, and to ensure their active participation in both
    the teaching and administrative spheres of Bahá’í activity—a task so
    clearly emphasized by the Pen of the Centre of the Covenant, and in the
    consummation of which the Canadian Bahá’í Community is destined to play so
    conspicuous a part.
</p>
<p>
    Above all, the utmost endeavour should be exerted by your Assembly to
    familiarize the newly enrolled believers with the fundamental and spiritual
    verities of the Faith, and with the origins, the aims and purposes, as well
    as the processes of a divinely appointed Administrative Order, to acquaint
    them more fully with the history of the Faith, to instil in them a deeper
    understanding of the Covenants of both Bahá’u’lláh and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, to
    enrich their spiritual life, to rouse them to a greater effort and a closer
    participation in both the teaching of the Faith and the administration of
    its activities, and to inspire them to make the necessary sacrifices for
    the furtherance of its vital interests. For as the body of the avowed
    supporters of the Faith is enlarged, and the basis of the structure of its
    Administrative Order is broadened, and the fame of the rising community
    spreads far and wide, a parallel progress must be achieved, if the fruits
    already garnered are to endure, in the spiritual quickening of its members
    and the deepening of their inner life.
</p>
<p>
    The duties incumbent upon this community, and particularly its elected
    national representatives, multiply with every passing day. Heavy is the
    burden they carry. Rich and immense are the possibilities stretching before
    them. Priceless are the rewards which a befitting discharge of their
    multiple responsibilities must bring in its wake. Boundless are the favours
    and bestowals which a loving and watchful Providence is ready to confer

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of June 20th has come to hand, and the Guardian has
    directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf. The contributions to the
    International Fund are greatly appreciated. Receipts are enclosed herewith,
    which please send to the donors with the appreciation of the Guardian;
    especially the pioneers in the Magdalen Islands, and in Newfoundland. He
has written a letter directly to Mr. Harrison,    <a href="#_ftn181" name="_ftnref181" title="">[******]</a> in which he has
    acknowledged the gift made in behalf of his wife, for the work in Africa.
</p>
<p>
    The work of the Canadian Bahá’ís is exemplary, and through their
    sacrificial devotion, many victories are being won for the Faith. He is
    hopeful, that the new Bahá’í Year we are entering will see rapid spread of
    the Faith in Canada, with Groups being developed into Assemblies, Isolated
    Centres into Groups, and many new Centres opened.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf. He sends loving
    greetings.

<p>
    The Beloved Guardian has received your kind gift to be used for the

    his behalf, and to inform you that it will be used as you wish, in memory
    of your dear wife. Receipt is enclosed herewith.

<p>
    The Beloved Guardian wishes you to know how deeply he cherishes and values
    your long and devoted services to the Cause of God. You are one of the
    pioneers of the Faith in Canada, in the days of the Beloved Master. Now you
    are pioneering in a virgin area, in the days of the Guardian, who is
    striving so diligently to fulfil all the Master’s instructions; especially
    in the teaching field. Well is it with you, that you have arisen to win the
    goals the Master has set before us. The Guardian is sure the Master will
    both guide and confirm you in this noble mission.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf; that every obstacle
    will be overcome, and you win many souls to the Water of Life, and Eternal
    Salvation, through the Outpourings of the Holy Spirit, through Bahá’u’lláh.
    He sends you his loving Greetings.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian feels this gift for the African work, made in the name of your
    wife, will give her great happiness in the realms beyond. It will be a

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of June 25 has been received, and the beloved Guardian has
    instructed me to answer it on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    As regards the questions you have asked:
</p>
<p>
    We should try not to introduce any set patterns into our teaching methods;
    however, if this form of group meditation produces unity and a deeper
    understanding of the teachings, he sees no reason why it should be not used
    at least in the beginning of a teaching class—providing the people want to,
    like it, and fully understand it has nothing to do with the teachings of
    the Faith, but is a method which sometimes proves helpful.
</p>
<p>
    Fruitless sciences is what Bahá’u’lláh refers to, like metaphysical hair
    splittings, and other abstract things carried to the extreme.
</p>
<p>
    The friends should be encouraged not to waste time on such things as
    astrology, etc., which you mention. They cannot be forbidden to do so. The
    exercise of our free will to choose to do the right thing is much more
    important.
</p>
<p>
    There is no “grace” in the Bahá’í teachings; the Guardian doubts if the
    words are those of the Báb, they may be, but, unless he saw the source in
    the original, he could not be sure.
</p>
<p>
    You should try to reactivate those you taught, but if there continues to be
    no response you had better concentrate on more receptive souls. He thinks
    your teaching efforts have been very fruitful, and you should be very
    happy.
</p>
<p>
    He feels you should consult with the Canadian National Spiritual Assembly
    as to whether you could do more good by pioneering or remaining where you
    are, presenting to them your situation in detail, as they best know the
    needs of the Faith in Canada at the present time.
</p>
<p>
    He will certainly pray that your labours may continue to be blessed, and
    you may confirm many more people in our beloved Faith.
</p>
<p>
    With warmest Bahá’í greetings,
</p>

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of August 16th has been received by the beloved
    Guardian. He has asked me to acknowledge it on his behalf. The contribution
    you have made to the International Fund is greatly appreciated. Receipt is
    enclosed.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian has been following your teaching activities in Canada with
    interest, through reports being received. It is most encouraging to get
    your word of the confirmation of six souls, and great interest on the part
    of others, who may also become Bahá’ís. This indicates the wisdom of
    visiting teachers, who will settle for a time in a goal city or area, so
    the fruits of their labours are developed. Too often our teachers enter a
    city, assist the local friends, stir up interest, and then leave, before
    the results are known. The Guardian hopes more teachers may be able to
    remain in a city, until the fruit is garnered.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian is happy also that you are to devote time now in the southern
    States, which are so pregnant with the clamour of interracial unity. If
    properly taught to the seeking Negro, many souls will enter the Faith. The
    Guardian hopes you will be most successful, so a new movement may take
    place in the teaching work in the South, which has lagged so badly of late.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian will pray for the success of your work, that many seeking
    souls may find eternal life through your sacrificial and devoted services.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian sends you his loving greetings.

    Your loving letter of September 1st has been received by the Beloved

    The Guardian is urgently anticipating word of the renewed teaching efforts
    of the Friends on the “Home Front”, where a stirring impetus is needed. The
    world is today seeking; the Faith is the goal of their search; the Friends
    are the light bearers, showing the way to the Kingdom. If the Friends do
    not arise with enthusiasm and vigour and their light is not burning

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    In reading the minutes of the June National Spiritual Assembly meeting
    which the Guardian recently received he noticed something which he wishes
    to call to the attention of the Canadian National Spiritual Assembly.
</p>
<p>
    He feels that to distribute Bahá’í pamphlets from door to door, as prepared
    by [a Local Spiritual Assembly], is undignified and might create a bad
    impression of the Faith. No doubt, it is the eagerness and devotion of the
    friends there that led them to make this proposal, but he does not think
    the best interests of the Cause are served by such a method. Please inform

</p>
<p>
    There are the vast number of French Canadians who are of Catholic
    persuasion. They would make fine Bahá’ís, and if representative members
    could be brought into the Faith, it will add prestige to the Faith, and
    help solidify its institutions.

<p>
    22 December 1956
</p>
<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    I have been instructed on behalf of our beloved Guardian to answer the
    questions raised in your recent letter.
</p>
<p>
    There are two things which he wishes to impress upon you. The first is that
    depriving people of their voting rights is the heaviest sanction which can
    be imposed at the present time (with the exception of excommunication,
    which is a right the Guardian has never permitted anyone else to exercise).
    Therefore, the greatest care should be exerted to try and remedy a
    situation before depriving anybody of their voting rights, and the action
    itself should only be taken if absolutely necessary.
</p>
<p>
    The other point is that the Guardian is very anxious that no more rules and
    regulations should be introduced by any National Spiritual Assemblies. He
    has continually impressed this upon the American, the British and other
    National Bodies. The spirit of the Cause will be stifled, the initiative of
    the friends killed, and the teaching work come to a stand-still if the
    friends are continually hemmed in by instructions. In view of this, he has
    instructed the National Bodies to deal with each case as it arises.
</p>
<p>
    The understanding conveyed in the quotation from Principles of Bahá’í
    Administration is correct; also people who are deprived of their voting
    rights should not receive Bahá’í News or Bulletins, as they are no longer
    active in the administrative affairs of the Faith.
</p>
<p>
He is very happy at present to have a member    <a href="#_ftn185" name="_ftnref185" title="">[*******]</a> of your
    Assembly visiting Haifa, and hopes that Miss Harvey will carry back to you
    a fresh impetus from the Holy Land, which will assist the Canadian Assembly
    members in carrying on their many heavy burdens in the service of the
    Faith.

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write you concerning the important
    matter of teaching the minorities of Canada.
</p>
<p>
He has spoken in some detail to Miss Harvey    <a href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186" title="">[†††††††]</a> concerning the
    subject, and she can and will amplify this communication.
</p>
<p>
    He feels it most important that active work be done in connection with the
    French Canadians, Eskimos, and Indians. You are also now actively in touch
    with the Poles and Ukrainians in your country.
</p>
<p>
    In order to intensify this work, the Guardian feels you should establish a
    Minorities Teaching Committee, with sub-committees to specialize in the
    teaching of the French Canadians, Eskimos, and Indians. As the work
    spreads, you can add other sub-committees, such as one for Eastern Europe,
    or the countries under active consideration. In other words, sub-committees
    might be formed for regional areas of the globe, where their people form a
    goodly number of inhabitants of Canada.
</p>
<p>
    Thus you would now have a Minorities Committee, with sub-committees to
    specialize in the teaching work of the Eskimos, another sub-committee for
    the Indians, another for the French Canadians, and another one for the
    Poles and Ukrainians.

</p>
<p>
    In such reports sent him of the Assemblies, Groups, and Isolated Centres,
    as well as the number of Bahá’ís, in Canada, you should not include data
    concerning the virgin areas without Canada such as Baranof Island,
    Greenland, etc. These should be kept separately, and reported separately to
    him.
</p>
<p>
    Later, it will be decided just what National Bodies these virgin areas will
    report to, but for the present, they are to be considered independent

    He feels that the work in Canada is certainly very urgent, and hopes that
    you will be able to assist on the Home Front. However, if you have to make
    a choice between teaching at a summer school or going to Austria and
    helping with the work there, he would certainly recommend Austria. The
    prospects are good in many towns there at present; and the help of a
    German-speaking Bahá’í, who can give a lecture and who has the added
    attraction of coming from far away, would undoubtedly lend an impetus to
    the work at this time.

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of January 26th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and
    he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He was very happy to hear of the response of the Ottawa Community to the
messages which Miss Winnifred Harvey    <a href="#_ftn187" name="_ftnref187" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> conveyed to
    them. It makes a great difference to make the personal contact of a
    returning pilgrim, and the Guardian feels sure that many of the friends
    would arise and do pioneer work if they grasped the privilege and the
    importance of it. The contact with a visitor from Haifa is naturally a
    vivid experience, and he feels sure will be a great stimulation to not only
    the Ottawa friends but others.
</p>
<p>
    He appreciates very deeply your sending him the maps, and will be happy to
    receive them.
</p>
<p>
    Please convey to those who have responded to the teaching call his sincere
    appreciation.
</p>
<p>
    He assures you one and all of his loving prayers for the success of your
    devoted labours.
</p>
<p>
    With warm Bahá’í greetings,

<p>

</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer certain matters raised in
    your recent correspondence with him.
</p>
<p>
    He is delighted to see that substantial progress is being made in Samoa. It
    is too early for him to say under whose administrative jurisdiction the
    Samoan Bahá’ís will come in the future. It will probably be Australia, but
    at the present time, these things have not been definitely settled.
</p>
<p>
    People who have withdrawn from the Cause because they no longer feel that
    they can support its Teachings and Institutions sincerely are not
    Covenant-breakers—they are non-Bahá’ís and should just be treated as such.
    Only those who ally themselves actively with known enemies of the Faith who
    are Covenant-breakers, and who attack the Faith in the same spirit as these
    people, can be considered, themselves, to be Covenant-breakers. As you
    know, up to the present time, no one has been permitted to pronounce
    anybody a Covenant-breaker but the Guardian himself.
</p>
<p>
    With warm Bahá’í greetings, and assuring you all of his prayers for the
    success of your important work,

    He hopes that the work in Hamilton and its vicinity will advance rapidly
    during the coming year, and that, through the efforts of the Hamilton
    Bahá’ís, a new Spiritual Assembly in that region will come into existence
    by next Ridván. This might well be your private one year plan!

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of May 2nd, was duly received by the Beloved Guardian
    and he has directed me to acknowledge it in his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Enclosed are receipts for the contributions made to the International Fund.
    Will you please send these on to the donors with the Guardian’s
    appreciation.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian is well pleased with the active teaching work of the Canadian
    Believers. He hopes that they will redouble their efforts however because
    the world is being shaken to its foundations and the people are seeking. If
    the Bahá’ís will arise as never before to teach the Cause they will find
    many listeners and many will find eternal life through their sacrificial
    efforts.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian will pray for you, for the members of the National Assembly

    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter dated May 9, 1957, with enclosures, has been received, and the
    beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He has read your letter and the sheets of correspondence with the European
    Teaching Committee which you enclosed, and he feels that you are not seeing
    the situation in a clear light; according to the Administrative Order laid
    down by the Master it is the bodies responsible for the work who bear the
    full responsibility. Now that you have in full detail acquainted the
    European Teaching Committee—and through them the American National
    Spiritual Assembly—with the situation as you see it, your duty is done, and
    you should stop worrying over the Cause there and leave the entire matter
    to the new National Spiritual Assembly for Scandinavia and Finland. In
    fact, as this entire situation has upset you so deeply, he advises you to
    pioneer elsewhere, if not in Europe then on the Home Front in Canada, where
    the need is also great. As the European Teaching Committee is willing to
    pay your fare home he thinks this may be the best plan for you. As I said,
    Canada needs workers very much at this time.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, if you get a favourable reply regarding Spitsbergen that would
    have first priority as far as your future plans go. However, as it is
    exceedingly difficult to get in there, particularly, he understands for a
    woman, to return to Canada will probably be your wisest course of action.
</p>
<p>
    He deeply appreciates the spirit of service which animates you, and will
    pray for the success of your future work for our beloved Faith.

<p>
    4 June 1957
</p>
<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Friends:
</p>
<p>
    The Beloved Guardian has noted your letter of February 15th, addressed to
    the National Teaching Committee, other committees and Local Assemblies
    giving advice concerning Teaching methods in Canada.
</p>
<p>
    The Beloved Guardian noted that in paragraph 3 you mention that no teachers
    have the authority to interpret more accurately than others: that every
    teacher is bound to interpret to some degree but the more he appreciates
    the Faith, the less will he be inclined to be dogmatic, etc.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian feels that this paragraph will cause great confusion amongst
    the friends.
</p>
<p>
    The Will and Testament of Bahá’u’lláh and the Will and Testament of the
    Master clearly and explicitly indicate that the Interpreter of the Word was
    the Centre of the Covenant and now is the Guardian. There are no other
    Interpreters whatsoever and no individual may interpret. This is strictly
    forbidden.
</p>
<p>
    No doubt the intent of this paragraph was to indicate that the Bahá’í
    teachers in making explanation of Divine Truths must give their
    understanding of the Divine Truths: explanations that have been clarified
    for them in study classes, summer schools, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Divine Truth is relative and that is why we are enjoined to constantly
    refer the seeker to the Word itself—and why any explanations we make to
    ease the journey of the soul of any individual must be based on the Word
    and the Word alone.
</p>
<p>
    If there is a wide divergence in the understandings of the Friends of the
    Teachings then the National Assembly should arrange for study classes on
    such points—and particularly the Summer Schools.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian feels the letter of February 15th should be withdrawn.

<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of June 10th has been received, and the beloved Guardian has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    He advises you not to make a teaching trip around the world, as the results
    of such a trip would not justify the expense it would entail.
</p>
<p>
    He feels you should concentrate on northern European countries and Austria,
    staying longer, and visiting the small places as well as the larger ones
    where Bahá’ís reside.
</p>
<p>
    Those Bahá’ís who have not yet made the pilgrimage have priority. However,
    he hopes at a future date it will be possible for you to come.

<p>
    18 July 1957
</p>
<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your Assembly’s communications with their enclosures have all arrived
    safely, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his
    behalf, and to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated: June 28, August
    26, September 25 and December 7, 14 and 17, 1956, and February 15, March 19
    and 21, May 15 and 31.
</p>
<p>
    As many of the questions mentioned in your letters have been answered, I
    will not repeat them here.
</p>
<p>
    It is a pity that the Canadian believers are having so much difficulty
    settling the question of both their Temple land and their National
    Headquarters. He was very surprised and distressed to learn that the Temple
    site you had chosen has entirely fallen through, and that you have to begin
    all over again looking for a Temple site. He feels that your Assembly
    should appreciate the fact that the important thing at this time is to
    acquire a Temple site. It does not have to be a very large piece of land,
    and, if the worst comes to the worst, at a future date, when the time comes
    to build a Temple in Canada, it can be exchanged or sold and a better site
    procured; but the question for this present National Body to settle once
    and for all is the purchase of a Temple plot as a beginning in order to
    remove from the Ten Year Plan one of its most important goals, and one the
    accomplishment of which has been dragging too long. He feels that your
    Assembly should also look around for a suitable and permanent
    Hazíratu’l-Quds in Toronto, and try and dispose of the one you have without
    loss, if possible, in order to enable you to acquire the new and he hopes
    permanent one at once.
</p>
<p>
    As regards the matter of those who have withdrawn from the Faith on the
    west coast: as you know, no one has the right to excommunicate anybody
    except the Guardian of the Faith, himself. Those people who have withdrawn
    from the Faith, though critical of it and disgruntled, are not necessarily
Covenant-breakers. If they were associating with Ahmad Sohrab    <a href="#_ftn188" name="_ftnref188" title="">[§§§§§§§]</a> and upholding
    his claims actively, then they would come into an entirely different
    category. If this is the case, you should inform the Guardian, but
    otherwise the friends should be advised to just leave these people alone,
    for their influence can be nothing but negative and destructive, and the
    less they breathe the breath, so to speak, of those who have turned their
    back on the light of this Faith, the better.
</p>
<p>
    It is not enough to bring people into the Faith, one must educate them and
    deepen their love for it and their knowledge of its teachings, after they
    declare themselves. As the Bahá’ís are few in number, especially the active
    teachers, and there is a great deal of work to be done, the education of
    these new believers is often sadly neglected, and then results are seen
    such as the resignations you have had recently. In this respect, the Summer
    Schools can be of the greatest help to the friends, new and old Bahá’ís
    alike, for in them they can study, and enjoy the feeling of Bahá’í
    companionship which is, alas, usually lacking in their home communities,
    owing to the smallness of their numbers.
</p>
<p>
    He is very happy to see that the friends are making every effort to execute
    the provisions of the Ten Year Plan, as they apply to the Canadian
    Community. The most urgent of all tasks facing them in connection with the
    execution of their part of the Ten Year Plan is to increase the number of
    Spiritual Assemblies.
</p>
<p>
    The Bahá’ís should realize that today’s intensely materialistic
    civilization, alas, most perfectly exemplified by the United States, has
    far exceeded the bounds of moderation, and, as Bahá’u’lláh has pointed out
    in His Writings, civilization itself, when carried to extremes, leads to
    destruction. The Canadian friends should be on their guard against this
    deadly influence to which they are so constantly exposed, and which we can
    see is undermining the moral strength of not only America, but indeed of
    Europe and other parts of the world to which it is rapidly spreading.
</p>
<p>
    The fortuitous combination of British solidity and good judgement and
    American get-up-and-go and enthusiasm, which has characterized Canada, must
    not be lost in the Canadian Bahá’í Community. Its members must demonstrate
    their outstanding abilities, and, through a greater vision, more
    consecration and renewed self-sacrifice, arise and attain their goals.
</p>
<p>
    He is very happy over the work in the Pacific region in general, and was
    glad to receive word recently of the formation of the Samoan Assembly, a
    feat of which your Assembly can be duly proud. However, the situation in
    the Marquesas needs immediate attention, and every effort should be exerted
    to reinforce the work initiated there, at the cost of much self-sacrifice,
    by the first pioneer.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="#_ftn189" name="_ftnref189" title="">[********]</a>
</p>
<p>
    The work in the north should likewise be consolidated, and every effort
    made to get more pioneers to join those heroic souls already labouring in
    such an infertile field. This applies equally to Labrador and Greenland,
where Bill Carr,    <a href="#_ftn190" name="_ftnref190" title="">[††††††††]</a> the lone
    Canadian pioneer, is demonstrating the Bahá’í spirit in such an exemplary
    manner. It is hard for the friends to appreciate, when they are isolated in
    one of these goal territories, and see that they are making no progress in
    teaching others, are living in inhospitable climes for the most part, and
    are lonesome for Bahá’í companionship and activity, that they represent a
    force for good, that they are like a light-house of Bahá’u’lláh shining at
    a strategic point and casting its beam out into the darkness. This is why
    he so consistently urges these pioneers not to abandon their posts. Apropos
    of this, he hopes that it will again be possible in the near future to get
someone into Anticosti. It is a great pity that the friend    <a href="#_ftn191" name="_ftnref191" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> who went there
    could not remain.
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian sends all the members of your Assembly his loving
    greetings and assures you all of his ardent prayers for your success.
</p>
<p>
    With warm Bahá’í love,
</p>
<p>
    R. Rabbani
</p>
<p>
    [From the Guardian:]
</p>
<p>
    Dear and valued co-workers:
</p>
<p>
    The opening of the second year of the third phase of the Ten Year Bahá’í
    spiritual Crusade presents the entire Canadian Bahá’í Community, and,
    particularly, its elected representatives, with an opportunity, and brings
    them face to face with a challenge, unique since its inception over half a
    century ago.
</p>
<p>
    The achievements that have distinguished the record of its stewardship,
    ever since its founding, and particularly since the launching of the World
    Bahá’í Crusade, both on the homefront and beyond its confines, have been
    such as to ennoble the annals of the Faith to which it is so
    whole-heartedly dedicated, and to arouse in the hearts of all those who
    have watched, throughout succeeding decades, its rise, its emergence into
    independent existence, and its rapid consolidation, feelings of profound
    admiration, of pride and of thankfulness.
</p>
<p>
    The distance that has been traversed, in the course of the four brief years
    since the inauguration of the Ten Year Plan, by a community, still highly
    restricted in numbers and circumscribed in resources, and faced with
    tremendous responsibilities, as a result of the colossal task it has
    willingly shouldered, is admittedly great, and augurs well for its further
    advancement along the path traced for it by the pen of the Centre of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant in His immortal Tablets.    <a href="#_ftn192" name="_ftnref192" title="">[§§§§§§§§]</a>
</p>
<p>
    The utmost care and vigilance, however, should be exercised by this
    youthful and dynamic community, so richly laden with the prizes it has so
    deservedly won, lest the momentum, so painstakingly gained in recent years,
    in both the teaching and administrative spheres of Bahá’í activity, be lost
    or reduced. The standard of dedication and of efficiency, attained, while
    pursuing the goals it has pledged itself to achieve, must never be allowed,
    through apathy, neglect or faint-heartedness, to be lowered. The vision
    that has fired its members, on the occasion of the centenary celebrations
    which witnessed the launching of the Ten Year Plan must, no matter how
    prolonged or arduous the task, never grow dim. Their unswerving fidelity to
    the Covenant established by the Author of their Faith, and their attachment
    to the ideals and precepts enshrined in His Revelation, should, under no
    circumstances, no matter how active and subtle the machinations of its
    enemies, both within and without, be weakened. The momentous and highly
    exacting task, initiated far beyond the confines of their homeland—a task
    which posterity will recognize as the opening chapter of their glorious
    Mission overseas—must be pursued with undiminished diligence, nay with
    redoubled zeal, and renewed determination and dedication. The no less vital
    obligation to expand, and consolidate the manifold activities conducted on
    the homefront, from the Atlantic to the Pacific seaboard, and from the
    northern confines of the Great Republic of the West to the fringes of the
    Arctic Ocean, must be faithfully discharged. The setbacks and difficulties
    that have, unexpectedly and most unfortunately, been recently experienced
    in connection with the acquisition of both the national Hazíratu’l-Quds and
    the site of the future Mother Temple of Canada, must be faced with
    resolution and vigour, and a definite and permanent solution be found which
    will ensure the full attainment of these twofold primary objectives. The
    long overdue conversion of the American Indians, the Eskimos and French
    Canadians, as well as the representatives of other minorities permanently
    residing within the borders of that vast Dominion, must receive, in the
    months immediately ahead, such an impetus as to astonish and stimulate the
    members of all Bahá’í communities throughout the length and breadth of the
    Western Hemisphere. The independent character of the Faith they profess and
    champion must, moreover, be fully vindicated through a closer adherence, on
    the part of the rank and file of the believers, to its distinguishing
    tenets and precepts, as well as through a fuller recognition by the civil
    authorities<a href="#_ftn193" name="_ftnref193" title="">[*********]</a>
    concerned of the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate and of the Bahá’í Holy Days.
    The integrity of the fundamental teachings of the Faith, its security, the
    healthy and steady development, and ultimate fruition, of its nascent
    institutions, must, above all, be ensured and safeguarded, for upon these
    will depend the consummation of the Mission with which the Author of the
    Tablet of the Divine Plan has chosen to entrust them.
</p>
<p>
    The few remaining years, separating the steadfast and high-minded members
    of the Canadian Bahá’í Community, striving so assiduously to achieve their
    goals, from the time fixed for the termination of a swiftly unfolding
    Crusade, are rapidly slipping by. A community which, ever since its
    inception, has, through the instrumentality of its most distinguished
members, and particularly its founder    <a href="#_ftn194" name="_ftnref194" title="">[†††††††††]</a> and those
    nearest to her, as well as a number of her spiritual children and
    associates, won such prizes at the World Centre of the Faith, in Latin
    America, in Europe, in Africa and in the Pacific area—such a community, at
    this crucial hour, cannot afford to either stand still, falter or hesitate.
    As this World Crusade sweeps majestically forward and draws nearer to its
    close, exploits, as superb as those its sons and daughters have
    successively achieved in widely scattered areas of the globe, must continue
    to distinguish and ennoble the imperishable record of its services.
</p>
<p>
    ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s prophetic words regarding the future of its homeland,
    spiritually as well as materially—the initial evidences of which are
    becoming more apparent every day, must not be lost sight of for a moment,
    however exacting and all-absorbing the strenuous task ahead, however
    complex the problems its prosecution involves, however burdensome the
    preoccupations which it must needs engender.
</p>
<p>
    Afire with that same love that burned so brightly in the hearts of its
    earliest pioneers, holding fast to the strong cord of the spiritual
    precepts and administrative principles of the Faith it bas so
    whole-heartedly espoused, confident of its ability to achieve, in its
    entirety, the Mission entrusted to it by the Author of the Tablets of the
    Divine Plan, this community must forge ahead, with undeviating loyalty,
    with indomitable courage, with unbreakable unity, and exemplary
    consecration, striving to scale loftier heights, and widening constantly
    the range of its operations, on the American mainland as well as in
    neighbouring and distant islands, until each and every objective of its
    allotted task has been triumphantly attained.

    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your letter of July 31st with enclosures has been received by the beloved
    Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    The services you have rendered the Faith since leaving Haifa are deeply
    appreciated by him, you may be sure.
</p>
<p>
    He feels the Laurentian School is an important institution and serves a
    wide area. He was most happy to know that this year’s Conference was so
    successful.

    With loving Bahá’í greetings,

    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian has received your letter of August 25th, and has
    instructed me to answer you on his behalf.
</p>
<p>
    Because Bahá’u’lláh lived in the Middle East, and addressed himself mostly
    to Moslems, Christians and Jews, His proofs had reference mostly to these
    Faiths.

<p>
    To an individual believer
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    The beloved Guardian has received your recent letter with greeting card
    enclosed from the children, which he appreciated.
</p>
<p>
    He was happy to learn that you and your wife are teaching the children.
    This is most important. He hopes you will encourage them, in addition to
    acquiring a knowledge of the Teachings, to endeavour to fit themselves for
    future Bahá’í work, either in their homeland or on foreign soil. The Faith
    will need many workers in all countries as time goes on, and it will be the
    children of today who will carry forward the Torch of Bahá’u’lláh in the
    days to come.
</p>
<p>
    Your Committee was fortunate indeed to have had a visit from the revered
Hand of the Cause, Mr. Khadem.    <a href="#_ftn199" name="_ftnref199" title="">[‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡]</a> He is truly
    one who kindles a new flame of love and longing to serve the Cause in the
    hearts of the believers wherever he goes.

<p>
    To the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Sister:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of October 5th was duly received and its contents have
    been presented to the Beloved Guardian.
</p>
<p>
    He was very happy indeed to learn of the very active manner in which the
    Canadian Bahá’ís have taken hold of this most important subject of teaching
    the Indians.
</p>
<p>
    He attaches the greatest importance to this matter as the Master has spoken
    of the latent strength of character of these people and feels that when the
    Spirit of the Faith has a chance to work in their midst, it will produce
    remarkable results.
</p>
<p>
    You<a href="#_ftn200" name="_ftnref200" title="">[§§§§§§§§§§]</a> yourself
    are to be congratulated on the very wonderful work you have been doing with
    the Indians on the Tyendinaga Reserve. The Guardian greatly appreciates
    this service, and wishes you to know that he values it very highly. He
    hopes nothing will interfere with your carrying it forward to the fine
    conclusion which you hope will be the establishment of an Assembly on this
    reserve. It would be a distinct victory for the Faith if that is
    accomplished.
</p>
<p>
    The Guardian will pray for you and for the success of your work.
</p>
<p>
    Faithfully yours,

<p>
    To the Treasurer of the National Spiritual Assembly
</p>
<p>
    Dear Bahá’í Brother:
</p>
<p>
    Your loving letter of October 12th was duly received by the Beloved
    Guardian and he has directed me to acknowledge it in his behalf. The
    contributions which were made by various Assemblies, Groups and individuals
    to the International Fund are greatly appreciated. Receipts are enclosed
    herewith.
</p>
<p>
    Will you please send these receipts to each Assembly, Group or individual
    concerned expressing the Guardian’s appreciation to them.
</p>
<p>
    The Beloved Guardian is directing exclusive attention at this time to the
    great importance of teaching the Cause of God. The Divine confirmations are
    descending in torrents, particularly on those who arise to teach the Faith.
    He is hoping there will be a new movement amongst the Friends in Canada so
    that many thirsty souls may find eternal life through the selfless deeds of
    the Canadian Bahá’ís.
</p>
<p>
    He will pray for you, for the Believers and for the success of their work.
    He sends you his loving greetings.
</p>
<p>
    Faithfully yours,
</p>
<p>

    P.S. This is one of the few letters I received instruction from the
    Guardian to write shortly before his Ascension.

<p>
Shoghi Effendi announced in May 1953    <a href="#_ftn201" name="_ftnref201" title="">[***********]</a> that those
    believers who arose to pioneer to goals outlined in the Ten Year Crusade,
    would be designated “Knights of Bahá’u’lláh”, and would have their names
    inscribed on a “Roll of Honour”. This Roll was placed at the entrance door
    of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh in 1992, as instructed by the Guardian and
    noted in the 8 June 1953 letter in this book. Several of these Knights were
    Canadian, and others fulfilled Canadian goals.
