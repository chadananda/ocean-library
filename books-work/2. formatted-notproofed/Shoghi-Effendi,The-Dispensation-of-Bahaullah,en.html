  <span class='block salutation'>To the beloved of
God and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the West.</span>
  <span class='block salutation'>Fellow-laborers in the Divine Vineyard:</span>
  <span class='block dropcap'>
  On the 23rd of May of this auspicious year the Bahá’í world will
  celebrate the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Faith of
  Bahá’u’lláh. We, who at this hour find ourselves standing on
  the threshold of the last decade of the first century of the Bahá’í
  era, might well pause to reflect upon the mysterious dispensations of
  so august, so momentous a Revelation. How vast, how entrancing the
  panorama which the revolution of four score years and ten unrolls
  before our eyes! Its towering grandeur well-nigh overwhelms us. To
  merely contemplate this unique spectacle, to visualize, however
  dimly, the circumstances attending the birth and gradual unfoldment
  of this supreme Theophany, to recall even in their barest outline the
  woeful struggles that proclaimed its rise and accelerated its march,
  will suffice to convince every unbiased observer of those eternal
  truths that motivate its life and which must continue to impel it
  forward until it achieves its destined ascendancy.</span>
</p>


<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='sub_disp_baha'>Bahá’u’lláh</h3>

<p id='2' data-ref='wob_en-6-p2'>
Dominating the entire range of this fascinating spectacle towers the
incomparable figure of Bahá’u’lláh, transcendental in His
majesty, serene, awe-inspiring, unapproachably glorious. Allied,
though subordinate in rank, and invested with the authority of
presiding with Him over the destinies of this supreme Dispensation,
there shines upon this mental picture the youthful glory of the Báb,
infinite in His tenderness, irresistible in His charm, unsurpassed in
His heroism, matchless in the dramatic circumstances of His short yet
eventful life. And finally there emerges, though on a plane of its
own and in a category entirely apart from the one occupied by the
twin Figures that preceded Him, the vibrant, the magnetic personality
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, reflecting to a degree that no man,
however exalted his station, can hope to rival, the glory and power
with which They who are the Manifestations of God are alone endowed.</p>


<p id='3' data-ref='wob_en-6-p3'>
With ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension, and more particularly
with the passing of His well-beloved and illustrious sister the Most
Exalted Leaf — the last survivor of a glorious and heroic age — there
draws to a close the first and most moving chapter of Bahá’í
history, marking the conclusion of the Primitive, the Apostolic Age
of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. It was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
Who, through the provisions of His weighty Will and Testament, has
forged the vital link which must for ever connect the age that has
just expired with the one we now live in — the Transitional and
Formative period of the Faith — a stage that must in the fullness of
time reach its blossom and yield its fruit in the exploits and
triumphs that are to herald the Golden Age of the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh.</p>


<p id='4' data-ref='wob_en-6-p4'>
Dearly-beloved friends! The onrushing forces so miraculously released
through the agency of two independent and swiftly successive
Manifestations are now under our very eyes and through the care of
the chosen stewards of a far-flung Faith being gradually mustered and
disciplined. They are slowly crystallizing into institutions that
will come to be regarded as the hall-mark and glory of the age we are
called upon to establish and by our deeds immortalize. For upon our
present-day efforts, and above all upon the extent to which we strive
to remodel our lives after the pattern of sublime heroism associated
with those gone before us, must depend the efficacy of the
instruments we now fashion — instruments that must erect the
structure of that blissful Commonwealth which must signalize the
Golden Age of our Faith.</p>


<p id='5' data-ref='wob_en-6-p5'>
It is not my purpose, as I look back upon these crowded years of
heroic deeds, to attempt even a cursory review of the mighty events
that have transpired since 1844 until the present day. Nor have I any
intention to undertake an analysis of the forces that have
precipitated them, or to evaluate their influence upon peoples and
institutions in almost every continent of the globe. The authentic
record of the lives of the first believers of the primitive period of
our Faith, together with the assiduous research which competent
Bahá’í historians will in the future undertake, will combine to
transmit to posterity such masterly exposition of the history of that
age as my own efforts can never hope to accomplish. My chief concern
at this challenging period of Bahá’í history is rather to call
the attention of those who are destined to be the champion-builders
of the Administrative Order of Bahá’u’lláh to certain
fundamental verities the elucidation of which must tremendously
assist them in the effective prosecution of their mighty enterprise.</p>


<p id='6' data-ref='wob_en-6-p6'>
The international status which the Religion of God has thus far
achieved, moreover, imperatively demands that its root principles be
now definitely clarified. The unprecedented impetus which the
illustrious deeds of the American believers have lent to the onward
march of the Faith; the intense interest which the first
Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the West is fast awakening
among divers races and nations; the rise and steady consolidation of
Bahá’í institutions in no less than forty of the most advanced
countries of the world; the dissemination of Bahá’í literature in
no fewer than twenty-five of the most widely-spoken languages; the
success that has recently attended the nation-wide efforts of the
Persian believers in the preliminary steps they have taken for the
establishment, in the outskirts of the capital-city of their native
land, of the third Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the Bahá’í
world; the measures that are being taken for the immediate formation
of their first National Spiritual Assembly representing the interests
of the overwhelming majority of Bahá’í adherents; the projected
erection of yet another pillar of the Universal House of Justice, the
first of its kind, in the Southern Hemisphere; the testimonies, both
verbal and written, that a struggling Faith has obtained from
Royalty, from governmental institutions, international tribunals, and
ecclesiastical dignitaries; the publicity it has received from the
charges which unrelenting enemies, both new and old, have hurled
against it; the formal enfranchisement of a section of its followers
from the fetters of Muslim orthodoxy in a country that may be
regarded as the most enlightened among Islamic nations — these afford
ample proof of the growing momentum with which the invincible
community of the Most Great Name is marching forward to ultimate
victory.</p>

<hr class='small compact'>


<p id='7' data-ref='wob_en-6-p7' class='dropcap'>
Dearly-beloved friends! I feel it incumbent upon me, by virtue of the
obligations and responsibilities which as Guardian of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh I am called upon to discharge, to lay special
stress, at a time when the light of publicity is being increasingly
focussed upon us, upon certain truths which lie at the basis of our
Faith and the integrity of which it is our first duty to safeguard.
These verities, if valiantly upheld and properly assimilated, will, I
am convinced, powerfully reinforce the vigor of our spiritual life
and greatly assist in counteracting the machinations of an implacable
and vigilant enemy.</p>


<p id='8' data-ref='wob_en-6-p8'>
To strive to obtain a more adequate understanding of the significance
of Bahá’u’lláh’s stupendous Revelation must, it is my
unalterable conviction, remain the first obligation and the object of
the constant endeavor of each one of its loyal adherents. An exact
and thorough comprehension of so vast a system, so sublime a
revelation, so sacred a trust, is for obvious reasons beyond the
reach and ken of our finite minds. We can, however, and it is our
bounden duty to seek to derive fresh inspiration and added sustenance
as we labor for the propagation of His Faith through a clearer
apprehension of the truths it enshrines and the principles on which
it is based.</p>


<p id='9' data-ref='wob_en-6-p9'>
In a communication addressed to the American believers I have in the
course of my explanation of the station of the Báb made a passing
reference to the incomparable greatness of the Revelation of which He
considered Himself to be the humble Precursor. He Whom Bahá’u’lláh
has acclaimed in the Kitáb-i-Íqán as that promised Qá’im Who
has manifested no less than twenty-five out of the twenty-seven
letters which all the Prophets were destined to reveal — so great a
Revealer has Himself testified to the préeminence of that superior
Revelation that was soon to supersede His own. <q class='bab'>“The germ,”</q>
the Báb asserts in the Persian Bayán, <q class='bab'>“that holds within
itself the potentialities of the Revelation that is to come is
endowed with a potency superior to the combined forces of all those
who follow me.”</q> <q class='bab'>“Of all the tributes,”</q> He again
affirms, <q class='bab'>“I have paid to Him Who is to come after Me, the
greatest is this, My written confession, that no words of Mine can
adequately describe Him, nor can any reference to Him in My Book, the
Bayán, do justice to His Cause.”</q> <q class='bab'>“The Bayán,”</q> He
in that same Book categorically declares, <q class='bab'>“and whosoever is
therein revolve round the saying of ‘Him Whom God shall make
manifest,’ even as the Alif (the Gospel) and whosoever was therein
revolved round the saying of Muḥammad, the Apostle of God.”</q>
<q class='bab'>“A thousand perusals of the Bayán,”</q> He further remarks,
<q class='bab'>“cannot equal the perusal of a single verse to be revealed by
‘Him Whom God shall make manifest.’… Today the Bayán is in the
stage of seed; at the beginning of the manifestation of ‘Him Whom
God shall make manifest’ its ultimate perfection will become
apparent.… The Bayán and such as are believers therein yearn more
ardently after Him than the yearning of any lover after his beloved.…
The Bayán deriveth all its glory from ‘Him Whom God shall make
manifest.’ All blessing be upon him who believeth in Him and woe
betide him that rejecteth His truth.”</q></p>


<p id='10' data-ref='wob_en-6-p10'>
Addressing Siyyid Yaḥyáy-i-Darábí surnamed Vahíd, the most
learned, the most eloquent and influential among His followers, the
Báb utters this warning: <q class='bab'>“By the righteousness of Him Whose
power causeth the seed to germinate and Who breatheth the spirit of
life into all things, were I to be assured that in the day of His
manifestation thou wilt deny Him, I would unhesitatingly disown thee
and repudiate thy faith.… If, on the other hand, I be told that a
Christian, who beareth no allegiance to My Faith, will believe in
Him, the same will I regard as the apple of Mine Eye.”</q></p>


<p id='11' data-ref='wob_en-6-p11'>
In one of His prayers He thus communes with Bahá’u’lláh:
<q class='bab'>“Exalted art Thou, O my Lord the Omnipotent! How puny and
contemptible my word and all that pertaineth unto me appear unless
they be related to Thy great glory. Grant that through the assistance
of Thy grace whatsoever pertaineth unto me may be acceptable in Thy
sight.”</q></p>


<p id='12' data-ref='wob_en-6-p12'>
In the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá — the Báb’s commentary on the Súrih of
Joseph — characterized by the Author of the Íqán as <q class='baha'>“the
first, the greatest and mightiest”</q> of the books revealed by the
Báb, we read the following references to Bahá’u’lláh: <q class='bab'>“Out
of utter nothingness, O great and omnipotent Master, Thou hast,
through the celestial potency of Thy might, brought me forth and
raised me up to proclaim this Revelation. I have made none other but
Thee my trust; I have clung to no will but Thy will… O Thou Remnant
of God! I have sacrificed myself wholly for Thee: I have accepted
curses for Thy sake, and have yearned for naught but martyrdom in the
path of Thy love. Sufficient witness unto me is God, the Exalted, the
Protector, the Ancient of Days.”</q> <q class='bab'>“And when the appointed
hour hath struck,”</q> He again addresses Bahá’u’lláh in that
same commentary, <q class='bab'>“do Thou, by the leave of God, the All-Wise,
reveal from the heights of the Most Lofty and Mystic Mount a faint,
an infinitesimal glimmer of Thy impenetrable Mystery, that they who
have recognized the radiance of the Sinaic Splendor may faint away
and die as they catch a lightening glimpse of the fierce and crimson
Light that envelops Thy Revelation.”</q></p>


<p id='13' data-ref='wob_en-6-p13'>
As a further testimony to the greatness of the Revelation identified
with Bahá’u’lláh may be cited the following extracts from a
Tablet addressed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to an eminent Zoroastrian
follower of the Faith: <q class='abd'>“Thou hadst written that in the sacred
books of the followers of Zoroaster it is written that in the latter
days, in three separate Dispensations, the sun must needs be brought
to a standstill. In the first Dispensation, it is predicted, the sun
will remain motionless for ten days; in the second for twice that
time; in the third for no less than one whole month. The
interpretation of this prophecy is this: the first Dispensation to
which it refers is the Muḥammadan Dispensation during which the Sun
of Truth stood still for ten days. Each day is reckoned as one
century. The Muḥammadan Dispensation must have, therefore, lasted
no less than one thousand years, which is precisely the period that
has elapsed from the setting of the Star of the Imamate to the advent
of the Dispensation proclaimed by the Báb. The second Dispensation
referred to in this prophecy is the one inaugurated by the Báb
Himself, which began in the year 1260 A.H. and was brought to a close
in the year 1280 A.H. As to the third Dispensation — the Revelation
proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh — inasmuch as the Sun of Truth when
attaining that station shineth in the plenitude of its meridian
splendor its duration hath been fixed for a period of one whole
month, which is the maximum time taken by the sun to pass through a
sign of the Zodiac. From this thou canst imagine the magnitude of the
Bahá’í cycle — a cycle that must extend over a period of at least
five hundred thousand years.”</q></p>


<p id='14' data-ref='wob_en-6-p14'>
From the text of this explicit and authoritative interpretation of so
ancient a prophecy it is evident how necessary it is for every
faithful follower of the Faith to accept the divine origin and uphold
the independent status of the Muḥammadan Dispensation. The validity
of the Imamate is, moreover, implicitly recognized in these same
passages — that divinely-appointed institution of whose most
distinguished member the Báb Himself was a lineal descendant, and
which continued for a period of no less than two hundred and sixty
years to be the chosen recipient of the guidance of the Almighty and
the repository of one of the two most precious legacies of Islám.</p>


<p id='15' data-ref='wob_en-6-p15'>
This same prophecy, we must furthermore recognize, attests the
independent character of the Bábí Dispensation and corroborates
indirectly the truth that in accordance with the principle of
progressive revelation every Manifestation of God must needs
vouchsafe to the peoples of His day a measure of divine guidance
ampler than any which a preceding and less receptive age could have
received or appreciated. For this reason, and not for any superior
merit which the Bahá’í Faith may be said to inherently possess,
does this prophecy bear witness to the unrivaled power and glory with
which the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh has been invested — a
Dispensation the potentialities of which we are but beginning to
perceive and the full range of which we can never determine.</p>


<p id='16' data-ref='wob_en-6-p16'>
The Faith of Bahá’u’lláh should indeed be regarded, if we wish
to be faithful to the tremendous implications of its message, as the
culmination of a cycle, the final stage in a series of successive, of
preliminary and progressive revelations. These, beginning with Adam
and ending with the Báb, have paved the way and anticipated with an
ever-increasing emphasis the advent of that Day of Days in which He
Who is the Promise of All Ages should be made manifest.</p>


<p id='17' data-ref='wob_en-6-p17'>
To this truth the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh abundantly testify.
A mere reference to the claims which, in vehement language and with
compelling power, He Himself has repeatedly advanced cannot but fully
demonstrate the character of the Revelation of which He was the
chosen bearer. To the words that have streamed from His pen — the
fountainhead of so impetuous a Revelation — we should, therefore,
direct our attention if we wish to obtain a clearer understanding of
its importance and meaning. Whether in His assertion of the
unprecedented claim He has advanced, or in His allusions to the
mysterious forces He has released, whether in such passages as extol
the glories of His long-awaited Day, or magnify the station which
they who have recognized its hidden virtues will attain, Bahá’u’lláh
and, to an almost equal extent, the Báb and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
have bequeathed to posterity mines of such inestimable wealth as none
of us who belong to this generation can befittingly estimate. Such
testimonies bearing on this theme are impregnated with such power and
reveal such beauty as only those who are versed in the languages in
which they were originally revealed can claim to have sufficiently
appreciated. So numerous are these testimonies that a whole volume
would be required to be written in order to compile the most
outstanding among them. All I can venture to attempt at present is to
share with you only such passages as I have been able to glean from
His voluminous writings.</p>


<p id='18' data-ref='wob_en-6-p18'>
<q class='baha'>“I testify before God,”</q> proclaims Bahá’u’lláh, <q class='baha'>“to
the greatness, the inconceivable greatness of this Revelation. Again
and again have We in most of Our Tablets borne witness to this truth,
that mankind may be roused from its heedlessness.”</q> <q class='baha'>“In
this most mighty Revelation,”</q> He unequivocally announces, <q class='baha'>“all
the Dispensations of the past have attained their highest, their
final consummation. That which hath been made manifest in this
preëminent, this most exalted Revelation, stands unparalleled in the
annals of the past, nor will future ages witness its like.”</q> <q class='baha'>“He
it is,”</q> referring to Himself He further proclaims, <q class='baha'>“Who in
the Old Testament hath been named Jehovah, Who in the Gospel hath
been designated as the Spirit of Truth, and in the Qur’án
acclaimed as the Great Announcement.”</q> <q class='baha'>“But for Him no
Divine Messenger would have been invested with the robe of
prophethood, nor would any of the sacred scriptures have been
revealed. To this bear witness all created things.”</q> <q class='baha'>“The
word which the one true God uttereth in this day, though that word be
the most familiar and commonplace of terms, is invested with supreme,
with unique distinction.”</q> <q class='baha'>“The generality of mankind is
still immature. Had it acquired sufficient capacity We would have
bestowed upon it so great a measure of Our knowledge that all who
dwell on earth and in heaven would have found themselves, by virtue
of the grace streaming from Our pen, completely independent of all
knowledge save the knowledge of God, and would have been securely
established upon the throne of abiding tranquillity.”</q> <q class='baha'>“The
Pen of Holiness, I solemnly affirm before God, hath writ upon My
snow-white brow and in characters of effulgent glory these glowing,
these musk-scented and holy words: ‘Behold ye that dwell on earth,
and ye denizens of heaven, bear witness, He in truth is your
Well-Beloved. He it is Whose like the world of creation hath not
seen, He Whose ravishing beauty hath delighted the eye of God, the
Ordainer, the All-Powerful, the Incomparable!’”</q></p>


<p id='19' data-ref='wob_en-6-p19'>
<q class='baha'>“Followers of the Gospel,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh addressing
the whole of Christendom exclaims, <q class='baha'>“behold the gates of heaven
are flung open. He that had ascended unto it is now come. Give ear to
His voice calling aloud over land and sea, announcing to all mankind
the advent of this Revelation — a Revelation through the agency of
which the Tongue of Grandeur is now proclaiming: ‘Lo, the sacred
Pledge hath been fulfilled, for He, the Promised One, is come!’”</q>
<q class='baha'>“The voice of the Son of Man is calling aloud from the sacred
vale: ‘Here am I, here am I, O God my God!’ … whilst from the
Burning Bush breaketh forth the cry: ‘Lo, the Desire of the world
is made manifest in His transcendent glory!’ The Father hath come.
That which ye were promised in the Kingdom of God is fulfilled. This
is the Word which the Son veiled when He said to those around Him
that at that time they could not bear it… Verily the Spirit of
Truth is come to guide you unto all truth… He is the One Who
glorified the Son and exalted His Cause…”</q> <q class='baha'>“The Comforter
Whose advent all the scriptures have promised is now come that He may
reveal unto you all knowledge and wisdom. Seek Him over the entire
surface of the earth, haply ye may find Him.”</q></p>


<p id='20' data-ref='wob_en-6-p20'>
<q class='baha'>“Call out to Zion, O Carmel,”</q> writes Bahá’u’lláh,
<q class='baha'>“and announce the joyful tidings: ‘He that was hidden from
mortal eyes is come! His all-conquering sovereignty is manifest; His
all-encompassing splendor is revealed… Hasten forth and
circumambulate the City of God that hath descended from heaven — the
celestial Kaaba round which have circled in adoration the favored of
God, the pure in heart and the company of the most exalted angels.’”</q>
<q class='baha'>“I am the One,”</q> He in another connection affirms, <q class='baha'>“Whom
the tongue of Isaiah hath extolled, the One with Whose name both the
Torah and the Evangel were adorned.”</q> <q class='baha'>“The glory of Sinai
hath hastened to circle round the Day-Spring of this Revelation,
while from the heights of the Kingdom the voice of the Son of God is
heard proclaiming: ‘Bestir yourselves, ye proud ones of the earth,
and hasten ye towards Him.’ Carmel hath in this day hastened in
longing adoration to attain His court, whilst from the heart of Zion
there cometh the cry: ‘The promise of all ages is now fulfilled.
That which had been announced in the holy writ of God, the Beloved,
the Most High, is made manifest.’”</q> <q class='baha'>“Ḥijáz is astir by
the breeze announcing the tidings of joyous reunion. ‘Praise be to
Thee,’ We hear her exclaim, ‘O my Lord, the Most High. I was dead
through my separation from Thee; the breeze laden with the fragrance
of Thy presence hath brought me back to life. Happy is he that
turneth unto Thee, and woe betide the erring.’”</q> <q class='baha'>“By the
one true God, Elijah hath hastened unto My court and hath
circumambulated in the day-time and in the night-season My throne of
glory.”</q> <q class='baha'>“Solomon in all his majesty circles in adoration
around Me in this day, uttering this most exalted word: ‘I have
turned my face towards Thy face, O Thou omnipotent Ruler of the
world! I am wholly detached from all things pertaining unto me, and
yearn for that which Thou dost possess.’”</q> <q class='baha'>“Had Muḥammad,
the Apostle of God, attained this Day,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh
writes in a Tablet revealed on the eve of His banishment to the penal
colony of ‘Akká, <q class='baha'>“He would have exclaimed: ‘I have truly
recognized Thee, O Thou the Desire of the Divine Messengers!’ Had
Abraham attained it, He too, falling prostrate upon the ground, and
in the utmost lowliness before the Lord thy God, would have cried:
‘Mine heart is filled with peace, O Thou Lord of all that is in
heaven and on earth! I testify that Thou hast unveiled before mine
eyes all the glory of Thy power and the full majesty of Thy law!’…
Had Moses Himself attained it, He, likewise, would have raised His
voice saying: ‘All praise be to Thee for having lifted upon me the
light of Thy countenance and enrolled me among them that have been
privileged to behold Thy face!’”</q> <q class='baha'>“North and South both
vibrate to the call announcing the advent of our Revelation. We can
hear the voice of Mecca acclaiming: ‘All praise be to Thee, O Lord
my God, the All-Glorious, for having wafted over me the breath
redolent with the fragrance of Thy presence!’ Jerusalem, likewise,
is calling aloud: ‘Lauded and magnified art Thou, O Beloved of
earth and heaven, for having turned the agony of my separation from
Thee into the joy of a life-giving reunion!’”</q></p>


<p id='21' data-ref='wob_en-6-p21'>
<q class='baha'>“By the righteousness of God,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh wishing
to reveal the full potency of His invincible power asserts, <q class='baha'>“should
a man, all alone, arise in the name of Bahá and put on the armor of
His love, him will the Almighty cause to be victorious, though the
forces of earth and heaven be arrayed against him.”</q> <q class='baha'>“By
God besides Whom is none other God! Should any one arise for the
triumph of our Cause, him will God render victorious though tens of
thousands of enemies be leagued against him. And if his love for Me
wax stronger, God will establish his ascendancy over all the powers
of earth and heaven. Thus have We breathed the spirit of power into
all regions.”</q></p>


<p id='22' data-ref='wob_en-6-p22'>
<q class='baha'>“This is the King of Days,”</q> He thus extols the age that
has witnessed the advent of His Revelation, <q class='baha'>“the Day that hath
seen the coming of the Best-beloved, Him Who through all eternity
hath been acclaimed the Desire of the World.”</q> <q class='baha'>“The world
of being shineth in this Day with the resplendency of this Divine
Revelation. All created things extol its saving grace and sing its
praises. The universe is wrapt in an ecstasy of joy and gladness. The
Scriptures of past Dispensations celebrate the great jubilee that
must needs greet this most great Day of God. Well is it with him that
hath lived to see this Day and hath recognized its station.”</q>
<q class='baha'>“Were mankind to give heed in a befitting manner to no more than
one word of such a praise it would be so filled with delight as to be
overpowered and lost in wonder. Entranced, it would then shine forth
resplendent above the horizon of true understanding.”</q></p>


<p id='23' data-ref='wob_en-6-p23'>
<q class='baha'>“Be fair, ye peoples of the world;”</q> He thus appeals to
mankind, <q class='baha'>“is it meet and seemly for you to question the
authority of one Whose presence ‘He Who conversed with God’
(Moses) hath longed to attain, the beauty of Whose countenance
‘God’s Well-beloved’ (Muḥammad) had yearned to behold,
through the potency of Whose love the ‘Spirit of God’ (Jesus)
ascended to heaven, for Whose sake the ‘Primal Point’ (the
Báb) offered up His life?”</q> <q class='baha'>“Seize your chance,”</q>
He admonishes His followers, <q class='baha'>“inasmuch as a fleeting moment in
this Day excelleth centuries of a bygone age… Neither sun nor moon
hath witnessed a day such as this… It is evident that every age in
which a Manifestation of God hath lived is divinely ordained and may,
in a sense, be characterized as God’s appointed Day. This Day,
however, is unique and is to be distinguished from those that have
preceded it. The designation ‘Seal of the Prophets’ fully reveals
and demonstrates its high station.”</q></p>


<p id='24' data-ref='wob_en-6-p24'>
Expatiating on the forces latent in His Revelation Bahá’u’lláh
reveals the following: <q class='baha'>“Through the movement of Our Pen of glory
We have, at the bidding of the omnipotent Ordainer, breathed a new
life into every human frame and instilled into every word a fresh
potency. All created things proclaim the evidences of this world-wide
regeneration.”</q> <q class='baha'>“This is,”</q> He adds, <q class='baha'>“the most
great, the most joyful tidings imparted by the pen of this wronged
One to mankind.”</q> <q class='baha'>“How great,”</q> He in another passage
exclaims, <q class='baha'>“is the Cause! How staggering the weight of its
message! This is the Day of which it hath been said: ‘O my son!
verily God will bring everything to light though it were but the
weight of a grain of mustard seed, and hidden in a rock, or in the
heavens or in the earth; for God is subtile, informed of all.’”</q>
<q class='baha'>“By the righteousness of the one true God! If one speck of a
jewel be lost and buried beneath a mountain of stones, and lie hidden
beyond the seven seas, the Hand of Omnipotence will assuredly reveal
it in this day, pure and cleansed from dross.”</q> <q class='baha'>“He that
partaketh of the waters of My Revelation will taste all the
incorruptible delights ordained by God from the beginning that hath
no beginning to the end that hath no end.”</q> <q class='baha'>“Every single
letter proceeding from Our mouth is endowed with such regenerative
power as to enable it to bring into existence a new creation — a
creation the magnitude of which is inscrutable to all save God. He
verily hath knowledge of all things.”</q> <q class='baha'>“It is in Our power,
should We wish it, to enable a speck of floating dust to generate, in
less than the twinkling of an eye, suns of infinite, of unimaginable
splendor, to cause a dewdrop to develop into vast and numberless
oceans, to infuse into every letter such a force as to empower it to
unfold all the knowledge of past and future ages.”</q> <q class='baha'>“We are
possessed of such power which, if brought to light, will transmute
the most deadly of poisons into a panacea of unfailing efficacy.”</q> </p>



<p id='25' data-ref='wob_en-6-p25'>
Estimating the station of the true believer He remarks: <q class='baha'>“By the
sorrows which afflict the beauty of the All-Glorious! Such is the
station ordained for the true believer that if to an extent smaller
than a needle’s eye the glory of that station were to be unveiled
to mankind, every beholder would be consumed away in his longing to
attain it. For this reason it hath been decreed that in this earthly
life the full measure of the glory of his own station should remain
concealed from the eyes of such a believer.”</q> <q class='baha'>“If the veil
be lifted,”</q> He similarly affirms, <q class='baha'>“and the full glory of
the station of those who have turned wholly towards God, and in their
love for Him renounced the world, be made manifest, the entire
creation would be dumbfounded.”</q></p>


<p id='26' data-ref='wob_en-6-p26'>
Stressing the superlative character of His Revelation as compared
with the Dispensation preceding it, Bahá’u’lláh makes the
following affirmation: <q class='baha'>“If all the peoples of the world be
invested with the powers and attributes destined for the Letters of
the Living, the Báb’s chosen disciples, whose station is ten
thousand times more glorious than any which the apostles of old have
attained, and if they, one and all, should, swift as the twinkling of
an eye, hesitate to recognize the light of My Revelation, their faith
shall be of no avail and they shall be accounted among the infidels.”</q>
<q class='baha'>“So tremendous is the outpouring of Divine grace in this
Dispensation that if mortal hands could be swift enough to record
them, within the space of a single day and night there would stream
verses of such number as to be equivalent to the whole of the Persian
Bayán.”</q></p>


<p id='27' data-ref='wob_en-6-p27'>
<q class='baha'>“Give heed to my warning, ye people of Persia,”</q> He thus
addresses His countrymen, <q class='baha'>“If I be slain at your hands, God will
assuredly raise up one who will fill the seat made vacant through my
death; for such is God’s method carried into effect of old, and no
change can ye find in God’s mode of dealing.”</q> <q class='baha'>“Should
they attempt to conceal His light on the continent, He will assuredly
rear His head in the midmost heart of the ocean and, raising His
voice, proclaim: ‘I am the lifegiver of the world!’… And if
they cast Him into a darksome pit, they will find Him seated on
earth’s loftiest heights calling aloud to all mankind: ‘Lo, the
Desire of the world is come in His majesty, His sovereignty, His
transcendent dominion!’ And if He be buried beneath the depths of
the earth, His Spirit soaring to the apex of heaven shall peal the
summons: ‘Behold ye the coming of the Glory; witness ye the Kingdom
of God, the most Holy, the Gracious, the All-Powerful!’”</q>
<q class='baha'>“Within the throat of this Youth,”</q> is yet another
astounding statement, <q class='baha'>“there lie prisoned accents which, if
revealed to mankind to an extent smaller than a needle’s eye, would
suffice to cause every mountain to crumble, the leaves of the trees
to be discolored and their fruits to fall; would compel every head to
bow down in worship and every face to turn in adoration towards this
omnipotent Ruler Who, at sundry times and in diverse manners,
appeareth as a devouring flame, as a billowing ocean, as a radiant
light, as the tree which, rooted in the soil of holiness, lifteth its
branches and spreadeth out its limbs as far as and beyond the throne
of deathless glory.”</q></p>


<p id='28' data-ref='wob_en-6-p28'>
Anticipating the System which the irresistible power of His Law was
destined to unfold in a later age, He writes: <q class='baha'>“The world’s
equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this
most great, this new World Order. Mankind’s ordered life hath been
revolutionized through the agency of this unique, this wondrous
System — the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed.”</q>
<q class='baha'>“The Hand of Omnipotence hath established His Revelation upon an
unassailable, an enduring foundation. Storms of human strife are
powerless to undermine its basis, nor will men’s fanciful theories
succeed in damaging its structure.”</q></p>


<p id='29' data-ref='wob_en-6-p29'>
In the Súratu’l-Haykal, one of the most challenging works of
Bahá’u’lláh, the following verses, each of which testifies to
the resistless power infused into the Revelation proclaimed by its
Author, have been recorded: <q class='baha'>“Naught is seen in My temple but the
Temple of God, and in My beauty but His Beauty, and in My being but
His Being, and in My self but His Self, and in My movement but His
Movement, and in My acquiescence but His Acquiescence, and in My pen
but His Pen, the Mighty, the All-Praised. There hath not been in My
soul but the Truth, and in Myself naught could be seen but God.”</q>
<q class='baha'>“The Holy Spirit Itself hath been generated through the agency
of a single letter revealed by this Most Great Spirit, if ye be of
them that comprehend.”</q>… <q class='baha'>“Within the treasury of Our
Wisdom there lies unrevealed a knowledge, one word of which, if we
chose to divulge it to mankind, would cause every human being to
recognize the Manifestation of God and to acknowledge His
omniscience, would enable every one to discover the secrets of all
the sciences, and to attain so high a station as to find himself
wholly independent of all past and future learning. Other knowledges
We do as well possess, not a single letter of which We can disclose,
nor do We find humanity able to hear even the barest reference to
their meaning. Thus have We informed you of the knowledge of God, the
All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”</q> <q class='baha'>“The day is approaching when
God will have, by an act of His Will, raised up a race of men the
nature of which is inscrutable to all save God, the All-Powerful, the
Self-Subsisting.”</q> <q class='baha'>“He will, ere long, out of the Bosom of
Power draw forth the Hands of Ascendancy and Might — Hands who will
arise to win victory for this Youth and who will purge mankind from
the defilement of the outcast and the ungodly. These Hands will gird
up their loins to champion the Faith of God, and will, in My name the
self-subsistent, the mighty, subdue the peoples and kindreds of the
earth. They will enter the cities and will inspire with fear the
hearts of all their inhabitants. Such are the evidences of the might
of God; how fearful, how vehement is His might!”</q></p>


<p id='30' data-ref='wob_en-6-p30'>
Such is, dearly-beloved friends, Bahá’u’lláh’s own written
testimony to the nature of His Revelation. To the affirmations of the
Báb, each of which reinforces the strength, and confirms the truth,
of these remarkable statements, I have already referred. What remains
for me to consider in this connection are such passages in the
writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the appointed Interpreter of
these same utterances, as throw further light upon and amplify
various features of this enthralling theme. The tone of His language
is indeed as emphatic and His tribute no less glowing than that of
either Bahá’u’lláh or the Báb.</p>


<p id='31' data-ref='wob_en-6-p31'>
<q class='abd'>“Centuries, nay ages, must pass away,”</q> He affirms in one
of His earliest Tablets, <q class='abd'>“ere the Day-Star of Truth shineth
again in its mid-summer splendor, or appeareth once more in the
radiance of its vernal glory… How thankful must we be for having
been made in this Day the recipients of so overwhelming a favor!
Would that we had ten thousand lives that we might lay them down in
thanksgiving for so rare a privilege, so high an attainment, so
priceless a bounty!”</q> <q class='abd'>“The mere contemplation,”</q> He
adds, <q class='abd'>“of the Dispensation inaugurated by the Blessed Beauty
would have sufficed to overwhelm the saints of bygone ages — saints
who longed to partake for one moment of its great glory.”</q> <q class='abd'>“The
holy ones of past ages and centuries have, each and all, yearned with
tearful eyes to live, though for one moment, in the Day of God. Their
longings unsatisfied, they repaired to the Great Beyond. How great,
therefore, is the bounty of the Abhá Beauty Who, notwithstanding our
utter unworthiness, hath through His grace and mercy breathed into us
in this divinely-illumined century the spirit of life, hath gathered
us beneath the standard of the Beloved of the world, and chosen to
confer upon us a bounty for which the mighty ones of bygone ages had
craved in vain.”</q> <q class='abd'>“The souls of the well-favored among the
concourse on high,”</q> He likewise affirms, <q class='abd'>“the sacred
dwellers of the most exalted Paradise, are in this day filled with
burning desire to return unto this world, that they may render such
service as lieth in their power to the threshold of the Abhá
Beauty.”</q></p>


<p id='32' data-ref='wob_en-6-p32'>
<q class='abd'>“The effulgence of God’s splendrous mercy,”</q> He, in a
passage alluding to the growth and future development of the Faith,
declares, <q class='abd'>“hath enveloped the peoples and kindreds of the earth,
and the whole world is bathed in its shining glory… The day will
soon come when the light of Divine unity will have so permeated the
East and the West that no man dare any longer ignore it.”</q> <q class='abd'>“Now
in the world of being the Hand of divine power hath firmly laid the
foundations of this all-highest bounty and this wondrous gift.
Whatsoever is latent in the innermost of this holy cycle shall
gradually appear and be made manifest, for now is but the beginning
of its growth and the dayspring of the revelation of its signs. Ere
the close of this century and of this age, it shall be made clear and
evident how wondrous was that springtide and how heavenly was that
gift!”</q></p>


<p id='33' data-ref='wob_en-6-p33'>
In confirmation of the exalted rank of the true believer, referred to
by Bahá’u’lláh, He reveals the following: <q class='abd'>“The station
which he who hath truly recognized this Revelation will attain is the
same as the one ordained for such prophets of the house of Israel as
are not regarded as Manifestations ‘endowed with constancy.’”</q></p>


<p id='34' data-ref='wob_en-6-p34'>
In connection with the Manifestations destined to follow the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes this
definite and weighty declaration: <q class='abd'>“Concerning the Manifestations
that will come down in the future ‘in the shadows of the clouds,’
know verily that in so far as their relation to the source of their
inspiration is concerned they are under the shadow of the Ancient
Beauty. In their relation, however, to the age in which they appear,
each and every one of them ‘doeth whatsoever He willeth.’”</q></p>


<p id='35' data-ref='wob_en-6-p35'>
<q class='abd'>“O my friend!”</q> He thus addresses in one of His Tablets a
man of recognized authority and standing, <q class='abd'>“The undying Fire
which the Lord of the Kingdom hath kindled in the midst of the holy
Tree is burning fiercely in the midmost heart of the world. The
conflagration it will provoke will envelop the whole earth. Its
blazing flames will illuminate its peoples and kindreds. All the
signs have been revealed; every prophetic allusion hath been
manifested. Whatever hath been enshrined in all the Scriptures of the
past hath been made evident. To doubt or hesitate is no more
possible… Time is pressing. The Divine Charger is impatient, and
can tarry no longer. Ours is the duty to rush forward and, ere it is
too late, win the victory.”</q> And finally, is this most stirring
passage which He, in one of His moments of exultation, was moved to
address to one of His most trusted and eminent followers in the
earliest days of His ministry: <q class='abd'>“What more shall I say? What else
can my pen recount? So loud is the call that reverberates from the
Abhá Kingdom that mortal ears are well-nigh deafened with its
vibrations. The whole creation, methinks, is being disrupted and is
bursting asunder through the shattering influence of the Divine
summons issued from the throne of glory. More than this I cannot
write.”</q></p>


<hr class='small compact'>


<p id='36' data-ref='wob_en-6-p36' class='dropcap'>
Dearly-beloved friends! Enough has been said, and the quoted excerpts
from the writings of the Báb, of Bahá’u’lláh and of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá are sufficiently numerous and varied, to
convince the conscientious reader of the sublimity of this unique
cycle in the world’s religious history. It would be utterly
impossible to over-exaggerate its significance or to overrate the
influence it has exerted and which it must increasingly exert as its
great system unfolds itself amidst the welter of a collapsing
civilization.</p>


<p id='37' data-ref='wob_en-6-p37'>
To whoever may read these pages a word of warning seems, however,
advisable before I proceed further with the development of my
argument. Let no one meditating, in the light of the afore-quoted
passages, on the nature of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh,
mistake its character or misconstrue the intent of its Author. The
divinity attributed to so great a Being and the complete incarnation
of the names and attributes of God in so exalted a Person should,
under no circumstances, be misconceived or misinterpreted. The human
temple that has been made the vehicle of so overpowering a Revelation
must, if we be faithful to the tenets of our Faith, ever remain
entirely distinguished from that “innermost Spirit of Spirits”
and “eternal Essence of Essences” — that invisible yet rational
God Who, however much we extol the divinity of His Manifestations on
earth, can in no wise incarnate His infinite, His unknowable, His
incorruptible and all-embracing Reality in the concrete and limited
frame of a mortal being. Indeed, the God Who could so incarnate His
own reality would, in the light of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh,
cease immediately to be God. So crude and fantastic a theory of
Divine incarnation is as removed from, and incompatible with, the
essentials of Bahá’í belief as are the no less inadmissible
pantheistic and anthropomorphic conceptions of God — both of which
the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh emphatically repudiate and the
fallacy of which they expose.</p>


<p id='38' data-ref='wob_en-6-p38'>
He Who in unnumbered passages claimed His utterance to be the <q class='baha'>“Voice
of Divinity, the Call of God Himself”</q> thus solemnly affirms in
the Kitáb-i-Íqán: <q class='baha'>“To every discerning and illumined heart it
is evident that God, the unknowable Essence, the Divine Being, is
immeasurably exalted beyond every human attribute such as corporeal
existence, ascent and descent, egress and regress… He is, and hath
ever been, veiled in the ancient eternity of His Essence, and will
remain in His Reality everlastingly hidden from the sight of men…
He standeth exalted beyond and above all separation and union, all
proximity and remoteness… ‘God was alone; there was none else
beside Him’ is a sure testimony of this truth.”</q></p>


<p id='39' data-ref='wob_en-6-p39'>
<q class='baha'>“From time immemorial,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh, speaking of
God, explains, <q class='baha'>“He, the Divine Being, hath been veiled in the
ineffable sanctity of His exalted Self, and will everlasting continue
to be wrapt in the impenetrable mystery of His unknowable Essence…
Ten thousand Prophets, each a Moses, are thunderstruck upon the Sinai
of their search at God’s forbidding voice, ‘Thou shalt never
behold Me!’; whilst a myriad Messengers, each as great as Jesus,
stand dismayed upon their heavenly thrones by the interdiction ‘Mine
Essence thou shalt never apprehend!’”</q> <q class='baha'>“How bewildering
to me, insignificant as I am,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh in His
communion with God affirms, <q class='baha'>“is the attempt to fathom the sacred
depths of Thy knowledge! How futile my efforts to visualize the
magnitude of the power inherent in Thine handiwork — the revelation
of Thy creative power!”</q> <q class='baha'>“When I contemplate, O my God, the
relationship that bindeth me to Thee,”</q> He, in yet another
prayer revealed in His own handwriting, testifies, <q class='baha'>“I am moved
to proclaim to all created things ‘verily I am God!’; and when I
consider my own self, lo, I find it coarser than clay!”</q></p>


<p id='40' data-ref='wob_en-6-p40'>
<q class='baha'>“The door of the knowledge of the Ancient of Days,”</q>
Bahá’u’lláh further states in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, <q class='baha'>“being
thus closed in the face of all beings, He, the Source of infinite
grace … hath caused those luminous Gems of Holiness to appear out
of the realm of the spirit, in the noble form of the human temple,
and be made manifest unto all men, that they may impart unto the
world the mysteries of the unchangeable Being and tell of the
subtleties of His imperishable Essence… All the Prophets of God,
His well-favored, His holy and chosen Messengers are, without
exception, the bearers of His names and the embodiments of His
attributes… These Tabernacles of Holiness, these primal Mirrors
which reflect the Light of unfading glory, are but expressions of Him
Who is the Invisible of the Invisibles.”</q></p>


<p id='41' data-ref='wob_en-6-p41'>
That Bahá’u’lláh should, notwithstanding the overwhelming
intensity of His Revelation, be regarded as essentially one of these
Manifestations of God, never to be identified with that invisible
Reality, the Essence of Divinity itself, is one of the major beliefs
of our Faith — a belief which should never be obscured and the
integrity of which no one of its followers should allow to be
compromised.</p>


<p id='42' data-ref='wob_en-6-p42'>
Nor does the Bahá’í Revelation, claiming as it does to be the
culmination of a prophetic cycle and the fulfillment of the promise
of all ages, attempt, under any circumstances, to invalidate those
first and everlasting principles that animate and underlie the
religions that have preceded it. The God-given authority, vested in
each one of them, it admits and establishes as its firmest and
ultimate basis. It regards them in no other light except as different
stages in the eternal history and constant evolution of one religion,
Divine and indivisible, of which it itself forms but an integral
part. It neither seeks to obscure their Divine origin, nor to dwarf
the admitted magnitude of their colossal achievements. It can
countenance no attempt that seeks to distort their features or to
stultify the truths which they instill. Its teachings do not deviate
a hairbreadth from the verities they enshrine, nor does the weight of
its message detract one jot or one tittle from the influence they
exert or the loyalty they inspire. Far from aiming at the overthrow
of the spiritual foundation of the world’s religious systems, its
avowed, its unalterable purpose is to widen their basis, to restate
their fundamentals, to reconcile their aims, to reinvigorate their
life, to demonstrate their oneness, to restore the pristine purity of
their teachings, to coördinate their functions and to assist in the
realization of their highest aspirations. These divinely-revealed
religions, as a close observer has graphically expressed it, “are
doomed not to die, but to be reborn… ‘Does not the child succumb
in the youth and the youth in the man; yet neither child nor youth
perishes?’”</p>


<p id='43' data-ref='wob_en-6-p43'>
<q class='baha'>“They Who are the Luminaries of Truth and the Mirrors reflecting
the light of Divine Unity,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh explains in the
Kitáb-i-Íqán, <q class='baha'>“in whatever age and cycle they are sent down
from their invisible habitations of ancient glory unto this world to
educate the souls of men and endue with grace all created things, are
invariably endowed with an all-compelling power and invested with
invincible sovereignty… These sanctified Mirrors, these Day-Springs
of ancient glory are one and all the exponents on earth of Him Who is
the central Orb of the universe, its essence and ultimate purpose.
From Him proceed their knowledge and power; from Him is derived their
sovereignty. The beauty of their countenance is but a reflection of
His image, and their revelation a sign of His deathless glory…
Through them is transmitted a grace that is infinite, and by them is
revealed the light that can never fade… Human tongue can never
befittingly sing their praise, and human speech can never unfold
their mystery.”</q> <q class='baha'>“Inasmuch as these Birds of the celestial
Throne,”</q> He adds, <q class='baha'>“are all sent down from the heaven of
the Will of God, and as they all arise to proclaim His irresistible
Faith, they therefore are regarded as one soul and the same person…
They all abide in the same tabernacle, soar in the same heaven, are
seated upon the same throne, utter the same speech, and proclaim the
same Faith… They only differ in the intensity of their revelation
and the comparative potency of their light… That a certain
attribute of God hath not been outwardly manifested by these Essences
of Detachment doth in no wise imply that they Who are the Day-Springs
of God’s attributes and the Treasuries of His holy names did not
actually possess it.”</q></p>


<p id='44' data-ref='wob_en-6-p44'>
It should also be borne in mind that, great as is the power
manifested by this Revelation and however vast the range of the
Dispensation its Author has inaugurated, it emphatically repudiates
the claim to be regarded as the final revelation of God’s will and
purpose for mankind. To hold such a conception of its character and
functions would be tantamount to a betrayal of its cause and a denial
of its truth. It must necessarily conflict with the fundamental
principle which constitutes the bedrock of Bahá’í belief, the
principle that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that
Divine Revelation is orderly, continuous and progressive and not
spasmodic or final. Indeed, the categorical rejection by the
followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh of the claim to finality
which any religious system inaugurated by the Prophets of the past
may advance is as clear and emphatic as their own refusal to claim
that same finality for the Revelation with which they stand
identified. <q class='baha'>“To believe that all revelation is ended, that the
portals of Divine mercy are closed, that from the daysprings of
eternal holiness no sun shall rise again, that the ocean of
everlasting bounty is forever stilled, and that out of the tabernacle
of ancient glory the Messengers of God have ceased to be made
manifest”</q> must constitute in the eyes of every follower of the
Faith a grave, an inexcusable departure from one of its most
cherished and fundamental principles.</p>


<p id='45' data-ref='wob_en-6-p45'>
A reference to some of the already quoted utterances of Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will surely suffice to establish, beyond
the shadow of a doubt, the truth of this cardinal principle. Might
not the following passage of the Hidden Words be, likewise, construed
as an allegorical allusion to the progressiveness of Divine
Revelation and an admission by its Author that the Message with which
He has been entrusted is not the final and ultimate expression of the
will and guidance of the Almighty? <q class='baha'>“O Son of Justice! In the
night-season the beauty of the immortal Being hath repaired from the
emerald height of fidelity unto the Sadratu’l-Muntahá, and wept
with such a weeping that the concourse on high and the dwellers of
the realms above wailed at His lamenting. Whereupon there was asked,
Why the wailing and weeping? He made reply: As bidden I waited
expectant upon the hill of faithfulness, yet inhaled not from them
that dwell on earth the fragrance of fidelity. Then summoned to
return I beheld, and lo! certain doves of holiness were sore tried
within the claws of the dogs of earth. Thereupon the Maid of heaven
hastened forth unveiled and resplendent from Her mystic mansion, and
asked of their names, and all were told but one. And when urged, the
first letter thereof was uttered, whereupon the dwellers of the
celestial chambers rushed forth out of their habitation of glory. And
whilst the second letter was pronounced they fell down, one and all,
upon the dust. At that moment a voice was heard from the inmost
shrine: ‘Thus far and no farther.’ Verily We bear witness to that
which they have done and now are doing.”</q></p>


<p id='46' data-ref='wob_en-6-p46'>
In a more explicit language Bahá’u’lláh testifies to this truth
in one of His Tablets revealed in Adrianople: <q class='baha'>“Know verily that
the veil hiding Our countenance hath not been completely lifted. We
have revealed Our Self to a degree corresponding to the capacity of
the people of Our age. Should the Ancient Beauty be unveiled in the
fullness of His glory mortal eyes would be blinded by the dazzling
intensity of His revelation.”</q></p>


<p id='47' data-ref='wob_en-6-p47'>
In the Súriy-i-Ṣabr, revealed as far back as the year 1863, on the
very first day of His arrival in the garden of Riḍván, He thus
affirms: <q class='baha'>“God hath sent down His Messengers to succeed to Moses
and Jesus, and He will continue to do so till ‘the end that hath no
end’; so that His grace may, from the heaven of Divine bounty, be
continually vouchsafed to mankind.”</q> </p>



<p id='48' data-ref='wob_en-6-p48'>
<q class='baha'>“I am not apprehensive for My own self,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh
still more explicitly declares, <q class='baha'>“My fears are for Him Who will
be sent down unto you after Me — Him Who will be invested with great
sovereignty and mighty dominion.”</q> And again He writes in the
Súratu’l-Haykal: <q class='baha'>“By those words which I have revealed,
Myself is not intended, but rather He Who will come after Me. To it
is witness God, the All-Knowing.”</q> <q class='baha'>“Deal not with Him,”</q>
He adds, <q class='baha'>“as ye have dealt with Me.”</q></p>


<p id='49' data-ref='wob_en-6-p49'>
In a more circumstantial passage the Báb upholds the same truth in
His writings. <q class='bab'>“It is clear and evident,”</q> He writes in the
Persian Bayán, <q class='bab'>“that the object of all preceding Dispensations
hath been to pave the way for the advent of Muḥammad, the Apostle
of God. These, including the Muḥammadan Dispensation, have had, in
their turn, as their objective the Revelation proclaimed by the
Qá’im. The purpose underlying this Revelation, as well as those
that preceded it, has, in like manner, been to announce the advent of
the Faith of Him Whom God will make manifest. And this Faith — the
Faith of Him Whom God will make manifest — in its turn, together with
all the Revelations gone before it, have as their object the
Manifestation destined to succeed it. And the latter, no less than
all the Revelations preceding it, prepare the way for the Revelation
which is yet to follow. The process of the rise and setting of the
Sun of Truth will thus indefinitely continue — a process that hath
had no beginning and will have no end.”</q></p>


<p id='50' data-ref='wob_en-6-p50'>
<q class='baha'>“Know of a certainty,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh explains in this
connection, <q class='baha'>“that in every Dispensation the light of Divine
Revelation hath been vouchsafed to men in direct proportion to their
spiritual capacity. Consider the sun. How feeble its rays the moment
it appeareth above the horizon. How gradually its warmth and potency
increase as it approacheth its zenith, enabling meanwhile all created
things to adapt themselves to the growing intensity of its light. How
steadily it declineth until it reacheth its setting point. Were it
all of a sudden to manifest the energies latent within it, it would
no doubt cause injury to all created things… In like manner, if the
Sun of Truth were suddenly to reveal, at the earliest stages of its
manifestation, the full measure of the potencies which the providence
of the Almighty hath bestowed upon it, the earth of human
understanding would waste away and be consumed; for men’s hearts
would neither sustain the intensity of its revelation, nor be able to
mirror forth the radiance of its light. Dismayed and overpowered,
they would cease to exist.”</q> </p>



<p id='51' data-ref='wob_en-6-p51'>
In the light of these clear and conclusive statements it is our clear
duty to make it indubitably evident to every seeker after truth that
from “the beginning that hath no beginning” the Prophets of the
one, the unknowable God, including Bahá’u’lláh Himself, have
all, as the channels of God’s grace, as the exponents of His unity,
as the mirrors of His light and the revealers of His purpose, been
commissioned to unfold to mankind an ever-increasing measure of His
truth, of His inscrutable will and Divine guidance, and will continue
to “the end that hath no end” to vouchsafe still fuller and
mightier revelations of His limitless power and glory.</p>


<p id='52' data-ref='wob_en-6-p52'>
We might well ponder in our hearts the following passages from a
prayer revealed by Bahá’u’lláh which strikingly affirm, and are
a further evidence of, the reality of the great and essential truth
lying at the very core of His Message to mankind: <q class='baha'>“Praise be to
Thee, O Lord my God, for the wondrous revelations of Thine
inscrutable decree and the manifold woes and trials Thou hast
destined for myself. At one time Thou didst deliver me into the hands
of Nimrod; at another Thou hast allowed Pharaoh’s rod to persecute
me. Thou alone canst estimate, through Thine all-encompassing
knowledge and the operation of Thy Will, the incalculable afflictions
I have suffered at their hands. Again Thou didst cast me into the
prison-cell of the ungodly for no reason except that I was moved to
whisper into the ears of the well-favored denizens of Thy kingdom an
intimation of the vision with which Thou hadst, through Thy
knowledge, inspired me and revealed to me its meaning through the
potency of Thy might. And again Thou didst decree that I be beheaded
by the sword of the infidel. Again I was crucified for having
unveiled to men’s eyes the hidden gems of Thy glorious unity, for
having revealed to them the wondrous signs of Thy sovereign and
everlasting power. How bitter the humiliations heaped upon me, in a
subsequent age, on the plain of Karbilá! How lonely did I feel
amidst Thy people; to what state of helplessness I was reduced in
that land! Unsatisfied with such indignities, my persecutors
decapitated me and carrying aloft my head from land to land paraded
it before the gaze of the unbelieving multitude and deposited it on
the seats of the perverse and faithless. In a later age I was
suspended and my breast was made a target to the darts of the
malicious cruelty of my foes. My limbs were riddled with bullets and
my body was torn asunder. Finally, behold how in this day my
treacherous enemies have leagued themselves against me, and are
continually plotting to instill the venom of hate and malice into the
souls of Thy servants. With all their might they are scheming to
accomplish their purpose… Grievous as is my plight, O God, my
Well-beloved, I render thanks unto Thee, and my spirit is grateful
for whatsoever hath befallen me in the path of Thy good-pleasure. I
am well pleased with that which Thou didst ordain for me, and
welcome, however calamitous, the pains and sorrows I am made to
suffer.”</q> </p>



<hr class='small compact'>
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='sub_disp_bab'>The Báb</h3>

<p id='53' data-ref='wob_en-6-p53'>
Dearly-beloved friends! That the Báb, the inaugurator of the Bábí
Dispensation, is fully entitled to rank as one of the self-sufficient
Manifestations of God, that He has been invested with sovereign power
and authority, and exercises all the rights and prerogatives of
independent Prophethood, is yet another fundamental verity which the
Message of Bahá’u’lláh insistently proclaims and which its
followers must uncompromisingly uphold. That He is not to be regarded
merely as an inspired Precursor of the Bahá’í Revelation, that in
His person, as He Himself bears witness in the Persian Bayán, the
object of all the Prophets gone before Him has been fulfilled, is a
truth which I feel it my duty to demonstrate and emphasize. We would
assuredly be failing in our duty to the Faith we profess and would be
violating one of its basic and sacred principles if in our words or
by our conduct we hesitate to recognize the implications of this root
principle of Bahá’í belief, or refuse to uphold unreservedly its
integrity and demonstrate its truth. Indeed the chief motive
actuating me to undertake the task of editing and translating Nabíl’s
immortal Narrative has been to enable every follower of the Faith in
the West to better understand and more readily grasp the tremendous
implications of His exalted station and to more ardently admire and
love Him.</p>


<p id='54' data-ref='wob_en-6-p54'>
There can be no doubt that the claim to the twofold station ordained
for the Báb by the Almighty, a claim which He Himself has so boldly
advanced, which Bahá’u’lláh has repeatedly affirmed, and to
which the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has finally
given the sanction of its testimony, constitutes the most distinctive
feature of the Bahá’í Dispensation. It is a further evidence of
its uniqueness, a tremendous accession to the strength, to the
mysterious power and authority with which this holy cycle has been
invested. Indeed the greatness of the Báb consists primarily, not in
His being the divinely-appointed Forerunner of so transcendent a
Revelation, but rather in His having been invested with the powers
inherent in the inaugurator of a separate religious Dispensation, and
in His wielding, to a degree unrivaled by the Messengers gone before
Him, the scepter of independent Prophethood.</p>


<p id='55' data-ref='wob_en-6-p55'>
The short duration of His Dispensation, the restricted range within
which His laws and ordinances have been made to operate, supply no
criterion whatever wherewith to judge its Divine origin and to
evaluate the potency of its message. <q class='baha'>“That so brief a span,”</q>
Bahá’u’lláh Himself explains, <q class='baha'>“should have separated this
most mighty and wondrous Revelation from Mine own previous
Manifestation, is a secret that no man can unravel and a mystery such
as no mind can fathom. Its duration had been foreordained, and no man
shall ever discover its reason unless and until he be informed of the
contents of My Hidden Book.”</q> <q class='baha'>“Behold,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh
further explains in the Kitáb-i-Badí’, one of His works refuting
the arguments of the people of the Bayán, <q class='baha'>“behold, how
immediately upon the completion of the ninth year of this wondrous,
this most holy and merciful Dispensation, the requisite number of
pure, of wholly consecrated and sanctified souls had been most
secretly consummated.”</q></p>


<p id='56' data-ref='wob_en-6-p56'>
The marvelous happenings that have heralded the advent of the Founder
of the Bábí Dispensation, the dramatic circumstances of His own
eventful life, the miraculous tragedy of His martyrdom, the magic of
His influence exerted on the most eminent and powerful among His
countrymen, to all of which every chapter of Nabíl’s stirring
narrative testifies, should in themselves be regarded as sufficient
evidence of the validity of His claim to so exalted a station among
the Prophets.</p>


<p id='57' data-ref='wob_en-6-p57'>
However graphic the record which the eminent chronicler of His life
has transmitted to posterity, so luminous a narrative must pale
before the glowing tribute paid to the Báb by the pen of
Bahá’u’lláh. This tribute the Báb Himself has, by the clear
assertion of His claim, abundantly supported, while the written
testimonies of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have powerfully reinforced its
character and elucidated its meaning.</p>


<p id='58' data-ref='wob_en-6-p58'>
Where else if not in the Kitáb-i-Íqán can the student of the Bábí
Dispensation seek to find those affirmations that unmistakably attest
the power and spirit which no man, except he be a Manifestation of
God, can manifest? <q class='baha'>“Could such a thing,”</q> exclaims
Bahá’u’lláh, <q class='baha'>“be made manifest except through the power of
a Divine Revelation and the potency of God’s invincible Will? By
the righteousness of God! Were any one to entertain so great a
Revelation in his heart the thought of such a declaration would alone
confound him! Were the hearts of all men to be crowded into his
heart, he would still hesitate to venture upon so awful an
enterprise.”</q> <q class='baha'>“No eye,”</q> He in another passage
affirms, <q class='baha'>“hath beheld so great an outpouring of bounty, nor hath
any ear heard of such a Revelation of loving-kindness… The Prophets
‘endowed with constancy,’ whose loftiness and glory shine as the
sun, were each honored with a Book which all have seen, and the
verses of which have been duly ascertained. Whereas the verses which
have rained from this Cloud of divine mercy have been so abundant
that none hath yet been able to estimate their number… How can they
belittle this Revelation? Hath any age witnessed such momentous
happenings?”</q></p>


<p id='59' data-ref='wob_en-6-p59'>
Commenting on the character and influence of those heroes and martyrs
whom the spirit of the Báb had so magically transformed Bahá’u’lláh
reveals the following: <q class='baha'>“If these companions be not the true
strivers after God, who else could be called by this name?… If
these companions, with all their marvelous testimonies and wondrous
works, be false, who then is worthy to claim for himself the truth?…
Has the world since the days of Adam witnessed such tumult, such
violent commotion?… Methinks, patience was revealed only by virtue
of their fortitude, and faithfulness itself was begotten only by
their deeds.”</q></p>


<p id='60' data-ref='wob_en-6-p60'>
Wishing to stress the sublimity of the Báb’s exalted station as
compared with that of the Prophets of the past, Bahá’u’lláh in
that same epistle asserts: <q class='baha'>“No understanding can grasp the
nature of His Revelation, nor can any knowledge comprehend the full
measure of His Faith.”</q> He then quotes, in confirmation of His
argument, these prophetic words: <q class='baha'>“Knowledge is twenty and seven
letters. All that the Prophets have revealed are two letters thereof.
No man thus far hath known more than these two letters. But when the
Qá’im shall arise, He will cause the remaining twenty and five
letters to be made manifest.”</q> <q class='baha'>“Behold,”</q> He adds,
<q class='baha'>“how great and lofty is His station! His rank excelleth that of
all the Prophets and His Revelation transcendeth the comprehension
and understanding of all their chosen ones.”</q> <q class='baha'>“Of His
Revelation,”</q> He further adds, <q class='baha'>“the Prophets of God, His
saints and chosen ones, have either not been informed, or, in
pursuance of God’s inscrutable decree, they have not disclosed.”</q></p>


<p id='61' data-ref='wob_en-6-p61'>
Of all the tributes which Bahá’u’lláh’s unerring pen has
chosen to pay to the memory of the Báb, His “Best-Beloved,” the
most memorable and touching is this brief, yet eloquent passage which
so greatly enhances the value of the concluding passages of that same
epistle. <q class='baha'>“Amidst them all,”</q> He writes, referring to the
afflictive trials and dangers besetting Him in the city of Ba<u>gh</u>dád,
<q class='baha'>“We stand life in hand wholly resigned to His Will, that
perchance through God’s loving kindness and grace, this revealed
and manifest Letter (Bahá’u’lláh) may lay down His life
as a sacrifice in the path of the Primal Point, the most exalted Word
(the Báb). By Him, at Whose bidding the Spirit hath spoken,
but for this yearning of Our soul, We would not, for one moment, have
tarried any longer in this city.”</q></p>


<p id='62' data-ref='wob_en-6-p62'>
Dearly-beloved friends! So resounding a praise, so bold an assertion
issued by the pen of Bahá’u’lláh in so weighty a work, are
fully re-echoed in the language in which the Source of the Bábí
Revelation has chosen to clothe the claims He Himself has advanced.
<q class='bab'>“I am the Mystic Fane,”</q> the Báb thus proclaims His
station in the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá, <q class='bab'>“which the Hand of
Omnipotence hath reared. I am the Lamp which the Finger of God hath
lit within its niche and caused to shine with deathless splendor. I
am the Flame of that supernal Light that glowed upon Sinai in the
gladsome Spot, and lay concealed in the midst of the Burning Bush.”</q>
<q class='bab'>“O Qurratu’l-‘Ayn!”</q> He, addressing Himself in that
same commentary, exclaims, <q class='bab'>“I recognize in Thee none other
except the ‘Great Announcement’ — the Announcement voiced by the
Concourse on high. By this name, I bear witness, they that circle the
Throne of Glory have ever known Thee.”</q> <q class='bab'>“With each and
every Prophet, Whom We have sent down in the past,”</q> He further
adds, <q class='bab'>“We have established a separate Covenant concerning the
‘Remembrance of God’ and His Day. Manifest, in the realm of glory
and through the power of truth, are the ‘Remembrance of God’ and
His Day before the eyes of the angels that circle His mercy-seat.”</q>
<q class='bab'>“Should it be Our wish,”</q> He again affirms, <q class='bab'>“it is in
Our power to compel, through the agency of but one letter of Our
Revelation, the world and all that is therein to recognize, in less
than the twinkling of an eye, the truth of Our Cause.”</q></p>


<p id='63' data-ref='wob_en-6-p63'>
<q class='bab'>“I am the Primal Point,”</q> the Báb thus addresses Muḥammad
<u>Sh</u>áh from the prison-fortress of Máh-Kú, <q class='bab'>“from which
have been generated all created things… I am the Countenance of God
Whose splendor can never be obscured, the light of God whose radiance
can never fade… All the keys of heaven God hath chosen to place on
My right hand, and all the keys of hell on My left… I am one of the
sustaining pillars of the Primal Word of God. Whosoever hath
recognized Me, hath known all that is true and right, and hath
attained all that is good and seemly… The substance wherewith God
hath created Me is not the clay out of which others have been formed.
He hath conferred upon Me that which the worldly-wise can never
comprehend, nor the faithful discover.”</q> <q class='bab'>“Should a tiny
ant,”</q> the Báb, wishing to stress the limitless potentialities
latent in His Dispensation, characteristically affirms, <q class='bab'>“desire
in this day to be possessed of such power as to be able to unravel
the abstrusest and most bewildering passages of the Qur’án, its
wish will no doubt be fulfilled, inasmuch as the mystery of eternal
might vibrates within the innermost being of all created things.”</q>
<q class='abd'>“If so helpless a creature,”</q> is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
comment on so startling an affirmation, <q class='abd'>“can be endowed with so
subtle a capacity, how much more efficacious must be the power
released through the liberal effusions of the grace of Bahá’u’lláh!”</q></p>


<p id='64' data-ref='wob_en-6-p64'>
To these authoritative assertions and solemn declarations made by
Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb must be added ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
own incontrovertible testimony. He, the appointed interpreter of the
utterances of both Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb, corroborates, not
by implication but in clear and categorical language, both in His
Tablets and in His Testament, the truth of the statements to which I
have already referred.</p>


<p id='65' data-ref='wob_en-6-p65'>
In a Tablet addressed to a Bahá’í in Mázindarán, in which He
unfolds the meaning of a misinterpreted statement attributed to Him
regarding the rise of the Sun of Truth in this century, He sets
forth, briefly but conclusively, what should remain for all time our
true conception of the relationship between the two Manifestations
associated with the Bahá’í Dispensation. <q class='abd'>“In making such a
statement,”</q> He explains, <q class='abd'>“I had in mind no one else except
the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, the character of whose Revelations it
had been my purpose to elucidate. The Revelation of the Báb may be
likened to the sun, its station corresponding to the first sign of
the Zodiac — the sign Aries — which the sun enters at the Vernal
Equinox. The station of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation, on the
other hand, is represented by the sign Leo, the sun’s mid-summer
and highest station. By this is meant that this holy Dispensation is
illumined with the light of the Sun of Truth shining from its most
exalted station, and in the plenitude of its resplendency, its heat
and glory.”</q></p>


<p id='66' data-ref='wob_en-6-p66'>
<q class='abd'>“The Báb, the Exalted One,”</q> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá more
specifically affirms in another Tablet, <q class='abd'>“is the Morn of Truth,
the splendor of Whose light shineth throughout all regions. He is
also the Harbinger of the Most Great Light, the Abhá Luminary. The
Blessed Beauty is the One promised by the sacred books of the past,
the revelation of the Source of light that shone upon Mount Sinai,
Whose fire glowed in the midst of the Burning Bush. We are, one and
all, servants of their threshold, and stand each as a lowly keeper at
their door.”</q> <q class='abd'>“Every proof and prophecy,”</q> is His
still more emphatic warning, <q class='abd'>“every manner of evidence, whether
based on reason or on the text of the scriptures and traditions, are
to be regarded as centered in the persons of Bahá’u’lláh and
the Báb. In them is to be found their complete fulfillment.”</q></p>


<p id='67' data-ref='wob_en-6-p67'>
And finally, in His Will and Testament, the repository of His last
wishes and parting instructions, He in the following passage,
specifically designed to set forth the guiding principles of Bahá’í
belief, sets the seal of His testimony on the Báb’s dual and
exalted station: <q class='abd'>“The foundation of the belief of the people of
Bahá (may my life be offered up for them) is this: His holiness the
exalted One (the Báb) is the Manifestation of the unity and
oneness of God and the Forerunner of the Ancient Beauty
(Bahá’u’lláh). His holiness, the Abhá Beauty
(Bahá’u’lláh) (may my life be offered up as a sacrifice
for His steadfast friends) is the supreme Manifestation of God and
the Day-Spring of His most divine Essence.”</q> <q class='abd'>“All others,”</q>
He significantly adds, <q class='abd'>“are servants unto Him and do His
bidding.”</q> </p>



<hr class='small compact'>
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='sub_disp_abd'>‘Abdu’l-Bahá</h3>

<p id='68' data-ref='wob_en-6-p68'>
Dearly-beloved friends! I have in the foregoing pages ventured to
attempt an exposition of such truths as I firmly believe are implicit
in the claim of Him Who is the Fountain-Head of the Bahá’í
Revelation. I have moreover endeavored to dissipate such
misapprehensions as may naturally arise in the mind of any one
contemplating so superhuman a manifestation of the glory of God. I
have striven to explain the meaning of the divinity with which He Who
is the vehicle of so mysterious an energy must needs be invested.
That the Message which so great a Being has, in this age, been
commissioned by God to deliver to mankind recognizes the divine
origin and upholds the first principles of every Dispensation
inaugurated by the prophets of the past, and stands inextricably
interwoven with each one of them, I have also to the best of my
ability undertaken to demonstrate. That the Author of such a Faith,
Who repudiates the claim to finality which leaders of various
denominations uphold has, despite the vastness of His Revelation,
disclaimed it for Himself I have, likewise, felt it necessary to
prove and emphasize. That the Báb, notwithstanding the duration of
His Dispensation, should be regarded primarily, not as the chosen
Precursor of the Bahá’í Faith, but as One invested with the
undivided authority assumed by each of the independent Prophets of
the past, seemed to me yet another basic principle the elucidation of
which would be extremely desirable at the present stage of the
evolution of our Cause.</p>


<p id='69' data-ref='wob_en-6-p69'>
An attempt I strongly feel should now be made to clarify our minds
regarding the station occupied by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the
significance of His position in this holy Dispensation. It would be
indeed difficult for us, who stand so close to such a tremendous
figure and are drawn by the mysterious power of so magnetic a
personality, to obtain a clear and exact understanding of the rôle
and character of One Who, not only in the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh
but in the entire field of religious history, fulfills a unique
function. Though moving in a sphere of His own and holding a rank
radically different from that of the Author and the Forerunner of the
Bahá’í Revelation, He, by virtue of the station ordained for Him
through the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, forms together with them
what may be termed the Three Central Figures of a Faith that stands
unapproached in the world’s spiritual history. He towers, in
conjunction with them, above the destinies of this infant Faith of
God from a level to which no individual or body ministering to its
needs after Him, and for no less a period than a full thousand years,
can ever hope to rise. To degrade His lofty rank by identifying His
station with or by regarding it as roughly equivalent to, the
position of those on whom the mantle of His authority has fallen
would be an act of impiety as grave as the no less heretical belief
that inclines to exalt Him to a state of absolute equality with
either the central Figure or Forerunner of our Faith. For wide as is
the gulf that separates ‘Abdu’l-Bahá from Him Who is the
Source of an independent Revelation, it can never be regarded as
commensurate with the greater distance that stands between Him Who is
the Center of the Covenant and His ministers who are to carry on His
work, whatever be their name, their rank, their functions or their
future achievements. Let those who have known ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
who through their contact with His magnetic personality have come to
cherish for Him so fervent an admiration, reflect, in the light of
this statement, on the greatness of One Who is so far above Him in
station.</p>


<p id='70' data-ref='wob_en-6-p70'>
That ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is not a Manifestation of God, that,
though the successor of His Father, He does not occupy a cognate
station, that no one else except the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh can
ever lay claim to such a station before the expiration of a full
thousand years — are verities which lie embedded in the specific
utterances of both the Founder of our Faith and the Interpreter of
His teachings.</p>


<p id='71' data-ref='wob_en-6-p71'>
<q class='baha'>“Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from God,”</q> is
the express warning uttered in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, <q class='baha'>“ere the
expiration of a full thousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying
imposter. We pray God that He may graciously assist him to retract
and repudiate such claim. Should he repent, God will no doubt forgive
him. If, however, he persists in his error, God will assuredly send
down one who will deal mercilessly with him. Terrible indeed is God
in punishing!”</q> <q class='baha'>“Whosoever,”</q> He adds as a further
emphasis, <q class='baha'>“interpreteth this verse otherwise than its obvious
meaning is deprived of the Spirit of God and of His mercy which
encompasseth all created things.”</q> <q class='baha'>“Should a man appear,”</q>
is yet another conclusive statement, <q class='baha'>“ere the lapse of a full
thousand years — each year consisting of twelve months according to
the Qur’án, and of nineteen months of nineteen days each,
according to the Bayán — and if such a man reveal to your eyes all
the signs of God, unhesitatingly reject him!”</q> </p>



<p id='72' data-ref='wob_en-6-p72'>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own statements, in confirmation of this
warning, are no less emphatic and binding: <q class='abd'>“This is,”</q> He
declares, <q class='abd'>“my firm, my unshakable conviction, the essence of my
unconcealed and explicit belief — a conviction and belief which the
denizens of the Abhá Kingdom fully share: The Blessed Beauty is the
Sun of Truth, and His light the light of truth. The Báb is likewise
the Sun of Truth, and His light the light of truth… My station is
the station of servitude — a servitude which is complete, pure and
real, firmly established, enduring, obvious, explicitly revealed and
subject to no interpretation whatever… I am the Interpreter of the
Word of God; such is my interpretation.”</q></p>


<p id='73' data-ref='wob_en-6-p73'>
Does not ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His own Will — in a tone and
language that might well confound the most inveterate among the
breakers of His Father’s Covenant — rob of their chief weapon those
who so long and so persistently had striven to impute to Him the
charge of having tacitly claimed a station equal, if not superior, to
that of Bahá’u’lláh? <q class='abd'>“The foundation of the belief of the
people of Bahá is this,”</q> thus proclaims one of the weightiest
passages of that last document left to voice in perpetuity the
directions and wishes of a departed Master, <q class='abd'>“His Holiness the
Exalted One (the Báb) is the Manifestation of the unity and
oneness of God and the Forerunner of the Ancient Beauty. His Holiness
the Abhá Beauty (Bahá’u’lláh) (may my life be a
sacrifice for His steadfast friends) is the supreme Manifestation of
God and the Day-Spring of His most divine Essence. All others are
servants unto Him and do His bidding.”</q></p>


<p id='74' data-ref='wob_en-6-p74'>
From such clear and formally laid down statements, incompatible as
they are with any assertion of a claim to Prophethood, we should not
by any means infer that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is merely one of the
servants of the Blessed Beauty, or at best one whose function is to
be confined to that of an authorized interpreter of His Father’s
teachings. Far be it from me to entertain such a notion or to wish to
instill such sentiments. To regard Him in such a light is a manifest
betrayal of the priceless heritage bequeathed by Bahá’u’lláh to
mankind. Immeasurably exalted is the station conferred upon Him by
the Supreme Pen above and beyond the implications of these, His own
written statements. Whether in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the most weighty
and sacred of all the works of Bahá’u’lláh, or in the
Kitáb-i-‘Ahd, the Book of His Covenant, or in the Súriy-i-<u>Gh</u>usn
(Tablet of the Branch), such references as have been recorded by the
pen of Bahá’u’lláh — references which the Tablets of His Father
addressed to Him mightily reinforce — invest ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
with a power, and surround Him with a halo, which the present
generation can never adequately appreciate.</p>


<p id='75' data-ref='wob_en-6-p75'>
He is, and should for all time be regarded, first and foremost, as
the Center and Pivot of Bahá’u’lláh’s peerless and
all-enfolding Covenant, His most exalted handiwork, the stainless
Mirror of His light, the perfect Exemplar of His teachings, the
unerring Interpreter of His Word, the embodiment of every Bahá’í
ideal, the incarnation of every Bahá’í virtue, the Most Mighty
Branch sprung from the Ancient Root, the Limb of the Law of God, the
Being <q class='baha'>“round Whom all names revolve,”</q> the Mainspring of
the Oneness of Humanity, the Ensign of the Most Great Peace, the Moon
of the Central Orb of this most holy Dispensation — styles and titles
that are implicit and find their truest, their highest and fairest
expression in the magic name ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He is, above
and beyond these appellations, the <q class='baha'>“Mystery of God”</q> — an
expression by which Bahá’u’lláh Himself has chosen to designate
Him, and which, while it does not by any means justify us to assign
to Him the station of Prophethood, indicates how in the person of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá the incompatible characteristics of a human
nature and superhuman knowledge and perfection have been blended and
are completely harmonized.</p>


<p id='76' data-ref='wob_en-6-p76'>
<q class='baha'>“When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My
Revelation is ended,”</q> proclaims the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, <q class='baha'>“turn
your faces towards Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from
this Ancient Root.”</q> And again, <q class='baha'>“When the Mystic Dove will
have winged its flight from its Sanctuary of Praise and sought its
far-off goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye whatsoever ye
understand not in the Book to Him Who hath branched from this mighty
Stock.”</q></p>


<p id='77' data-ref='wob_en-6-p77'>
In the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd, moreover, Bahá’u’lláh solemnly and
explicitly declares: <q class='baha'>“It is incumbent upon the A<u>gh</u>ṣán,
the Afnán and My kindred to turn, one and all, their faces towards
the Most Mighty Branch. Consider that which We have revealed in Our
Most Holy Book: ‘When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the
Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward Him Whom God
hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root.’ The
object of this sacred verse is none other except the Most Mighty
Branch (‘Abdu’l-Bahá). Thus have We graciously
revealed unto you our potent Will, and I am verily the Gracious, the
All-Powerful.”</q></p>


<p id='78' data-ref='wob_en-6-p78'>
In the Súriy-i-<u>Gh</u>usn (Tablet of the Branch) the following
verses have been recorded: <q class='baha'>“There hath branched from the
Sadratu’l-Muntahá this sacred and glorious Being, this Branch of
Holiness; well is it with him that hath sought His shelter and
abideth beneath His shadow. Verily the Limb of the Law of God hath
sprung forth from this Root which God hath firmly implanted in the
Ground of His Will, and Whose Branch hath been so uplifted as to
encompass the whole of creation. Magnified be He, therefore, for this
sublime, this blessed, this mighty, this exalted Handiwork!… A Word
hath, as a token of Our grace, gone forth from the Most Great
Tablet — a Word which God hath adorned with the ornament of His own
Self, and made it sovereign over the earth and all that is therein,
and a sign of His greatness and power among its people …Render
thanks unto God, O people, for His appearance; for verily He is the
most great Favor unto you, the most perfect bounty upon you; and
through Him every mouldering bone is quickened. Whoso turneth towards
Him hath turned towards God, and whoso turneth away from Him hath
turned away from My beauty, hath repudiated My Proof, and
transgressed against Me. He is the Trust of God amongst you, His
charge within you, His manifestation unto you and His appearance
among His favored servants… We have sent Him down in the form of a
human temple. Blest and sanctified be God Who createth whatsoever He
willeth through His inviolable, His infallible decree. They who
deprive themselves of the shadow of the Branch, are lost in the
wilderness of error, are consumed by the heat of worldly desires, and
are of those who will assuredly perish.”</q></p>


<p id='79' data-ref='wob_en-6-p79'>
<q class='baha'>“O Thou Who art the apple of Mine eye!”</q> Bahá’u’lláh,
in His own handwriting, thus addresses ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, <q class='baha'>“My
glory, the ocean of My loving-kindness, the sun of My bounty, the
heaven of My mercy rest upon Thee. We pray God to illumine the world
through Thy knowledge and wisdom, to ordain for Thee that which will
gladden Thine heart and impart consolation to Thine eyes.”</q> <q class='baha'>“The
glory of God rest upon Thee,”</q> He writes in another Tablet, <q class='baha'>“and
upon whosoever serveth Thee and circleth around Thee. Woe, great woe,
betide him that opposeth and injureth Thee. Well is it with him that
sweareth fealty to Thee; the fire of hell torment him who is Thine
enemy.”</q> <q class='baha'>“We have made Thee a shelter for all mankind,”</q>
He, in yet another Tablet, affirms, <q class='baha'>“a shield unto all who are
in heaven and on earth, a stronghold for whosoever hath believed in
God, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing. God grant that through Thee
He may protect them, may enrich and sustain them, that He may inspire
Thee with that which shall be a wellspring of wealth unto all created
things, an ocean of bounty unto all men, and the dayspring of mercy
unto all peoples.”</q></p>


<p id='80' data-ref='wob_en-6-p80'>
<q class='baha'>“Thou knowest, O my God,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh, in a prayer
revealed in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s honor, supplicates, <q class='baha'>“that
I desire for Him naught except that which Thou didst desire, and have
chosen Him for no purpose save that which Thou hadst intended for
Him. Render Him victorious, therefore, through Thy hosts of earth and
heaven… Ordain, I beseech Thee, by the ardor of My love for Thee
and My yearning to manifest Thy Cause, for Him, as well as for them
that love Him, that which Thou hast destined for Thy Messengers and
the Trustees of Thy Revelation. Verily, Thou art the Almighty, the
All-Powerful.”</q></p>


<p id='81' data-ref='wob_en-6-p81'>
In a letter dictated by Bahá’u’lláh and addressed by Mírzá
Áqá Ján, His amanuensis, to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá while the
latter was on a visit to Beirut, we read the following: <q class='baha'>“Praise
be to Him Who hath honored the Land of Bá (Beirut) through
the presence of Him round Whom all names revolve. All the atoms of
the earth have announced unto all created things that from behind the
gate of the Prison-city there hath appeared and above its horizon
there hath shone forth the Orb of the beauty of the great, the Most
Mighty Branch of God — His ancient and immutable Mystery — proceeding
on its way to another land. Sorrow, thereby, hath enveloped this
Prison-city, whilst another land rejoiceth… Blessed, doubly
blessed, is the ground which His footsteps have trodden, the eye that
hath been cheered by the beauty of His countenance, the ear that hath
been honored by hearkening to His call, the heart that hath tasted
the sweetness of His love, the breast that hath dilated through His
remembrance, the pen that hath voiced His praise, the scroll that
hath borne the testimony of His writings.”</q></p>


<p id='82' data-ref='wob_en-6-p82'>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, writing in confirmation of the authority
conferred upon Him by Bahá’u’lláh, makes the following
statement: <q class='abd'>“In accordance with the explicit text of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh hath made the Center of the Covenant
the Interpreter of His Word — a Covenant so firm and mighty that from
the beginning of time until the present day no religious Dispensation
hath produced its like.”</q></p>


<p id='83' data-ref='wob_en-6-p83'>
Exalted as is the rank of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and however
profuse the praises with which in these sacred Books and Tablets
Bahá’u’lláh has glorified His son, so unique a distinction must
never be construed as conferring upon its recipient a station
identical with, or equivalent to, that of His Father, the
Manifestation Himself. To give such an interpretation to any of these
quoted passages would at once, and for obvious reasons, bring it into
conflict with the no less clear and authentic assertions and warnings
to which I have already referred. Indeed, as I have already stated,
those who overestimate ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s station are just
as reprehensible and have done just as much harm as those who
underestimate it. And this for no other reason except that by
insisting upon an altogether unwarranted inference from Bahá’u’lláh’s
writings they are inadvertently justifying and continuously
furnishing the enemy with proofs for his false accusations and
misleading statements.</p>


<p id='84' data-ref='wob_en-6-p84'>
I feel it necessary, therefore, to state without any equivocation or
hesitation that neither in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas nor in the Book of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, nor even in the Tablet of the Branch,
nor in any other Tablet, whether revealed by Bahá’u’lláh or
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is there any authority whatever for the
opinion that inclines to uphold the so-called “mystic unity” of
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, or to establish the
identity of the latter with His Father or with any preceding
Manifestation. This erroneous conception may, in part, be ascribed to
an altogether extravagant interpretation of certain terms and
passages in the Tablet of the Branch, to the introduction into its
English translation of certain words that are either non-existent,
misleading, or ambiguous in their connotation. It is, no doubt,
chiefly based upon an altogether unjustified inference from the
opening passages of a Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh, extracts of which,
as reproduced in the “Bahá’í Scriptures”, immediately
precede, but form no part of, the said Tablet of the Branch. It
should be made clear to every one reading those extracts that by the
phrase “the Tongue of the Ancient” no one else is meant but God,
and that the term “the Greatest Name” is an obvious reference to
Bahá’u’lláh, and that “the Covenant” referred to is not the
specific Covenant of which Bahá’u’lláh is the immediate Author
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá the Center but that general Covenant
which, as inculcated by the Bahá’í teaching, God Himself
invariably establishes with mankind when He inaugurates a new
Dispensation. “The Tongue” that “gives,” as stated in those
extracts, the “glad-tidings” is none other than the Voice of God
referring to Bahá’u’lláh, and not Bahá’u’lláh referring
to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.</p>


<p id='85' data-ref='wob_en-6-p85'>
Moreover, to maintain that the assertion “He is Myself,” instead
of denoting the mystic unity of God and His Manifestations, as
explained in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, establishes the identity of
Bahá’u’lláh with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, would constitute a
direct violation of the oft-repeated principle of the oneness of
God’s Manifestations — a principle which the Author of these same
extracts is seeking by implication to emphasize.</p>


<p id='86' data-ref='wob_en-6-p86'>
It would also amount to a reversion to those irrational and
superstitious beliefs which have insensibly crept, in the first
century of the Christian era, into the teachings of Jesus Christ, and
by crystallizing into accepted dogmas have impaired the effectiveness
and obscured the purpose of the Christian Faith.</p>


<p id='87' data-ref='wob_en-6-p87'>
<q class='abd'>“I affirm,”</q> is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own written
comment on the Tablet of the Branch, <q class='abd'>“that the true meaning, the
real significance, the innermost secret of these verses, of these
very words, is my own servitude to the sacred Threshold of the Abhá
Beauty, my complete self-effacement, my utter nothingness before Him.
This is my resplendent crown, my most precious adorning. On this I
pride myself in the kingdom of earth and heaven. Therein I glory
among the company of the well-favored!”</q> <q class='abd'>“No one is
permitted,”</q> He warns us in the passage which immediately
follows, <q class='abd'>“to give these verses any other interpretation.”</q>
<q class='abd'>“I am,”</q> He, in this same connection, affirms, <q class='abd'>“according
to the explicit texts of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd
the manifest Interpreter of the Word of God… Whoso deviates from my
interpretation is a victim of his own fancy.”</q></p>


<p id='88' data-ref='wob_en-6-p88'>
Furthermore, the inescapable inference from the belief in the
identity of the Author of our Faith with Him Who is the Center of His
Covenant would be to place ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a position
superior to that of the Báb, the reverse of which is the
fundamental, though not as yet universally recognized, principle of
this Revelation. It would also justify the charge with which, all
throughout ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry, the
Covenant-Breakers have striven to poison the minds and pervert the
understanding of Bahá’u’lláh’s loyal followers.</p>


<p id='89' data-ref='wob_en-6-p89'>
It would be more correct, and in consonance with the established
principles of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb, if instead of
maintaining this fictitious identity with reference to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
we regard the Forerunner and the Founder of our Faith as identical in
reality — a truth which the text of the Súratu’l-Haykal
unmistakably affirms. <q class='baha'>“Had the Primal Point (the Báb)
been someone else beside Me as ye claim,”</q> is Bahá’u’lláh’s
explicit statement, <q class='baha'>“and had attained My presence, verily He
would have never allowed Himself to be separated from Me, but rather
We would have had mutual delights with each other in My Days.”</q>
<q class='baha'>“He Who now voiceth the Word of God,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh
again affirms, <q class='baha'>“is none other except the Primal Point Who hath
once again been made manifest.”</q> <q class='baha'>“He is,”</q> He thus
refers to Himself in a Tablet addressed to one of the Letters of the
Living, <q class='baha'>“the same as the One Who appeared in the year sixty
(1260 A.H.). This verily is one of His mighty signs.”</q>
<q class='baha'>“Who,”</q> He pleads in the Súriy-i-Damm, <q class='baha'>“will arise to
secure the triumph of the Primal Beauty (the Báb) revealed in the
countenance of His succeeding Manifestation?”</q> Referring to the
Revelation proclaimed by the Báb He conversely characterizes it as
<q class='baha'>“My own previous Manifestation.”</q></p>


<p id='90' data-ref='wob_en-6-p90'>
That ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is not a Manifestation of God, that He
gets His light, His inspiration and sustenance direct from the
Fountain-head of the Bahá’í Revelation; that He reflects even as
a clear and perfect Mirror the rays of Bahá’u’lláh’s glory,
and does not inherently possess that indefinable yet all-pervading
reality the exclusive possession of which is the hallmark of
Prophethood; that His words are not equal in rank, though they
possess an equal validity with the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh;
that He is not to be acclaimed as the return of Jesus Christ, the Son
Who will come “in the glory of the Father” — these truths find
added justification, and are further reinforced, by the following
statement of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, addressed to some believers in
America, with which I may well conclude this section: <q class='abd'>“You have
written that there is a difference among the believers concerning the
‘Second Coming of Christ.’ Gracious God! Time and again this
question hath arisen, and its answer hath emanated in a clear and
irrefutable statement from the pen of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that
what is meant in the prophecies by the ‘Lord of Hosts’ and the
‘Promised Christ’ is the Blessed Perfection (Bahá’u’lláh)
and His holiness the Exalted One (the Báb). My name is
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. My qualification is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
My reality is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. My praise is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Thraldom to the Blessed Perfection is my glorious and refulgent
diadem, and servitude to all the human race my perpetual religion…
No name, no title, no mention, no commendation have I, nor will ever
have, except ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This is my longing. This is my
greatest yearning. This is my eternal life. This is my everlasting
glory.”</q> </p>



<hr class='small compact'>
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='sub_disp_adm'>The Administrative Order</h3>

<p id='91' data-ref='wob_en-6-p91'>
Dearly-beloved brethren in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! With the
ascension of Bahá’u’lláh the Day-Star of Divine guidance which,
as foretold by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad and Siyyid Kázim, had
risen in <u>Sh</u>íráz, and, while pursuing its westward course,
had mounted its zenith in Adrianople, had finally sunk below the
horizon of ‘Akká, never to rise again ere the complete revolution
of one thousand years. The setting of so effulgent an Orb brought to
a definite termination the period of Divine Revelation — the initial
and most vitalizing stage in the Bahá’í era. Inaugurated by the
Báb, culminating in Bahá’u’lláh, anticipated and extolled by
the entire company of the Prophets of this great prophetic cycle,
this period has, except for the short interval between the Báb’s
martyrdom and Bahá’u’lláh’s shaking experiences in the
Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál of Ṭihrán, been characterized by almost fifty
years of continuous and progressive Revelation — a period which by
its duration and fecundity must be regarded as unparalleled in the
entire field of the world’s spiritual history.</p>


<p id='92' data-ref='wob_en-6-p92'>
The passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, on the other hand, marks the
closing of the Heroic and Apostolic Age of this same
Dispensation — that primitive period of our Faith the splendors of
which can never be rivaled, much less be eclipsed, by the
magnificence that must needs distinguish the future victories of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation. For neither the achievements of the
champion-builders of the present-day institutions of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh, nor the tumultuous triumphs which the heroes of
its Golden Age will in the coming days succeed in winning, can
measure with, or be included within the same category as, the
wondrous works associated with the names of those who have generated
its very life and laid its pristine foundations. That first and
creative age of the Bahá’í era must, by its very nature, stand
above and apart from the formative period into which we have entered
and the golden age destined to succeed it.</p>


<p id='93' data-ref='wob_en-6-p93'>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who incarnates an institution for which we
can find no parallel whatsoever in any of the world’s recognized
religious systems, may be said to have closed the Age to which He
Himself belonged and opened the one in which we are now laboring. His
Will and Testament should thus be regarded as the perpetual, the
indissoluble link which the mind of Him Who is the Mystery of God has
conceived in order to insure the continuity of the three ages that
constitute the component parts of the Bahá’í Dispensation. The
period in which the seed of the Faith had been slowly germinating is
thus intertwined both with the one which must witness its
efflorescence and the subsequent age in which that seed will have
finally yielded its golden fruit.</p>


<p id='94' data-ref='wob_en-6-p94'>
The creative energies released by the Law of Bahá’u’lláh,
permeating and evolving within the mind of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
have, by their very impact and close interaction, given birth to an
Instrument which may be viewed as the Charter of the New World Order
which is at once the glory and the promise of this most great
Dispensation. The Will may thus be acclaimed as the inevitable
offspring resulting from that mystic intercourse between Him Who
communicated the generating influence of His divine Purpose and the
One Who was its vehicle and chosen recipient. Being the Child of the
Covenant — the Heir of both the Originator and the Interpreter of the
Law of God — the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá can no
more be divorced from Him Who supplied the original and motivating
impulse than from the One Who ultimately conceived it. Bahá’u’lláh’s
inscrutable purpose, we must ever bear in mind, has been so
thoroughly infused into the conduct of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and
their motives have been so closely wedded together, that the mere
attempt to dissociate the teachings of the former from any system
which the ideal Exemplar of those same teachings has established
would amount to a repudiation of one of the most sacred and basic
truths of the Faith.</p>


<p id='95' data-ref='wob_en-6-p95'>
The Administrative Order, which ever since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
ascension has evolved and is taking shape under our very eyes in no
fewer than forty countries of the world, may be considered as the
framework of the Will itself, the inviolable stronghold wherein this
new-born child is being nurtured and developed. This Administrative
Order, as it expands and consolidates itself, will no doubt manifest
the potentialities and reveal the full implications of this momentous
Document — this most remarkable expression of the Will of One of the
most remarkable Figures of the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh. It
will, as its component parts, its organic institutions, begin to
function with efficiency and vigor, assert its claim and demonstrate
its capacity to be regarded not only as the nucleus but the very
pattern of the New World Order destined to embrace in the fullness of
time the whole of mankind. </p>



<p id='96' data-ref='wob_en-6-p96'>
It should be noted in this connection that this Administrative Order
is fundamentally different from anything that any Prophet has
previously established, inasmuch as Bahá’u’lláh has Himself
revealed its principles, established its institutions, appointed the
person to interpret His Word and conferred the necessary authority on
the body designed to supplement and apply His legislative ordinances.
Therein lies the secret of its strength, its fundamental distinction,
and the guarantee against disintegration and schism. Nowhere in the
sacred scriptures of any of the world’s religious systems, nor even
in the writings of the Inaugurator of the Bábí Dispensation, do we
find any provisions establishing a covenant or providing for an
administrative order that can compare in scope and authority with
those that lie at the very basis of the Bahá’í Dispensation. Has
either Christianity or Islám, to take as an instance two of the most
widely diffused and outstanding among the world’s recognized
religions, anything to offer that can measure with, or be regarded as
equivalent to, either the Book of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant or
to the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá? Does the text
of either the Gospel or the Qur’án confer sufficient authority
upon those leaders and councils that have claimed the right and
assumed the function of interpreting the provisions of their sacred
scriptures and of administering the affairs of their respective
communities? Could Peter, the admitted chief of the Apostles, or the
Imám ‘Alí, the cousin and legitimate successor of the Prophet,
produce in support of the primacy with which both had been invested
written and explicit affirmations from Christ and Muḥammad that
could have silenced those who either among their contemporaries or in
a later age have repudiated their authority and, by their action,
precipitated the schisms that persist until the present day? Where,
we may confidently ask, in the recorded sayings of Jesus Christ,
whether in the matter of succession or in the provision of a set of
specific laws and clearly defined administrative ordinances, as
distinguished from purely spiritual principles, can we find anything
approaching the detailed injunctions, laws and warnings that abound
in the authenticated utterances of both Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá? Can any passage of the Qur’án, which in
respect to its legal code, its administrative and devotional
ordinances marks already a notable advance over previous and more
corrupted Revelations, be construed as placing upon an unassailable
basis the undoubted authority with which Muḥammad had, verbally and
on several occasions, invested His successor? Can the Author of the
Bábí Dispensation however much He may have succeeded through the
provisions of the Persian Bayán in averting a schism as permanent
and catastrophic as those that afflicted Christianity and Islám — can
He be said to have produced instruments for the safeguarding of His
Faith as definite and efficacious as those which must for all time
preserve the unity of the organized followers of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh?</p>


<p id='97' data-ref='wob_en-6-p97'>
Alone of all the Revelations gone before it this Faith has, through
the explicit directions, the repeated warnings, the authenticated
safeguards incorporated and elaborated in its teachings, succeeded in
raising a structure which the bewildered followers of bankrupt and
broken creeds might well approach and critically examine, and seek,
ere it is too late, the invulnerable security of its world-embracing
shelter.</p>


<p id='98' data-ref='wob_en-6-p98'>
No wonder that He Who through the operation of His Will has
inaugurated so vast and unique an Order and Who is the Center of so
mighty a Covenant should have written these words: <q class='abd'>“So firm and
mighty is this Covenant that from the beginning of time until the
present day no religious Dispensation hath produced its like.”</q>
<q class='abd'>“Whatsoever is latent in the innermost of this holy cycle,”</q>
He wrote during the darkest and most dangerous days of His ministry,
<q class='abd'>“shall gradually appear and be made manifest, for now is but the
beginning of its growth and the dayspring of the revelation of its
signs.”</q> <q class='abd'>“Fear not,”</q> are His reassuring words
foreshadowing the rise of the Administrative Order established by His
Will, <q class='abd'>“fear not if this Branch be severed from this material
world and cast aside its leaves; nay, the leaves thereof shall
flourish, for this Branch will grow after it is cut off from this
world below, it shall reach the loftiest pinnacles of glory, and it
shall bear such fruits as will perfume the world with their
fragrance.”</q></p>


<p id='99' data-ref='wob_en-6-p99'>
To what else if not to the power and majesty which this
Administrative Order — the rudiments of the future all-enfolding
Bahá’í Commonwealth — is destined to manifest, can these
utterances of Bahá’u’lláh allude: <q class='baha'>“The world’s
equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this
most great, this new World Order. Mankind’s ordered life hath been
revolutionized through the agency of this unique, this wondrous
System — the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed.”</q></p>


<p id='100' data-ref='wob_en-6-p100'>
The Báb Himself, in the course of His references to “Him Whom God
will make manifest” anticipates the System and glorifies the World
Order which the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is destined to
unfold. <q class='bab'>“Well is it with him,”</q> is His remarkable statement
in the third chapter of the Persian Bayán, <q class='bab'>“who fixeth his gaze
upon the Order of Bahá’u’lláh and rendereth thanks unto his
Lord! For He will assuredly be made manifest. God hath indeed
irrevocably ordained it in the Bayán.”</q></p>


<p id='101' data-ref='wob_en-6-p101'>
In the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh where the institutions of the
International and Local Houses of Justice are specifically designated
and formally established; in the institution of the Hands of the
Cause of God which first Bahá’u’lláh and then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
brought into being; in the institution of both local and national
Assemblies which in their embryonic stage were already functioning in
the days preceding ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension; in the
authority with which the Author of our Faith and the Center of His
Covenant have in their Tablets chosen to confer upon them; in the
institution of the Local Fund which operated according to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s specific injunctions addressed to certain
Assemblies in Persia; in the verses of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas the
implications of which clearly anticipate the institution of the
Guardianship; in the explanation which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in
one of His Tablets, has given to, and the emphasis He has placed
upon, the hereditary principle and the law of primogeniture as having
been upheld by the Prophets of the past — in these we can discern the
faint glimmerings and discover the earliest intimation of the nature
and working of the Administrative Order which the Will of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was at a later time destined to proclaim and
formally establish.</p>


<hr class='small compact'>


<p id='102' data-ref='wob_en-6-p102' class='dropcap'>
An attempt, I feel, should at the present juncture be made to explain
the character and functions of the twin pillars that support this
mighty Administrative Structure — the institutions of the
Guardianship and of the Universal House of Justice. To describe in
their entirety the diverse elements that function in conjunction with
these institutions is beyond the scope and purpose of this general
exposition of the fundamental verities of the Faith. To define with
accuracy and minuteness the features, and to analyze exhaustively the
nature of the relationships which, on the one hand, bind together
these two fundamental organs of the Will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and connect, on the other, each of them to the Author of the Faith
and the Center of His Covenant is a task which future generations
will no doubt adequately fulfill. My present intention is to
elaborate certain salient features of this scheme which, however
close we may stand to its colossal structure, are already so clearly
defined that we find it inexcusable to either misconceive or ignore. </p>



<p id='103' data-ref='wob_en-6-p103'>
It should be stated, at the very outset, in clear and unambiguous
language, that these twin institutions of the Administrative Order of
Bahá’u’lláh should be regarded as divine in origin, essential
in their functions and complementary in their aim and purpose. Their
common, their fundamental object is to insure the continuity of that
divinely-appointed authority which flows from the Source of our
Faith, to safeguard the unity of its followers and to maintain the
integrity and flexibility of its teachings. Acting in conjunction
with each other these two inseparable institutions administer its
affairs, coördinate its activities, promote its interests, execute
its laws and defend its subsidiary institutions. Severally, each
operates within a clearly defined sphere of jurisdiction; each is
equipped with its own attendant institutions — instruments designed
for the effective discharge of its particular responsibilities and
duties. Each exercises, within the limitations imposed upon it, its
powers, its authority, its rights and prerogatives. These are neither
contradictory, nor detract in the slightest degree from the position
which each of these institutions occupies. Far from being
incompatible or mutually destructive, they supplement each other’s
authority and functions, and are permanently and fundamentally united
in their aims.</p>


<p id='104' data-ref='wob_en-6-p104'>
Divorced from the institution of the Guardianship the World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh would be mutilated and permanently deprived of that
hereditary principle which, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written,
has been invariably upheld by the Law of God. <q class='abd'>“In all the Divine
Dispensations,”</q> He states, in a Tablet addressed to a follower
of the Faith in Persia, <q class='abd'>“the eldest son hath been given
extraordinary distinctions. Even the station of prophethood hath been
his birthright.”</q> Without such an institution the integrity of
the Faith would be imperiled, and the stability of the entire fabric
would be gravely endangered. Its prestige would suffer, the means
required to enable it to take a long, an uninterrupted view over a
series of generations would be completely lacking, and the necessary
guidance to define the sphere of the legislative action of its
elected representatives would be totally withdrawn.</p>


<p id='105' data-ref='wob_en-6-p105'>
Severed from the no less essential institution of the Universal House
of Justice this same System of the Will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would be paralyzed in its action and would be powerless to fill in
those gaps which the Author of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas has deliberately
left in the body of His legislative and administrative ordinances.</p>


<p id='106' data-ref='wob_en-6-p106'>
<q class='abd'>“He is the Interpreter of the Word of God,”</q> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
referring to the functions of the Guardian of the Faith, asserts,
using in His Will the very term which He Himself had chosen when
refuting the argument of the Covenant-breakers who had challenged His
right to interpret the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh. <q class='abd'>“After
him,”</q> He adds, <q class='abd'>“will succeed the first-born of his lineal
descendants.”</q> <q class='abd'>“The mighty stronghold,”</q> He further
explains, <q class='abd'>“shall remain impregnable and safe through obedience
to him who is the Guardian of the Cause of God.”</q> <q class='abd'>“It is
incumbent upon the members of the House of Justice, upon all the
A<u>gh</u>ṣán, the Afnán, the Hands of the Cause of
God, to show their obedience, submissiveness and subordination unto
the Guardian of the Cause of God.”</q></p>


<p id='107' data-ref='wob_en-6-p107'>
<q class='baha'>“It is incumbent upon the members of the House of Justice,”</q>
Bahá’u’lláh, on the other hand, declares in the Eighth Leaf of
the Exalted Paradise, <q class='baha'>“to take counsel together regarding those
things which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book, and to
enforce that which is agreeable to them. God will verily inspire them
with whatsoever He willeth, and He verily is the Provider, the
Omniscient.”</q> <q class='abd'>“Unto the Most Holy Book”</q> (the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas), ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states in His Will, <q class='abd'>“every
one must turn, and all that is not expressly recorded therein must be
referred to the Universal House of Justice. That which this body,
whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the
truth and the purpose of God Himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom is
verily of them that love discord, hath shown forth malice, and turned
away from the Lord of the Covenant.”</q></p>


<p id='108' data-ref='wob_en-6-p108'>
Not only does ‘Abdu’l-Bahá confirm in His Will
Bahá’u’lláh’s above-quoted statement, but invests this body
with the additional right and power to abrogate, according to the
exigencies of time, its own enactments, as well as those of a
preceding House of Justice. <q class='abd'>“Inasmuch as the House of Justice,”</q>
is His explicit statement in His Will, <q class='abd'>“hath power to enact laws
that are not expressly recorded in the Book and bear upon daily
transactions, so also it hath power to repeal the same… This it can
do because these laws form no part of the divine explicit text.”</q></p>


<p id='109' data-ref='wob_en-6-p109'>
Referring to both the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice we
read these emphatic words: <q class='abd'>“The sacred and youthful Branch, the
Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of
Justice to be universally elected and established, are both under the
care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the shelter and
unerring guidance of the Exalted One (the Báb) (may my life
be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of God.”</q></p>


<p id='110' data-ref='wob_en-6-p110'>
From these statements it is made indubitably clear and evident that
the Guardian of the Faith has been made the Interpreter of the Word
and that the Universal House of Justice has been invested with the
function of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the
teachings. The interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his
own sphere, is as authoritative and binding as the enactments of the
International House of Justice, whose exclusive right and prerogative
is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on such laws and
ordinances as Bahá’u’lláh has not expressly revealed. Neither
can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of
the other. Neither will seek to curtail the specific and undoubted
authority with which both have been divinely invested.</p>


<p id='111' data-ref='wob_en-6-p111'>
Though the Guardian of the Faith has been made the permanent head of
so august a body he can never, even temporarily, assume the right of
exclusive legislation. He cannot override the decision of the
majority of his fellow-members, but is bound to insist upon a
reconsideration by them of any enactment he conscientiously believes
to conflict with the meaning and to depart from the spirit of
Bahá’u’lláh’s revealed utterances. He interprets what has
been specifically revealed, and cannot legislate except in his
capacity as member of the Universal House of Justice. He is debarred
from laying down independently the constitution that must govern the
organized activities of his fellow-members, and from exercising his
influence in a manner that would encroach upon the liberty of those
whose sacred right is to elect the body of his collaborators.</p>


<p id='112' data-ref='wob_en-6-p112'>
It should be borne in mind that the institution of the Guardianship
has been anticipated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in an allusion He
made in a Tablet addressed, long before His own ascension, to three
of His friends in Persia. To their question as to whether there would
be any person to whom all the Bahá’ís would be called upon to
turn after His ascension He made the following reply: <q class='abd'>“As to the
question ye have asked me, know verily that this is a well-guarded
secret. It is even as a gem concealed within its shell. That it will
be revealed is predestined. The time will come when its light will
appear, when its evidences will be made manifest, and its secrets
unraveled.”</q></p>


<p id='113' data-ref='wob_en-6-p113'>
Dearly-beloved friends! Exalted as is the position and vital as is
the function of the institution of the Guardianship in the
Administrative Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and staggering as must be
the weight of responsibility which it carries, its importance must,
whatever be the language of the Will, be in no wise over-emphasized.
The Guardian of the Faith must not under any circumstances, and
whatever his merits or his achievements, be exalted to the rank that
will make him a co-sharer with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the unique
position which the Center of the Covenant occupies — much less to the
station exclusively ordained for the Manifestation of God. So grave a
departure from the established tenets of our Faith is nothing short
of open blasphemy. As I have already stated, in the course of my
references to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s station, however great the
gulf that separates Him from the Author of a Divine Revelation it can
never measure with the distance that stands between Him Who is the
Center of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant and the Guardians who are
its chosen ministers. There is a far, far greater distance separating
the Guardian from the Center of the Covenant than there is between
the Center of the Covenant and its Author.</p>


<p id='114' data-ref='wob_en-6-p114'>
No Guardian of the Faith, I feel it my solemn duty to place on
record, can ever claim to be the perfect exemplar of the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh or the stainless mirror that reflects His light.
Though overshadowed by the unfailing, the unerring protection of
Bahá’u’lláh and of the Báb, and however much he may share with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá the right and obligation to interpret the
Bahá’í teachings, he remains essentially human and cannot, if he
wishes to remain faithful to his trust, arrogate to himself, under
any pretense whatsoever, the rights, the privileges and prerogatives
which Bahá’u’lláh has chosen to confer upon His Son. In the
light of this truth to pray to the Guardian of the Faith, to address
him as lord and master, to designate him as his holiness, to seek his
benediction, to celebrate his birthday, or to commemorate any event
associated with his life would be tantamount to a departure from
those established truths that are enshrined within our beloved Faith.
The fact that the Guardian has been specifically endowed with such
power as he may need to reveal the purport and disclose the
implications of the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh and of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá does not necessarily confer upon him a
station co-equal with those Whose words he is called upon to
interpret. He can exercise that right and discharge this obligation
and yet remain infinitely inferior to both of them in rank and
different in nature.</p>


<p id='115' data-ref='wob_en-6-p115'>
To the integrity of this cardinal principle of our Faith the words,
the deeds of its present and future Guardians must abundantly
testify. By their conduct and example they must needs establish its
truth upon an unassailable foundation and transmit to future
generations unimpeachable evidences of its reality.</p>


<p id='116' data-ref='wob_en-6-p116'>
For my own part to hesitate in recognizing so vital a truth or to
vacillate in proclaiming so firm a conviction must constitute a
shameless betrayal of the confidence reposed in me by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and an unpardonable usurpation of the authority with which He Himself
has been invested.</p>


<hr class='small compact'>


<p id='117' data-ref='wob_en-6-p117' class='dropcap'>
A word should now be said regarding the theory on which this
Administrative Order is based and the principle that must govern the
operation of its chief institutions. It would be utterly misleading
to attempt a comparison between this unique, this divinely-conceived
Order and any of the diverse systems which the minds of men, at
various periods of their history, have contrived for the government
of human institutions. Such an attempt would in itself betray a lack
of complete appreciation of the excellence of the handiwork of its
great Author. How could it be otherwise when we remember that this
Order constitutes the very pattern of that divine civilization which
the almighty Law of Bahá’u’lláh is designed to establish upon
earth? The divers and ever-shifting systems of human polity, whether
past or present, whether originating in the East or in the West,
offer no adequate criterion wherewith to estimate the potency of its
hidden virtues or to appraise the solidity of its foundations.</p>


<p id='118' data-ref='wob_en-6-p118'>
The Bahá’í Commonwealth of the future, of which this vast
Administrative Order is the sole framework, is, both in theory and
practice, not only unique in the entire history of political
institutions, but can find no parallel in the annals of any of the
world’s recognized religious systems. No form of democratic
government; no system of autocracy or of dictatorship, whether
monarchical or republican; no intermediary scheme of a purely
aristocratic order; nor even any of the recognized types of
theocracy, whether it be the Hebrew Commonwealth, or the various
Christian ecclesiastical organizations, or the Imamate or the
Caliphate in Islám — none of these can be identified or be said to
conform with the Administrative Order which the master-hand of its
perfect Architect has fashioned.</p>


<p id='119' data-ref='wob_en-6-p119'>
This new-born Administrative Order incorporates within its structure
certain elements which are to be found in each of the three
recognized forms of secular government, without being in any sense a
mere replica of any one of them, and without introducing within its
machinery any of the objectionable features which they inherently
possess. It blends and harmonizes, as no government fashioned by
mortal hands has as yet accomplished, the salutary truths which each
of these systems undoubtedly contains without vitiating the integrity
of those God-given verities on which it is ultimately founded.</p>


<p id='120' data-ref='wob_en-6-p120'>
The Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh must in no
wise be regarded as purely democratic in character inasmuch as the
basic assumption which requires all democracies to depend
fundamentally upon getting their mandate from the people is
altogether lacking in this Dispensation. In the conduct of the
administrative affairs of the Faith, in the enactment of the
legislation necessary to supplement the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas,
the members of the Universal House of Justice, it should be borne in
mind, are not, as Bahá’u’lláh’s utterances clearly imply,
responsible to those whom they represent, nor are they allowed to be
governed by the feelings, the general opinion, and even the
convictions of the mass of the faithful, or of those who directly
elect them. They are to follow, in a prayerful attitude, the dictates
and promptings of their conscience. They may, indeed they must,
acquaint themselves with the conditions prevailing among the
community, must weigh dispassionately in their minds the merits of
any case presented for their consideration, but must reserve for
themselves the right of an unfettered decision. <q class='baha'>“God will verily
inspire them with whatsoever He willeth,”</q> is Bahá’u’lláh’s
incontrovertible assurance. They, and not the body of those who
either directly or indirectly elect them, have thus been made the
recipients of the divine guidance which is at once the life-blood and
ultimate safeguard of this Revelation. Moreover, he who symbolizes
the hereditary principle in this Dispensation has been made the
interpreter of the words of its Author, and ceases consequently, by
virtue of the actual authority vested in him, to be the figurehead
invariably associated with the prevailing systems of constitutional
monarchies.</p>


<p id='121' data-ref='wob_en-6-p121'>
Nor can the Bahá’í Administrative Order be dismissed as a hard
and rigid system of unmitigated autocracy or as an idle imitation of
any form of absolutistic ecclesiastical government, whether it be the
Papacy, the Imamate or any other similar institution, for the obvious
reason that upon the international elected representatives of the
followers of Bahá’u’lláh has been conferred the exclusive right
of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the Bahá’í
writings. Neither the Guardian of the Faith nor any institution apart
from the International House of Justice can ever usurp this vital and
essential power or encroach upon that sacred right. The abolition of
professional priesthood with its accompanying sacraments of baptism,
of communion and of confession of sins, the laws requiring the
election by universal suffrage of all local, national, and
international Houses of Justice, the total absence of episcopal
authority with its attendant privileges, corruptions and bureaucratic
tendencies, are further evidences of the non-autocratic character of
the Bahá’í Administrative Order and of its inclination to
democratic methods in the administration of its affairs.</p>


<p id='122' data-ref='wob_en-6-p122'>
Nor is this Order identified with the name of Bahá’u’lláh to be
confused with any system of purely aristocratic government in view of
the fact that it upholds, on the one hand, the hereditary principle
and entrusts the Guardian of the Faith with the obligation of
interpreting its teachings, and provides, on the other, for the free
and direct election from among the mass of the faithful of the body
that constitutes its highest legislative organ.</p>


<p id='123' data-ref='wob_en-6-p123'>
Whereas this Administrative Order cannot be said to have been modeled
after any of these recognized systems of government, it nevertheless
embodies, reconciles and assimilates within its framework such
wholesome elements as are to be found in each one of them. The
hereditary authority which the Guardian is called upon to exercise,
the vital and essential functions which the Universal House of
Justice discharges, the specific provisions requiring its democratic
election by the representatives of the faithful — these combine to
demonstrate the truth that this divinely revealed Order, which can
never be identified with any of the standard types of government
referred to by Aristotle in his works, embodies and blends with the
spiritual verities on which it is based the beneficent elements which
are to be found in each one of them. The admitted evils inherent in
each of these systems being rigidly and permanently excluded, this
unique Order, however long it may endure and however extensive its
ramifications, cannot ever degenerate into any form of despotism, of
oligarchy, or of demagogy which must sooner or later corrupt the
machinery of all man-made and essentially defective political
institutions.</p>

<hr class='small compact'>

<p id='124' data-ref='wob_en-6-p124' class='dropcap'>
Dearly-beloved friends! Significant as are the origins of this mighty
administrative structure, and however unique its features, the
happenings that may be said to have heralded its birth and signalized
the initial stage of its evolution seem no less remarkable. How
striking, how edifying the contrast between the process of slow and
steady consolidation that characterizes the growth of its infant
strength and the devastating onrush of the forces of disintegration
that are assailing the outworn institutions, both religious and
secular, of present-day society!</p>


<p id='125' data-ref='wob_en-6-p125'>
The vitality which the organic institutions of this great, this
ever-expanding Order so strongly exhibit; the obstacles which the
high courage, the undaunted resolution of its administrators have
already surmounted; the fire of an unquenchable enthusiasm that glows
with undiminished fervor in the hearts of its itinerant teachers; the
heights of self-sacrifice which its champion-builders are now
attaining; the breadth of vision, the confident hope, the creative
joy, the inward peace, the uncompromising integrity, the exemplary
discipline, the unyielding unity and solidarity which its stalwart
defenders manifest; the degree to which its moving Spirit has shown
itself capable of assimilating the diversified elements within its
pale, of cleansing them of all forms of prejudice and of fusing them
with its own structure — these are evidences of a power which a
disillusioned and sadly shaken society can ill afford to ignore.</p>


<p id='126' data-ref='wob_en-6-p126'>
Compare these splendid manifestations of the spirit animating this
vibrant body of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh with the cries and
agony, the follies and vanities, the bitterness and prejudices, the
wickedness and divisions of an ailing and chaotic world. Witness the
fear that torments its leaders and paralyzes the action of its blind
and bewildered statesmen. How fierce the hatreds, how false the
ambitions, how petty the pursuits, how deep-rooted the suspicions of
its peoples! How disquieting the lawlessness, the corruption, the
unbelief that are eating into the vitals of a tottering civilization!</p>


<p id='127' data-ref='wob_en-6-p127'>
Might not this process of steady deterioration which is insidiously
invading so many departments of human activity and thought be
regarded as a necessary accompaniment to the rise of this almighty
Arm of Bahá’u’lláh? Might we not look upon the momentous
happenings which, in the course of the past twenty years, have so
deeply agitated every continent of the earth, as ominous signs
simultaneously proclaiming the agonies of a disintegrating
civilization and the birthpangs of that World Order — that Ark of
human salvation — that must needs arise upon its ruins?</p>


<p id='128' data-ref='wob_en-6-p128'>
The catastrophic fall of mighty monarchies and empires in the
European continent, allusions to some of which may be found in the
prophecies of Bahá’u’lláh; the decline that has set in, and is
still continuing, in the fortunes of the <u>Sh</u>í‘ih hierarchy
in His own native land; the fall of the Qájár dynasty, the
traditional enemy of His Faith; the overthrow of the Sultanate and
the Caliphate, the sustaining pillars of Sunní Islám, to which the
destruction of Jerusalem in the latter part of the first century of
the Christian era offers a striking parallel; the wave of
secularization which is invading the Muḥammadan ecclesiastical
institutions in Egypt and sapping the loyalty of its staunchest
supporters; the humiliating blows that have afflicted some of the
most powerful Churches of Christendom in Russia, in Western Europe
and Central America; the dissemination of those subversive doctrines
that are undermining the foundations and overthrowing the structure
of seemingly impregnable strongholds in the political and social
spheres of human activity; the signs of an impending catastrophe,
strangely reminiscent of the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West,
which threatens to engulf the whole structure of present-day
civilization — all witness to the tumult which the birth of this
mighty Organ of the Religion of Bahá’u’lláh has cast into the
world — a tumult which will grow in scope and in intensity as the
implications of this constantly evolving Scheme are more fully
understood and its ramifications more widely extended over the
surface of the globe.</p>


<p id='129' data-ref='wob_en-6-p129'>
A word more in conclusion. The rise and establishment of this
Administrative Order — the shell that shields and enshrines so
precious a gem — constitutes the hall-mark of this second and
formative age of the Bahá’í era. It will come to be regarded, as
it recedes farther and farther from our eyes, as the chief agency
empowered to usher in the concluding phase, the consummation of this
glorious Dispensation.</p>


<p id='130' data-ref='wob_en-6-p130'>
Let no one, while this System is still in its infancy, misconceive
its character, belittle its significance or misrepresent its purpose.
The bedrock on which this Administrative Order is founded is God’s
immutable Purpose for mankind in this day. The Source from which it
derives its inspiration is no one less than Bahá’u’lláh
Himself. Its shield and defender are the embattled hosts of the Abhá
Kingdom. Its seed is the blood of no less than twenty thousand
martyrs who have offered up their lives that it may be born and
flourish. The axis round which its institutions revolve are the
authentic provisions of the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Its guiding principles are the truths which He Who is the unerring
Interpreter of the teachings of our Faith has so clearly enunciated
in His public addresses throughout the West. The laws that govern its
operation and limit its functions are those which have been expressly
ordained in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. The seat round which its spiritual,
its humanitarian and administrative activities will cluster are the
Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár and its Dependencies. The pillars
that sustain its authority and buttress its structure are the twin
institutions of the Guardianship and of the Universal House of
Justice. The central, the underlying aim which animates it is the
establishment of the New World Order as adumbrated by Bahá’u’lláh.
The methods it employs, the standard it inculcates, incline it to
neither East nor West, neither Jew nor Gentile, neither rich nor
poor, neither white nor colored. Its watchword is the unification of
the human race; its standard the “Most Great Peace”; its
consummation the advent of that golden millennium — the Day when the
kingdoms of this world shall have become the Kingdom of God Himself,
the Kingdom of Bahá’u’lláh.
