<h2 class='section_header chapter' id='preface'> Preface </h2>

<p id='p.1'> The Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith set foot on Benelux soil at least once. Together with Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, probably after World War II, he made a short stopover at Schiphol Airport and from there dashed off by taxi to the Rijksmuseum in nearby Amsterdam to see De Nachtwacht (‘The Night Watch’), Rembrandt’s famous painting.</p>

<p id='p.2'> As far as we know, the Guardian did not meet any believers on that occasion. In fact he never journeyed to officially meet with the Bahá’ís. He chose instead as an important means of guiding the worldwide Bahá’í Community an extensive correspondence, ranging from short cables to extensive monographs, well over 17,500 in total. The present book offers, for the first time, a compilation of his letters which were sent to Bahá’ís living in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.</p>

<p id='p.3'> The plan to compile these letters originated in Belgium during the Bahá’í Summer School of 2004, when Mr. ‘Alí Na<u>kh</u>javání, a former member of the Universal House of Justice, suggested the idea to an attending Dutch Bahá’í. A few months later, the National Spiritual Assembly of Belgium presented the delegates to the 2005 Belgian National Convention with a small compilation. When the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the Netherlands received a copy of this booklet, it was impressed and took up Mr. Na<u>kh</u>javání’s idea.</p>

<p id='p.4'> A task force was formed with members from the three National communities. It was charged to collect as many of Shoghi Effendi’s letters to the Benelux as possible and to give honour to those early pioneers to the Benelux and the first native Bahá’í’s for their memorable services. It is our hope that this book will connect us with those days, when, in accordance with Shoghi Effendi’s instructions, the foundation was laid for all our present Bahá’í work.</p>

<p id='p.5'> We feel honoured that the introductions were written by Mr. Hénuzet, one of the last living native Bahá’ís from that period and an active “co-worker” to this day, and by Mr. Na<u>kh</u>javání who gave the impulse for this book. This compilation is the result of a special spirit of love, with wonderful assistance from the World Centre, the United States Archivist, and from individual friends both within and outside the Benelux. We are grateful to all those who contributed.</p>

<p id='p.6'> We hope that this book will be an inspiration for the Bahá’í’s living in the countries of the Benelux today. In 2001 the Universal House of Justice announced that the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh had entered the fifth epoch of its Formative Age, a “milestone [that] falls within the patterns established by Shoghi Effendi for marking measures of time in the history of the Cause”. Under the inspiring guidance of the Universal House of Justice and the International Teaching Centre, the Bahá’í World has since then been engaged in a series of Five Year Plans aimed at the promotion of “entry by troops”, leading to the centenary of the Formative Age.

<p id='p.7'> It is inspiring to read now what Shoghi Effendi wrote to the very first Regional Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’í’s of the Benelux (elected by delegates of four Local Spiritual Assemblies) in a letter of July 5th 1957 about our three <q class='shoghi italic'>“newly emerged, wholly dedicated, steadily unfolding, highly promising communities” “The spirit, ... that so powerfully animates them in the discharge of their sacred and inescapable dudes is such as to ensure, if they persevere along the path they now tread, their complete and total victory.”</q></p>

<p id='p.8'> On November 4th 1957 the Bahá’í World suffered an indescribable loss when our beloved Guardian suddenly passed away. How much we wish that Shoghi Effendi could have witnessed the formation only five years later of the National Spiritual Assemblies of our three ever-growing Bahá’í Communities that together comprise 45 Local Spiritual Assemblies at this time.

<p id='p.9'> May we finish this preface with the moving words of Shoghi Effendi concluding that letter of July 5th 1957: <q class='shoghi italic'>“That they may prove themselves worthy of their high calling; that they may rise to such heights as to excite the unqualified admiration of their brethren not only in the European continent but throughout both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres; that they may through the range and quality of their concerted exertions, draw forth a measure of Divine bounty adequate to meet the pressing needs and manifold requirements of their glorious mission is my ardent and constant prayer for them all as I lay my head on the threshold of His Most Holy Shrine. Shoghi”</q></p>

<h2 class='section_header chapter no-pad-below' id='the_mail'> The Mail </h2> 
<h5 class='subhead no-pad-above' id='the_mail_b'>by ‘Alí and Violette Na<u>kh</u>javání</h5>

<p id='p.10'> After arriving in Haifa following the passing of the beloved Master, Shoghi Effendi set himself the task of translating into English the text of the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and of writing, in collaboration with Lady Blomfield, an account of the events leading to the Masters passing and of the funeral ceremony that followed. It was early in 1922 when he started corresponding with the friends in the East and West. For two years, from 1922 to 1924, for the most part he wrote his letters himself to the institutions and the friends.</p>

<p id='p.11'> As his work increased he developed the method of asking secretaries to write letters on his behalf, conveying his instructions and thoughts in response to reports received or questions asked. For sixteen years he regularly used three secretaries from among members of his family for correspondence with the friends in the West. These were two of his cousins, Rúḥí Afnán and Suhayl Afnán, and one of his brothers, Ḥusayn Rabbání. He always opened all correspondence addressed to himself, and when time permitted he would instruct his secretary on how to answer the points raised in each incoming letter. After reading and approving a drafted response, he would often append a few words of his own followed by his signature.</p>

<p id='p.12'> In one of the letters written on his behalf we read the following postscript in his own hand: <q class='shoghi italic'>“Whatever letters are sent on my behalf from Haifa are all read and approved by me before mailing. There is no exception whatever to this rule.”</q> <span class='ref'>(Principles of Bahá’í Administration: A Compilation. London: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1976, p. 89)</span></p>

<p id='p.13'> Gradually the regular English-speaking secretaries, namely, his two cousins and finally his brother, all broke the Covenant and disqualified themselves from membership in the community. It was then, in 1940, that Shoghi Effendi called on Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum to serve as his secretary for the West. From what Violette heard several times from Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, Shoghi Effendi had told her that she was the best of all his secretaries and that he was very pleased with the manner in which she was able to faithfully convey his thoughts, wishes and instructions. Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum did relate that in some cases the Guardian felt her drafts were too wordy, and he would instruct her to write more briefly and concisely.</p>

<p id='p.14'> There is an anecdote that Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum quite often recounted. She said that her writing was never up to calligraphic standards, and when Shoghi Effendi was reviewing her drafted letters, he would often find that he needed to cross her “t”s and dot her “i”s. Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum carried out her responsibilities until the end of Shoghi Effendi’s earthly life.</p>

<h2 class='section_header chapter no-pad-below' id='history1a'> Short history </h2> 
<h5 class='subhead no-pad-above' id='history1b'>by ‘Alí and Violette Na<u>kh</u>javání</h5>

<p id='p.15'> The Benelux countries, namely, the Central Organization for a Durable Peace, which was based in The Hague, feature early in the history of the Bahá’í Faith. It was on 17 December 1919 that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent a detailed Tablet to that Organization outlining the basic Teachings of the Faith as they bear upon the establishment of universal peace. The Hand of the Cause of God ‘Alí-Muḥammad Ibn-i-Asdaq and Mr. Aḥmad Yazdání, a devoted Bahá’í Esperantist, were asked by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to carry this Tablet to the Organization’s Offices in The Hague.</p>

<p id='p.16'> After ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing, the beloved Guardian closely followed and encouraged the development of the Faith in Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg, directed travelling teachers to visit those countries, took an interest in and even helped financially with the publication of Bahá’í literature in the local languages, and corresponded with visiting Bahá’ís as well as early native believers, stimulating and inspiring them to promote the interests of the Faith in these countries. Outstanding among the travelling teachers that visited Belgium in 1936 were Mrs. May Maxwell and her daughter, Mary Maxwell, who later became Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum. Mrs. Maxwell’s visit was in response to the beloved Guardians wish that she should visit Belgium and stimulate the teaching work in that country.</p>

<p id='p.17'> It was in April 1946 that the beloved Guardian called on the American and Canadian believers to direct their efforts and their human and other resources to the Continent of Europe, the “cradle of world-famed civilizations”, as he described that Continent. He included this goal as one of the main objectives of the second Seven Year Plan of the National Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada.</p>

<p id='p.18'> As a result of these activities, the beloved Guardian determined that the foundations which had been laid since 1946 were adequate enough to justify the formation of an interim Regional National Spiritual Assembly for the three Benelux countries at Riḍván 1957.</p>

<p id='p.19'> Five years later, at Riḍván 1962, the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies and new believers had reached a point when it was possible to establish independent National Assemblies for each of the three Benelux countries. The story of these developments can be traced and better understood through the perusal of the letters of the beloved Guardian in this compilation.</p>

<h2 class='section_header chapter no-pad-below' id='history2a'> Short history </h2> 
<h5 class='subhead no-pad-above' id='history2b'>by Louis Hénuzet</h5>

<p id='p.20'> The period from 1946 to 1957 corresponds to the growth of Bahá’í communities within those countries of Western Europe where this had not yet taken place. From the birth of the Faith up until 1946, structured communities had been built in Great Britain, France and Germany. Due to its interdiction under the Nazi regime in Germany, this latter community had to reform after World War II. In other countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, the Faith had only touched a few individuals who had encountered it on their travels or in the context of conferences organized by the Esperantist League at which Bahá’ís participated.</p>

<p id='p.21'> In 1946 Shoghi Effendi launched the second Seven Year Plan, one of the main objectives of which was to introduce the Faith into ten European “goal” countries. These were the three Scandinavian countries, the three Benelux states, the two nations of the Iberian Peninsula, and Switzerland and Italy. The National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States of America, under whose aegis the achievement of this goal had been placed, decided to form a European Teaching Committee, which would dispatch pioneers into each of these goal countries.</p>

<p id='p.22'> The first Local Spiritual Assemblies were rapidly formed in the capital cities of these European countries. By Riḍván 1949 there were Assemblies in Amsterdam, Brussels and Luxembourg. These very young communities all felt the need to collaborate and decided initially to pool their efforts by exchanging public speakers.</p>

<p id='p.23'> This collaboration received a new impulse in December 1951 with the formation by the European Teaching Committee of a Teaching Committee for the Benelux, composed of Rita van Bleyswijk Sombeek and Theo Beets for the Netherlands, Leá Nijs and Louis Hénuzet for Belgium, and Suzette Hipp and Claude Lévy for Luxembourg. The tasks assigned to this committee were the organisation of an annual teaching conference and the exchange of public speakers, as well as the creation of publicity materials for public talks.

<p id='p.24'> The first annual conference took place at the Brussels Bahá’í Centre from 11 to 14 April 1952. Each country presented a report of its efforts to create other local communities where already a centre or group of believers existed. In Belgium, such centres could be found in Antwerp, Ostend, Courtrai and Liège. However, it was decided, following the guidance of the European Teaching Committee, to concentrate on a single city. Antwerp was chosen.</p>

<p id='p.25'> A second conference was convened for 1 and 2 November 1952 in Antwerp at the “Hôtel de Londres”. This was the occasion for studying Shoghi Effendi’s message of 23 August 1952 announcing the formation of Regional Assemblies as a prelude to the formation of National Assemblies. And, of course, included among these Regional Assemblies was one for the Benelux. I can clearly remember the enthusiasm of the participants at that conference. Certainly our communities were still weak and numerically small, but we possessed the certitude that everything would consolidate in time to permit the election of this Regional Assembly by the planned deadline of April 1957.</p>

<p id='p.26'> From 1952 to 1957 cooperation between the three Benelux nations was intense. In 1954 the conference was held from 6 to 8 June near Arnhem in the Netherlands, and it was followed by a Summer School from 9 to 13 June. These enriching experiences were henceforth to be renewed every year in one or other of the three countries, most notably on the Belgian coast.</p>

<p id='p.27'> However, as the efforts so unconditionally expended for the formation of the other Local Assemblies were nevertheless unsuccessful, the four Local Assemblies elected in April 1956 (The Hague, Amsterdam, Brussels and Luxemburg) were finally deemed sufficient to form the Regional Assembly of the Benelux. The Regional Convention was held at the recently acquired National Bahá’í Centre at 54, Rue Stanley in Brussels, in the presence of Mr. Borrah Kavelin, representing the National Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States of America. Bob van Lith and Jan Sijsling from the Netherlands, Claude Lévy from Luxemburg, and Jean and Leá Nijs, Roger Swinnen, Fernand Radar, Elsa Dekoninck and Louis Hénuzet from Belgium were elected.</p>

<p id='p.28'> And this Regional Assembly of the Benelux would continue to guide the destiny of our three countries until the election of independent National Spiritual Assemblies in April 1962.</p>

<h3 class='subhead no-pad-above date' id='lt_1a'> 14 April 1932 </h3>
<h4 class='subhead no-pad-above recipient' id='lt_1b'> To Louise Drake Wright </h4>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal1'>Dear Miss Wright:<a data-fnid='1'></a></p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn1'>
    Louise Drake Wright (1867-1949) was an American believer who first heard of the Bahá’í Faith in Italy in 1907. She and her sister lived in England when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited there in 1911. She met Him ‘almost daily’ during His stay there in London. Following her pilgrimage to the Holy Land and her meeting with the Guardian in November and December 1929, Wright went to Germany to visit the Bahá’ís there. In January 1932, an inspiring letter from Shoghi Effendi reached her in Brookline, Massachusetts: ‘I trust that your health is sufficiently restored to enable you to resume with enthusiasm and vigour your services to the Cause in Europe’, and so Wright sailed for France, arriving in April. She immediately proceeded to Geneva in Switzerland where, since 1925, the International Bahá’í Bureau had acted as an intermediary between Haifa and other Bahá’í centres. There this letter of the Guardian reached her.
  </aside>



<p id='1'>Shoghi Effendi wishes me to drop you these few lines to acknowledge the receipt of your cable asking his advice concerning your teaching tour. He believes that the most advisable thing is to concentrate upon northern Germany and Holland. He has already asked Miss Jack<a data-fnid='2'></a> to stay in Sofia and Mr. Benke<a data-fnid='3'></a> is going to join her. Mrs. Gregory<a data-fnid='4'></a> and Martha<a data-fnid='5'></a> are to devote most of their time to Central Europe especially Hungary, Austria and Poland. This makes Eastern and Central Europe well provided for.</p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn2'>
    Marion Jack (1866-1954) was a Canadian Bahá’í. She became a believer in Paris in 1900, brought the Faith to Alaska in 1919, and settled in Sofia (Bulgaria) as a pioneer in 1932, remaining there the rest of her life.
  </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn3'>
    George Adam Benke (1878-1932) was a Russian immigrant in Germany. He accepted the Bahá’í Faith in 1920, moved from Leipzig to Sofia (Bulgaria), and died there in November 1932. Shoghi Effendi called him the first European martyr.
  </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn4'>
    Louisa Gregory (née Mathew) (1866-1956) was a British Bahá’í, the first to visit Romania in 1925. She was the wife of Hand of the Cause Louis C. Gregory.
  </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn5'>
    Martha Louise Root (1872-1939) was an American journalist and writer who became a Bahá’í in 1909. Posthumously, Shoghi Effendi named her a Hand of the Cause. See also letter 5 April 1947 (24).
  </aside>


<p id='1.2'> Shoghi Effendi therefore believes that you could render greater services if you visit the centers in Germany especially the northern part and also include Holland.</p>

<p id='1.3'>As far as we can learn through the correspondence we receive, the greatest amount and most lasting work has been achieved by those teachers who instead of covering much ground stay for at least a few weeks in the same city and try to confirm those whom they interest. Mere meeting the people and speaking to them about the general aspects of the Cause does not generally produce a lasting result. So if you chose some of the towns in Northern Germany and Holland and stay at least [a] few weeks in each place you could achieve more. Holland is a totally new country to the Cause so it will be true pioneer service. We do not know how receptive the people are but through the grace of God some real opening could be made.</p>

<p id='1.4'>We have only one Bahá’í there and his name is: Herr G.I. Bertelink<a data-fnid='6'></a>, Hoogstraat 3, Enschede, Holland. Perhaps you could use his help; otherwise you will have to rely on your own resources and divine help.</p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn6'>
    Gerrit Jan Bertelink (1908-1990) became a Bahá’í in the 1920’s. He had a Protestant background and worked as a reporter for a regional newspaper in the east of the Netherlands.
  </aside>

<p id='1.5'>Anyhow Shoghi Effendi hopes you will succeed and create a new and prosperous center in Holland. Assuring you of his prayers and best wishes I remain.</p>

<h4 class='subhead no-pad-above recipient' id='m2d'> To Louise Drake Wright</h4>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal2'>Dear Bahá’í Sister,</p>

<p id='2'> It was with a great sense of appreciation and joy that Shoghi Effendi received your letter of July 5th, 1932 which he read with deep care and interest, and he has directed me to address you these lines expressing his heartfelt thanks for your manifold services to our beloved Faith.</p>

<p id='2.2'> The detailed narrative of your most interesting experiences throughout your visits to the different European countries, the many contacts you made with both Bahá’ís and non-Bahá’í’s and especially with some distinguished University professors such as Dr. Fisher<a data-fnid='7'></a> of the department of Oriental studies in the University of Leipzig, filled our Guardian’s heart with thanks and joy and confirmed his hopes for the future of your pioneering work in the many countries you visited.<a data-fnid='8'></a></p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn7'>
    August Fischer (1865-1949) was a German orientalist and author of a well-known lexicon of Arabic.

  <aside class='fn' id='fn8'>
    After a journey through Germany (April-June), during which she visited Bahá’í communities in Leipzig, Berlin, Rostock, Warnemünde and Hamburg, Wright stayed in Amsterdam from 27 June to 11 August 1932.
  </aside>

<p id='2.3'> I need not assure you how appreciative the Guardian is of all the precious efforts you are making for the spread of the Bahá’í teachings. He cherishes the brightest hopes for the future of your work. Your literary and intellectual power, your devotion and invincible faith as well as your perseverance and constancy, all these qualities of your heart and mind make you assuredly equal to the noble and most delicate task you have set yourself to achieve.</p>

<p id='2.4'> However meagre the immediate results of your efforts may be, however sceptical nay cynical the attitude of the public may seem to appear, you should always be confident that wherever you may go and to whomsoever you may speak the Hand of Divine Guidance is with you and will always lead you in the right path.<a data-fnid='9'></a></p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn9'>
    Wright had found it difficult to come into contact with the Dutch and not only because of language problems. ‘The people here are all Holland for the Hollanders, led by the Queen who is intrusive in her leaning in this direction... They feel no need of any others. They feel far superior to all surrounding countries’, she wrote at the end of her stay
  </aside>

<p id='2.5'> Shoghi Effendi will be always delighted to hear of your news and he wishes you to keep him in touch with your activities. And be assured that he will be always glad to give you any advice or help you may need. In his moments of meditation and prayer he will always remember you and ask the Almighty that He may cheer and comfort you and give you the necessary strength for the fulfilment of your most precious task.</p>

<p class='signature noid' id='sig2'>Yours in His Service, H. Rabbání</p>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal3'>Dear and valued co-worker:</p>

<p id='2.6'> Your message of sympathy cabled in connection with the passing of our beloved <u>Kh</u>ánum<a data-fnid='10'></a> has touched me and relieved the burden of grief that weighs so heavily on my heart. Our loss is irreparable, our grief immense. The example of her saintly life will inspire us to follow in her footsteps. Your pioneer services in Holland are highly meritorious in the sight of God and I wish you to persevere in your noble task and not to allow either grief or the apathy of the people to deflect you from your high purpose. Your true brother, Shoghi</p>

<h4 class='subhead no-pad-above recipient' id='m3d'> To Louise Drake Wright</h4>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal4'>Dear Bahá’í co-worker,</p>

<p id='3.1'> Your letters dated July 19th and 25th, 1932 addressed to Shoghi Effendi were duly received and read with deep interest. He has directed me to address you these few lines expressing his warmest thanks and his lively appreciation of your kind words of condolence and sympathy in connection with the sudden passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf<a data-fnid='11'></a>. Your beautiful and touching words greatly alleviated the burden of his sorrow and comforted his aching heart.</p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn11'>
    Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum (1846-1932), who was also known as the Greatest Holy Leaf, was Bahá’u’lláh’s oldest daughter and the sister of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. She passed away in Haifa on 15 July. In her diary Wright wrote: ‘I have heard the sad news that the Greatest Holy Leaf has ascended to her Father in heaven. This is indeed a most sorrowful blow to our beloved Guardian, Shoghi Effendi. And when I remember her dear Kindness to me both times I visited Haifa I am all gratitude that I was privileged to go there before she left this earth. She said she would always be with me and would always pray for me. How little I knew what an eternal blessing this is. May I repay in doing all I can for our Faith.’
  </aside>

<p id='3.2'> At this terrible hour, when hearts are filled with grief and minds are turned towards God imploring His grace, our Guardian’s sole comfort is to see you as ever active in the service of the Cause.</p>

<p id='3.3'> In this great calamity which has affected all the friends both in East and West, his loss has been the greatest and the most cruel. But his heart is overflowing with thanks to God for the guidance and help which His blessings confer to all those who, scattered in every part of the globe, are striving to promote and consolidate the interests of the Faith.</p>

<p id='3.4'> He has, already, cabled to you regarding your teaching work in Holland and has urged you to concentrate on those few people who are truly interested in the teachings of the Cause and to make of them sincere Bahá’ís. It is no use delivering the Message to the public in a general way. You should strive to take hold of some persons who have a genuine interest in the Faith and to deepen their knowledge and make them ready for teaching.</p>

<p id='3.5'> Assuring you once more of Shoghi Effendi’s warmest thanks and of his continued prayers on your behalf.</p>

<p class='signature noid' id='sig3'>Yours in His service, H. Rabbání</p>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal5'>Dear and precious co-worker:</p>

<p id='3.6'> Your services in Europe, and particularly in Holland, are deeply appreciated. I trust that through your constant efforts a center will be established in that country and will start to function vigorously and prove a prelude to still greater achievements in the future.

She was instrumental in the publication of the Dutch translation of Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, an introductory handbook on the history and teachings of the Bahá’í Faith, written by the Scottish physician John Ebenezer Esslemont (1874-1925).

<h4 class='subhead no-pad-above recipient' id='m4d'> To Louise Drake Wright</h4>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal6'>Dear Miss Wright:</p>

<p id='4.1'> Shoghi Effendi was very glad to receive your two letters dated September 30th, 1932 and February 19th, 1933 together with the enclosed.</p>

<p id='4.2'> As regards the election of new members on the National Assembly, Shoghi Effendi finds no other practical method that is in conformity with the spirit of the Teachings, except through better acquaintance of the friends during the annual convention and summer schools. It is the duty of the individual friends to come to know one another and find out who are the persons best fitted to become members of that body. This is a slow process but surely the best one and gives the greatest amount of freedom of choice to the electors. It is the duty of the friends individually to become more intelligent voters and vote only after studying the situation conscientiously.</p>

<p id='4.3'> As regards the chart representing creation, we should always remember that no matter how useful such charts may be for beginners, the real authority lies in the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh and the Master. They have to say the last word. It is by them that we should be guided, rather then by charts that help the beginners.</p>

<p id='4.4'> The Guardian was very glad to hear that you are contemplating a second visit to Holland.<a data-fnid='13'></a> According to the reports we have received from Mrs. Greeven, Captain Liebau<a data-fnid='14'></a> has completed the translation of Dr. Esslemonts book. Should it go immediately to the printers, as Shoghi Effendi hopes it will, it will be a source of great assistance to you.<a data-fnid='15'></a></p>

    Wright received this letter only days before leaving Boston for, what she called, ‘a second attempt to promote knowledge of the Bahá’í Revelation in the Netherlands’.
  </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn14'>
    Jacob (Jaap) Asmus Liebau (1886-1969), from Rotterdam, was a captain of the Holland-America Line. He learned of the Bahá’í Faith in New York in 1919, translated several Bahá’í books into Dutch, and formally became a believer in May 1952.
  </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn15'>
    The Dutch translation of Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era was not yet available when Wright settled in Amsterdam once more on 27 March 1933. Her second stay in Holland lasted until 18 July 1933.
  </aside>

<p id='4.5'> In Eastern Europe the Cause is making wonderful head-way. We earnestly hope Northern Europe will do the same. They are very enlightened and should appreciate the importance of peace and a spiritual regeneration of man.</p>

<p id='4.6'> In his moments of prayer at the blessed Shrines, the Guardian will think of you and Mrs. Nelson<a data-fnid='16'></a> as well as the other friends in Boston and ask for you all divine guidance and help.</p>

    Caroline Nelson (née Wright) was Wright’s sister. She too was a Bahá’í.

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal7'>Dear co-worker:</p>

<p id='4.7'> The problems which confront the believers at the present time, whether social, spiritual, economic or administrative will be gradually solved as the number and the resources of the friends multiply and their capacity for service and for the application of Bahá’í principles develops. They should be patient, confident and active in utilizing every possible opportunity that presents itself within the limits now necessarily imposed upon them. May the Almighty aid them to fulfil their highest hopes. Your true brother, Shoghi</p>

    A few days after receiving this letter Marshall dashed from Bremen to Rotterdam for one day to consult Doeke Zijlstra of the Nijgh & van Ditmar publishing company, as she found ‘things moved too slowly by letter’. In April she wrote to Wright: ‘The book should be off the press in about three weeks time. I cabled Shoghi Effendi yesterday and today he answered: “Delighted, loving appreciation”. He feels now that you have something to lean on, and I fear you will need a prop! ... Capt. Liebau has promised to translate, during his present voyage to Amer. the pamphlet: “What is the Bahá’í Movement?” and I shall have 1000 copies of that printed to help you.

<p id='6.4'> With all you people centered in Holland some really lasting and wonderful work should be accomplished.

The introductions that you possess are also very valuable and helpful.</p>

<p id='6.5'> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to assure you of his prayers and best wishes for a successful campaign.

<p id='6.6'> Your two letters dated April 6th and 7th have just arrived and I am delighted to learn of the splendid start you have made. I wish you could induce Mr. [...] to undertake and finish as soon as he can the translation of the Íqán<a data-fnid='23'></a>, which has already been published into four languages, the latest being the Chinese version. The book constitutes an essential preliminary to an intensive and intelligent campaign of teaching in Holland. I wish he could complete the translation before the end of the present year! If he cannot undertake it in person, I trust his collaborators may enable him to complete it. The “New Era” is being translated into fifteen additional languages! May the Beloved bless richly your historic work. Rest assured, I will continue to pray for you. Your true brother, Shoghi</p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn23'>
    The Kitáb-i-Íqán (The Book of Certitude) is an early work of Bahá’u’lláh. Shoghi Effendi described it as of’unsurpassed pre-eminence among the writings of the Author of the Bahá’í Revelation’. His English translation was published in 1931. See also letters 7 May, 29 May and 27 June 1933.

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal12'>Dear Miss Wright:</p>

<p id='7.1'> The Guardian received your letter which you had left undated, and read it with a sense of deep pleasure and satisfaction. He sincerely hopes that God will reinforce your sacrificial efforts and enable you to sow some good seeds in that country, for it is sure that the land is ready and the people are far more restless to obtain something new, to help them out of their present troubles, than they were a few years ago. The Guardian will surely pray for you, while visiting the Blessed Shrines, and ask God to guide and assist you.</p>

<p id='7.2'> As regards the translation and publication of the Íqán, Shoghi Effendi believes that as long as Mr. [...] is going to translate it free of charge we should not let the chance be left to slip away. Encourage him to start that work and complete it as soon as possible. Meanwhile will you obtain some estimate as to how much its publication will cost and inform the Guardian? He is very eager to have this wonderful book translated well, for it is the best means of grounding those who become interested in the fundamental teachings of the Faith. The Íqán and Dr. Esslemont’s book will Be sufficient to make any seeker a true believer in the divine nature of the Faith.</p>

<p id='7.3'> The Guardian is eagerly awaiting the news of the progress of your work. He hopes you will keep him informed as to any interesting developments especially regarding the translation of the Íqán.</p>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal13'>Dear and precious co-worker:</p>

<p id='7.4'> I wonder whether it would be possible to induce the translator to print the Íqán at his own expense and obtain whatever profit he can make from the sale of the books, with a definite assurance that we would purchase from him a fixed percentage of the books immediately they are published. If this is not acceptable, I would appreciate an estimate of the cost ofpublication, and trust it will be possible, in the near future, to provide the sum that is required. I trust and pray that the Beloved may guide and sustain you in your arduous, your pioneer and highly meritorious endeavours for the spread of the Cause in Holland. Shoghi</p>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal14'>Dear Bahá’í Sister,</p>

<p id='8.1'> Shoghi EfFendi has directed me to address you these few lines, informing you of a letter he has recently received from Mr. [...] in which he has proposed to translate the Kitáb-i-Íqán into Dutch and to have it published partly on his own account. Mr. [...], who is a journalist, seems to be deeply interested in the Bahá’í teachings and, although himself not a Bahá’í, yet his genuine belief is that the Íqán is a highly-important and interesting book that can be of an invaluable help to every thoughtful person with some knowledge of religious literature.</p>

<p id='8.2'> His proposition for the publication of the book is as follows. The cost of the publication of 1000 copies he estimates to be 550 dollars and the price of each copy will not exceed 1,50 dollars. He is willing to translate the book free of any charge and he is ready to bring out the book provided Shoghi EfFendi purchases from him 350 copies at a total price of 350 dollars, of which to be paid 175 dollars at once and 175 dollars at the date of publication.</p>

<p id='8.3'> The Guardian is very glad that Mr. [...] is ready to facilitate and expedite the publication of the Íqán, and he is ready to contribute his share for the immediate completion of this work.</p>

<p id='8.4'> Inasmuch, however, as he is not sufficiently acquainted with the man he would prefer not sending him the sum directly. He thinks it would be much wiser and safer to have the amount sent directly to you so as to prevent any possible difficulty or misunderstanding.</p>

<p id='8.5'> With the assurance of his best and loving greetings and of his continued prayers for the advancement and success of your work.

<p class='signature noid' id='sig8'> Yours in His Service, H. Rabbání</p>

    This letter arrived on 7 June and presented Wright with, what she called, a ‘startling assignment’. How could she find out whether or not the publishers proposition was ‘wholly genuine’? She sought the advice of her other Dutch contacts and learned that the publisher was not the right person. On 10 June, Wright advised the Guardian by cable to cancel the project. See also letter 27 June 1933.

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal15'>Dear and valued co-worker:</p>

<p id='8.7'> Your deeply interesting letters of May 12 brought deep joy to my heart. I am so sorry to hear of the delay in the publication of the ‘New Era’. Do please make every effort to expedite the work, and ensure its early publication. The services you are rendering in protecting the Cause, in defending its institutions, in explaining its principles, in diffusing its spirit and circulating its literature are indeed highly praiseworthy, most appropriate and meritorious in the sight of God. Your pioneer work will surely be richly blessed and enrich the annals of our immortal Faith, if you persevere in your high endeavours. Immediately you confirm and approve the proposition of Mr. [...] I will send you the sum of $175 as first instalment. Your true brother, Shoghi</p>

It was such a long time that he had no news from you, and was feeling really anxious, knowing well the difficult circumstances under which you were living in Holland.<a data-fnid='29'></a> He is profoundly grieved to learn that you are still being faced with so many difficulties, and that you have not yet succeeded in securing a suitable position which would enable you to settle permanently in your country.

  <aside class='fn' id='fn29'>
    Between 1925 and 1934, while living in Java in the Dutch East Indies, Grosfeld received several letters from Shoghi Effendi, but none of these seem to have survived. The correspondence had temporarily stopped with a letter dated 19 August 1934, Given that unemployment in the Netherlands had risen dramatically since 1929, Grosfeld had difficulties in finding a job there. By 1936, a third of the Dutch labour force was out of work.

<p id='12.2'> As you have been already in the East, it would not be very difficult for you to return there and start once more your work. But before undertaking such a trip, the Guardian would advise you to make all the necessary enquiries, and to fully ascertain that once there you will be sure to find a proper job. </p>

<p id='12.3'> In his prayers and meditations, the Guardian will remember you and will specially entreat Bahá’u’lláh to protect, strengthen and guide you, and open before you the door of success. You should not feel discouraged at the sight of the obstacles that so severely confront you at present, but should feel confident that through your sustained and wise efforts and through God’s unfailing guidance you will succeed in overcoming them one by one. Also, you should bear in mind that sorrows and afflictions are a necessary part of life, and are often blessings in disguise, as they serve to open our eyes to the nobler spiritual aspects of life. Trials and sufferings are therefore very helpful to our spiritual growth, and as such should be accepted with the utmost resignation and submissiveness to the Divine Will. </p>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal23'>Dear Mr. Grosfeld,</p>

<p id='13.1'> Your welcome letter of August 7th to the Guardian has arrived, and the news of the success of the teaching work in Holland has greatly rejoiced his heart.<a data-fnid='30'></a> He hopes that the small group of beginners you have succeeded in forming will meet regularly, and that through careful and concentrated study of the Cause they will grow both in numbers and in strength. Will you be so kind as to convey his greetings and heartfelt congratulations to these dear friends, and to assure each and all of them of his ardent prayers and best wishes for the success of their endeavours in the path of service to our beloved Cause. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn30'>
    In his letter dated 7 August 1936 Grosfeld had written to the Guardian: ‘The beautiful Cause is beginning to live in Holland. In a very short time we have together 8 or 9 friends, all very kind and zealous souls.’ He mentioned Johan (John) and Diana Verhoeven, who had become Bahá’ís in Canada and now lived in The Hague; Liebau, who lived in Rotterdam; Bertelink, who lived in Hengeloo; Käthe Braun, a German nurse working in Haarlem; Mr. and Mrs. Eugen Epple who also came from Germany and lived in Brummen; and Mr. Grootenhuis.
  </aside>

<p id='13.2'> The Guardian is however extremely grieved to learn that you are still without proper work, and he would certainly advise you, in case you find it quite impossible to earn your living in Holland, to leave for any other country where you can be assured of gaining the means of your livelihood. </p>

<p id='13.3'> Assuring you once more of his fervent prayers for the removal of your difficulties, and for the realization of your fondest hopes and dearest wishes. </p>

<p class='signature noid' id='sig12'>Yours in His service, H. Rabbání</p>

<p id='13.4' class='italic'>Kindly assure those precious friends that you have interested in the Cause of my love, my best wishes and prayers for their spiritual advancement. Your noble and historic work, conducted under such difficult circumstances, is dear and near to my heart, and is worthy of the highest praise. I pray that you may be enabled to find the necessary means that will enable you to expand and consolidate the work you have so nobly initiated. Persevere and rest confident.

<h3 class='subhead no-pad-above date' id='m14b'>17 November 1937</h3>
<h4 class='subhead no-pad-above recipient' id='m14d'> To Inez Greeven</h4>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal25'>Dear Mrs. Greeven,</p>

<p id='14.1'> The Guardian has received your letter of the 26th October and has learned with satisfaction of the news of the completion of the printing of the Dutch version of the Kitáb-i-Íqán.<a data-fnid='31'></a> He has also received a note from the publisher regarding the printing expenses, and has mailed him a draft for £41.17.1, being half of the total cost for publishing the book.<a data-fnid='32'></a> </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn31'>
    After his involvement in the translation and publication of Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era, Liebau had translated a short mystical work of Bahá’u’lláh called The Hidden Words. Upon publication of this Dutch translation in 1935, he had started on another early work of Bahá’u’lláh: Kitáb-i-Íqán or The Book of Certitude.
  </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn32'>
    In September 1936 the Greevens had informed the Guardian that Liebau had completed the job. However, due to financial difficulties caused by the worldwide Great Depression, it seemed impossible to them to have the work printed. With the Guardian’s help the Dutch translation of the book came out in November 1937.
  </aside>

<p id='14.2'> He would approve of the publishers suggestion to place three hundred copies with all the booksellers, and to send the remaining two hundred over to Haifa, He trusts that the books will be soon mailed and will reach in good condition. Needless to assure you how grateful he feels for this outstanding service you and your dear sister have been able to render, and he will pray that as a result the Cause may make a good start in Holland. He is eagerly waiting to hear of the good news of the progress of your teaching activities, and would urge you to whole-heartedly and confidently persevere in your efforts. </p>

<p id='14.3'> Regarding the statement you had enclosed about the sale of the Esslemont book: the Guardian indeed regrets that the results are so disappointing, and does not think it necessary for you to make any accounting to the Esslemont heirs. He would advise you to wait until the amount collected would be sufficiently substantial. </p>

<p id='14.4'> In closing may I express the Guardian’s hope that your trip to Italy will prove helpful in restoring your health. He will specially pray to the Beloved that He may strengthen your forces for many more years of service to His Faith. </p>

<p id='14.5'> Loving greetings to you and dear Mr. Greeven, and with best wishes for your success in your new field of work in Holland.<a data-fnid='33'></a> </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn33'>
    With all the Bahá’í activity forbidden and foreign trade at a complete standstill as well, the Greevens were forced to leave Germany. In the autumn of 1937 they moved to The Hague.
  </aside>

<p class='signature noid' id='sig13'>Yours ever in His service, H. Rabbání</p>

<p id='14.6'> P.S. Of the 200 copies you are going to send to Haifa, the Guardian wishes you to mail fifty to the American National Spiritual Assembly and to distribute thirty among the various other Assemblies throughout the Bahá’í world. </p>



<p class='salutation noid' id='sal26'>Dear and valued co-worker:</p>

<p id='14.7' class='italic'>I wish to assure you in person of my special prayers for the success of the efforts which you and dear Mr. Greeven are now exerting in Holland for the progress and establishment of the Faith. The literature which through your generous assistance is now available in Dutch will no doubt be a great help to you in your devoted labours, and I pray that your dearest hopes may be fully and speedily realized. My loving gratitude to you both, your true brother, Shoghi</p>

<h3 class='subhead no-pad-above date' id='m15b'>10 November 1938</h3>
<h4 class='subhead no-pad-above recipient' id='m15d'> To Max Greeven</h4>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal27'>Dear Mr. Greeven,</p>

<p id='15.1'> I am directed by the Guardian to express his thanks for your letters dated August 9th and October 11th. </p>

<p id='15.2'> With reference to the situation of the Cause in Germany; Frau Mühlschlegel<a data-fnid='34'></a> wrote sometime ago that the friends in Stuttgart had received a communication from the Berlin Secret Police to the effect that “for state-police reasons” the Faith had to remain prohibited, and that the objects confiscated would not be returned.<a data-fnid='35'></a> </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn34'>
    Herma Mühlschlegel (née Weidle) (1902-1964) was the wife of Dr. Adelbert Mühlschlegel. In 1936 the couple made a pilgrimage to Haifa.
  </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn35'>
    In the spring of 1933, Germany had turned into a totalitarian state. To discuss the ominous situation in their country, the Guardian had invited some prominent German Bahá’ís — Greeven being one of them — for consultations in Haifa in March 1934. Following that meeting, Greeven became the Guardians chief instrument in the ‘delicate and difficult mission of having the Ministry of Church Affairs’ measures for curtailing Bahá’í activity rescinded. Despite his American nationality, German background, and — what Shoghi Effendi described as — his mature experience, wisdom and above all unwavering loyalty and attachment to the Cause’, Greeven’s efforts had been of no avail. The situation for the German Bahá’í’s did not improve; on the contrary. In 1937 all Bahá’í activity had been forbidden owing to the Faith’s ‘pacifist and international teachings’.
  </aside>

<p id='15.3'> There is apparently nothing the friends in Stuttgart can do to induce the authorities to re-examine their rulings, or to rescind it, even in part. Further representation on their part not only seem to bring no results, but might have the effect of displeasing the authorities. And in view of this, the Guardian wrote in reply to Frau Mühlschlegel that under existing circumstances it would be wiser for the believers to keep entirely silent, and not to press any longer their case by addressing any appeal either to the authorities in Stuttgart or Berlin. </p>

<p id='15.4'> As regards your own efforts to approach the minister in charge of ecclesiastical affairs in the capital; the Guardian has noted your view that under the existing regime in Germany there is very little chance of your obtaining any definite results through representations to that department. He would suggest therefore that, in case you deem it feasible and opportune, you should endeavour to find new ways of approach, possibly by trying to contact some of the high officials in the “Gestapo” which, as you have written, reigns supreme in the Germany of today. This is, however, merely a suggestion, and he leaves it entirely to you to decide as to its practicability, particularly as events in Germany are all developing in the direction of greater centralization, and of a further suppression of all religious groups and denominations. </p>

<p id='15.5'> The general world condition is obviously growing more tense every day and clearly points to the inevitability of that world-wide conflagration foretold by the Master and explained by the Guardian in his “Goal of a New World Order”.<a data-fnid='36'></a> Shoghi Effendi wishes the friends to be prepared for still far more serious developments than those which we have witnessed in the course of the last two months, but he wishes them also to feel assured and confident in the glorious promises for a brighter future so emphatically given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn36'>
    The Goal of a New World Order is a letter of the Guardian to the Bahá’ís of the world dated 28 November 1931, commemorating the first decade since the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In this letter he had written: ‘Might we not already discern, as we scan the political horizon, the alignment of those forces that are dividing afresh the continent of Europe into camps of potential combatants, determined upon a contest that may mark, unlike the last war, the end of an epoch, a vast epoch, in the history of human evolution?’ The Guardian had also repeated ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s warning of 1920 that ‘another war fiercer than the last, will assuredly break out’.
  </aside>

<p id='15.6'> With regard to the photographs of the Paris bust of the Master; Shoghi Effendi does not wish, you to undergo the expense and trouble of ordering another fifty copies of the same dimensions as the original photos. Those of the post-card size you had sent, he feels, are quite good and sufficient. </p>

<p class='signature noid verse'>With his most loving greetings, also to Mrs. Greeven, 
  yours in His Service, H. Rabbání</p>



<p class='salutation noid' id='sal28'>Dearest co-worker:</p>

<p id='15.7'> Just a word to assure you of my ever-deepening gratitude and admiration for the efforts you are ceaselessly exerting on behalf of our oppressed brethren. Bahá’u’lláh is no doubt watching over you, and the Beloved is well pleased with your historic endeavours. Whatever their outcome, you have won for yourself an abiding place in the affections of the believers. Affectionately and gratefully Shoghi </p>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal29'>Dear Mr. Greeven,</p>

<p id='16.1'> Your very kind letter of October 28th was truly welcome, and it indeed greatly rejoiced the heart of our beloved Guardian to know that both Mrs. Greeven and yourself are keeping well, and that in spite of the storm and stress created by the outbreak of war in Europe you have been spared so far the sufferings and privations which millions of souls are now bitterly experiencing.<a data-fnid='37'></a> He hopes, and indeed will earnestly pray that the protection and guidance of Bahá’u’lláh may continue to be vouchsafed unto you both, and unto each and everyone of the believers throughout the world. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn37'>
    In a letter to Wright, dated 23 August 1939, Greeven-Marshall had written: ‘I have been able to accomplish so very little in the way of teaching, but am hoping that after the coming war (if I be alive!) that the people will be more ready to hear what I have to say.’ A week later, on 1 September, German troops crossed the border into Poland.
  </aside>

<p id='16.2'> In view of the gravity of the situation in Holland, and the possibility of war spreading gradually to that and other adjoining countries, he still feels that, in case your business conditions permit, you should move as soon as possible to Sweden, where you have certainly a greater chance of safety than in the Netherlands.<a data-fnid='38'></a> He would leave, however, the final decision to you and to Mrs. Greeven that you may, in consultation with each other, decide upon the course that would be the best and most feasible for you to take under present circumstances. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn38'>
    The Netherlands pursued a policy of neutrality, but on 4 September the Parliament voted in favour of a law for the mobilization of the Dutch Army.

Now is the time of seed sowing, and consequently one of slow and painful progress. But the harvest which the future shall reap will be incalculably rich, and great will also be your reward for having so unremittingly toiled in bringing it about.... </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn39'>
    As this letter indicates, the Greevens still were in The Hague on 25 March 1940. In the next days or weeks they left the Netherlands for North America. On 10 May, German troops entered the Benelux.

She arrived in New York on the 1st of May. While studying philosophy at Columbia University, she came in contact with Bahá’í’s and formally became a believer in August 1945.

    Anita Ioas (married Chapman) was born into a Californian Bahá’í family, and she went to Europe as a Bahá’í pioneer. In a letter of 14 March 1947, the secretary of the ETC wrote to Van Bleyswijk Sombeek and Straub in Rotterdam: ‘You will rejoice to know that the five pioneers about whom I wrote you on March 3 (this included Anita Ioas), sailed March 12 on the “Veendam” and should be arriving in Rotterdam a week from today or the 22nd. We are concerned about the job it has presented to you in preparing for their arrival and we hope that you can arrange for the truck which we had to meet them and transfer their accumulated baggage to the train.’ Ioas settled in Luxembourg together with Sally Sanor.

<p id='20.7'> Just a note to put in the Guardians letter: when I was in Brussels with my mother we stayed at the Palace Hotel; there was a Russian man there who was the public stenographer and had his office in the hotel. Mother often spoke to him about the Cause. He was a nice man and you might find him still there and now more ready for the Faith. </p>

<p id='20.8'> I forget his name, but I am sure he would remember “Mrs. Maxwell”.<a data-fnid='49'></a> </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn49'>
    May Maxwell (née Bolles) (1870-1940) was a prominent early Canadian Bahá’í. In the summer of 1935, she and her daughter Mary started a tour to promulgate the Bahá’í’ Faith in Europe. While Maxwell focused on France and Belgium, Mary paralleled her mother’s work in Germany. A year later, the mother and daughter concluded their tour with a pilgrimage to Haifa. They arrived there in January 1937.

  <aside class='fn' id='fn50'>
    Arnold van Ogtrop (1916-2000) had become a Bahá’í in 1937 while working as a dancer in the Kurt Jooss Ballet at Dartington Hall in Devon in the United Kingdom. In the spring of 1946, the English Bahá’ís had invited him to their summer school in Matlock Bath. There he had met some 140 Bahá’í’s from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Írán, Egypt, and France. ‘I cant say in words what this Summer School did to me. Being like a dry sponge, I just drank it all in every minute of the day. I wanted to give the Message — but how and to whom?’ In August 1946, he was ‘intensely pleased’ to learn that Van Bleyswijk Sombeek and Straub were coming to help him. They met in Rotterdam on 8 October. ‘That day I finished being an isolated believer.’
  </aside>

<p id='21.1'> Your welcome letter, dated August 19th, has been received, and our beloved Guardian was very pleased to hear from you, as he had already received news of your attachment to the Faith from the English believers. He has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p id='21.2'> He has great hopes for the rapid development of an assembly in Holland; the Dutch people are a fine race, tolerant, intelligent and kindly, and a center in Holland would greatly reinforce the Cause in Europe. Now that the new Dutch Bahá’ís are going to be active there in spreading the teachings, you will have the benefit of their help, and through your united labours should soon be able to establish a group of interested people. </p>

<p id='21.3'> He was also very pleased to hear of your visit to the Swiss Bahá’ís; they are devoted and persevering, but need outside help and stimulation. Your experience at the Summer School in England will also be of great help to you, for when the friends gather for study and consultation they really feel the depths of the bonds which unite us in the Faith of God for this day. </p>

<p id='21.4'> You may be sure his ardent prayers will be offered for the success of your Bahá’í work, and he will also pray for your father and for the soul of your dear mother, that in the worlds beyond she may have the joy of recognizing Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p id='21.5'> He would welcome news of your activities and of the progress of the work there. </p>

    The date of this cable is not known, but it was most likely sent when Humbert moved from the US to Belgium. By December 1946, the European Teaching Committee had sent out a total of eleven pioneers to Europe, and in January 1947 another five left; among them Madeline (Melanie) Humbert. In a letter to Van Bleyswijk Sombeek and Straub, the ETC wrote: ‘You will be happy to know that Madeline Humbert’s plans are at last completed and that she is sailing January 29 on the “Noordam”, sister ship to our nice “Westerdam”. She will pass through Rotterdam of course, and hopes to see you both to convey to you personally our deep love and warm greetings. Perhaps you can arrange to meet her steamer and assist her through the customs to her train for Brussels.’ Straub lived in Rotterdam, so that was no problem. After Humbert arrived, the ETC wrote on 20 February 1947: ‘The committee members were very happy indeed to have your letter of Feb 8 and to hear of your meeting with Madeline Humbert. We deeply appreciate the beautiful hospitality offered by Jetty to pioneers passing that way and will plan to have as many as possible routed through Rotterdam, providing we do not impose on her generosity.’

    At the National Convention in Wilmette (Illinois), the Guardian’s second Seven Year Plan (1946-1953) for the Bahá’í’s of the United States and Canada had been disclosed. The plan, operating in three continents, covered four main objectives, the last one of which was ‘the initiation of systematic teaching activities in the war-torn, spiritually-famished European continent... aiming at the establishment of administratively firm, well-grounded Assemblies in the Scandinavian countries, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and Portugal’.

    <p>‘In our house of nine rooms, only one room was allowed to be heated.’ During those cold winter months, the two sisters made a new Dutch translation of Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era. The book would come out in June.</p>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal43'>Dear Bahá’í Sister:</p>

<p id='24.1'> Your letters dated January 4th and February 13th have been received by our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer them on his behalf. </p>

<p id='24.2'> Regarding your question about the Esperantists: for many years they have been one of our closest contacts in Europe, and many of them have become believers. They are working for one of our greatest principles, and we certainly should associate with them. In Germany the Bahá’ís published an Esperanto magazine, and Martha Root<a data-fnid='56'></a> represented the Cause at Esperanto Congresses. We cannot say we are sure this language will be the International one, but we are anxious to see it spread as it fosters unity and understanding. By all means foster your contact with them. Whether Esperanto will be chosen as the International language or not we cannot say; but we can say we hope it will spread because it nearly fulfils such a noble purpose.<a data-fnid='57'></a> </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn56'>
    Martha Root (1872-1939) was a prominent American Bahá’í and Esperantist. She was a journalist by profession and travelled the world extensively to promulgate the Bahá’í Faith. In 1926, Root was in The Hague to deliver Bahá’í books to Queen Wilhelmina, and two years later she attended an international conference on ‘Peace by Religion in that same city. From there she went to the 20th Universal Esperanto Congress in Antwerp. See also letter 14 April 1932.
  </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn57'>
    Because of Bahá’u’lláh’s teaching to select a single language for rhe use of all on earth, there had been long-standing and close relations between the Esperanto movement and the Bahá’í community, also in the Netherlands. Apparently Van Bleyswijk Sombeek intended to build on this connection. On 10 June 1947, she became a member of the Esperanto Club of Amsterdam, where she was introduced as ‘a Bahá’í representative’. A few days later the Heraldo de Esperanto carried an article on the Faith and gave her address for those who wished to know more.
  </aside>

<p id='24.3'> By all means speak to gatherings, when the opportunity arises, about the Faith. There is no objection to broadcasting the Message over the radio — but your first consideration and main objective is to confirm sufficient souls to establish a spiritual assembly, and also to build up your literature in the Dutch language. </p>

<p id='24.4'> He is very encouraged to hear you and your dear sister and Mr. van Ogtrop are working in close harmony, and that your spirits are high and you are facing the work with so much joy! </p>

<p id='24.5'> You may be sure his loving prayers for your spiritual advancement and understanding will be offered in the Holy Shrines. </p>

<p class='signature noid' id='sig22'>With Bahá’í love, R, Rabbání</p>



<p id='24.6' class='italic'>May the Spirit of Bahá’u’lláh ever sustain you, cheer your heart, illumine your path, remove every obstacle that impedes the progress of your historic work, aid you to attract capable souls to the Faith, and establish a firm and unassailable foundation for its institutions.

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal50'>Dear Bahá’í Sister:</p>

<p id='31.1'> Your letter of March 2nd, written on behalf of Miss Van Sombeek, and enclosing a translation of the Dutch pamphlet, has been received by our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.<a data-fnid='65'></a> </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn65'>
    The pamphlet was entitled: De Weg tot een Menswaardige Wereld (The Road to a Humane World).
  </aside>

<p id='31.2'> The excellent progress being made in Holland, the formation of the first historic assembly<a data-fnid='66'></a> there, the translation work being done — all are great sources of comfort and pride to our Guardians heart.

    The first Spiritual Assembly of Amsterdam was formed on 20 April 1948. Its members were: Jan Piet de Borst, Josephine Diebold (treasurer), Harry Dieperink, John Carré, Charlotte Stirrat, Hans Slim, Rita van Bleyswijk Sombeek (secretary), Arnold van Ogtrop (vice-chairman), and Jetty Straub (chairman).
  </aside>

<p id='31.3'> In a country of such intelligent and forward-thinking people as the Dutch the Cause should make steady headway, and soon become well, and — we hope — nationally established.<a data-fnid='67'></a> </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn67'>
    Did the Guardian know that some American Bahá’í visitors to the Netherlands held somewhat different opinions? ‘You will never find a country of people so much in favour of the Bahá’í principles — they offer no resistance — they offer no help — they’re just apathetic as a whole.’ Another apparently had that same impression. Obviously referring to the Dutch polder landscape, she concluded that its inhabitants were ‘so broadminded that they’re flat’. And a third was inspired by geography too: The Dutch build a dyke around you, then drain you dry.’

    Dorothy Baker (1898-1954) was a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States. During her stay in Amsterdam — from 4 to 8 February — she spoke at public meetings each day. Stirrat described her as ‘the most outstanding and spiritual woman I have ever known. She has a great gift of intuition, a keen sense of justice, a loving and understanding heart’. The Guardian appointed her Hand of the Cause in 1951.

<h3 class='subhead no-pad-above date' id='m34b'>Doris Lohse, 6 July 1948</h3>
<h4 class='subhead no-pad-above recipient' id='m34d'> To John and Eunice Shurcliff</h4>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal54'>Dear Bahá’í Friends:<a data-fnid='70'></a></p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn70'>
    <p>  Doris Lohse was an American Bahá’í pioneer who lived in Brussels from September 1947 to 29 June 1948. John (Jack) and Eunice Shurcliff were also American Bahá’í pioneers. They lived in Uccle (Ukkel) near Brussels from March 1947 to October 1949. In a letter to friends and relatives in the US, dated 24 April 1947, Eunice wrote: ‘Our passports came through at the last minute, and we got our Dutch and Belgian visas in New York just a day before sailing on the S.S. Veendam of the Holland-America line. It is a 20,000 ton ship, recently remodelled after combat use in the war.</p>

    <p>Three other Bahá’í pioneers were with us on the Veendam: Anita Ioas and Sally Sanor from San Francisco, going to Luxembourg, and John Carre from Los Angeles, bound for Amsterdam. All of us were in the same general age group, i.e., 26 to 36.</p>

    <p>Many New York Bahá’ís were on deck to see us off with chocolates and magazines... Very quickly the animated handkerchiefs and hats faded from sight and we were passing tugs, ferryboats, great ships in dock and still vessels of war. As the famous New York skyline, Ellis Island, and finally our grand and noble symbol of freedom passed in revue, I think we all realized how bountiful and blest is strong, young America.</p>

    <p>For the first few days out, the passengers on S.S. Veendam (1st class) seemed rather stiff and formal, and we looked down enviously upon the friendly group chatting and laughing on ‘B’ deck. But gradually a few sunny personalities managed to break the first class ice, and we learned the story of everyone’s life.</p>

    <p>Jack, Francie and I had one of the choicest cabins with a good window, yet it seemed rather cramped to us. We had the baby’s crib removed because it took up most of the floor space, but Francie slept happily on her mattress on the floor between my bunk and the bureau. She would wake up every night when the ship rocked heartily and cry until one of us took her into his bed.</p>

    <p>Jack ate with the first sitting and I with the second — so we could take turns with the baby... My table companions were two very interesting Dutchmen, engineers from Java going home to Amsterdam after three years in a Japanese concentration camp. Both spoke English very well, had been to America and were exceptionally good conversationalists...</p>

    <p>On board were the Maharaja of Indore, his American wife and three-year-old son, Prince Richard, who used to kiss Francie’s hand and then her cheek each night at bedtime. Jack says she hasn’t been the same since she was kissed by a prince.</p>

    <p>During our voyage, news of the Bahá’í Faith spread from one passenger to another, and several persons asked us for literature... Our comparatively luxurious trip was extended a day or so because of rough weather, and so we arrived in Rotterdam Sunday morning, March 23rd (we left New York March 12th at 5 pm). Entering the canal just at daybreak, we felt all the charm of the quiet Dutch countryside; only later, as the sunlight grew’stronger, could we discern the misery that lay behind those picturesque windmills and farmhouses.</p>

    <p>Every few minutes a scrap-iron pile showed itself upon the waters edge, and the sun shone through the bombed-out tops of houses. Former passenger ships, used in combat during the war, sat idle and useless. Soon our ship’s slow movement ceased altogether, and the stevedores scrambled aboard after the tons of luggage.</p>

    <p>Our window looked out upon the opposite side from Rotterdam’s one remaining pier. We saw tiny boats anchored in front of 15th and 16th-century buildings of deep barn-red and canary yellow, antiquated brown and white stone ones with spires, and vacant spaces where proud masonry had stood before the bombings.</p>

    <p>Alighting at the pier was something of a shock, and we stood around in dazed fashion while everyone rushed frantically in search of his baggage. Dutch people crowded in as close as allowed to stare enviously at the fortunate passengers from America, grabbed extended oranges hungrily, some eating them lustily on the spot. Children squealed with excitement, and babies cried fearfully as they were handed over to Dutch grandparents. In the midst of it all, nets full of luggage descended threateningly through an opening in the roof, and workmen scurried to and fro, attempting to speak a few words of English but mixing everyone up even more.</p>
      
    <p>Holland is a cold, damp country, and Rotterdam looked old and dying as a result of the intense bombings and hardships. Jetty [Straub] told us how people tore up their floors, doors and cupboards in a mad and desperate effort to have warmth and to cook the eternal sugar beets. Most of the trees have been cut down for the same purpose... I suppose it is always rather a surprise to Americans to see that upon crossing a European boundary line the whole aspect of the country and the people changes immediately. The Dutch countryside looked immaculately neat but poor and terribly somber. Just over the line in Belgium, the sun seemed warmer, the trees greener, the houses gayer. Belgium has suffered not at all compared with poor Holland. We could see from the train that Antwerp was badly bombed but still very much alive and kicking. Entering Brussels was delightful — an exciting, rich city after gaunt, ghostly Rotterdam... We were grateful to see well-dressed, well-fed people, oranges sold fairly inexpensively everywhere, chocolates in the shops and comfort in general — though one has to wonder how the people manage with such terrifically high prices and correspondingly low wages... We are now happily installed with a family of three in the suburban town of Uccle... and the arrangement is made liveable by their having sleeping quarters three flights upstairs.</p>

    <p>Uccle, where we are, is typical of a Belgian village — tall, slim gaily-painted houses, cobblestone streets (which require heavy, flat-heeled shoes), a neat ‘Boucherie’, ‘Poissonerie’, ‘Charcuterie’, and ‘Patisserie’ in every other block, horse-drawn bread and milk wagons, rather few automobiles, and every now and then a ‘Dog of Flanders’ cart — usually selling beer or milk...
    Our greatest problem is how to use the fleeting hours and moments to the best advantage for the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh.
    With warm greetings and love to you all, Eunice and Jack Shurcliff.’</p>

<p id='34.2'> He has been greatly encouraged over the wonderful way the work has progressed in Europe during the past year. The formation of the Brussels Assembly being a most welcome addition to the list of triumphs registered! </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn71'>
    The conference referred to was the first Bahá’í European Teaching Conference, which was held in Geneva (Switzerland) from Saturday 22 to Thursday 27 May. The conference was attended by some 90 Bahá’ís of 13 different nationalities. From Belgium Léa Nys and Doris Lohse attended. In a letter to her parents, Stirrat wrote: ‘Tues. night our train left A’dam — five Bahá’ís were in the second class compartment together with one stranger. It was a beautiful moonlight night and it was fine being together — eating and sleeping (sitting up). At 7.00 in the morning we went through Luxembourg and were met at the station by 2 of the Bahá’ís there — taking us to breakfast and bringing us sandwiches, bananas, oranges, candy, cookies etc. Such precious people those two Bahá’ís... Luxembourg is a most beautiful, mountainous country — streams, luxurious green grass carpets, wild flowers and lovely large trees — it’s really a heavenly nation — but oh so tiny! Luxembourg Ville is the principal city and is like a medieval town even today in thought, action and surroundings... A little ticket from A’dam to Basel is about the size of 1 1/2 mail postage stamps — yet wherever we passed a border it had to be punched. First by Dutch, then Belgians, Luxembourgers, then French, then Swiss — 5 punches on this little card!’ And in another letter .she continued: ‘The conference was thrilling beyond words and unique in my Bahá’í experience. This is the beginning of future conferences — the very first one to be held on the European Continent... When I was planning for the trip, the real significance of the conference skipped my mind... gradually, the true meaning of the conference became clear — it was as though the curtain were pulled aside for a moment, and I saw what the Bahá’ís are really doing — in 91 countries of the world... It is so thrilling to see how our Guardian works — it is as though he has his finger on the pulse of the world — he is always several jumps ahead of the statesmen in the world... And now — in the midst of the chaos, uncertainty and falling bombs in Palestine, plans are being made to erect the first building of the Universal House of Justice on the slope of Mt. Carmel — the Sepulchre of the Báb.’

    The committee had its first meeting on 4 December 1948. Its members were: Etty Graeffe and Anne Lynch for Switzerland, Suzette Hipp and Mrs. Roeder for Luxembourg, and Léa Nys and Mrs. P. Rose-Spanoghe for Belgium. During that meeting it was not only decided to first review the works already published in French first, but also to send a letter to the Guardian. Suzette Hipp, mentioned here, was the first native Bahá’í in Luxembourg. She declared on 31 December 1947.

In the past, on more than one occasion, there has been duplication of translations and of work, which is an awful waste of our limited resources. If the French Bahá’ís already have any translations made, he suggests, you review them and use them, rather than make new ones, — unless of course, they should not be considered usable. </p>

<p id='36.1'> Your letter to our beloved Guardian of June 7, was received, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. </p>

<p id='36.2'> He was most happy to see the truly remarkable way in which your passport-difficulties have been straightened out, and feels that this in itself has been a way of serving the Cause, for it has called to the attention — and evidently won the sympathy of the American authorities for your uprightness, and devotion to this Faith of ours. </p>

<p id='36.3'> Your struggles have been richly blessed and must serve as an example to other pioneers and a sure proof that God will assist all those who arise to serve Him. </p>

<p id='36.4'> It is part of the preciousness of this great work being done in the teaching field that it should be done through real sacrifices and not without heartaches attending it. There is a tendency in the American outlook on life at present to believe that suffering is produced by clumsiness and is not only avoidable but not a good thing, and not essential. While there is some truth in this attitude, we as Bahá’ís cannot but believe that suffering is often an essential part of our service. The Prophets suffered bitterly, so did all the saints and martyrs and often “fed on the fragments of those broken hearts”, as Bahá’u’lláh says in one of His beautiful prayers. </p>

<p id='37.2' class='italic'> The establishment of twelve assemblies and the formation of twenty-two additional groups and isolated centres ere the halfway mark of the plan has been reached, constitute an outstanding exploit unparalleled since the inauguration of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan, unsurpassed in vastness of range and of spiritual potency by any collective enterprise yet undertaken by the followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in any continent of the globe since the inception of the Formative Age of His Dispensation. </p>

<p id='37.3' class='italic'> Am moved to offer warmest congratulations to the American National Spiritual Assembly, as trustees of the plan; to the European Teaching Committee, as its appointed executors; to all pioneers whether settlers or itinerant teachers; to all native believers both new and old; to all newly-formed assemblies; to all groups, and to all isolated believers, who directly or indirectly participated so valiantly in this unique, brilliant, and greatest single victory since the plan was set in motion. </p>

<p id='37.4' class='italic'> The stage is set, the moment is propitious for no less spectacular exertion of effort, concentration of attention, and expenditure of energy, during the course of the final phase of the plan in the European continent, aiming, though above and beyond the prescribed objectives, at the broadening and the consolidation of the structural basis already laid, through the preservation of the prizes already won, the conversion of the larger groups into assemblies, the expansion of recently-instituted extension work, the increased participation of the native believers in both administrative and teaching activities, the acceleration of the translation and publication of Bahá’í literature, the gradual institution of regional summer schools, and the promotion of closer fellowship and more active collaboration, despite great distances, paucity of resources, and diversity in range of customs and language among the budding communities scattered in the north, west, south, and in the heart of the European continent, which (attainments) posterity will recognize as the bedrock of Bahá’u’lláh’s fast-evolving administrative order, as the torchbearers of His embryonic World Order, and as the heralds of a yet unborn world civilization amidst the turmoil of a travailing age, of overspreading gloom, and of present chaotic social and political order. </p>

<p id='37.5' class='italic'> The firmly-knit and sacred bonds of spiritual fellowship, more enduring and possessed of greater cohesive strength than any ties of kinship or race, are more potent than any social ideology or political alliance, deriving constant sustenance from the Mandate issued by the Pen of the author of the Divine Plan, and assured the overshadowing protection vouchsafed by the Lord of the Covenant Himself presiding over the Plan’s unfolding Destiny. </p>

<p id='37.6' class='italic'> Let them on this auspicious occasion dedicate themselves, through their assembled representatives, to the dual task of steadily consolidating their infant strength and tirelessly diffusing the holy influences inherent in their mission, until a visionless, slumbering, and spiritually-impoverished continent is awakened, through the saving grace of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation, and its peace and security are unassailably established, through theredemptive power released through the emergence of the Institutions divinely-appointed in His World Order.<a data-fnid='74'></a> </p>

    <p>  Léa Nys, became a Bahá’í on 30 September 1947 in Brussels. She served in the first Spiritual Assembly of Brussels, the first Regional Assembly of the Benelux, as well as the first National Spiritual Assembly of Belgium. On her passing in 1992 the Universal House of Justice wrote:</p>

    <p>‘We profoundly lament the passing of dearly loved Léa Nys, valiant handmaiden Bahau Hah, outstanding promoter His Faith. The first to accept Bahá’u’lláh on die soil of Belgium, she, from that moment in September 1947, unstintingly devoted her highly meritorious endeavours to die promotion of that Message and the up building of the Bahá’í community. Whether as a member of the first Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’í’s of Brussels, as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly, as a participant in the first election of the Universal House of Justice, as a member of the Auxiliary Board, as official representative of the Bahá’í’ International Community, as a translator of Bahá’í’ literature into French, as a victorious travelling teacher to innumerable countries in North and South America and the Antilles, to the islands of the Pacific and Indian Ocean, to east and west Africa, she has conveyed the divine summons to high and low alike, and raised aloft the banner of the oneness of mankind.’</p>

    Henk and Marie Buys became Bahá’ís in Amsterdam in 1949. See also letter 23 November 1947. That same year, Buys informed the Guardian that he intended to return to the East Indies. Times had changed however. Right after the end of World War II, nationalists had declared the East Indies to be the Republic of Indonesia, but since the Dutch colonial power had not recognized this, a period of unrest, chaos and military confrontation had started. The colony was granted full independence in December 1949. Buys arrived there that same month.
  </aside>

<p id='40.1'> Our beloved Guardian was very happy to receive your letter of October 2, and also to hear you are going out to Indonesia. </p>

<p id='40.2'> You can do an immense lot of good for the Faith there by teaching people whom you find open-minded and receptive to the wonderful message of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p id='40.3'> He urges you to get in touch with: </p>

<p id='40.4'> Mr, Rustam Sabet, P.O. Box 19, New Delhi, India, who is the secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of India, Pakistan and Burma. There is already one pioneer from India in Indonesia, and if you can see him, or write to him, after obtaining from Mr. Sabet his address, your cooperation would be very useful, as of course this believer is of oriental background,<a data-fnid='82'></a> </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn82'>
    Apart from this Indian pioneer of Iranian background, Grosfeld also still lived in Java. See letter 29 June 1936.
  </aside>

<p id='40.5'> It would be a wonderful service to the Faith if you can find some way of having the book Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era translated into Malay. </p>

<p id='40.6'> It is wonderful to think that whereas a few months ago there were no Bahá’ís in Indonesia, there will now be three, two from Holland and one from India.<a data-fnid='83'></a> God truly moves in mysterious ways to carry His Faith to suffering humanity! </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn83'>
    Buys travelled together with Jan Piet de Borst. The latter was the youngest of three children of an Indonesian mother and a Dutch father. On 3 August 1947, during a meeting at the house of Straub in Rotterdam and in the presence of Edna and Corinne True, De Borst had become ‘the first new Bahá’í in Holland’. Buys and De Borst stayed in Indonesia until early 1953. In July 1951 Buys was one of the four Bahá’í representatives to the UN Non-Governmental Organizations Regional Conferences held in Den Pasar on the island of Bali. At that occasion the Guardian cabled: PRAYERS SURROUNDING YOU — SHOGHI.
  </aside>

<p id='40.7'> It is just possible that Mr. Charles Mason Remey may be able to visit, on his world tour, Indonesia. Mr. Sabet can inform you of this. As Mr. Remey is a very charming and cultivated man he could be introduced to your circle of friends and give them lectures on the Cause in a way that would not savour of any propaganda, but rather seem a privilege to those who met him. </p>

<p id='40.8'> The Guardian assures you of his prayers for the success of your work out there, and also for dear Mrs. Buys.<a data-fnid='84'></a> </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn84'>
    Because of the unstable political situation Marie Buys and De Borst’s fiancee remained in Holland.

<p class='signature noid' id='sig37'>With warmest greetings, R. Rabbání</p>

<p id='40.9'> P.S. In view of the great importance of having some literature in Malay the Guardian urges you, and the other two pioneers out there, to make every effort to have at least a small pamphlet translated and printed as soon as possible. He would like to receive some copies of this for the Bahá’í libraries in Haifa and Bahjí as soon as they are available. </p>

    Josephine C. Diebold (1876-1966) was the daughter of a German mother and a Swiss father. She was a teacher-governess by profession and became a Bahá’í in Amsterdam on 21 March 1947. She was the oldest member of the Local Spiritual Assembly at the time. Stirrat described her as ‘a steady rock’ during many a stormy assembly meeting.
  </aside>

<p id='43.1'> Your letter dated November 23 has reached our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p id='43.2'> He fully realizes how very distressing it is to see any inharmony in a Bahá’í Community. However, a great deal of inharmony — if not all of it — is due to the fact that the Bahá’ís do not properly understand the administration. They know that the Spiritual Assembly is the body to decide the affairs of the Community, but they do not let it do so! This is usually due not to lack of a desire to see the assembly function, but rather to over-anxiety to see it do what one or two people think is the proper thing. </p>

<p id='43.3'> It is very hard for people to learn to function the way ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says we should: the friends on the assembly must consult freely, all of them; then whatever the majority decides must be accepted wholeheartedly, for the sake of God. Personal opinions are important, but once the majority has voted, they must be given up and not clung to. </p>

<p id='43.4'> The Guardian appreciates very much your devotion to the Faith, and your loving and helpful attitude towards your fellow Bahá’ís. He urges you to go on encouraging them, and pointing out to them that these are small problems — growing pains — and will and can be overcome. </p>

    The 4th European Bahá’í Teaching Conference and Summer School in Scheveningen lent a boost to the Bahá’í activities in The Hague. Several participants wanted to join the community. In December, Eleanor Hollibaugh — an American pioneer who had arrived in Amsterdam in 1948, but who now lived in The Hague — could report that a group of seven earnest believers’ had formed in The Hague. These included, as well as herself: Jeanne Boekhoudt, Theo Beets, Elly Becking, Lottie Tobias, Fippie van Duyne-Ouborg, and Ton Bloem.

<p id='54.2'> The European Teaching Conference no doubt lent a great impetus to the work in Holland.

    In December 1951, the European Teaching Committee appointed three new ‘Regional Committees’, including one for the Benelux. The Regional Committee of the Benelux consisted of six members: Louis Hénuzet and Léa Nys from Belgium, Rita van Bleyswijk Sombeek and Theo Beets from the Netherlands, and Claude Lévy and Suzette Hipp from Luxembourg. Its primary task was to organize an annual regional conference. And so it happened that on 12 April 1952, 47 Benelux Bahá’ís gathered for a three-day Benelux Conference at the Bahá’í’ Centre in Brussels. The conference was also attended by Hand of the Cause Zikrulláh Khádem. His wife remembered: ‘After visiting some Bahá’í communities in Italy, we proceeded from Milan to Brussels on 11 April 1952.’ After a train journey of several hours and little sleep the couple arrived exhausted, but the welcome made up for the hardship. ‘Upon receipt of the news that we were coming, the Bahá’í’s had assembled in front of the building to watch for us. Words of welcome and Bahá’í greetings echoed as we arrived. We were escorted to the conference hall to the sound of clapping and cheering. In this manner the dear friends received the representative of their Guardian.’ This first Benelux conference was such a success that the European Teaching Committee had to warn the organizers that these regional conferences should not divert interest from the larger annual European Teaching Conferences!

    Marthe Molitor-Noury (1904-1994) was a French-born painter and journalist. She discovered the Bahá’í Faith in 1947 during a trip to Belgium from her home in Rwanda. She married a Belgian, and in October 1951 left for the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) one day after becoming a Bahá’í in Brussels. This letter of Shoghi Effendi reached her two months after her meeting with Zikru’lláh and Javidukht Khádem as well as Músá and Sami Banání in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa). At the time, Molitor was one of the only two Bahá’ís living in that country. Javidukht Khádem described Molitor as ‘a mature woman with a very attractive disposition’. And she added: ‘Could this dedicated woman who labored so devotedly, grasped every opportunity, and persisted in her lonely attempts to teach the Faith ever have imagined that today there would be thousands of believers? How could she have known that her lonely labors — pioneering with a non-Bahá’í husband, lacking funds, and being out of communication with the rest of the Bahá’í world — would bear such fruit?’ Molitor assisted in the formation of the Spiritual Assembly of Brazzaville, capital of French Equatorial Africa (now The Republic of Congo). In 1954, at the completion of her husband’s term of service for the government, Molitor returned to Brussels. There Mr. Molitor became a Bahá’í too.

    Geertruida (Geertrui) Ankersmit was originally from Nijmegen, but she had become a Bahá’í in Brighton (England), in November 1951. At the Intercontinental Teaching Conference in Stockholm (21-26 July 1953), she volunteered to go toTexel, thereby opening the Frisian Islands for the Faith. She arrived there in October 1953, and Shoghi Effendi appointed her to be a Knight of Bahá’u’lláh. It was difficult, however, to find a job on the island. And when she at last found work as an assistant nurse in a home for the elderly, this proved to be too great a strain on her health. On 16 August 1956, Ankersmit asked the Guardian to release her of her responsibility as a pioneer on Texel. ‘I wholeheartedly long to serve the Cause where and as you wish me to. I will await your wishes before taking any further steps. I know that urgent pioneer assistance is needed in Luxembourg and over there is a possibility of employment. How I dislike to disappoint the beloved Guardian, but I hope to become a pioneer soon, so that I will be able to help you in your sacred task.’ A few months later she joined Van Bleyswijk Sombeek as a pioneer in Luxembourg.

    <p>  Eleanor G. Hollibaugh-Smith (1897-1987) was a Bahá’í pioneer from Nebraska. She had become a believer in 1939, had lived as a pioneer in Bolivia and in the southern United States, and on 22 October 1948 she had arrived in Amsterdam. After the conference in Scheveningen in 1951 she had moved to The Hague. In her letter of 16 June 1956 on behalf of ‘the Spiritual Assembly of The Hague and the Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds Committee’ Hollibaugh wrote: ‘Beloved Guardian: On May the 20th, the Dedication of the Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds took place in The Hague, preceding the Benelux Conference. Deep gratitude was expressed by all the Friends toward those who had made it possible for us to have this building. Therefore, I am writing this letter thanking you for your generous gift to us at the time of its purchase in August of last year...</p>

    <p>  Every day there is a fresh realization of the benefit that ownership of this building gives us. It seems to be a visible anchor, something material to back up our teaching efforts. We hope and pray that we may be worthy of this gift and that we may take hold of our responsibilities in every way, both in the maintenance of the building and in the further spreading of our beloved Faith. With loving greetings from the Bahá’ís of Holland.’</p>

    In a letter dated 4 September 1956, Léa Nys, Secretary of the Benelux Regional Committee, had informed Leroy Ioas, the Guardian’s secretary, that due to ‘the (numerical) seriousness of the situation’ in the Benelux and ‘in view of the birth of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the Benelux, to be elected next year, a special Conference instead of the Summer School’ was to be held in the Bahá’í Centre in Brussels from 15 to 17 September. The conference was attended by 42 believers, including Edna True, the representative of the European Teaching Committee.

<p id='92.2'> Homosexuality is highly condemned<a data-fnid='143'></a> and often a great trial and cause of suffering to a person, as a Bahá’í. Any individual so afflicted must, through prayer, and any other means, seek to overcome this handicap.

  <aside class='fn' id='fn143'>
    In 1950 the Guardian had written to an individual believer: ‘No matter how devoted and fine the love may be between people of the same sex, to let it find expression in sexual acts is wrong.’ And in 1954: ‘Homosexuality, according to the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, is spiritually condemned. This does not mean that those people so afflicted must not be helped and advised and sympathized with. It does mean that we do not believe that it is a permissible way of life.’
  </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn144'>
    The word ‘flagrantly’ is one of very few words ever underlined in a letter of the Guardian. The phrase ‘flagrantly immoral’ was understood at the time to mean ‘showing very obvious disrespect for Bahá’í law’.

    This discord centered around a couple who defended their homosexual lifestyle and tried to win others over to their position, thereby causing a rift within the community.

<h4 class='subhead no-pad-above recipient' id='m94d'> To Benelux Convention</h4>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal106'>Dearly beloved friends:<a data-fnid='146'></a></p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn146'>
    <p>On Saturday, 20 April 1957, the Benelux Bahá’ís assembled at the Bahá’í Centre in Brussels. Two days later, on a Monday afternoon, the 19 delegates elected, from among all adult believers living in that area, the nine members of the first Regional Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the Benelux. Its members were: Louis Hénuzet, Claude Lévy, the couple Jean and Léa Nys, Fernand Radar, Roger Swinnen, Elsa Dekoninck, Jan Sijsling and Bob van Lith.</p>
        
    <p>The text of the letter printed here was found as such in the three National Archives. It is the last part of a much longer message of the Guardian to the Benelux Convention. </p>   
  </aside> 

<p id='94.1'> The opening of the second year of the third phase of a ten-year long Crusade, marking the passing of a little over one third of its duration; coinciding with the closing of a period rendered memorable by the achievement of so many of its goals, as well as by a succession of victories won in fields beyond its scope; significantly ushered in by the emergence of no less than thirteen National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies in four continents, with a jurisdiction embracing more than forty territories of the globe, in the election of which over three hundred delegates, representing more than one hundred and thirty local communities will participate; and over the inauguration of which no less than thirteen Hands of the Cause of God will preside — the opening of so auspicious a year must be signalized by a solemn renewal of dedication, on the part of all who are participating in this colossal, world-girdling enterprise, and indeed by the entire company of those who profess the Faith of ofBahá’u’lláh — a dedication which, as the year pursues its course, will be reflected in acts the brilliance of which will eclipse the shining exploits achieved since the inception of the Crusade, and, indeed, since the commencement of the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation. </p>

<p id='94.2'> The pre-eminent task of teaching the Faith to the multitudes who consciously or unconsciously thirst after the healing Word of God in this day — a task so dear to the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; at once so sacred, so fundamental, and so urgent; primarily involving and challenging every single individual; the bed-rock on which the solidity and the stability of the multiplying institutions of a rising Order must rest — such a task must, in the course of this year, be accorded priority over every other Bahá’í activity. </p>

<p id='94.3'> <q class='baha'>“If they arise to teach My Cause”</q>, Bahá’u’lláh Himself, revealing the secret of success for the propagation of His Faith, has declared, <q class='baha'>“they must let the breath of Him Who is the Unconstrained, stir them, must spread it abroad on the earth with high resolve, with minds that are wholly centered in Him, and with hearts that are completely detached from, and independent of all things, and with souls that are sanctified from the world and its vanities. It behoveth them to choose as the best provision for their journey reliance upon God, and to clothe themselves with the love of their Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious. If they do so, their words shall influence their hearers.”</q></p>

<p id='94.4'> The historic work initiated at the price of so much sacrifice, in more than one hundred territories of the globe, must not only be jealously safeguarded, but continually expanded, and wisely consolidated. A determined effort must be made to ensure, as speedily as possible, the resettlement of the territories which Bahá’í pioneers have been forced to abandon and the opening of the three virgin islands situated in the North Sea and in the Indian Ocean, as well as the six Republics of the Soviet Union and the five territories included within the Soviet Orbit. Particular attention should be paid to the all-important task of broadening and consolidating the foundations of the newly emerged National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies, as an essential preliminary to the formation of additional ones designed to buttress the fabric of a steadily expanding Administrative Order. </p>

<p id='94.5'> Simultaneous with the acceleration in the process of individual conversion, the equally pressing need of safeguarding local spiritual assemblies from dissolution and of increasing rapidly their number, must continually be borne in mind, as the most effectual means for the strengthening of the structural basis of the Administrative Order of the Faith. Complementing this laudable task, strenuous efforts must be exerted for the purpose of multiplying the existing groups and isolated centres in all the continents of the globe, ensuring thereby the early attainment of the goal of five thousand Bahá’í centres in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The three remaining Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds, the last two national endowments, the one remaining Temple site, must despite the present obstacles and the complications that have arisen, be speedily acquired, whilst the unexpected setback in the purchase of the temple site in Frankfurt must be overcome. </p>

<p id='94.6'> The important two-fold task of translating and of publishing Bahá’í literature, constituting so vital an aspect of the Plan must be diligently pursued and rapidly completed. The construction of the Home for the Aged — an institution designed to inaugurate the Dependencies of the Mother Temple of the West — must without further delay be commenced. The process of incorporating firmly grounded local as well as newly formed national and regional assemblies must be given an unprecedented impetus in every continent of the globe. The no less essential obligation to establish the remaining Bahá’í Publishing Trust must likewise be discharged. Strenuous efforts must be exerted to vindicate the independent character of the Bahá’í Faith through obtaining recognition by civil authorities, in as many countries, states and localities as possible, of both the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate and the Bahá’í Holy Days. Nor should any effort be spared, however severe the challenge, to ensure the acquisition and preservation for posterity of the few remaining historic sites in the Cradle of the Faith, and particularly those associated with the incarceration and execution of its Herald in A<u>dh</u>irbáyján. The equally meritorious project of transferring the remains of the father of Bahá’u’lláh, of the mother and of the cousin of the Báb to the Bahá’í burial-ground in the vicinity of the Most Great House, must receive the continued and prayerful attention of those on whom this sacred responsibility primarily devolves. In particular a determined effort must be made, now that no less than nine of the fifteen Republics constituting the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are included within the pale of the Faith, and especially by those Bahá’í communities situated on the periphery of this vast territory, to establish a nucleus, however small, in each of the six remaining republics, all of which140are now confined to the European continent, as well as in each of the two islands and of the three satellites included within the Soviet Orbit, thereby decisively contributing to the consummation of one of the most challenging objectives of this world-embracing Crusade. </p>

<p id='94.7'> Supplementing these manifold and pressing dudes, which the audacious prosecutors of this vast Crusade are now, with such modest resources, and despite the smallness of their numbers, so nobly discharging, over so large a portion of the globe, and at so turbulent a stage in the affairs of mankind, is the no less vital obligation to ensure, through a still more spectacular demonstration of world-wide Bahá’í solidarity and self-sacrifice, the meanswhereby the three monumental Edifices, each designed to serve as a house for the indwelling Spirit of God and a tabernacle for the glorification of His appointed Messenger in this day, may, without any interruption, be raised and dedicated, in the European, the African and Australian continents, and contribute their share to the world-wide celebrations of the Centenary towards which every Bahá’í heart is eagerly straining. </p>

<p id='94.8'> Great are the strides that have already been made, and phenomenal the success achieved, by the prosecutors of a thrice blessed Crusade, a Crusade so closely associated with the epoch-making Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan utilizing as its agencies the laboriously erected institutions of an efficiently functioning, divinely-appointed Administrative Order and linking, as it forges ahead, two historic centenaries commemorating the Birth and the Declaration of the Mission of the Founder of our Faith. The tasks that still remain to be accomplished, however, are truly formidable. Above all, the homefront, that must serve as a base, and act as a reservoir for the supply of a steady flow of pioneers and resources for the multiple organized operations of a continually expanding Crusade, and which, alas, in several countries, distinguished by an outstanding record of service to the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh has been progressively declining, must, at whatever, cost, and within as short a time as possible, be revitalized, extended and consolidated. More than ever its manpower must rapidly increase, the administrative machinery it utilizes, and on which it relies, for the effectual discharge of its Mission, must be assiduously perfected, and, most important of all, its spiritual driving force must be constantly reinforced through a firmer grasp by the individuals, ultimately responsible for its progress, of the distinguishing verities and fundamental purposes of their Faith, through a fuller dedication to its glorious Mission, and through a closer communion with its animating Spirit. </p>

<p id='94.9'> I appeal, as I close this review of the superb feats already accomplished, in the course of so many campaigns, by the heroic band of the warriors of of Bahá’u’lláh, battling in His Name and by His aid for the purification, the unification and the spiritualization of a morally and spiritually bankrupt society, now hovering on the brink of self-destruction, for a renewed dedication, at this critical hour in the fortunes of mankind, on the part of the entire company of my spiritual brethren in every continent of the globe, to the high ideals of the Cause they have espoused, as well as to the immediate accomplishment of the goals of the Crusade on which they have embarked, be they in active service or not, of either sex, young as well as old, rich or poor, whether veteran or newly enrolled — a dedication reminiscent of the pledges which the Dawnbreakers of an earlier Apostolic Age, assembled in conference at Badasht, and faced with issues of a different but equally challenging nature, willingly and solemnly made for the prosecution of the collective task with which they were confronted. </p>

<p id='94.10'> May this Crusade, on which the privileged heirs and present successors of the heroes of the Primitive Age of our Faith have so auspiciously embarked, yield, as it speeds on to its mid-way point, such a harvest as will amaze its prosecutors, astonish the world at large, and draw forth from the Source on high a measure of celestial strength adequate to ensure its triumphant consummation. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn148'>
    Howard Borrah Kavelin (1906-1988) was a Russian-American real-estate broker in New York. He was a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States who had presided over the convention and gave the members of the newly elected Regional Spiritual Assembly an intensive course in practical Bahá’í administration. The assembly had its first regular meeting in the weekend of 4-5 May in Brussels. In 1963 Kavelin was elected as member of the Universal House of Justice.
  </aside>

<p id='97.2'> This item is to the effect that you were to write the Hands of the Cause, and thank them for the two Albums sent, one of the Shrines and Houses of Worship, and the other of the Ḥaẓíra’s purchased under the Ten Year Crusade. </p>

    Leroy Ioas (1896-1965) was a prominent American Bahá’í from a German Lutheran background. Shoghi Effendi appointed him a Hand of the Cause in December 1951 and invited him to Haifa. He became both Secretary-General of the International Bahá’í’ Council and an assistant secretary to the Guardian. See also letter 2 September 1946.

One is that your Assembly should write a letter directly to the Guardian and not allow your expression of appreciation to come only through Dr. Grossman.<a data-fnid='150'></a> In other words it is perfectly proper that Dr. Grossman express your appreciation to the Guardian, but it is my opinion that the Guardian would feel a closer tie with your Assembly if your Assembly itself wrote to him. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn150'>
    Hermann Grossmann (1899-1968) was born in Argentina. He became a Bahá’í in Germany in 1920. He was active in child education and organized the Bahá’í Esperanto movement in Germany. After the war he was a leading figure in the rebuilding of the German Bahá’í community. Shoghi Effendi appointed him a Hand of the Cause in December 1951.
  </aside>

<p id='98.5'> There is one other suggestion which I may offer to you and that is whenever you list those in attendance at meetings. The Hands of the Cause should always be listed first, then members of a National Assembly, then members of National committees.

I only mention this that you might understand the proper method of listing the various institutions of the Faith. </p>

    In June 1957 Shoghi Effendi had cabled to the Bahá’í world: ‘The expropriation order issued by the Israeli government... related to the entire property owned by Covenant-breakers within the Haram-i-Aqdas, recently contested by these same enemies through appeal to Israel’s Supreme Court, now confirmed through adverse decision just announced by same Court, enabling the civil authorities to enforce rhe original decision and proceed with the eviction of the wretched remnants of the once redoubtable adversaries who, both within the Holy Land and beyond its confines, laboured so long and so assiduously to disrupt the foundations of the Faith, sap their loyalty and cause a permanent cleavage in the ranks of its supporters.’ The houses were pulled down in December of that year.

<h4 class='subhead no-pad-above recipient' id='m101d'> To National Spiritual Assembly of the Benelux Countries</h4>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal110'>Dear Bahá’í Friend:</p>

<p id='101.1'> Your loving letter of June 26th has just come to hand. </p>

<p id='101.2'> I will submit to the Guardian the question you raised with regard to using the address of the Ḥaẓíra for all mail going to the Benelux National Assembly, or rather all mail going to the secretary of the Benelux National Assembly. </p>

<p id='101.3'> The purpose of the Ḥaẓíra is to become the focal point of the Administrative activities and certainly now that the Regional National Assembly has been established for the Benelux countries, their Ḥaẓíra should become the center from which all activities radiate. It may be of course that due to the new birth of your National Assembly and the problems involved, the Guardian would not insist on the Secretary using this address for mail. Therefore I have submitted the matter to him and will let you know as soon as he gives me advice. </p>

<p id='101.4'> Your request for additional copies of the Guardians messages creates a problem, because most of these messages are forwarded directly to the National Spiritual Assembly in the United States and redistributed by them. It might be, if you write to Mr. Holley secretary of the N.S.A. in the United States, he would be able to send you two copies in the future instead of one. </p>

<p id='101.5'> The list of all the National Spiritual Assemblies throughout the world is not entirely complete so far as our records here are concerned as we have not had reports from all of the newly elected bodies. However attached is a memorandum which gives the addresses which we have. </p>

<p id='101.6'> I likewise give you below the address of the Bahá’ís in Yugoslavia which I have. It would be very desirable if the secretary of the Brussels Assembly was able to contact these Friends when in Yugoslavia. However, the utmost caution must be used so as not to attract attention of the local authorities and certainly no publicity of any type should be sought concerning either the Bahá’í activities or the visit of the Bahá’í to that country. </p>

<p id='101.7'> When the secretary of the Brussels Assembly returns from the trip, I am sure the Guardian would be delighted to have a report of his contacts of his friends in Yugoslavia. </p>

<p class='signature noid' id='sig86'> With loving Bahá’í Greetings, I am faithfully yours, Leroy Ioas </p>

<h3 class='subhead no-pad-above date' id='m102b'>Mrs. Léa Nys, Secretary, 5 July 1957</h3>
<h4 class='subhead no-pad-above recipient' id='m102d'> To National Spiritual Assembly of the Benelux Countries</h4>

<p class='salutation noid' id='sal111'>Dear Bahá’í Sister:</p>

<p id='102.1'> Your communications with their enclosure have all arrived safely, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf and to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated: April 25, May 5, 7, 19 and 24, June 17, and a letter regarding the Benelux Bulletin. </p>

<p id='102.2'> The historic formation of the three new Regional Assemblies for Europe has been a source of great joy to his heart, and he feels sure that it marks the opening of an important new phase in the progress of the Faith. In the past, the goal countries of Europe have been under the direct tutelage of the European Teaching Committee, acting for the American National Assembly. It was like a child who has a loving governess who lays the foundation of its education. Now the child has grown up and become a young man, and independent. He feels sure that this new development will be characterized by a marked step forward in the teaching work. </p>

<p id='102.3'> The whole purpose of the Bahá’í administrative bodies at this time is to teach, to increase the membership, to increase the Assemblies and to increase the Groups, not to create rules and regulations and impede the work through unnecessary red tape, but to insure that a great breath of spiritual vitality and inspiration goes out to the friends from their new National Body. Your Assembly should constantly bear this in mind, encourage and stimulate the friends in the teaching field, smooth out difficulties and misunderstandings and hurt feelings through love, understanding and wisdom, refrain from harsh measures, and, above all, from over-organization of the affairs of the Communities. There is a definite tendency of people everywhere to try and over-administer, so to speak, and the beloved Guardian points this out to your Assembly during the very first year of its existence in order to put it on its guard against this danger, which will stifle the spiritual life of the Community. You may be sure that many, many times he has issued this same warning to such old and tried national bodies as that of America, Germany, England etc. </p>

<p id='102.4'> It is not necessary for your Assembly to acknowledge by cable, communications, whether letter or cable, or to cable him after each National Assembly meeting. This only adds unnecessarily to the drain on your limited resources, all of which are needed for the all-important work of spreading the Faith in the three countries you represent. </p>

<p id='102.5'> The believers must be encouraged to teach individually in their own homes. Bahá’u’lláh has enjoined upon the Bahá’ís the sacred obligation of teaching. We have no priests, therefore the service once rendered by priests to their religions is the service every single Bahá’í is expected to render individually to his religion. He must be the one who enlightens new souls, confirms them, heals the wounded and the weary upon the road of life, and gives them to quaff from the chalice of everlasting life — the knowledge of the Manifestation of God in His Day. </p>

<p id='102.6'> The friends should also be encouraged within their own countries to go out and establish new centres by moving from places where there are already fifteen Bahá’ís. Although this may seem a daring act at so early a stage in the development of these communities, without audacity and courage the work will not go forward. We must not concentrate on our limitations, but on the boundless possibilities of the bounty of God, which will be vouchsafed to those who arise to propagate His Faith. </p>

<p id='102.7'> He is very pleased to see the practical way you have gone about executing your Six-Year Plan by biting off, so to speak, the work for one year, and fully approves of the goals you have set yourselves. </p>

<p id='102.8'> He noticed in one of your letters a reference to the translation and publication of literature: Although your Assembly will naturally have to assume full responsibility for Dutch and Flemish translations and publications, the ones in the French language are a different matter in view of the fact that French literature is not only needed in Belgium and Luxembourg, but also for France and Switzerland, and can be used widely throughout Europe and other countries. In view of this, your Assembly should avoid all duplication of effort which is a waste of time and money, and keep in close touch with the Paris Assembly and the Italo-Swiss National Spiritual Assembly, in order to find out what translations they are working on and what prospective publications they have in mind. In this way, time, effort and money will be saved.He was very happy to see that you are planning a Summer School in Holland. Such activities stimulate the friends, and are also a means of confirming interested contacts who may attend. He hopes it will be a great success. </p>

<p id='102.9'> He also hopes the Benelux Bulletin will be a means of encouraging and stimulating the believers throughout that area.You may be sure that he will remember you all in his prayers in the holy Shrines, and supplicate that Bahá’u’lláh may watch over your work, bless your efforts, and protect and strengthen you, in every way. </p>

<p class='signature noid' id='sig87'>With warmest Bahá’í greetings, R. Rabbání</p>



<p class='salutation noid' id='sal112'>Dear and valued co-workers:</p>

<p id='102.10' class='italic'> I fully share the joy and exultation that has filled the hearts of the valiant promoters of the Faith throughout the Benelux countries at this latest and most remarkable evidence of the onward march of their beloved Faith in so important an area of the European continent. This memorable milestone in the evolution of the institutions Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic Order, now firmly established in each of the sovereign states of Holland, of Belgium and of Luxembourg, augurs well for its future unfoldment and ultimate fruition in those countries. </p>

<p id='102.11' class='italic'> The efforts, so nobly exerted in the past by the band of pioneers, resident believers and itinerant teachers in each of these states, must, in consequence of the auspicious opening of a new phase in the establishment of this Divine Order, be multiplied a hundredfold, and the standard of consecration and of service to His Cause must be raised to still greater heights. No obstacle, however formidable, no test or trial however severe, should deflect them for a moment from the task they have pledged themselves to fulfil. </p>

<p id='102.12' class='italic'> The Six-Year Plan, on which they have joyously and con fidendy embarked, must be made the object of their constant solicitude and their earnest deliberations in the years immediately ahead. No sacrifice can be deemed too great, no labour too arduous. For the purpose of achieving its goals all must arise, whether young or old, however limited their resources or experience, to contribute their share to the consummation of this collective historic task. A concerted effort, unexampled in its range and intensity, must needs be exerted to augment, to an unprecedented degree, the number of the avowed and active supporters of the Faith in each of these three countries, whose people stand in such dire need of its life-giving principles and ideals as well as its divinely appointed institutions. Simultaneously, effective measures must be undertaken, by the elected representatives of these communities, as well as by the rank and file of the believers, to multiply rapidly the number of isolated centres, groups and local assemblies, constituting the bedrock on which a divinely conceived order must rest. Every frmly-grounded spiritual assembly must, moreover, be incorporated for the purpose of reinforcing this foundation. Steps must also be taken to secure from the civil authorities concerned the recognition of the Bahá’í marriage certificate as well as of the Bahá’í Holy Days. The translation of Bahá’í literature into Dutch, French and Flemish, and its publication and dissemination, must likewise be energetically undertaken and carried out. The number of Summer-Schools must, gradually, increase and their scope be continually widened. And, last but not least, a plot should be selected and purchased in the outsldrts of the capital city of Belgium to serve as a site for the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the Benelux countries. </p>

<p id='102.13' class='italic'> The task confronting these newly emerged, wholly dedicated, steadily unfolding, highly promising comm unities is admittedly strenuous and calls for a prolonged effort, the utmost consecration, vigilance and self-sacrifice. The interval during which this vast enterprise is to be consummated is exceedingly short. The resources at the disposal of the prosecutors of this far-reaching Plan are extremely limited. The spirit, however that so powerfully animates them in the discharge of their sacred and inescapable duties is such as to ensure, if they persevere along the path they now tread, their complete and total victory. </p>

<p id='102.14' class='italic'> That they may prove themselves worthy of their high calling; that they may rise to such heights as to excite the unqualified admiration of their brethren not only in the European continent but throughout both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres; that they may, through the range and quality of their concerted exertions, draw forth a measure of Divine bounty adequate to meet the pressing needs and manifold requirements of their glorious Mission, is my ardent and constant prayer for them all as I lay my head on the threshold of His Most Holy Shrine. Shoghi </p>

These buildings were purchased at much expense and self-sacrifice, and they should be animated centres of Bahá’í life. </p>

    Since the Guardian had left no heir and made no appointment of another Guardian, the Hands of the Cause now constituted the highest authority in the Bahá’í community. On 25 November, they chose nine from among themselves to serve as ‘Custodians of the Bahá’í World Faith’ who would reside in the Holy Land and oversee the continued progress of Shoghi Effendi’s Ten Year Plan. Leroy Ioas, the signatory of the above letter, was one of these Custodians. This interregnum ended in 1963 with the first election of the Universal House of Justice.
