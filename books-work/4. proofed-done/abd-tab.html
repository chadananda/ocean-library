  </div>



 <p id='i' class='nodropcap'> This book <span data-pg='i'></span> is a reproduction of the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as contained in the archives of the House of Spirituality <a data-fnid='1'></a> of Bahá’ís of Chicago. These Tablets are letters written by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and received by individuals and assemblies throughout America, many of them being in answer to questions. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn1'> This Tablet bears the following superscription: “To the members of the House of Justice, the servants of the Covenant, the faithful worshipers of the Holy Threshold of the Beauty of Abhá.” This tablet and the following eighteen are to the House of Spirituality of Chicago. </aside>

 <p id='i.2'> These copies of Tablets have been gathered by the House of Spirituality of Chicago from the recipients for the purpose of safe preservation in accordance with the purpose mentioned in the following letter sent out by that Body: </p>


 <p id='i.3' class='blockquote verse'>	March 21, 1908
 To the Friends of God in the Light of Abhá, throughout America. </p>

<p id='i.4' class='blockquote'> Greeting: — For a number of years the House of Spirituality has been gathering copies of Tablets, received by the Friends in America from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás, for sacred preservation in its archives, in accord with permission from him to do so in a Tablet addressed to it dated April 21, 1903, as follows: “As to the compiling of the Tablets in a Book for the House of Spirituality, this depends upon the consent of the receivers of the Tablets; if the owners of the Tablets consent, copies should be kept and collected in the House of Spirituality and it will be acceptable.” </p>

<p id='i.5' class='blockquote'> Although many Tablets, both published and unpublished, were known to be in circulation among the believers, and notwithstanding <span data-pg='ii'></span> the restriction to collect only copies sent in with the consent of the recipients, yet, in the spring of 1907, through the hearty response and co-operation in this endeavor about 500 copies of different Tablets had been received, acknowledged and filed with data concerning each in a safety deposit vault equipped with all modern appliances for protection. </p>

<p id='i.6' class='blockquote'> We believe the Friends everywhere will be further interested in knowing that at that time a draft of the Tablets was made by the Librarian of the House of Spirituality for the Bahá’í Publishing Society (who contemplated issuing same in book form), with all references to personalities eliminated, and said compilation was taken by Mr. Agnew to the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who inquired especially as to elimination of all names of persons and everything of a clearly personal nature, and as to whether the recipients of the Tablets had consented to publication of them, etc.-to all of which he gave approval and instructed the Publishing Society to proceed with the work. </p>

<p id='i.7' class='blockquote'> The purpose of this communication is therefore twofold: First, that the endeavor be continued to preserve a copy of every Tablet obtainable; and second, that it be accomplished at the earliest possible moment in order to make the forthcoming Volumes of Tablets (now being prepared by the Publishing Society) as complete as possible, for only the Tablets in the archives of the House will be used, as therein is recorded the desire of the recipients. </p>

<p id='i.8' class='blockquote'> In sending copies of Tablets, kindly see in so far as possible that together with each is given: (1) Full name of recipient (2) present address, mentioning street number, city or town, and state, (3) on or about date translated, (4) name of translator, (5) clearly state whether or not permission to publish all or only a portion of same is granted. Should there be any doubt as to whether or not a copy of any certain Tablet is already in the archives, you may be assured in knowing that every Tablet received has been acknowledged on a special printed form, signed by the Librarian. </p>

<p id='i.9' class='blockquote'> Concerning this important matter the following words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will be of interest to all: “Verily know, that the Tablets (Book) of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his address is a hidden mystery and concealed fact; no one is informed of its greatness and importance at these times. But in the course of times and future centuries, the signs thereof will be manifested, the lights thereof will dawn, the fragrance thereof will be diffused, and the greatness, the importance <span data-pg='iii'></span> thereof will be known. The truth I say unto thee, that each leaflet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will be a wide-spread Book; nay, rather, a glistening Gem on the Glorious Crown. Know thou Its value and hold great Its station!” </p>

 <p id='i.10' class='signature verse'>Thanking you in advance, we are your fellow-servants in the Vineyard of Abhá,
 THE HOUSE OF SPIRITUALITY. </p>

<p id='i.11'> A sufficient number of Tablets having been gathered together, they have been entrusted to the Bahá’í Publishing Society for publication in this concrete form for the enlightenment of the English-speaking world. </p>

<p id='i.12'> The Tablets appear in the book in the order received and filed in the archives. i.e., the first to respond to the above letter sent out by the House of Spirituality appear first in the book, and, so far as possible. all the Tablets to any one person or to a family or to an assembly have been placed together. </p>

<p id='i.13'> Regarding publications, the following Tablet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was received by this Society in October, 1906: </p>

<p id='i.14' class='blockquote abd'> HE IS GOD! </p>

<p id='i.15' class='blockquote abd'> O ye heavenly Assemblage! </p>

<p id='i.16' class='blockquote abd'> Your letter was received and its contents became known. Ye have written concerning the printing and the publication of the Tablets. </p>

<p id='i.17' class='blockquote abd'> The translation of the Súratu’l-Haykal <a data-fnid='2'></a> is of the utmost difficulty. It must be translated by a committee who are exceedingly efficient both in Persian and English, exercising the closest and most minute attention. <span data-pg='iv'></span> Otherwise the text would not become intelligible. The same rule applieth to other Writings and Tablets. For the present the organization of such a committee of translators is not possible and there is no other means than the translations made by individuals. In the future, God willing, means will be brought about. Translations will be made by a committee composed of two most erudite Persians and two learned Americans, all of them having the utmost proficiency in both languages and possessing a certain knowledge of sciences and arts. Then others from among the scholars and thinkers must assist. At that time Tablets will be translated correctly and published. What ye have in your hands and what is already printed will impart a certain degree of information. Whatever matter the spiritual Boards of Council in New York, Chicago, Washington and Kenosha unanimously deem advisable to print and publish, ye may print and publish; and have the utmost unity and oneness with each other. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn2'> Súratu’l-Haykal by Bahá’u’lláh, a portion of which was translated by Anton Haddad, published in 1900. The retranslation of this book has not yet been undertaken. </aside>



 <p id='i.18' class='blockquote abd'> Regarding the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: Each of them is important. Print ye those which are in detail. </p>

<p id='i.19' class='blockquote abd'> As to the question of annihilation and destruction of the spirits<a data-fnid='3'></a>: Mr. Phelps hath not fully understood the matter or else the translator hath made some mistake. It was not intended to convey the idea that the unbelieving souls are absolutely annihilated. Nay, rather, it was meant that the existence of the evil spirits in comparison to the existence of the sanctified souls was like unto annihilation. As you clearly behold, the existence <span data-pg='v'></span> of mineral in comparison with the existence of man is like unto non-being. When the body of man is destroyed and disintegrated, it returneth to the mineral. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn3'> Referring to passage in “The Life and Teaching of ‘Abbás Effendi” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá), by Myron T. Phelps, published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons,New York. </aside>



 <p id='i.20' class='blockquote abd'> Concerning the income of the printing and publishing society, as ye write, it must be expended for charitable purposes. </p>

<p id='i.21' class='blockquote abd'> O ye believers of God! I am pleased with you and seek for your assistance and confirmation. I hope that ye may, day by day, add to your love, steadfastness, purity of intention and service to the Cause of God. </p>

<p id='i.22' class='signature abd verse'> Upon ye be greeting and praise!
 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás. </p>



<p id='i.23'> These Tablets were originally written in Persian and all bear the caption, <q class='abd'>“He is God!”</q><a data-fnid='4'></a> and close with expressions of good will, such as, <q class='abd'>“Upon ye be greetings and praise!”</q> These expressions have been omitted from this compilation; also such portions as are clearly of a personal nature, as well as names of persons, as instructed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn4'> This is a usage of the people of the East. The purpose is that in every matter the commencement should be in the Name of God. </aside>

 <p id='i.24'> Omission of names of persons has been designated by the sign, thus ______; omission of purely personal portions of text have been designated by the sign, thus ... . The translator’s interpolations are enclosed in parentheses, thus ( ); editors’ interpolations are enclosed in brackets, thus [ ]. Messages and quotations are shown by the usual sign, thus “ ”. </p>

<p id='i.25'> The great labor of translating these Tablets from the original language has been entrusted to the following translators,<span data-pg='vi'></span> whose inestimable service is hereby gratefully acknowledged: Anton Haddad, Mirza S. M. Raffie, Mirza Housein Roohey, Ali Kuli Khan, Dr. Ameen U. Fareed, H. S. M. Taki Manshadi, Mirza Ahmad Esphahani, Mrs. Getsinger, Miss Barney and Mirza Moneer Zane. </p>

<p id='i.26'> The House of Spirituality desires to thank all who have assisted in this matter of gathering in copies of Tablets for preservation in its archives, and requests the Bahá’ís everywhere to continue the endeavor as outlined in the circular letter sent out by that Body, as herein quoted. Address such communications to the Librarian of the House of Spirituality, P. O. Box 283, Chicago, Ill. </p>

<p id='i.27'> Only a portion of the Tablets now on file with the House of Spirituality are contained in this volume. Other volumes will be issued as soon as possible. Tablets coming in will take their place in order according to the date received and appear in forth-coming volumes. </p>

<p id='1.4'> O party of the Covenant! Verily, the Beauty of Abhá hath promised the most great assistance to the beloved who are firm in the Covenant and to confirm them through the mightiest power. Ye will surely find in your luminous assembly such signs as will shine within hearts and souls.

Make feet firm, strengthen hearts and rely upon the everlasting bounties which will successively pour on you from the Kingdom of Abhá. Know, verily, the lights of Bahá will shine forth unto you during your gathering together in the brilliant Paradise. </p>

<p id='1.5'> It is incumbent on you to have union and harmony. It is incumbent upon you to have affinity and accord, so that you may become united in body and soul as the Pleiades, and as strings of brilliant pearls. Thereby your foundation will be laid, your argument will become manifest, your stars will beam forth and your souls will be comforted. </p>

<p id='1.6'> When ye enter the spiritual meeting of Consultation, chant the following commune, your hearts beating with the love of God and your tongues purified from aught else save the commemoration of God; so that the Most Mighty Power may confirm you by the greatest assistance: </p>

We are servants who have sincerely turned our faces unto Thy grand face, severed ourselves from all else save Thee in this great day and are assembled together in this glorious meeting, of one accord and desire, and unanimous in thought to promulgate Thy Word amid Thy creatures. </p>

<p id='1.8'> O my Lord! O my Lord! Suffer us to be signs of guidance, standards of Thy manifest Religion throughout the world, servants of Thy Great Covenant — O our exalted Lord! — appearances of Thy oneness in Thy <span data-pg='3'></span> Kingdom, the Abhá, and stars which dawn forth unto all regions. </p>

<p id='1.9'> O Lord! Make us as seas rolling with the waves of Thy great abundance, rivers flowing from the mountains of Thy glorious Kingdom, pure fruits on the tree of Thy illustrious Cause, plants refreshed and moved by the breeze of Thy gift in Thy wonderful vineyard. </p>

Cause our souls to depend upon the signs of Thy Oneness, our hearts to be dilated with the bounties of Thy Singleness, so that we may become united as are ripples on a waving sea; become harmonized as are the rays which shine forth from a brilliant light; so that our thoughts, opinions and feelings become as one reality from which the spirit of accord may be diffused throughout all regions. </p>

Your faces shall be enlightened with the radiance of supplication of God, invocation to Him, humbleness and submission to the friends (believers),<span data-pg='4'></span> and your assembly will be made a magnet for the lights of assistance from His Great Kingdom. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn8'> ‘Akká Syria — the Holy Land. </aside>



 <p id='2.5'> Be rejoiced, O friends of God, with this confinement which is a cause of freedom, this prison which is a means of salvation (to many) and this suffering which is the best cause of great comfort. Verily, by God, I would not change this prison for the throne of the command of the horizons and would not exchange this confinement for all excursions and enjoyments in the gardens of the earth. </p>

<p id='2.6'> Verily, I hope, through the kindness of my Lord and His mercy, bounty and generosity, to be suspended in the air in His path and that my breast may become the target to be pierced by thousands of bullets; or that I may be cast into the bottomless seas, or thrown into the wilderness and plains of barrenness. This is my utmost aim, my supreme desire, the animation of my <span data-pg='5'></span> spirit, the healing of my bosom and the sight of my eyes. </p>

<p id='2.7'> As to you, O friends of God: Make firm your feet in the Cause of God with such firmness as cannot be shaken by the most great disasters of the world. Be not troubled by anything under any condition. Be as lofty mountains, dawning-stars from the horizon of existence, brilliant lamps in the assemblies of oneness and lowly souls, pure hearted, with the friends. </p>

<p id='2.8'> Be signs of guidance; lights of piety; severed from the world, holding fast to the firm rope; spreaders of the spirit of life; abiders in the ark of safety; manifestations of mercy; dawning-stars of the mysteries of existence; points of revelation; day-springs of light; strengthened by the Holy Spirit; attracted toward God; sanctified from all things and from the (natural) qualities of people, and characterized with the attributes of the angels of heaven — so ye may attain to the greatest gift in this great century and new age. </p>

<p id='2.9'> By the life of El-Bahá! No one will obtain this great favor save he who cuts himself from this world, being attracted by the love of God, who is dead to the desires and appetites of self, sincere to God in all things and meek, humble, imploring, pleading and lowly before God. </p>

  </div>

 <p id='8' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! </p>

<p id='8.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read your reports with great joy. They are a cause of spirituality and fragrance and a source of dilation of souls. If the Spiritual Meeting, by the divine fragrance and heavenly confirmation, be firmly established (or continued) it will become a source of great signs and will be confirmed in matters of paramount importance. </p>

<p id='8.3'> The Spiritual Meetings, which are organized in this cycle of God and this divine century, have never had their simile or likeness in bygone cycles. For the great meetings (organizations) were under the protection of aristocratic men, while these meetings (or organizations) are under the protection of the bounty of Abhá. The helper or supporter of those (organizations) was either a prince or a king; either a priest was the principal, or a great republic (the cause); but the Helper, the Assistant, the Confirmer and the Inspirer of these spiritual meetings (or organizations) is His Majesty the Everlasting God. </p>

<p id='8.4'> Consider not the present condition, but rather foresee the future and the end. A seed in the beginning is very small, but in the end a great tree. One should not consider the seed, but the tree and its abundance of blossoms, leaves and fruits. </p>

<p id='8.5'> Consider the days of Jesus, when there was only a small body of people, and then observe the great tree which grew from that seed and what an abundant fruit it produced. This is greater than that, for as much as it is the calling of the Lord of Hosts and the Voice of the Trumpet of the Living God; it is the summons unto the harmony and unison of the world, and it is the banner <span data-pg='11'></span> of faithfulness, trustworthiness and friendship among the different nations and sects of the universe; it is the light of the Sun of Truth and the spirituality of the Majestic One. Verily this great cycle (dispensation) will encompass all the horizons and ultimately all the nations will gather together under this standard. </p>

<p id='8.6'> Therefore, know the importance of this seed which was planted in the divine field by the heavenly Gardener, watered with the rain of grace and nurtured by the heat and light of the Sun of Truth. Thus, O ye friends of God, give thanks unto His Majesty, the One, that ye became (or were made) the manifestation of such a gift and the recipient of such favor. </p>

<p id='8.7'> Blessed are ye! Good-tidings unto you for this great blessing! </p>

  </div>

 <p id='10' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye who are attracted by the Fragrances of God! </p>

<p id='10.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read your letters which uttered your steadfastness in the Cause of God, your firmness in His Religion and your joy by the breezes wafted from the garden of the Kingdom of God. </p>

<p id='10.3'> The truth, I say unto you: “Verily, the Supreme Concourse utter praise upon you, because ye forsook the desires of self, were illumined by the light of guidance, clothed yourselves with the garment of sanctity and called in the Name of Abhá among the people. Verily, ye shall reap what ye sow and obtain the fruits of what ye plant. This is a pre-ordained fact.” </p>

<p id='10.4'> O ye beloved of God! When the winds blow severely, rains fall fiercely, the lightening flashes, the thunder roars, the bolt descends and storms of trial become severe, grieve not; for after this storm, verily, the divine spring will arrive, the hills and fields will become verdant, the expanses of grain will joyfully wave, the earth will become covered with blossoms, the trees will be clothed with green garments and adorned with <span data-pg='13'></span> blossoms and fruits. Thus blessings become manifest in all countries. These favors are results of those storms and hurricanes. </p>

<p id='10.5'> The discerning man rejoiceth at the day of trials, his breast becometh dilated at the time of severe storms, his eyes become brightened when seeing the showers of rain and gusts of wind, whereby trees are uprooted; because he foreseeth the result and the end (of these trials); the leaves, blossoms and fruits (which follow this wintry storm); while the ignorant (short-sighted) person becometh troubled when he seethe a storm, is saddened when it raineth severely, is terrified by the thunder and trembleth at the surging of the waves which storm the shore. </p>

<p id='10.6'> As ye have heard of the former times, when (for example) Christ — glory be to Him! — appeared, a storm of trials arose, afflictions appeared, the winds of tests blew, the thunder of temptation descended and hosts of people (Pharisees) surrounded the houses of the friends; then the weak ones were shaken and were misled after once being guided; but the disciples withstood the hardships and endured the storms of ordeals, remaining firm in the Religion of God. Then observe that which occurred after the storm and what appeared subsequent to that severity, whereby the members (followers) trembled. </p>

<p id='10.7'> God changed the sorrow to joy, the destructive darkness of calamity into the shining light from the Supreme Concourse. The people at the beginning persecuted and reviled the believers in God and said of them: “These are the people of aberration.” Then, when <span data-pg='14'></span> their light appeared, their stars shone and their lamps illuminated, the people returned into love and affinity; they prayed to them, offered words of glory night and day (in their name) and remembered them in eulogy, reverence, honor and majesty. </p>

<p id='10.8'> Therefore, O ye beloved of God, be not grieved when people stand against you, persecute you, afflict and trouble you and say all manner of evil against you. The darkness will pass away and the light of the manifest signs will appear, the veil will be withdrawn and the Light of Reality will shine forth from the unseen [Kingdom] of Abhá. This we inform you before it occurs, so that when the hosts of people arise against you for my love, be not disturbed or troubled; nay, rather, be firm as a mountain, for this persecution and reviling of the people upon you is a pre-ordained matter. Blessed is the soul who is firm in the path! </p>

<p id='17.2' class='dropcap'> Your long letter was considered and its contents were a source of happiness. Thank God that ye, western friends, have become dawning-points of the love of God and stars of knowledge leading to Him; night and day are ye thinking of imparting life to souls and of educating people of discernment. </p>

<p id='17.3'> Regarding the blessed word, the Greatest Name: Its writing or spelling is according to its pronunciation (i.e., it is spelled as it is pronounced) in the Persian language. <u>Bahá</u> is correct; <u>Beha</u> is incorrect. However, <span data-pg='21'></span> this question must not cause inharmony and grief among the friends. The truth shall become manifest. </p>

<p id='17.4'> Should ye attribute a mistake to a person, it will be a cause of offense and grief to him — how much greater would this be if it is attributed to a number of people! How often it hath occurred that a slight difference hath caused a great dissension and hath been made a reason for division. Now, you write <u>Bahá’u’lláh</u>, but do not object to any person. All will eventually follow the correct spelling. </p>



 <p id='17.5'> In all matters, endeavor not to cause grief to any one. Strive firmly to establish unity and harmony. The least difference today may cause great difference in the future. </p>

<p id='17.6'> O ye beloved ones of God! The manifestation of the Light of Unity is for binding together the people of the world. If this unity is not attained, the tree of life is made fruitless, the heavenly bounty is not utilized. The blessed blood (of the saints) was shed for bringing about unity and harmony. These souls gave their lives as sacrifice in order to produce the love that bindeth the hearts of all the people. Therefore, ye should all spend your efforts in uniting and reconciling (the people), so that the light of God’s love may permeate the universe. </p>

<p id='17.7'> The Spiritual Meeting of men (House of Spirituality) and the Spiritual Meeting of women (Assembly of Teaching) in Chicago are indeed endeavoring to serve. If they unite, as they should, they will produce great results. Especially, if the Spiritual Meetings of <span data-pg='22'></span> Chicago unite with those of New York and become bound together, in a short while the fragrance of the divine garden, which giveth life, will perfume all regions. </p>

<p id='19.2' class='dropcap'> The blessed letter indicating the election of the Spiritual Meeting was received and proved a source of joy. Thank God, the beloved of that city, in perfect unity, love and oneness, held the new election and were confirmed and strengthened to elect such holy souls as are near the divine Threshold and known by the republic of the beloved to be firm and steadfast in the Covenant. </p>

<p id='19.3'> Now they (the members of the Spiritual Meeting) must, in perfect spirit and fragrance, in sincerity of <span data-pg='24'></span> heart, in attraction by the fragrances of God and by the confirmations of the Holy Spirit; engage in service; in the promotion of the Word of God; the diffusion of the fragrances of God; the training of souls; the promulgation of the most great peace. They must raise the Banner of Guidance and become the host of the Supreme Concourse. </p>

<p id='19.4'> Indeed, blessed souls have been elected. When I read their names, spiritual joy was immediately realized, for, praise be to God! certain souls have appeared in that continent who are servants of the Kingdom, self-sacrificing ones of the Peerless Majesty. </p>

<p id='19.5'> O ye friends of mine! Illuminate the meeting with the light of the love of God, make it joyful and happy through the melody of the Kingdom of holiness, and with heavenly food and through the “Lord’s Supper”<a data-fnid='19'></a> confer life. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn19'> A term synonymous with heavenly food. </aside>



 <p id='19.6'> Congregate in the utmost joy and happiness and commence with this commune: </p>

<p id='19.7'> O Lord of the Kingdom! Although we are assembled, yet we are Thy scattered ones; captives of Thy Shining Face. Although we are incapable, yet we anticipate the manifestation of Thy Strength and ability. Although we are without capital and commodity, yet we are aided by the treasury of the Kingdom. Although we are a drop, yet we emanate from Thy sea of seas. Although we are an atom, yet are illumined by Thy most Bright Sun. </p>

<p id='19.8'> O Lord! Confirm us so that each one in this gathering become a bright candle, a witness of the meeting, <span data-pg='25'></span> a caller to the Kingdom; that the world of matter become the mirror of heaven. </p>

<p id='19.9'> O ye dear friends of mine! The assemblies of those regions must be connected with one another and must communicate (correspond) with each other. Even communicate with the assemblies of the East, so that this may become the means of the great unity and concord. </p>

<p id='19.10'> O ye spiritual friends! Firmness (constancy) must reach a degree that if all the souls (Bahá’ís) be destroyed by the evil wishers and there remain but one, that one singly and alone should be capable of withstanding all who live on earth, and of spreading the fragrances of holiness. </p>

<p id='19.11'> Therefore, when any terrible news or calamitous tidings reach you from the land of desire (‘Akká), ye should not grow cold, sad, or be affected thereby. Nay, rather, ye must immediately in the utmost firmness, arise for the service of the Kingdom. </p>

<p id='19.12'> This servant of the Threshold of His Majesty the eternal God, hath always been and is in danger; there hath never been a hope for rest. The utmost of his hopes is that in the arena of martyrdom the cup of grace become replete and the wine of great bounty lend the wondrous ecstasy. This is the utmost of my hopes and desires. </p>

<p id='19.13'> The Tablets of I<u>sh</u>ráqát, Ṭarázát, Bi<u>sh</u>árát, Tajallíyát and Kalimát,<a data-fnid='20'></a> according to what is heard have been <span data-pg='26'></span> translated and printed in those regions.

<p id='20'> Thou hast written <a data-fnid='22'></a> concerning the Board of Consultation. It is very proper thou shouldst exert thyself with heart and soul so that this assembly shall become a source of merciful events, and enter the shadow of the protection and preservation of His Highness, the One God. The more this gains strength and becomes effective, the greater will become the penetration of the Word of God, and the more will the doors of confirmation be opened. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn22'> Extracts from a Tablet to Mírzá Asadu’lláh, at the time of the organization of the House of Justice, and the Assembly of Teaching of Chicago, in September, 1901. </aside>



 <p id='20.2'> As to the Assembly of Teaching, the revered members of which are the maid-servants of the Merciful, they are also assisted by the help and the providence of the Beauty of Abhá. They will soon discover that they are strengthened by the invisible hosts, and rendered successful by the abundant bounty of the Kingdom of the Forgiving Lord. They will set such a flame to the regions as will kindle the heart of the universe, and will cause the pillars of the world to tremble. But all of their mention and thought in their meeting should be confined to teaching the truth, and to <span data-pg='27'></span> constantly persuade people in pure and divine brilliancy and in absolute godlike spirituality. They should not interfere with the affairs which have regard to the Board of Consultation, because confusion of thought conduces to division and causes disturbance to the mind, and then pure spirituality would cease. But if all mentions are turned into one mention, and all thoughts concentrated in one point, then man will find (a higher) spirit, and witness ( a higher) confirmation. His power and penetration will increase, and his armies and hosts will gain successive victories. By this it is intended that the assembly of the maid-servants of the Merciful should be with pure spirituality and with absolute brilliancy, and become a torch of that blessed fire, a center of the merciful feelings. </p>

<p id='20.3'> The Assembly of Teaching is in this day of the first importance, and is promised to be assisted and protected through the assistance of His Highness, the One God. </p>

<p id='20.4'> Announce infinite glad-tidings to the revered maid-servants of God — the members of the merciful assembly, so that they may arise with the utmost tranquility (to further) prosperity and success, because ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is their strong and firm assistant through the help and the providence of the Lord of Hosts. </p>

<p id='20.5'> Concerning organizing Houses of Justice of men and Assemblies of Teaching of maid-servants of God, the more endeavor is made, the more agreeable it will be. It is very useful. Likewise, electing men and women teachers, and their traveling and journeying in all parts, and their going and coming in cities and villages, is greatly conducive to the solidity of the Cause. <span data-pg='28'></span> ... </p>

Know that, verily, this day is the day of teaching, this day is the day of diffusing the fragrances of God, being severed from aught else save God, attracted to the Word of God, and clinging to the Covenant of God. There is no work greater than this. Be ye entirely spiritual, purely brilliant, cut your dependence from any other mention, thought or purpose, and confine your mentions, thoughts and occupations to spreading the fragrances of God, and devote your attention to this great work. By God, the True One, verily, the Sun of Truth will cast forth its lights in your assemblies and will make you shining lamps, glittering stars, brilliant signs, and as souls attracted to the Holy Spirit. This is the great prosperity! This is the manifest light! </p>

O God, strengthen us through the fragrances of Thy sanctity, that we may become sanctified from the stain of egotism and lust, baptized with Thy Holy Spirit, with the fire of Thy love and the water of Thy bounty. </p>

 <p id='26' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye my divine friends! <a data-fnid='30'></a> </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn30'> Revealed in response to a supplication signed by 422 believers in America and sent July 4, 1905. </aside>



 <p id='26.2' class='dropcap'> At a time when the sea of tests had become tempestuous and the waves of calamity were heaving and the hosts of nations were in the utmost violence and the people of oppression dealt with infinite injustice, some of the calumniators, uniting with our unkind brother, wrote a letter replete with false accusations and engaged in seditions and calumnies. </p>

<p id='26.3'> They confused the mind of the government and agitated the state authorities. From this it is evident how a prisoner in this ruined walled city would fare and how the conditions are so full of perplexity and confusion as to baffle all description! Notwithstanding, this imprisoned exile is in the utmost firmness and calmness, trusts in His Highness the Peerless God, and wishes for every calamity and affliction in the path of the love of God! (To us) the arrow of oppression is a rich flow of divine bounty, and deadly poison is a swift-healing antidote. </p>

<p id='26.4'> We were in such a state when a letter came from the friends in America. The whole of its contents showed an agreement on their part to be in unity and harmony in all respects, and it was signed by all, determined to be self-sacrificing in the path of the love of God, in order thus to secure eternal life. </p>

<p id='26.5'> Upon perusing that letter and looking at the names signed to it, such a joy and gladness came over ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as is beyond description, and he thanked God that such friends are found in that country, who in utmost joy and fragrance are in union and accord and <span data-pg='36'></span> one in agreement with each other. The more this Covenant is strengthened, the happier, the better, the sweeter it will be and it will thus attract the divine confirmations. If the friends of God are wishing for confirmation in order to enjoy the friendship of the Supreme Concourse, they must exert themselves to confirm and strengthen this Covenant; for the making of a covenant, and an alliance for brotherhood and unity is like unto the irrigation of the tree of life which is conducive to eternal life! </p>

<p id='26.6'> Briefly, O ye friends of God! Make your feet firm, make a firm compact, and in union and accord endeavor to diffuse the fragrance of the love of God and to spread the divine teachings, in order that ye may impart life to the dead body of this world, and bestow a real healing on every one diseased (in soul). </p>

<p id='26.7'> O ye friends of God! The world is like the body of man — it hath become sick, feeble and infirm. Its eye is devoid of sight, its ear hath become destitute of hearing and its faculties of sense are entirely dissolved. The friends of God must become as wise physicians and care for and heal this sick person, in accord with the divine teachings, in order that — God willing — it may perchance gain health, find eternal healing and that its lost powers may be restored; and that the person of the world may find such health, freshness and purity that it will appear in the utmost beauty and charm. </p>

<p id='26.8'> The first remedy is to guide the people, so that they may turn unto God, hearken unto the divine commandments and go forth with hearing ear and seeing eye. After this swift and certain remedy hath been applied, then according to the divine teachings, they ought to <span data-pg='37'></span> be trained in the conduct, morals and deeds of the Supreme Concourse, encouraged and inspired with the gifts of the Kingdom of Abhá. The hearts should be purified and cleansed from every trace of hatred and rancor and enabled to engage in truthfulness, conciliation, uprightness and love toward the world of humanity; so that the East and West may embrace each other like unto two lovers, enmity and animosity may vanish from the human world and the universal peace be established! </p>

<p id='26.9'> O ye friends of God! Be kind to all people and nations, have love for all of them, exert yourselves to purify the hearts as much as you can, and bestow abundant effort in rejoicing the souls. Be ye a sprinkling of rain to every meadow and a water of life to every tree. Be ye as fragrant musk to every nostril and a soul-refreshing breeze to every invalid. Be ye salutary water to every thirsty one, a wise guide to every one led astray, an affectionate father or mother to every orphan, and, in the utmost joy and fragrance, a son or daughter to every one bent with age. Be ye a rich treasure to every indigent one; consider love and union as delectable paradise, and count annoyance and hostility as the torment of hell-fire. Exert with your soul; seek no rest in body; supplicate and beseech with your heart and search for divine assistance and favor, in order that ye may make this world the Paradise of Abhá and this terrestrial globe the arena of the Supreme Kingdom. If ye make an effort, it is certain that these lights will shine, this cloud of mercy shall rain, this soul-nourishing breeze shall waft, and the scent of this most fragrant musk be <span data-pg='38'></span> diffused. </p>

<p id='26.10'> O ye Friends of God! Be ye not concerned with the events transpiring at this Blessed Spot, and give no thought thereto. Whatever may happen is good, for calamities are bestowal itself, hardship is the reality of mercy, discomposure of mind, and sacrifice of like is a manifest gift. Whatever may happen is a bounty of God, the Most High. Be ye engaged in your own affairs; be employed in guiding the people; train the souls in the qualities and nature of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and convey the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of Abhá to the people. Do not seek rest during the night and day and sit not tranquil for a minute. Bring these glad-tidings to the hearing of mankind with the utmost exertion, and accept every calamity and affliction in your love for God and reliance on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Endure the censure of enemies and bear the reproaches of the people of oppression with patience. Follow the example of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and at every moment wish to offer yourselves in the path of the Beauty of Abhá. Shine ye like unto the sun and roar and move like unto the sea; impart life to mountain and desert like unto clouds, and similar to the vernal breeze, bestow freshness, grace and elegance on the trees of human temples. </p>

<p id='27.4'> I desire for you all that you will have this great assistance and partake of this great bounty, and that in spirit and heart you will strive and endeavor until the world of war become the world of peace; the world of darkness the world of light; satanic conduct be turned into heavenly behavior; the ruined places become built up; the sword be turned into the olive branch; the flash of hatred become the flame of the love of God and the noise of the gun the voice of the Kingdom; the soldiers of death the soldiers of life; all the nations of the world one nation; all races as one <span data-pg='40'></span> race; and all national anthems harmonized into one melody. </p>

<p id='27.5'> Then this material realm will be Paradise, the earth Heaven, and the world of Satan become the world of Angels. </p>

 <p id='28' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye Cohorts of God!  <a data-fnid='32'></a></p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn32'> Revealed in response to a supplication signed by 489 believers in America during the period of the 19-day fast in 1906. </aside>



 <p id='28.2' class='dropcap'> A letter which was signed by you in general was received. Its content was of the utmost beauty, sweetness, eloquence and perfection. While reading it the utmost happiness was produced. It spoke of fasting during the month of the Fast. Happy is your condition for you have executed the divine command; and have arisen to fast in these blessed days. For this physical fasting is a symbol of the spiritual fasting, that is, abstaining from all carnal desires, becoming characterized with the attributes of the spiritual ones, attracted to the heavenly fragrances and enkindled with the fire of the love of God. </p>

<p id='28.3'> Likewise your letter was an evidence of the union and affinity of the hearts. I hope that through the bounty and favors of the Most Glorious Lord, in this new age, the regions of the West become the East of the Sun of Truth, the believers of God become the dawning-places of lights, the manifestors of the signs, be protected and guarded from the doubts of the heedless ones, remain firm and steadfast in the Covenant and Testament, and strive day and night in order to awaken those who are asleep, to make mindful those who are heedless, to make confident of the mysteries of the Kingdom those who are deprived, to confer a <span data-pg='41'></span> share from the never-ending outpouring upon those who are helpless, to become the heralds of the Kingdom and to call the inhabitants of this terrestrial world to the Celestial Realm. </p>

<p id='28.4'> O ye Cohorts of God! Today in the present world each community is wandering in a wilderness, moving in accord with some passion and desire, and running to and fro in pursuance of his own imagination. Among the communities of the world, this community of the “Most Great Name” is free from every thought, keeping aloof from every project and scheme, arising with the purest designs and intentions, and striving and endeavoring with the utmost hope to live in accordance with the divine teachings in order that the surface of the earth become the delectable paradise, the nether world become the mirror of the Kingdom, the universe become another universe, and the human race attain to higher morals, conduct and manners. </p>

<p id='28.5'> O ye Cohorts of God! Through the protection and help of the Blessed Perfection — may my life be a sacrifice to His beloved ones! — you must conduct and deport yourselves in such a manner that you may stand out among other souls distinguished by a brilliancy like unto the sun. If any one of you enters a city he must become the center of attraction because of the sincerity, faithfulness, love, honesty, fidelity, truthfulness and loving-kindness of his disposition and nature toward all inhabitants of the world, that the people of the city may all cry out: “This person is unquestionably a Bahá’í; for this manners, his behavior, his conduct, his morals, his nature and his disposition are of the attributes of the Bahá’ís.” Until you do attain to this <span data-pg='42'></span> station, you have not fulfilled the Covenant and the Testament of God. For according to the irrefutable texts, He has taken from us a firm covenant that we may live and act in accord with the divine exhortations, commands and lordly teachings. </p>

<p id='28.6'> O ye Cohorts of God! Now is the time when the signs and the perfections of the “Most Great Name” become manifest and clear in this golden cycle in order that it may become demonstrated and established beyond doubt that this period is the period of the Blessed Perfection, and this cycle is distinguished from all other cycles and epochs. </p>

<p id='28.7'> O Ye Cohorts of God! If you observe that a soul has turned his face completely toward the Cause of God, his intention is centralized upon the penetration of the Word of God, he is serving the Cause day and night with utmost fidelity, no scent of selfishness is inhaled from his manners and deeds, and no trace of egotism or prejudice is seen in his personality — nay rather is he a wanderer in the wilderness of the love of God, and one intoxicated with the wine of the knowledge of God, occupied wholly with the diffusion of the fragrances of God, and attracted to the signs of the Kingdom of God; know ye of a certainty that he is confirmed with the powers of the Kingdom, assisted by the heaven of Might; and he will shine, gleam, and sparkle like unto the morning star with the utmost brilliancy and splendor from the horizon of the everlasting gift. If he is alloyed with the slightest trace of passion, desire, ostentation or self-interest, it is certain that the results of all efforts will prove fruitless, and he will become deprived and <span data-pg='43'></span> hopeless. </p>

<p id='28.8'> O ye Cohorts of God! Praise be to God! — that the Blessed Perfection hath freed the necks from the bonds and fetters and released all from the racial attachments by proclaiming, “Ye are all the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch.” Be ye kind to the human world, and be ye compassionate to the race of man, deal with the strangers as you deal with the friends, be ye gentle toward the outsiders as you are toward the beloved ones, know the enemy as the friend, look upon the satan as upon the angel, receive the unjust with the utmost love like unto a faithful one, and diffuse far and wide the fragrances of the musk of the gazelles of Kheta and Khotan <a data-fnid='33'></a> to the nostrils of the ravenous wolves. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn33'> Kheta and Khotan are two cities in China celebrated for having large numbers of musk-producing animals. The reference here symbolizes the severed and detached believers who are diffusing the fragrance of the Word of God. </aside>



 <p id='28.9'> Become ye a shelter and asylum to the fearful ones, be ye a cause of tranquillity and ease to the souls and hearts of the agitated ones, impart ye strength to the helpless ones, become ye a treasury of wealth to the indigent ones, be ye a remedy and antidote to the afflicted ones, and a physician and nurse to the sick ones. Serve ye for the promotion of peace and concord and establish in this transitory world the foundation of friendship, fidelity, reconciliation and truthfulness. </p>

<p id='28.10'> O ye Cohorts of God! Strive ye that this human world may be changed into a luminous realm and this mound of earth become the Paradise of Abhá. Darkness hath environed the world upon all sides. Savage tempers and inclination predominate. The human world has become the battlefield of the rapacious savages <span data-pg='44'></span> and the arena of the heedless and ignorant ones. The souls are either bloodthirsty wolves or beasts with degenerate reason. They are either deadly poison, or worthless plants. There are a few souls who in reality have some humanitarian intentions and are thinking of the well-being and prosperity of human kind. You must in this instance (that is, service to humanity) sacrifice your lives, and in sacrificing your lives celebrate happiness and beatitude. </p>

<p id='28.11'> O ye Cohorts of God! His Highness, the Supreme <a data-fnid='34'></a> — may my life be a sacrifice to Him! — hath given up His life, and at every moment the Blessed Perfection <a data-fnid='35'></a> in His own life sacrificed hundreds of lives, endured dire calamities and oppressions. Laden with fetters He was thrown into the dark dungeon, He was exiled and banished to distant lands and finally passed His days in the Most Great Prison.<a data-fnid='36'></a> Likewise a multitude of friends drank the sweet chalice of martyrdom and sacrificed soul, possession, family and relatives for the Cause. How many houses were overthrown! How many residences were pillaged and rapined! How many buildings were razed to the foundation and how many magnificent palaces were turned into a desolate tomb! All these phenomena transpired only that the world of humanity may become a luminous realm; ignorance be changed into wisdom, human souls become merciful, warfare and bloodshed be destroyed to their very foundation, and the Kingdom of Peace become paramount over all men. Now strive ye, that perchance this Beloved of Hopes appear in the assemblage of the world and this Providence become a <span data-pg='45'></span> realized fact. </p>

 <p id='28.12'> O ye Cohorts of God! Beware lest ye offend the feelings of anyone, or sadden the heart of any person, or move the tongue in reproach of and finding fault with anybody, whether he is friend or stranger, believer or enemy. Pray in behalf of all and entreat God for forgiveness and bounty for all. Beware, beware that any soul take revenge or retaliate over another even if he be a bloodthirsty enemy. Beware, beware that any one rebuke or reproach a soul, though he may be an ill-wisher and an ill-doer. Do ye not look upon the creature, advance ye toward the Creator. Behold ye not the rebellious people, turn your faces toward the Lord of Hosts. Look ye not upon the ground, raise your eyes to the world-illuminating Sun, which hath transformed every atom of the gloomy soil into bright and luminous substance. </p>

<p id='28.13'> O ye Cohorts of God! In the moment of catastrophe, find ye patience, resignation and submission. </p>

<p id='28.14'> The more the calamities are intensified the less become ye disturbed. Withstand ye, with perfect assurance, the flood of trials and calamities, through the power of His Highness, the Almighty. </p>

<p id='28.15'> Last year some of the known and unknown, friends and strangers, slandered, calumniated and presented false accusations against these exiled ones, before the throne of His Imperial Majesty, the Padeshah of the Ottomans; while these oppressed ones were entirely free from those calumnies. The government, conformable with prudent measures, arose to investigate these calumnies and dispatched some commissioners (or examiners) to this city. Therefore it is evident that the field which was found by the ill-wishers and the flood <span data-pg='46'></span> which was brought about by them, can neither be written nor explained. However, relying upon God, we conducted ourselves with the utmost patience and submission, resignation and calmness; so much that if one did not know anything about these matters, he would have thought that we were in perfect ease of soul, enjoying the tranquility of heart mind, and were engaged in happiness and felicity. The matters reached to such an issue that the plaintiffs and calumniators entered into alliance and intrigue with the officials, in regard to the carrying out of the work of investigation. Consequently, the plaintiff, the magistrate and the witness became as one single soul. Therefore it is clear what things transpired! But here one witnesses the fairness and impartiality of His Imperial Majesty, the Padeshah of the Ottomans, who so far has not given any consideration to these slanders, statements, stories and calumnies, but has dealt with the utmost justice and equity. Truly, I say, if there had been any other person except this Padeshah, no trace of these exiled ones would remain. This is the truth! We must not overlook justice. In reality today in the Asiatic world, the Padi<u>sh</u>áh of the Ottoman Empire and the <u>Sh</u>áh of Persia, Muẓaffar-i-Dín, are peerless and have no equals. If you could realize the degree of the malignity of the enemies, and the wickedness and mischief done by the ill-wishers, especially by the unkind brother, both here and in Persia, and that notwithstanding these seditions and villainies, these two kings have treated us with tranquillity and mildness, ye would undoubtedly feel sure that both are just. If they were like kings of bygone ages, unquestionably <span data-pg='47'></span> every day thousands of souls would have been deprived of life in Persia. Therefore pray ye earnestly in behalf of these two kings, beseech for them protection and confirmation in the threshold of the Almighty, and ask for them, from God, victory and triumph; especially for the Padeshah of the Ottoman Empire, who has dealt at all times in justice with these exiled ones. </p>

<p id='28.16'> O Thou Omnipotent God! Perfume the nostrils of the friends in the Occident with the breaths of the Holy Spirit; and illumine the horizon of the West with the light of guidance. Make the remote ones the near ones, change the strangers into compassionate friends, awaken those who are asleep, and make heedful those who are heedless. </p>

<p id='28.17'> O Thou Glorious Lord! Confirm and assist these noble friends with Thy good pleasure, suffer them to become the well-wishers of the known and unknown, enter them in the world of the everlasting Kingdom, confer upon them a share from the outpouring of the Realm of Might, make them real Bahá’ís and sincere godly ones, deliver them from superficiality and establish them in Truth, make them the signs of the Kingdom and brilliant stars in the horizon of the world, make them the cause of the prosperity and composure of the world of humanity and the servants of the universal peace, intoxicate all of them with the wine of Thy commands and exhortations and grant to all good morals and conduct in the path of Thy teachings. </p>

<p id='28.18'> O my God! The desire of this Servant of the Threshold is to see that the friends of the West have embraced the beloved of the East, and the individuals <span data-pg='48'></span> of the world of humanity are with the utmost kindness the members of one assemblage, the drops of one ocean, the birds of one rose-garden, the pearls of one sea, the leaves of one tree and the rays of one sun. </p>

 <p id='43' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art uttering the praise of God! </p>

<p id='43.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read thy letter, which expressed thy surprise at some of the commandments of the law of God, such as that concerning hunting of innocent animals. Be not surprised at this. Ponder over the contingent realities, their mysteries, wisdom, connection and relations. The world is harmonious in all things and the connection therein is mighty and nothing is missing. All things are eaters and eaten in the physical creation. The plant sucks from the mineral, the animal eats and swallows the plant, and human eats the animal. Then the mineral (in turn) eats the human body. Physical bodies are transferred from death to death and life to life. Therefore, all things are subject to transfer and change except the Cause of existence, which cannot be changed or transferred, because it is the foundation for life in all kinds and species and in all possible realities in the world of creation. </p>

<p id='43.3'> If thou observest closely through a microscope the water which man drinks and the air which he breathes, thou wilt see that in every breath which man breathes, that breath contains numerous animals, and in every draught of water great numbers of animals exist. This could not be prevented because the existent beings are eaters and eaten and, by this, existence is caused; otherwise, <span data-pg='56'></span> the relations between existent things would cease. When a thing decomposes and decays, being bereft of life, it becomes promoted to a world of life greater than the former. For instance, it ceased in a mineral life and was promoted to the vegetable life; then leaves the vegetable life and is elevated to that of the animal; then leaving the animal life it advances to the human, and this is on account of the favor of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement. </p>

<p id='43.4'> I ask God to strengthen thee in comprehending the mysteries deposited in the reality of existence, to lift up the veil from before thee and thy sister, so that the concealed mystery and the hidden reality become manifest as the sun at noon, and to confirm thy sister and thy husband in entering the Kingdom of God, and heal thee from all physical and spiritual disease in the world of creation. </p>

<p id='95.3'> How many souls advanced unto God, entered the shadow of the Word of God and became celebrated in the world, as Judas Iscariot. Then, when the tests became severe and trials great, their feet turned from the path; turned from confession to denial; changed from love and affection to severe enmity. Then the power of tests, whereby the foundations shake, were manifested. </p>

<p id='95.4'> Judas Iscariot was one of the greatest disciples, was called unto Jesus; he thought that Jesus increased his kindness to Peter, the disciple, when saying to him: “Thou art Peter; upon thee I shall build my church.” This speech affecting Peter with special impression whereby envy was created in the heart of Judas and, therefore, he turned after advancing, denied after confessing, hated after loving, until he became the cause of the crucifixion of the Glorious Lord and Manifest Light. This is the end of envy which causes people to turn from the right path. Such has taken place and will occur in this Great Cause; but there is no harm in it, as it is the cause of manifesting the firmness of the rest and the arising of the firm souls who are as solid as the lofty mountains in the love of the Manifest Light. </p>

<p id='95.5'> As to thee, convey unto the maid-servants of the Merciful that they must be firm in the love of El-Bahá at the time of the severe trials and tests; for as much as the storms and winds occur during the winter seasons; <span data-pg='89'></span> then comes the spring with the wonderful scenery and it adorns the hills and plains with flowers and beautiful birds sing the melodies of joy on the branches of the trees and warble beautiful tunes on the roofs of bowers, in wonderful melodies.

Then shalt thou see the waverers frightened and at loss. This is a complete matter on the part of the Lord of Signs. </p>

<p id='95.6'> Blessed art thou for keeping firm in the Cause of God. I pray God to give thee a divine spirit, spiritual blood and to make thee a growing and thriving leaf on the Tree of Life, so that thou mayest serve the maid-servants of God in fragrance and spirituality. </p>

<p id='95.7'> Thy generous Lord will confirm thee in serving in His great vineyard and will make thee an instrument for spreading the spirit of concord and union among the maid-servants of the Merciful, will open thine insight by the light of knowledge and forgive thee thy sins and change them to good deeds.

<p id='96.3'> Commit thyself to God; give up thy will and choose <span data-pg='90'></span> that of God; abandon thy desire and lay hold on that of God; that thou mayest be a holy, spiritual and heavenly example among the maid-servants of God. </p>

<p id='96.4'> O maid-servant of God! Know thou that in the sight of God, the conduct of women is the same as that of men. All are the creatures of God and He has created them after His form and likeness; that is to say, after the form and likeness of the Manifestations of His names and His attributes. >From the spiritual point of view, therefore, there is no difference between women and men. “The nearer we draw to God, the nearer He comes to us” without regard to whether the person be a man or a woman. How many women, thus drawn to God, have surpassed men in the shadow of Bahá in bringing men under it — women famous throughout the world! </p>

<p id='96.5'> The House of Justice, however, according to the positive commandments of the Doctrine of God, has been specialized to the men, for a (specific) reason or exercise of wisdom on the part of God, and this reason will presently appear, even as the sun at midday. </p>

<p id='96.6'> And as to you — you other maid-servants attracted by the perfume of God — establish spiritual gatherings (assemblies) and heavenly meetings. This work is the beginning of the diffusing of the perfume of God and the foundation of the elevating of the Word of God and the making known of the commandments of God. Is there a blessing greater than this? These spiritual gatherings (assemblies) are sustained (reinforced) by the Spirit of God, and their protector is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who spreads his wings (over) above them. Is there a blessing greater than this? These <span data-pg='91'></span> spiritual gatherings (assemblies) are glowing lamps and heavenly gardens which cast the light of knowledge upon the contingent world and cause the spirit of life to penetrate to every quarter.

 <p id='98' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who dear maid-servant of God! </p>

<p id='98.2' class='dropcap'> Thank God that thou hast come near unto the Holy Threshold and art dear in the Kingdom of His Glory. Thou art president of an assembly which is a type of the assemblages of the Supreme Concourse and a reflection of the semblances of the Kingdom of God. With heart and soul, with entire devotion, supplication, humbleness and submissiveness, endeavor to promulgate the law of God and strive to diffuse the fragrances <span data-pg='92'></span> of God. Exert yourself to become the real president of assemblies of spiritual ones and a companion of the Kingdom of the Merciful. </p>

<p id='98.3'> Thou hast asked in regard to the 10th verse of the 21st chapter of Revelation and to the 17th verse: </p>

<p id='98.4'> Know that the firmament of the bright sun of the world of possibilities is divided into twelve sections, according to mathematical principles, which are called the twelve constellations; likewise, the Sun of Truth manifests and pours forth His bounty in twelve constellations of holiness. By these constellations are meant holy souls who are the manifestations of purity and the dawning-points of the lights of Unity. Observe that in the day of His Holiness the Speaker of God (Moses), there were twelve holy souls who were the leaders of the Truth. In like manner, in the cycle of His Holiness the Spirit (Jesus Christ), note that there were twelve apostles under the shadow of the light of the Most High, and the Sun of Truth was manifested through those bright dawning-places like unto the phenomenal sun. Likewise, in the time of His Holiness Muḥammad, consider that there were twelve dawning points of holiness who were the manifestations of confirmation. Such is the case. </p>

<p id='98.5'> Accordingly, St. John, the divine, declared in his vision regarding the twelve doors and the twelve foundations. By the great and holy city of Jerusalem, which is descended from heaven, is meant the sacred law of God. This subject has been repeatedly explained in many Tablets and in the Scriptures of the ancient prophets. For example, it is said in one place: “I beheld Jerusalem marching on to the wilderness.” The purport <span data-pg='93'></span> is that this Heavenly Jerusalem has twelve doors through which the advancing souls enter into the City of God. These doors are the souls who are the stars of guidance and doors unto bounty and knowledge. “At the gates twelve angels stood.” By “angel” is meant the power of the confirmation of God; that the candle of the power of the divine confirmation shines forth and is illumined in those souls. That is to say, that each one of those souls will be confirmed by the mightiest power. Those twelve gates surround the whole universe. This signifies that all existence is under the shadow of those souls; also, that these doors are the foundation of the city of God, the divine Jerusalem; that upon each of the foundations the name of one of the Apostles of His Holiness the Spirit <a data-fnid='56'></a> is written. That is to say, the manifestation of the perfections, glad-tidings, virtues and high attributes of that holy soul. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn56'> Christ. </aside>



 <p id='98.6'> In brief, it is said that: “And he that talked with me had a golden rod to measure the city and the gates thereof and the walls thereof.” The purport is this, that certain souls guided (people) with a rod of the plant, that is, a reed wherewith he shepherded the sheep, like unto the rod of Moses; others trained (the people) with a rod of iron and drove them, as in the time of Muḥammad (The scepter of Muḥammad was the sword). In this Greatest Day the rod of the plant and the rod of iron are changed into a rod which is of pure gold and is from the end <span data-pg='94'></span> trained. Observe the difference: In a certain time the teachings of God were like unto the twigs of a tree and by them the signs of God were spread, the law of God promulgated and the religion of God founded. Later a time came when the rod of the divine Shepherd was like iron, and now in this blessed and glorious cycle that rod is become like unto pure gold. What a great difference exists between them! Therefore know that the law of God and the divine teachings prove a great advance in this day. They have reached a degree of supremacy, compared with former ages. Nay, rather, this is pure gold, while that was iron and wood. </p>

<p id='98.7'> This answer was written briefly because there was no more time. You will certainly excuse. The maid-servants of God must reach a station wherein they themselves shall comprehend the realities and meanings, to give clear explanations for each word and the fountains of wisdom gush forth from the reality of their hearts like a full flowing stream. </p>

Therefore, turn unto thy Supreme Lord and say: </p>

<p id='99.4'> O my God! O my God! This Thy maid-servant supplicates to Thee, trusts in Thee and directs herself unto Thee, asking Thee to shed Thy divine mercies upon her, to manifest Thy spiritual mysteries and to show forth Thy majesty unto her. O Lord! O Lord! Illumine the sight of my husband, cheer his breast by the light of knowing Thee, attract his heart unto Thy manifest Beauty and gladden his spirit by the manifestation of Thy radiant light. O Lord! Withdraw the veil from his sight, grant him Thy compassion, exhilarate him with the wine of Thy love among the people, make him an angel of Thine walking upon the earth, let his spirit soar unto heaven and make him a lamp glistening with the light of Thy knowledge in the community. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Precious, the Bestower! </p>

 <p id='108' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art advancing to the Kingdom of God! </p>

<p id='108.2' class='dropcap'> I have considered thy writing, which indicates brightness of heart and the love of God. Blessed art thou for having been thus favored and for having attained to guidance. </p>

<p id='108.3'> You have asked me two questions: “That if the same spirit is manifest in all the Manifestations and Prophets, then what is the distinction or difference between Christ (or rather Jesus) and the other Prophets; also [what is the difference] between Father and Son?” </p>

<p id='108.4'> Know that the human spirit is one, but it manifests <span data-pg='103'></span> itself in various members of the body in a certain (measure or) form. The human spirit is existent in the sight (eyes); it is also existent in the brain, which is the location of great functions and powers; it is also existent in the heart, which organ is largely connected with the brain or the center of the mind, and the heart, or that the center which is connected with the brain, has a distinct and separate function, effect and appearance. In this connection, the hair and the nails have no command (or direct feeling). </p>

<p id='108.5'> Figuratively speaking, the Father is the center of the brain and the Son is the center of the heart; the rest of the Prophets are members and parts. Fatherhood and Prophethood, in this case, are two expressions of the same thing, as man and creature are two names of the same reality. The word “man,” however, is greater than the word “creature” because it bears a weightier meaning than the name “creature”; both are the same. </p>

<p id='108.6'> O maid-servant of God! I pray God to confirm thee forever anew. Give greeting to thy dear mother. Superstition hath somewhat overcome her. When the imagined Satan overpowers, let her say: “Yá-Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” She should then turn to the highest Kingdom. Thus will the imagined Satan leave her. [She] has a form of obsession; therefore, you may not heed her sayings. </p>

<p id='108.7'> Cultivate the land and thus, through its fruits, you will obtain benefits. God will relieve you from care (on account) of your mother. </p>

<p id='108.8'> Give your good husband my spiritual greeting. I pray that he may be made a recipient of the divine bounties and attain to the grace <span data-pg='104'></span> of God. </p>

<p id='113.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, I read thy letter and I besought God to cause thee to promulgate His divine Manifestation, to be rejoiced at the bounty of His Kingdom, to adhere to His Testament, to hold fast to the hem of the robe of His grandeur, to exert thyself in His Cause, to desire the unity of His dearly beloved ones, and the harmony amongst His chosen ones and to endeavor to remove the doubts which are being emanated from deceitful souls. </p>

<p id='113.3'> By the might of my Lord, verily, the Lord will assist only those who will remain firm in His Cause, and desire union, love, humility and submissiveness, and to become separated from aught else save God.

<p id='113.4'> Exert thyself with all thy heart and soul and with all strength, so that thou mayest become a sign of firmness and as a banner of the Word of God which may wave on every lofty edifice through the favor of thy Glorious Lord. </p>

<p id='113.5'> As to thy question concerning the 12th chapter of Ecclesiastes: This is prophecy regarding the coming of Jesus in that book, the signs and marks of which were fulfilled with the appearance of the Promised One of the Bible <a data-fnid='61'></a>; but since the Jews did not understand the meaning thereof, so they denied Jesus and — <span data-pg='107'></span> God forbid! — said that He was the deformed (Antichrist). Then it is said by Jesus in the Gospel, that similar signs would appear in the “last day” — or in other words — in the day when Christ will come the second time in this world. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn61'> “Bible” signifies the Old Testament; “Gospel” signifies the New Testament. </aside>



 <p id='113.6'> The interpretation of these statements is mentioned in the clearest manner and with the most wonderful proofs in the Book of Íqán.<a data-fnid='62'></a> His honor, ‘Ali Kuli Khan, has already translated this Book which will soon be published in America.<a data-fnid='63'></a> Then you will be informed of the explanation and interpretation of these verses and statements as elucidated by the Blessed Perfection. Therefore my interpretation is not necessary. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn62'> During the time of Bahá’u’lláh’s residence in Baghdád (the Dwelling of Peace), men of learning, including Jews, Christians and Muḥammadans, visited Him seeking answer to religious and scriptural questions. Such answer He gave in the Book of Íqán, otherwise known as the Book of Explanations and Assurance. It concerns the Reality and Authority of the human Divine “Manifestations.” </aside>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn63'> The book was published in 1904. </aside>



 <p id='113.7'> As to thy question concerning the 54th chapter of Isaiah: This chapter refers to the Exalted Leaf, the mother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. As a proof to this it is said: “For more are the children of the desolate, than the children of the married wife.” Reflect upon this statement and then upon the following: ‘And thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.” And truly the humiliation and reproach which she suffered in the path of God is a fact which no one can refute. For the calamities and afflictions mentioned in the whole chapter are such afflictions which she suffered in the path of God, all of which she endured with patience and thanked God therefor and praised Him, because He had enabled her to endure afflictions for the sake of Bahá. During <span data-pg='108'></span> all this time, the men and women (nakazeen) persecuted her in an incomparable manner, while she was patient, God-fearing, calm, humble and contented through the favor of her Lord and by the bounty of her Creator. </p>

<p id='113.8'> As to thee — O thou who art confessing the Oneness of God! — rise with all thy power to keep firm in the Testament of God, and firmly believe that, verily, all troops are defeated save those of the Testament and all banners are reversed, save that of the Covenant of God, which will wave over all horizons and will overshadow the hosts of spirit, love and peace, while agitated by the breeze of the favor of God. Be thou of the number of this great host and among the vanguard of this great and powerful army. </p>

<p id='116.3'> Consider how there are thousands of heedless souls who are asleep, while there is one who is conscious and awake! Even a His Holiness Christ has said, the friends of God are the salt of the earth, and the salt is but a little part of the whole. Undoubtedly the friends of God have been endowed with ability and capacity, on which account they became of the “chosen” and not of the “called.” </p>

A prisoner who is awake and conscious will certainly seek for freedom, and mindful bird will certainly wish for deliverance from the cage. When the heart becometh free from attachment unto this world, it will crave for the world of the Kingdom and seek for eternal life. </p>

 <p id='124' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O visitant to the Resort of spirits (who are) sincere in the Religion of God!  <a data-fnid='65'></a></p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn65'> ‘Akká, Syria — the Holy Land. </aside>



 <p id='124.2' class='dropcap'> Blessed is the mother who bore thee and the breast whose milk suckled thee and the bosom wherein thou <span data-pg='115'></span> wert nurtured, because thou hast apprehended the Day of the Lord, hast prepared thyself to enter in unto His kingdom, hast set thy face singly toward His Gracious Countenance, hast believed in the Manifest Light, hast rejoiced in the Abundant Grace, hast responded to the Voice of thy Lord with a sincere and beating heart and hast presented thyself from those regions at the Glorious Threshold and hast marked thy forehead with pure, holy, fragrant Tomb,<a data-fnid='66'></a> the breaths of whose sanctity are spread abroad throughout the lands as fragrant musk is diffused unto the distant place! Then thank thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement, for this great salvation (or fruition, achievement, or attainment) and exceeding grace! </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn66'> The Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh. </aside>



 <p id='124.3'> Now as to what thou askest concerning the spirit and its “return” to this world of humanity and this elemental space: Know that spirit in general is divided into five sorts — the vegetable spirit, the animal spirit, the human spirit, the spirit of faith, and the divine spirit of sanctity. </p>

<p id='124.4'> The vegetable spirit is the virtue augmentative, or growing or vegetative faculty, which results from the admixture of the simple elements, with the co-operation of water, air and heat. </p>

<p id='124.5'> The animal spirit is the virtue perceptive resulting from the admixture and absorption of the vital elements generated in the heart, which apprehend sense-impressions. </p>

<p id='124.6'> The human spirit consists of the rational, or logical, reasoning faculty, which apprehends general ideas and things intelligible and <span data-pg='116'></span> perceptible. </p>

<p id='124.7'> Now these “spirits” are not reckoned as Spirit in the terminology of the Scriptures and the usage of the people of the Truth, inasmuch as the laws governing them are as the laws which govern all phenomenal being (i.e., all existences belonging to the phenomenal or material universe, called “the world of generation and corruption”), in respect to generation, corruption, production, change and reversion, as is clearly indicated in the Gospel where it says: “Let the dead bury their dead;” “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit”; inasmuch as he who would bury these dead was alive with the vegetative, animal and rational human soul, yet did Christ — to whom be glory! — declare such dead and devoid of life, in that this person was devoid of the Spirit of Faith, which is the Kingdom of God. </p>

<p id='124.8'> In brief, for these three spirits there is no restitution or “return,” but they are subordinate to reversions and production and corruption. </p>

<p id='124.9'> But the Spirit of Faith which is of the Kingdom (of God) consists of the all-comprehending Grace and the perfect attainment (or salvation, fruition, achievement) and the power of sanctity and the divine effulgence from the Sun of Truth on luminous light-seeking essences from the presence of the divine Unity. And by this Spirit is the life of the spirit of man, when it is fortified thereby, as Christ saith: “That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.” And this Spirit hath both restitution and return, inasmuch as it consists of the Light of God and the unconditioned Grace. So, having regard to this state and station, Christ announced that John the Baptist was Elias, who was to come before <span data-pg='117'></span> Christ (Matt. 11:14). And the likeness of this station is as that of lamps kindled (from one another): for these in respect to their glasses and oil-holders, are different, but in respect to their light, One, and in respect to their illumination, One; nay, each one is identical with the other, without imputation of plurality, or diversity or multiplicity or separateness. This is the Truth and beyond the Truth there is only error. </p>

<p id='124.10'> But as to the question of the Trinity, know, O advancer unto God, that in each one of the cycles wherein the Lights have shone forth upon the horizons (i. e., in each prophetic dispensation) and the Forgiving Lord hath revealed Himself on Mount Párán (see Habbakkuk 3:3, etc.) or Mount Sinai, or Mount Seir (see Ezekiel 35), there are necessarily three things: The Giver of Grace, and the Grace, and the Recipient of the Grace; the Source of the Effulgence, and the Effulgence, and the Recipient of the Effulgence; the Illuminator, and the Illumination, and Illuminated. Look at the Mosaic cycle: The Lord, and Moses, and the Fire (i.e., the burning bush), the Intermediary; and [at] the Messianic cycle: The Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost the Intermediary; and in the Muḥammadan cycle: The Lord, the Apostle (or Messenger, Muḥammad), and Gabriel (for, as the Muḥammadans believe, Gabriel brought the Revelation from God to Muḥammad). Look at the sun and its rays and the heat which results from its rays; the rays and the heat are but two effects of the sun, but inseparable from it; yet the sun is one in its essence, unique in its real identity, single in its attributes, neither is it possible that anything should <span data-pg='118'></span> resemble it. Such is the essence of the Truth concerning the Unity, the real doctrine of Singularity, the undiluted reality as to the (Divine) Sanctity. </p>

<p id='124.11'> But as to the question concerning the atonement on the part of the Holy Redeemer, I have explained this to thee by word of mouth in a plain and detailed manner, devoid of ambiguities, and I have made it clear to thee as the sun at noonday. </p>

<p id='124.12'> And I ask God to open unto thee the gates, that thou mayest thyself apprehend the true meanings of these mysteries. Verily, He is the Confirmer, the Beneficent, the Merciful! </p>

<p id='133.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read thy new letter and was informed of its meanings, which proved thy lowliness to thy Glorious Lord. </p>

<p id='133.3'> Verily we promised thee, by the favor of thy Lord, last year, that thy Lord would grant thee “sight of eyes” (i. e., a son), a blessed birth. Thanks and praise be unto God for that He granted thee a good descendant and dilated thy breast by this great bounty. It is incumbent on thee to offer many thanks to the Merciful Lord for this great favor in the world of humanity. Verily I implore unto God to make him a <span data-pg='123'></span> sign of His Kingdom, illuminated, spiritual and godlike among the children. </p>

  </div>

 <p id='136' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='136.2' class='dropcap'> I have seen the letter which thou hast written to Mr. ______. The opinion (expressed therein) was very agreeable. The spiritual Meeting of Consultation of New York must be in the utmost union and harmony with the Spiritual Meeting of Consultation of Chicago, and that which they deem advisable to publish, these two Meetings of Consultation must unitedly approve of it and deem its publication advisable. Then the Meeting of Consultation must send one copy thereof to ‘Akká, in order that it may be also approved of here and then returned, and that then it may be printed and published. </p>

<p id='136.3'> That the two Spiritual Meetings of Chicago and New York must be in unity and harmony is very important, and when a Spiritual Meeting may be also organized in Washington in a befitting manner, these two meetings (of Chicago and New York) must be also in unity and harmony with that meeting. </p>

<p id='136.4'> To be brief, it hath been decided by the Desire of <span data-pg='125'></span> God that union and harmony may day by day increase among the friends of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful One, in the West. Not until this is realized will the affairs advance by any means whatever! And the greatest means for the union and harmony of all is Spiritual Meetings. This matter is very important and is as a magnet (to attract or) for divine confirmation. If the beauty of this Divine Beloved One — that is, unity of believers — does appear in the ornament of the Kingdom of Abhá, it is certain that those countries will, in a short time, become the Paradise of Abhá and the light of Unity (or Oneness) and Singleness will shine upon the whole world from the West. We <a data-fnid='68'></a> are endeavoring with all heart and soul, have no rest night and day, nor a moment of tranquility, so that we may make the world of humanity the mirror of the divine unity; how much more the beloved of God! And this wish and hope shall appear and shine forth at that time when the true friends of God may arise and act in accord with the teachings of the Beauty of Abhá — may my life be a sacrifice to His beloved ones! One of the teachings is that love and faithfulness must prevail in the hearts that men may see the stranger as a friend, the sinner as an intimate fellow, may count enemies as allies, regard foes as loving comrades, call their executioner the giver of life, consider the denier as a believer and the unbeliever as a faithful one — that is, men must behave in such a manner as may befit the believers, the faithful, the friend and the confidant. If this lamp may shine in a befitting manner in the assemblage of the world you <span data-pg='126'></span> will find that the regions will become fragrant and the world become a delectable paradise, the surface of the earth will become an excellent garden, the world will become as one home, the different nations will become as one kind, and the peoples and nationalities of the East and West will become as one household. I hope such a day may come and such lights may dawn and such a Countenance may appear in the utmost beauty. </p>

 <p id='154' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O maid-servant of God! </p>

<p id='154.2' class='dropcap'> Thy letter was understood. Thou hast asked, very humbly, for certain things and all were worthy to be coveted. Thou desirest forgiveness of sins; didst ask for great unity and peace; sought nearness to the Threshold of God; hoped to be detached from thine own will, seeking the will of God; prayed for rescue from self-love (or selfishness); hoped for progress in <span data-pg='136'></span> the station of knowledge; desired to serve God; and prayed that thy honorable husband and thy children may be set aglow with the fire of the love of God and may manifest light on their brows through the radiance of the knowledge of God. All these wishes are well worthy of asking. <i>Especially the rescue from self-love</i>. This is a strange trait and the means of the destruction of many important souls in the world. If man be imbued with all good qualities but be selfish, all the other virtues will fade or pass away and eventually he will grow worse. </p>

<p id='154.3'> I hope the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful will be entirely freed from selfishness. Should this become their nature, they will indeed become manifestations of great bounties, and the doors of the divine grace will open. </p>

<p id='154.4'> Be thou grateful to Mrs. ______ for having led thee to the Straight Path and guiding thee to the Kingdom of God. If thou shouldst thank her a thousand times an hour, thou wilt fail to thank her sufficiently for the attainment. </p>

<p id='169.12'> Thou hast asked regarding the naming of children: When thou wishest to name a babe, prepare a meeting <span data-pg='150'></span> therefor; chant the verses and communes, and supplicate and implore the Threshold of Oneness and beg the attainment of guidance for the babe and wish confirmated firmness and constancy; then give the name and enjoy beverage and sweetmeat. This is spiritual baptism. </p>

<p id='169.13'> His honor, Mr. ______, Mrs. ______ and ______ arrived. They were attracted by the fragrances of God and ignited by the fire of the love of God. With a new spirit and fresh life they returned. </p>

<p id='169.15'> Strive so that the odor of violation cease and all come under the protection of the Covenant. </p>

<p id='169.16'> Remain in and about that town and know that trial is the cause of promotion. But thou must deal with all in the utmost love and do kindness. Although they lift up the head of pride, show thou greater humility and meekness and treat them with the utmost submission and lowliness. </p>

<p id='169.17'> Show the utmost kindness in my behalf to the near maid-servant of God (thy wife).... </p>

But every worldly transaction,<span data-pg='155'></span> although it be a gift through which the far and the near be profited, still it is transient and temporary and will not last for ages and its blessings will not extend successively to the righteous people in the ages to come. And as the heavenly abundance and the divine gifts and the omnipotent grace come in these days successively and uninterruptedly, therefore, thou shouldst establish a heavenly edifice to facilitate and level the way before the divine transaction, to carry out the divine order, to gladden the pure hearts of every one, to sanctify thyself from everything but God and to keep aloof from all the worldly things for the Cause of God; to be kindled with the fire of the love of God, to spread the fragrance of God and to expose thyself to the gentle breeze of God. </p>

<p id='180.2' class='dropcap'> I received thy letter and its contents caused the utmost joy and fragrance within me, because it showed thy firmness in the Cause of God and prove thy steadfastness in the love of the Word of God. Its meanings were the mystery of unity and its expression showed thy firm intention in serving the glorious Lord. </p>

<p id='180.3'> I beseech the Threshold of Unity with all humility and supplication to make thee confirmed in His service and to enable thee to be serviceable in the Holy Threshold; that thou mayest not be a moment at rest nor take a breath of composure; nay, rather to pass all thy life in this greatest gift and this supreme favor employed in diffusing the breath of God; that thy sincerity of heart, thy sanctity and purity may increase and that thou mayest become entirely separated from aught else save God.

The more the mirror is clear and pure the greater will the <span data-pg='158'></span> rays and the bounties of the Sun of Truth show forth from it. </p>

<p id='180.4'> As to those things published in journals against thee: Thou shouldst not be grieved nor sorry therefor, because thousands of journals have written traducing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, have given false and base accusations and awful calumnies. Notwithstanding these he was neither troubled nor grieved thereby; nay, rather these caused me to exert myself more than usual in the path of God and to drink the cup of sacrifice and to boil in the fire of His love. Man must seek to gain the acceptance of God and not that of the different classes of men. If one is praised and chosen by God, the accusation of all the creatures will cause no loss to him; and if the man is not accepted in the threshold of God, the praise and admiration of all men will be of no use to him. </p>

<p id='180.5'> By all these it is meant that thou must not be sorry and grieved because of these things the papers have written against thee; nay, rather trust in God and be unmoved by either the praise or the false accusations declared by people towards thee, depend entirely on God and exert thyself to serve His holy vineyard. All else save this is but imagination, though it be the praises of all people in thy behalf; because all else is of no result and bears no fruit. </p>

<p id='180.6'> As to thine action against the journal which hath libeled thee: It is not at all best to bring action against them, because there is no profit in doing that; nay, it will lead to more sayings of a similar nature. Under these circumstances silence is best. Thou must not be disappointed, sorry or grieved thereat; God will remove all these difficulties. If thou wilt employ thyself <span data-pg='159'></span> in the service (of the Cause of God) the past losses will be recovered and all the troubles will be settled. </p>

<p id='180.7'> This is the manifest truth. </p>

 <p id='187' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who hast arisen to render service to the Cause of God in His Great Vineyard! </p>

<p id='187.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, I have already written thee several letters, and sent them to thee at different times. Now, I address thee with such words whereby the souls of the proximate ones are rejoiced, and the faces of the sincere ones are cheered. </p>

<p id='187.3'> O my friend, verily the Cause is great and great, and the penetration of the Word of God in the temple (body) of all the regions is similar to the pervasion of the soul in a sound body. </p>

<p id='187.4'> By the life of Bahá, verily, the power of the Kingdom of God hath taken hold of the pillars of the world, and hath possessed all the nations. Thou wilt surely find the standards of the Testament waving in all regions, the chanting of the verses of unity raised in exalted assemblies, and the lights of the Sun of Truth and its heat dispersing the thick clouds massed on the horizon. Be rejoiced at this glad-tidings, whereby the hearts of the sincere among the beloved are cheered. </p>

<p id='187.5'> O my friend, isolate all thy faculties and senses from every other mention and thought, and follow the example of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in servitude to the Holy and Exalted Threshold. Hasten to the field of sacrifice, craving for the most great martyrdom; expend thy life and all of thy grades of love for God and in attraction to the Beauty of <span data-pg='165'></span> Abhá. </p>

<p id='187.6'> By God, the True One, man should seek only this bounty, inasmuch as it is everlasting, eternal, divine, spiritual, luminous and merciful. Be sanctified from all the universe, and send my greeting and praise to the spiritual leaf, the being who relies upon the grace of her Lord — the maid-servant of God, thy revered wife, and say unto her that she may address the veiled ones (those blind to the Truth), saying: “Verily, eyes are dazzled by gazing at the sun, and it is impossible to consider it because of the intensity of its rays; and verily the sea cannot be contained in a cup. The weakness of eyes does no harm to the sun, nor the smallness of the cup to the sea.” </p>

<p id='187.7'> Then let her explain to the people, and make known to every questioner, by saying: “Verily, minds are limited, and the splendor of lights is so great as not to be comprehended by (man’s) reflective faculties. Ye ought to have the sight of the heart so that ye may apprehend the reality of the mysteries of God which are deposited behind coverings.” </p>

 <p id='188' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who hast sought illumination from the Light of the Guidance of God! </p>

<p id='188.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read thy words of thanksgiving to God for that He hath directed thee to His Kingdom, illuminated thine insight with the light of guidance, and baptized thee with the water which hath descended from heaven, with the fire which was ignited in the Sinaitic Tree, and with the Holy Spirit which quickeneth hearts and souls. Then, thank thou God for this gift whereby thy face is shining amid the concourse of Chosen <span data-pg='166'></span> Ones. </p>

<p id='188.3'> Know thou, verily, man before reaching (spiritual) maturity passes his days and only apprehends trivial things which are clear on account of their exoteric indications, but when he attains full development, then he grasps the reality of things and their esoteric facts. Every day after maturity is equivalent to one year before it, on account of man’s perception, understanding, apprehension and discoveries. </p>

<p id='188.4'> Now, thou hast reached development and apprehended the degree of maturity: Gaze at the grades of the existence, the realities of beings, the allegories in the epistles of God, and the mysteries in the Old and New Testament. By the life of Bahá, the covering will be removed from off thee (i. e., facts will be unfolded to thee), and thou wilt be informed of that which all the philosophers and wise men are unable to apprehend. Verily, this is a gift which God assigns only to such of His chosen servants as He willeth. Verily, thy Lord will inspire thee with the mysteries of God, the Protector, the Self-subsistent. </p>

<p id='188.5'> Verily, I beseech the Lord of Hosts to increase thy faith each day over that of the previous day, to confirm thee through His Holy Spirit, to give thee capacity to partake of the lights of knowledge and wisdom, to make thee a herald of the Covenant in those regions, and to instruct thee in that which thou knowest not; so that thou mayest become a physician for bodies as well as souls, to heal bodies with the medicines which are useful and beneficial for physical (sickness), and to cure hearts and souls with that antidote which quickeneth hearts and souls. </p>

<p id='188.6'> O my friend, it is incumbent upon thee to be severed <span data-pg='167'></span> (from all else save God), to be attracted, to be sincere, and to spend thy life in the path of God. Be thou holy, spiritual, divine, lively, brilliant, godlike, sanctified, pure, with merciful character, firm in the Covenant, fluent and knowing; and gaze toward the Kingdom of Abhá with heart brimming over with the love of God, with tears flowing in the commemoration of God, with a face scintillating through the light of God, with a heart sincere to the beloved of God, and with a sword which divides truth from falsehood. By God, the True One, the Spirit of Bahá will assist thee with such strength that all the concourse of the earth will fail (to withstand). </p>

And when the heart is turned unto the Sun, then the eye will be opened and will recognize the Sun through the Sun itself. Then (man) will be in no need of arguments (or proofs), for the Sun is altogether independent, and absolute independence is in need of nothing, and proofs are one of the things (of which absolute independence has no need).

<p id='202' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art confident in the appearance of the Kingdom of God! </p>

<p id='202.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read thy letter, which was beautifully composed and which proved thy great love, the extent of thy knowledge and the illumination of thy sight, by witnessing the signs whereunto the heads bow in reverence and faces show respect. </p>

<p id='202.3'> O beloved! Thank God that He chose thee for His love and elected thy wife for the calling of the appearance of the Kingdom of God. Verily, this is a great favor, and wert thou aware of the results which will follow it in the Kingdom of God, thou wouldst, verily, rejoice exceedingly and wouldst call with loud voice: “Blessed are we for this great favor, and glad-tidings be unto us for this glorious attainment.” </p>

<p id='202.4'> Consider the past, so that thou mayest become informed of the mysteries which shall be disclosed in the future. When the disciples were calling in the name of Christ, the Jews scoffed, scorned and laughed at them. They were saying, “They (i. e., the disciples) are taken with madness, and madness is made an art.” They even beat them with whips, threw stones at them, prevented the people from approaching them, and were saying, “This man (Christ) is naught but a sorcerer, blasphemeth God and is possessed of a devil.” </p>

<p id='202.5'> Then observe how that persecution and scorn were changed to glory, honor and reverence. Ultimately, they (the Jews) honored their sublime stations and acknowledged their loftiness, which was exalted, promoted and glorified in the center of the horizons until it reached the degree of exaggeration in deeds. They <span data-pg='176'></span> made for them likenesses and pictures, decorated with jewels shining in the eyes; thy placed these likenesses or pictures in the temples, churches and monasteries built on the tops of the mountains, and worshipped them with respect, glory, majesty and reverence. This is the condition of the neglectful ones who are deprived of the Truth (the Manifestations of God) at the day of their existence among them. After the ascension of their (the prophets’) spirits unto the Center of Purity and Piety, then the negligent ones repent and return, making likenesses and pictures according to their own ideas, which do not bear resemblance, and worship the same. This is the station of the ignorant ones who are as animals, following every croaker and shaken by every wind. “Forsake them to play in their shallow waters.” </p>

<p id='202.6'> As to thee: Be happy because of what thy Lord, the Clement, the Merciful, hath given thee; choosing thee and thy esteemed wife for entrance into His Kingdom, for calling in His name, praising Him in assemblies, gatherings and meetings. </p>

<p id='202.7'> The truth I verily say unto thee, this divine grace cannot be exchanged for the sovereignty of the earth, the east or the west. For that (the worldly kingdom) is naught but dreams, torture to the spirit, trouble for the hearts; its mortality is certain and its destruction a well known fact — while this spiritual kingdom and divine grace will shine, and it is an Abhá (Glorious) jewel which will glisten on the diadems of great glory in the course of centuries and <span data-pg='177'></span> cycles. </p>

    <h3 class='sectionnum'> — 226 — </h3>
  </div>

 <p id='226' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art advancing toward the Divine Kingdom! </p>

<p id='226.2' class='dropcap'> What thou hast written was understood and noted. Thou hast asked concerning the station of this servant. The station of this servant is servitude to the Holy Threshold (Bahá’u’lláh) and I glory and honor in this. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the standard of the divine love, the sign of the gift of God, the servant of the assemblage of the merciful ones, the light of the meeting of the spiritual ones. He is the orb of peace and reconciliation and the light of love in the world of humanity. He is the herald of the Kingdom of the Merciful One and the promulgator of the religion of rectitude and security. <i>This is the station of this servant! This is the Truth</i>! </p>

<p id='226.3'> I hope through the divine grace that the brilliancy of the love of God will pervade all regions, and that he will remove warfare and strife from the world of existence. Then the human world will become expressive of the unity of the merciful world, the inferior world will become a clear and purified mirror reflecting the Supreme Concourse, the East and West will embrace each other like unto two longing ones and the North and South will shake hands and clasp each other <span data-pg='192'></span> in the arms like unto two beloved ones. <i>This is the station of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá</i>. </p>

<p id='226.4'> As to the light thou dost witness: It is not an earthly light (phenomenal); nay, rather, it is a heavenly light. It cannot be seen by the sight; nay, rather, it is perceived by the insight. </p>

<p id='226.5'> As to the resurrection of the body of Christ three days subsequent to His departure: This signifies the divine teachings and spiritual religion of His Holiness Christ, which constitute His spiritual body, which is living and perpetual forevermore. </p>

<p id='226.6'> By the “three days” of His death is meant that after the great martyrdom, the penetration of the divine teachings and the spread of the spiritual law became relaxed on account of the crucifixion of Christ. For the disciples were somewhat troubled by the violence of divine tests. But when they became firm, that divine spirit resurrected and that body — which signifies the divine word — arose. </p>

<p id='226.7'> Likewise the address of the angels to the people of Galilee, “That this Christ will return in the same way and that He will descend from heaven,” is a spiritual address. For when Christ appeared, He came from heaven, although He was outwardly born from the womb of Mary. For He said: “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven.” </p>

<p id='226.8'> He said: “I came down from heaven and likewise will go to heaven.” By “heaven” is not meant this infinite phenomenal space, but “heaven” signifies the word of the divine kingdom which is the supreme station and seat of the Sun of Truth. </p>

<p id='226.9'> To be brief: The mysteries of the Holy Books are <span data-pg='193'></span> many and require explanation and elucidation. I hope thine insight will be so opened that the divine mysteries may become manifest and clear. </p>

<p id='228.3'> Know thou that the Messianic Spirit and the out-pouring of the Holy Spirit is always manifest, but capacity and ability (to receive it) is more in some and less in others. After the crucifixion the apostles had not in the beginning the capacity and ability of witnessing the Messianic reality. For they were agitated. But when they found firmness and steadfastness, their inner sight became opened, and thy saw the reality of the Messiah as manifest. For the body of Christ was crucified and vanished, but the Spirit of Christ is always pouring upon the contingent world, <span data-pg='194'></span> and is manifest before the insight of the people of assurance. </p>

<p id='228.4'> O thou seeker of the kingdom of God! If thou wishest thy speech and utterance to take effect in the hardened hearts, be thou severed from all attachment to this world and turn unto the Kingdom of God. Enkindle the fire of the love of God in the heart with such intensity that thou mayest become a flame of fire and a luminous lamp of guidance.

<p id='231.2' class='dropcap'> The letter which thou hast written was perused and its contents were noted. Thou hast written concerning spiritual hearing and insight. The insight (or inner perception) is a correct sight, for it never blundereth. But the outward sight doth err (or misjudgeth); it seeth the mirage as water, considereth the revolving flame as a circle, imagineth the images reflected in a mirror as a reality and judgeth huge bodies as small ones, from a remote distance. There are many evidences as to the blundering of the sight; but the insight apprehendeth the reality and discovereth the mysteries. </p>

<p id='231.3'> As to the difference between inspiration and imagination: inspiration is in conformity with the Divine Texts, but imaginations do not conform therewith. A real, spiritual connection between the True One and the servant is a luminous bounty which causeth an ecstatic (or divine) flame, passion and attraction. When this connection is secured (or realized) such an ecstasy and happiness become manifest in the heart that man doth fly away (with joy) and uttereth melody and song. Just as the soul bringeth the body in motion, so that spiritual bounty and real connection likewise moveth (or cheereth) the human <span data-pg='196'></span> soul. </p>

<p id='231.4'> As to truthful dreams: I beg of God that thy inner eye (insight) may be so opened that thou mayest thyself differentiate between truthful and untruthful dreams. </p>

I am weak: favor me with power and strength, so that I may be a maid-servant in Thy Threshold, with perfect purity and sanctity; sacrifice myself unto Thee, be quit of myself and seek Thee, walk in the path of Thy good pleasure, speak Thy secret and witness the signs of Thy Oneness wherever I look.

 <p id='241' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art esteemed in the Threshold of the Almighty! </p>

<p id='241.2' class='dropcap'> Praise thou God, for that thou hast found the Light of Guidance, recognized the Lord of the Kingdom, art engaged in the service of the Divine Garden and hast guided a number of souls and led them to the Kingdom of Existence. When thou occupiest thyself with all thy strength in service, thou wilt become a magnet of attraction and cause every seeker to reach the presence of the Desired One; thou wilt raise a great clamor in the world and evince such an ecstasy and rapture that will astonish the minds. </p>

<p id='241.3'> Send my loving greeting to those souls whom thou hast guided unto the divine kingdom and say unto them: “Ye must appreciate Miss. ______. Move your tongues in thanksgiving and be obliged for her great effort; for she gave you to drink the wine of guidance from the cup of the love of God and led you to the kingdom of lights. Were you to thank her for many years as a reward for this guidance, ye will not be able to repay your obligation for this <span data-pg='204'></span> gift.” </p>

<p id='241.4'> Thou hast written concerning the Impersonality of the Divinity. Personality is in the Manifestation of the Divinity, not in the Essence of the Divinity. The reality of the divine world is purified and sanctified from limits and restriction. But the pure Mirror, which is the Manifestor of the Sun of Truth and in which the Sun of Truth is manifest in full appearance — that mirror is restricted, not the lights. The soul pervadeth throughout the whole body, and its commands are effective in all the parts and limbs of man. Notwithstanding its utmost sanctification (or abstraction) this soul is manifest and evident in all its grades, in this material form. By seeing God is meant beholding the Manifestation of Himself; for witnessing the sun in its entire splendor, in a clear glassy surface, is identical with witnessing the essence of the sun itself. </p>

<p id='241.5'> When the souls of the sincere depart (from this body), then their unreal vision (i. e., seeing) is changed into a vision of reality. Even as man, when in the age of babyhood and imperfection, though he seeth things, yet that vision is superficial and external. But when he reacheth the world (or age) of perfection and becometh endowed with reasoning faculty and (the power of) discrimination and comprehension, then that vision of his is a vision (i. e., seeing) of reality <a data-fnid='93'></a> and not the unreality. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn93'> Insight. </aside>



 <p id='241.6'> It is evident that the divine nearness is an unlimited nearness, be it in this world or the next one. This is a nearness which is sanctified from the comprehension of the minds. The more a man seeketh light from the Sun of Truth, the nearer he will draw. For <span data-pg='205'></span> instance, a clear body is near unto the sun, and a black stone is far from the sun. This nearness dependeth upon clearness, purity and perfection and that remoteness is due to density, dullness (or obscurity) and imperfection. </p>

<p id='241.7'> As to the question whether the souls will recognize each other in the spiritual world: This (fact) is certain; for the Kingdom is the world of vision (i. e., things are visible in it), where all concealed realities will become disclosed. How much more the well-known souls will become manifest. The mysteries of which man is heedless in this earthly world, those will he discover in the heavenly world, and there will he be informed of the secret of truth; how much more will he recognize or discover persons with whom he hath been associated. Undoubtedly, the holy souls who find a pure eye and are favored with insight will, in the kingdom of lights, be acquainted with all mysteries, and will seek the bounty of witnessing the reality of every great soul. Even they will manifestly behold the Beauty of God in that world. Likewise will they find all the friends of God, both those of the former and recent times, present in the heavenly assemblage. </p>

<p id='241.8'> As to the difference and distinction between Lazarus and that “rich man”: The first was spiritual, while the second was material. One was in the highest degree of knowledge and the other in the lowest depths of ignorance. The difference and distinction will naturally become realized between all men after their departure from this mortal world. But this (distinction) is not in respect to place, but it is in respect to the soul and conscience. For the Kingdom of God is sanctified <span data-pg='206'></span> (or free) from time and place; it is another world and another universe. But the holy souls are promised the gift of intercession. And know thou for a certainty, that in the divine worlds, the spiritual beloved ones (believers) will recognize each other, and will seek union (with each other), but a spiritual union. Likewise, a love that one may have entertained for any one will not be forgotten in the world of the Kingdom. Likewise, thou wilt not forget (there) the life that thou hast had in the material world. </p>

<p id='241.9'> O thou maid-servant of God! Hold fast to the Most Strong Handle <a data-fnid='94'></a> and be thoroughly attracted to the Kingdom of Abhá, until thou mayest at every instant find a new confirmation and attain to a wonderful gift and become a cause for the guidance of souls. </p>

  </div>

 <p id='242' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who hast attained to Truth! </p>

<p id='242.2' class='dropcap'> I beg of God that the divine light which is spoken of in the Twelfth Chapter of John may shed its rays upon thee forever, so that thou mayest always be in light. The life of man in this world is short and will soon draw to an end. Consequently one must appreciate (or count as gain) every breath (or moment) of his life and endeavor in that which is conducive to eternal glory. </p>

<p id='242.3'> Thou hast written concerning the shining assembly of Washington (D. C.): This caused me great joy, for that assemblage is a rose-garden of mysteries and very sweet fragrances are being inhaled from it. I hope that through the sincerity of heart of the friends and maid-servants of God, that assembly will continue and <span data-pg='207'></span> be extended (or grow) day by day, will increase in luminosity every moment and that the members of that assembly will make extraordinary progress in the Divine Threshold. </p>

<p id='242.4'> If the health and well-being of the body be expended in the path of the Kingdom, this is very acceptable and praiseworthy; and if it is expended to the benefit of the human world in general — even though it be to their material (or bodily) benefit and be a means of doing good — that is also acceptable. But if the health and welfare of man be spent in sensual desires, in a life on the animal plane, and in devilish pursuits — then disease is better than such heath; nay, death itself is preferable to such a life. If thou art desirous of health, wish thou health for serving the Kingdom. I hope thou mayest attain a perfect insight, an inflexible resolution, a complete health and spiritual and physical strength in order that thou mayest drink from the fountain of eternal life and be assisted by the spirit of divine confirmation. </p>

<p id='242.5'> Say unto ______: “Thou art sowing pure seeds, but that soil (wherein the seeds fall) is full of useless plants, weeds and rubbish. Therefore the seeds are wasted. Consequently, come and sow those seeds in a pure, sweet and fertile soil, in order that they may vegetate, become fresh and verdant and form into heaps on heaps of harvest.” </p>

<p id='242.6'> Send my greeting to ______ and say unto her: “The sun is in the utmost effulgence but the surface turned toward it must be a mirror; the clearer and purer it is, the more lights shall be reflected therein.” </p>

<p id='242.7'> Send my loving greeting to his honor ______ and <span data-pg='208'></span> say unto him: “Do not miss the opportunity. Now is the springtime and the bounty of heaven is pouring on earth and the fields and rose-gardens are in growth and development. Exert thyself as much as thou canst, in order that through this everlasting bounty and the sprinklings of the clouds of the divine gift, thou mayest grow and thrive like unto a fruitful tree, with the utmost freshness and purity.” </p>

<p id='242.8'> That matter (or substance) which is the cause of the moderation and perfection of the body is that perfect moderate temperament which is produced by the organization and admixture of constituent elements; that matter (or substance) is material (or physical) not spiritual. But reason, which comprehends (or detects) the realities of things, is a spiritual reality, not physical (or material). Therefore the animal is deprived of reason, and it (reason) is specialized to mankind. The animal feeleth realities which are perceptible to the senses, but man perceiveth intellectual realities (or things perceptible to reason). Consequently, it hath become evident that reason is a spiritual faculty, not physical (or material). </p>

<p id='242.9'> The Holy Land is not tranquil in these days.<a data-fnid='95'></a> Consequently, let thy presence (or coming) in the Holy Land depend on some other time. Endeavor night and day in serving the Cause of God; this service is real visit, and this is meeting, itself. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn95'> Revealed in 1903. </aside>



 <p id='242.10'> Deliver my greeting to each one of the friends of God and maid-servants of the Merciful with the utmost love. </p>

<p id='242.11'> That blessed name which thou hast asked to remain <span data-pg='209'></span> with thee forever and become the cause of spiritual progress — that name is “Aseyeh,” which is the name of the mother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. I give the blessed name to thee. Be therefore in the utmost joy and happiness, and be engaged in all gladness and attraction (or ecstasy) for thou hast become the object of such a favor. </p>

I beg of God that thou mayest always enjoy spiritual nearness and ever be rejoiced. Reveal thou (or teach thou) the Word of God; be not grieved at the people’s lack of hearing.

 <p id='252' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='252.2' class='dropcap'> Thy letter was received. Thou hast written regarding thy trip to the Holy Land. God willing, this desire of thine will be realized. </p>

<p id='252.3'> The name Aseyeh is acceptable in the Threshold of Oneness, for the daughter of Pharaoh had this name, who, when (Moses) the Light of Guidance dawned, became confirmed by the Merciful One, left the court of Pharaoh with its grandeur and sovereignty and became perfumed with the fragrances of holiness. Then she assisted in the service of His Holiness (Moses) — upon him be peace! Also, Aseyeh was the name of my mother. </p>

<p id='252.4'> Thou hast written that thou lovest the Bible. Undoubtedly, the friends, and the maid-servants of the Merciful should know the value of the Bible, for they are the ones who have discovered its real significances and have become cognizant of the hidden mystery of the Holy Book. <span data-pg='219'></span> ... </p>

<p id='252.5'> Deliver my greeting to ______ and say: “I supplicate God that thou mayest gladden and rejoice the heart of ______ with the melody of the Kingdom, rend asunder the veil of her concealment, enlighten her face with the light of the Most Great Guidance and make her eyes see and her ears hear.” </p>

<p id='252.6'> Say on my behalf to the maid-servant of God, ______, “The end of every (material) work is without result, because it is perishable and inconstant, but the first (real) work is attraction to the fragrance of God, enkindlement with the fire of the love of God, reading the verse of Unity and beholding the lights from the Dawning-place of Mystery.<a data-fnid='101'></a> After that cometh the training of the soul, purification of character and service to humanity. If thou art able to accomplish any one of these, the result is eternal and the fruit everlasting.” </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn101'> i. e., as the sun rises out of the darkness. </aside>



 <p id='252.7'> Thou hast written regarding thy coming to the Holy Land; do not hasten, for then thou mayest travel with comfort. It would be better not to resign from the school, nay rather, avail thyself of the opportunity during vacation time which is in the season of summer, and present thyself in this land; because thy presence in that school is fruitful. Thou shalt finally study the Persian language.... </p>

 <p id='255' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou herald of the Kingdom! </p>

<p id='255.2' class='dropcap'> Thou wast not alone in the trip thou didst undertake in various places. The spirit and soul of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was with thee. Although thou hast been afflicted with many and severe persecutions, hast heard derision, scorn and contempt and observed the opposition of the heedless ones, yet this is conducive to thy glory, that thou hast been made a target for the arrow <span data-pg='221'></span> of opposition in the Path of God and hast drunk the cup of affliction. Consider this, how many a calamity was submitted to by those sanctified souls in bygone ages and to how many sufferings they were resigned! Thou also must endure dire oppression and ordeals in the Path of Abhá and maintain the feet of steadfastness and firmness. Then thou shalt behold the confirmation of God surrounding thee. Rejoice thou and be happy that thou hast attained to this station and walked in the footsteps of the holy souls. </p>

<p id='255.3'> Announce on my behalf longing greeting to Mr. ______ and say, “The melody of the Kingdom is that which hath caused the motion of the universe; the musk-diffusing fragrance of the rose-garden of God is that which hath perfumed the nostrils; and the reflection of the Sun of Truth is that which hath illumined the whole earth. Now is the beginning of illumination! Therefore, the people of darkness imagine that they can oppose (this Revelation); yet, ere long they shall find themselves in loss and consternation! They shall observe that the power of the Word of God hath subdued East and West. Be thou not sad and dispirited on account of the opposition of the heedless ones. Soon they shall regret sorely. Reflect thou how the Pharisees persecuted and looked down in contempt upon His Holiness the Christ. The result was that His lamp became ignited, His light began to shine and His followers sparkled like unto the stars from the horizon of existence; and the consequence to the Pharisees was the pangs of remorse and regrets.” </p>

<p id='255.4'> Convey, also, greeting to the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ______ and say, “Thy house is the nest and <span data-pg='222'></span> the shelter of this heavenly bird. Undoubtedly, thou must enkindle the lights of the Kingdom therein.” </p>

<p id='255.5'> Likewise convey respectful greeting on my behalf to Mrs. ______ and say, “I ask of God that thy house may become the gathering-place of the spiritual ones and the assembly of the godly ones; that the light of Truth may shine therein and make it brilliant and resplendent.” </p>

<p id='255.6'> Also convey longing greeting to Mr. ______ and say, “Those souls who, in the time of His Highness Christ, turned their faces toward the Kingdom and quaffed the wine of guidance from the cup of the Word of God, had their troubles changed into everlasting bliss. No matter how much they heard the rebuke of the heedless ones, observed the censure of the relatives, were afflicted with the injury of the oppressors and thrown into abjection, yet that ignominy finally became eternal glory. Thou must show the utmost love and kindness towards the heedless ones and the oppressors and ask from God forgiveness and pardon for them, for they are ignorant. if they understood, they would not oppress; nay, rather would they arise (to serve the Cause) with faithfulness.” </p>

<p id='255.7'> Announce, also, respectful greeting from me to Mrs. ______ and Mr. ______ and say. “The sons of the Kingdom are scattered throughout the whole world, but the ignorant Pharisees have arisen with the utmost hatred instigating persecutions. They imagine that persecution and suffering will hinder the promulgation of the Cause; whereas no rampart is able to obstruct the descent of the waves of the Most Great Sea; no veil can conceal the rays of the Sun of Truth; no wall can stay <span data-pg='223'></span> the wafting of the Divine Breeze; and no power is able to resist the Spirit of God. Be ye not sad nor dejected on account of the disturbance and uproar of the people of desire and passion. Ere long the symphony of the Kingdom shall silence all the other noises. Rest ye assured and illumine your house with the lights of divine commemoration.” </p>

<p id='255.8'> Give my greeting to Mr. ______ and announce to him, “Caiaphas and Annas were the colossal pillars of the Mosaic Dispensation in the day of His Highness the Spirit; but as they did not acknowledge the Word of God, they fell from the apex of glory to the bottom of the pit of the greatest abasement. But Peter was a catcher of fish; as he turned his face toward the Word of God, the fame of his imperishable, deathless and immortal glory encircled East and West; and he found in the sovereignty of the Kingdom, eternal and everlasting majesty. It is the same in these days.” </p>

God willing, thou wilt bring them out of the nether world, with the net of the love of God, into the immensity of the Kingdom. Those brilliant stars which thou hast beheld are the children of the Kingdom. That brilliant crescent is the Cause of God. The appearance of His Highness <span data-pg='226'></span> Christ and His white robe and resplendent light in His blessed face is the proof of the power and the promulgation of the Word of God in America. </p>

Where is the throne of David, the Glorious? Where is his iron rod? Where are his innumerable hosts? Where are his attacking armies? Where are the angels of heaven? Where do we see justice of government existing among people and even among beasts and insects? Where is his great majesty? Where is his power, which shaketh heaven and earth? Is not this a claim of one who is bewildered and wandering amidst valleys and hills? Doth he not ride upon an ass, while on his head there is a crown of thorns and he is despised?” </p>

 <p id='285.2' class='dropcap'> In these times thanksgiving for the bounty of the Merciful One consists in the illumination of the heart and the feeling of the soul. This is the reality of thanksgiving. But, although offering thanks through speech or writings is approvable, yet, in comparison with that, it is but unreal, for the foundation is spiritual feelings and merciful sentiments. I hope that you may be favored therewith. But the lack of capacity and merit in the Day of Judgement does not prevent one from bounty and generosity, for it is the day of grace and not justice, and to give every one his due is justice. Consequently, do not look upon thy capacity, nay, rather, look upon the infinite grace of the Bounty of Abhá whose grace is comprehending and whose bounty is perfect. </p>

Thank thou God for that thou hast had such a revelation in the world of dreams. </p>


 <p id='285.5'> As to the fact that man must entirely forget himself, by this is meant that he should arise in the mystery of sacrifice and that is the disappearance of mortal sentiments and extinction of blamable morals which constitute the temporal gloom, and not that the physical health should be changed into weakness and debility. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn113'> To the West Hoboken assembly. </aside>

 <p id='320.2' class='dropcap'> Blessed are ye, for ye have removed the covering; witnessed the lights of the Sun of Truth which is shining from the horizon of bestowal; are attracted by the fragrances sent forth from the garden of the Kingdom; have arisen to praise the Lord of Grandeur and Might, and have resolved to disseminate the teachings of God in those vast and extensive regions! </p>


 <p id='320.3'> Truly I say unto you! Verily, ye have cast away superstitions; have partaken an abundant portion from that Reality which is shining upon all regions; have perceived the manifest signs, have entered the ark of salvation and attained unto eternal life, under the shadow of the Lord of Hosts, gazing unto the Most Honorable Station, enkindled with the fire ablaze in the tree of existence, in the spot of Sinai; responding to the call of the Clement One, severed from the world, and yearning for the place of sacrifice in the path of Bahá. </p>


 <p id='320.4'> You will surely hear from this call a ringing voice in the regions. Then the nations will awake to this effulgence and hasten unto the fountain of the Covenant; so that they may drink fresh and salutary water from the grace of your Lord, the Clement. </p>


 <p id='320.5'> At that time, the faithful shall be cheered, the sincere shall rejoice and the yearning ones shall be drawn unto the unseen world, the Kingdom of your Lord, the Merciful! </p>


 <p id='320.6'> O ye beloved of God and His chosen ones! Trust <span data-pg='274'></span> ye in the divine confirmation, the merciful bounty and the supreme bestowal. Verily, He will confirm your hearts, dilate your breasts, make your tongues fluent and will rejoice your souls by a grace from the Compassionate Merciful One! </p>


 <p id='320.7'> O ye beloved of Bahá! Do not look at your weakness, nay, rely upon the confirmation of the Holy Spirit. Verily, It maketh the weak strong, the lowly mighty, the child grown, the infant mature and the small great. </p>


 <p id='320.8'> I beg of God that He may make you diffusers of His fragrances, servants of His Cause, gazers unto His Face, speakers in His praise, and that He may protect you against tests and trials, so that ye may become shining lights, beaming stars, gleaming lamps and lofty trees. Verily, this is not difficult with God! </p>


 <p id='320.9'> Verily, I hope from God that ye may become my associates in servitude to His Holy Threshold and my partners at the entrance of the Door of His Oneness; so that ye may equally serve in His great vineyard. Then thank ye your Lord, for He hath favored you with this manifest success. By God, the true One! this cannot be equaled either by the dominion of the world or by the gift of ruling over all regions with pomp, glory and power! Reflect ye upon the chosen ones of God in the earlier ages! How their worth was unknown during their days; how they were known by people as but ordinary individuals and unimportant persons! Afterwards, their arguments appeared, their lights scintillated, their stars beamed, their trees became lofty, their mysteries gleamed forth, their fruits were praised, their reservoirs became overflowing, their gardens <span data-pg='275'></span> adorned, their birds warbled and their joy became perfect in the Kingdom of their Beneficent Lord. </p>


 <p id='320.10'> O my God! O my God! These are souls who have advanced toward Thy Kingdom; their breasts dilated by supplicating to Thy Realm of Might; their eyes anticipating the descent of Thy mercy; and their spirits rejoiced at Thy grace and gift! </p>


 <p id='320.11'> O my God! O my God! Guard them by the eye of Thy protection, preserve them in the cave of Thy defence, deliver them from the grade of the contingent world, protect them during the violence of tests and trials, and assist them by a power from the breath of Thy Holy Spirit, in the world of existence! Verily, Thou art the Beneficent, the Mighty, the Clement! </p>

Take the cup of the love of God in thy right hand and with thy left hand hoist the banner of universal peace, love and affection among the nations of the earth. Call out (saying): “Hasten! Hasten unto the Great Bounty! Press! Press forward unto the Abundant Mercy! Speed! Speed unto the Manifest Light! Be urgent! Be urgent for the Great Attainment! Verily, by God the Truth, the doors of the Kingdom are opened, the lights of God have shown forth and illumined the horizon of the earth! The Lord of Hosts hath descended with the army of lights and angels of heaven and depressed the armies of darkness! He sent His angels to all directions, with a call of the trumpet of realities and meanings, instructions and teachings! Therefore, O people of the earth, appreciate the opportunity, in this new century, wherein the lights have been revealed by the Glorious Lord!” </p>


 <p id='332.6'> In regard to the school which thou didst think of and its organization: I ask God that thou shouldst become confirmed in it with all order and command. But now it is necessary first to organize the Cause of God in those countries; then, order and preparation. Therefore arise, through a power from God, in organizing the Cause of God — that is, the diffusion of the fragrances of God, promotion of the Word of God and heralding unto the nations and peoples with a pre-existent power the appearance of the Most Great <span data-pg='289'></span> Sun. </p>

 <p id='333' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God! </p>

 <p id='333.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read thy excellent letter and was dilated through its excellent contents. Know thou that the distance of habitation doth not prevent the rising of the lights, and that time and place only control the bodies and not the spirits which are free from the contingent beings, nor (do they control) the realities which are sanctified from the stains of the world. When the Spirit is breathed in the East, its signs immediately appear in the West and it hath a spiritual dominion which penetrates the pillars of the world. </p>


 <p id='333.3'> Then know thou that God hath not ordained any greater happiness and joy than the removing of the veils by witnessing the Kingdom of God and presenting oneself in an assembly which is radiant with merciful emotions which cannot be apprehended by minds and thoughts. </p>


 <p id='333.4'> O maid-servant of God! Verily opposition will wax fierce upon thee and denial and unbelief will day by day increase. People will arise to oppression and people will torment thee for thou hast believed in God, art attracted to the fragrances of God and hath spoken His praise among the maid-servants. They will execrate, revile, curse and oppress thee with acute tongues. Be not distressed at this; nay, rather continue with an increased firmness and staunchness in the Cause of God. For through calamity the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is attracted; through (suffering) oppression the breast of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is dilated; through enduring afflictions the faithfulness of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is proven; through imprisonment the soul of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is <span data-pg='290'></span> cheered; at every moment he wishes to quaff the cup of sacrifice in the path of God. </p>


 <p id='333.5'> O maid-servant of God! Opposition shall surely pass away, the dark clouds in all regions will be dispelled and the lights of the Covenant shall shine forth. At that time your value shall appear among the nations of the world and tribes and people will arise to praise you. Take warning by the former cycles and the bygone Manifestations. </p>


 <p id='333.6'> O maid-servant of God! Verily the Cause is great and great! Regiments and regiments enter therein! Some people must necessarily turn their backs upon it, on account of their lack of sincerity in the Cause of God and for their selfishness and egotism. </p>


 <p id='333.7'> O maid-servant of God! A pure sea doth not accept a dead body, therefore the waves will necessarily throw the dead finally upon the shores. </p>


 <p id='333.8'> O maid-servant of God! When some souls turn away from the love of God, there is no harm therein. Did not Judas Iscariot, the chief of the apostles, turn away on account of jealousy for Peter the apostle? Likewise, some people must necessarily turn away on account of jealousy for others. </p>


 <p id='333.9'> As to thee: Consider the predecessors as a warning to posterity and purify thy heart from all else save God, under all circumstances. When thou wast in ‘Akká we pointed this out to thee. </p>


 <p id='333.10'> O maid-servant of God! Whenever sorrows and afflictions grow violent toward thee, remember that which we told thee during thy presence in these lands; then thy sorrows shall be removed and thy heart shall <span data-pg='291'></span> become dilated through the fragrances of God in these days. </p>


 <p id='333.11'> Be thou rejoiced at the glad-tidings of God! Be as a globe of fire from which the heat of the love of God will be diffused. Sanctify thyself from the grades of this world, be purified from the superstitions of people and be characterized with spiritual qualities. Be thou a mountain of quiescence, a sign of meekness, a sea of patience, a light of love, a standard of utter separation (from all else save God), so that thou mayest become everlasting in the Kingdom of God. </p>


 <p id='333.12'> The light shall surely encompass the maid-servants who are attracted by the fragrances of God and it will shine forth from their faces upon all regions. </p>


 <p id='333.13'> O maid-servant of God! Let thy joy and happiness be increased every moment through the light of God. </p>


 <p id='333.14'> Verily, the Exalted Leaf and the brilliant Leaves <a data-fnid='118'></a> remember thee by night and day. Then know thou, verily the prison is my wonderful paradise in love for Bahá; it is my lofty stronghold, my impregnable mansion and glorious throne. Be not grieved thereat, nay, rather beg of God to make me quaff the cup of sacrifice in the path of Bahá. </p>

Verily she is attracted to the word of her Lord, was dilated by <span data-pg='293'></span> hearing the speech of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at the time of meeting and her eyes became consoled by witnessing the signs of her Mighty Lord. </p>


 <p id='334.7'> As to the maid-servant of God ______: God hath indeed favored her with an excellent disposition which is like fragrance from a garden of the Merciful and she passeth her days in serving the Cause of God. I beg of God to confirm and assist her under all aspects and circumstances. </p>


 <p id='334.8'> As to the son of the “Mother of the Faithful”: I beg of God to make his ears attentive, his eyes observing, his heart abounding with the lights of guidance and to make his soul as one of the signs of his Mighty Lord. Pray ye in his behalf night and day that God may strengthen him in a matter which may shine, beam and glow in the niche of the Kingdom of God and that He may cause him to arise and assist the pious ones, to seek bounty from the signs, to gain illumination from the lights, to deliver the necks of all men from the chains of superstition, to feed the needy ones upon the food of the Kingdom of God and support the weak ones with a penetrative power from the Word of God. Verily the Lord is the Confirmer! </p>

 <p id='365' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou who doest believe in the Spirit of Christ, in the Kingdom of God! </p>

 <p id='365.2' class='dropcap'> The body is composed, in truth, of corporeal elements and every composition is necessarily subject to decomposition; but the spirit is an essence, simple, pure, spiritual, eternal, perpetual and divine. He who seeketh Christ from the point of view of His body hath, in truth, debased Him and hath gone astray from Him; but he who seeketh Christ from the point of view of His Spirit will grow from day to day in joy, attraction, zeal, proximity, perception and vision. </p>


 <p id='365.3'> Thou hast then to seek the Spirit of Christ in this marvelous day. The heaven whither Christ ascended is not an infinite space. His heaven is much rather the kingdom of His Lord, the Munificent. As He said, “The Son of Man is in heaven.” It is known then that His heaven is beyond the boundaries that surround existence and that He is elevated for the people who adore. </p>


 <p id='365.4'> Pray God to ascend to this heaven, to taste of its food — and know thou that the people have not understood to this day the mystery of the Holy Scriptures. They believe that Christ was deprived of His heaven when He was in this world, that He had fallen from the heights of His elevation and that later He ascended to this elevated pinnacle — that is to say, towards the heaven <span data-pg='317'></span> which doth not exist, for there is only space. They expect that He will descend from this heaven seated upon a cloud. They believe that there is in the heavens a cloud upon which He will be seated and by which He will descend; while, in reality, the clouds are vapors which rise from the earth and which do not descend from the heavens. The cloud mentioned in the Holy Scriptures is the human body, because it is a veil for them, like a cloud, which prevents them from seeing the Sun of Truth which is shining in the horizon of Christ. </p>


 <p id='365.5'> I pray God to open before your face the gates of revelation and of vision in such a way that thou shalt learn the mysteries of God in this known day. *** </p>

This period of time is the Promised Age, the assembling of the human race to the “Resurrection Day” and now is the great “Day of Judgment.” Soon the whole world, as in springtime, will change its garb. The turning and falling of the autumn leaves is past; the bleakness of the winter time is over. The new year hath appeared and the spiritual springtime is at hand. The black earth is becoming a <span data-pg='319'></span> verdant garden; the deserts and mountains are teeming with red flowers; from the borders of the wilderness the tall grasses are standing like advance guards before the cypress and jessamine trees; while the birds are singing among the rose branches like the angels in the highest heavens, announcing the glad-tidings of the approach of that spiritual spring, and the sweet music of their voices is causing the real essence of all things to move and quiver. </p>


 <p id='368.3'> O my spiritual friend! Dost thou know from what airs emanate the notes sung by those birds? They are from the melodies of peace and reconciliation, of love and unity, of justice and security, of concord and harmony. In a short time this heavenly singing will intoxicate all humanity; the foundations of enmity shall be destroyed; unity and affection shall be witnessed in every assembly; and the lovers of the love of God at these great festivals shall behold their splendor. </p>


 <p id='368.4'> Therefore, contemplate what a spirit of life God hath given that the body of the whole earth may attain life everlasting! The Paradise of Abhá will soon spread a pavilion from the pole-star of the world, under whose shelter the beloved shall rejoice and the pure hearts shall repose in peace. </p>

 <p id='372' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou faithful maid-servant of God! </p>

 <p id='372.2' class='dropcap'> What thou hast written me hath been seen. Indeed thou belongest to the Kingdom and thou turnest towards the Horizon of Abhá. I ask from the bounty of God that thou mayest be enflamed day by day more and more by the fire of the love of God. </p>


 <p id='372.3'> It seems that thou wast uncertain whether to occupy thyself in writing or in delivering the tidings of the Cause of God. In these days, to deliver the glad-tidings is the best of all. Open then thy tongue to the guidance of the human race on any occasion that presents itself. </p>


 <p id='372.4'> Thou hast asked about knowledge and cognition. Read the divine books and tablets and look into the books of proofs that have been written in presenting <span data-pg='322'></span> this Cause. One of them is the Book of Íqán,<a data-fnid='128'></a> which is translated into English. There is also the book <a data-fnid='129'></a> by Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl and there are others written by the believers. In the time to come, many divine books and tablets will be translated and thou wilt read them; but thou mayest ask God that thou mayest attract divine knowledge by the magnet of the love of God. When the soul becomes sanctified in every condition and becomes pure and holy, then the door of the divine knowledge will be opened to the face. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn128'> During the time of Bahá’u’lláh’s residence in Ba<u>gh</u>dád (the Dwelling of Peace), men of learning, including Jews, Christians and Muḥammadans, visited Him seeking answer to religious and scriptural questions. Such answer He gave in the Book of Íqán, and otherwise known as the Book of Explanations and Assurance. It concerns the Reality and Authority of the human “Divine Manifestations.</aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn129'> “The Bahá’í Proofs.” </aside>

 <p id='372.5'> Thou hast written about the dear maid-servant of God, Mrs. ______ That one attracted unto God is indeed always occupied in the service and she doth her utmost to spread the divine lights; if she continueth in the same way there will be great results in the future. That which is of the greatest importance is to have firmness, steadfastness and constancy. </p>


 <p id='372.6'> I pray God that through the desires and the efforts of the maid-servants of the Merciful the foot of the mountains by the ocean’s shore <a data-fnid='130'></a> will be enlightened by the brilliancy of the love of God in such a way that its light may be transmitted all over the world. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn130'> Refers to California and the Pacific coast. </aside>

 <p id='372.7'> You ask if, through the appearance of the Kingdom of God, every soul hath been saved. The Sun of Reality hath appeared to all the world. This Luminous Appearance is salvation and life; but only he who hath opened the eye of reality and who hath seen these lights will be <span data-pg='323'></span> saved. </p>


 <p id='372.8'> You also ask about the eventual victory of spirituality in this Bahá’í age. It is certain that spirituality will overcome materiality and that the divine will have the victory over the human; it is also true that by divine education souls in every condition of existence will be elevated, except those that are blind, deaf, dumb and dead. How can such souls comprehend the light? The sun lighteth up all the dark world, but the blind man hath no portion in its brilliancy; the cloud of mercy poureth forth streams of water, but the sterile land will never produce plants and flowers. </p>


 <p id='372.9'> Give my greetings to the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ______ and to her daughter. I pray God to assist them and to help them, that their meeting day by day will grow brighter and that their hearts will be more and more attracted. </p>

 <p id='386' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God and steadfast in the Covenant of God! </p>

 <p id='386.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read thine eloquent letter, the composition of which was beautiful, words excellent and significances interesting, and I thanked God that He hath chosen certain souls for His knowledge and love, deposited in their hearts His mysteries, manifested from their faces <span data-pg='333'></span> His lights and made them the signs of His Kingdom, the banners of His majesty, the trees of His paradise and the birds of the garden of His holiness. </p>


 <p id='386.3'> O thou, my honorable friend! Verily I scented the fragrance of meekness and humbleness from the orchard of the meanings of thy letter and was caused to rejoice, smile and be made glad that God hath made thee humble and submissive to His beloved. Verily this is the greatest bounty from God and by it the breast of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is dilated in this remote prison. </p>


 <p id='386.4'> O friend! Verily the prison is my paradise and the chains my necklace; my balance (or testing) is my redemption (or salvation) and the castle is my fortified safety, for this imprisonment is in the path of my Lord and it is my salvation, my joy, my gratitude and happiness. Verily, in calamity the face of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá shineth and through hardship joy is attained by this servant in all conditions. </p>


 <p id='386.5'> O thou friend! Be not sorrowful because of my imprisonment and lament not for my difficulties; nay, rather ask God to increase my hardship in His path, for therein lies a wisdom which none are able to comprehend save the near angels. </p>


 <p id='386.6'> O thou friend! Verily, those among the friends who were martyred in the path of God — verily this is a favor from God which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He chooses; verily God is the most bountiful! — they attained what the holy ones in the Supreme Kingdom yearned for, and quaffed the wine of grace from the bountiful hand of thy Lord the Merciful — may my spirit be a sacrifice to <span data-pg='334'></span> them! </p>


 <p id='386.7'> Therefore, be not sorrowful, for in it is a great bounty for them and by it (martyrdom) the fire of the love of God is increased in glowing, the Word of God in spreading, the standard of God in elevation, the fragrances of God in diffusion, and by this blood the tree of peace is watered, the orchard of unity and harmony pruned, and by it the fragrances of holiness emanate from the Tree of Life and are being diffused in the world. Verily this is from the mercy of God, which is bestowed upon whomsoever He wishes. </p>


 <p id='386.8'> O friend! I implore to God to make thee a banner of the banners of the Kingdom, firm and steadfast, unshaken by the most severe winds of tests and trials in this terrestrial world; to confirm thee in the servitude of the Sublime Threshold; to guide through thee many souls and to make thee a sign of meekness and humbleness before the beloved of God, the Mighty, the Protecting! </p>

    <h3 class='sectionnum'> — 389 — </h3>
  </div>

 <p id='389' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou honored friend! </p>

 <p id='389.2' class='dropcap'> Verily the sight of providence is far reaching and the divine glance is perfect. Thou hast always been a recipient of favors and the object of the bounty of the glorious Beauty of Abhá. I trust in God that thou mayest be thus aided by Him to serve His Cause and so shine as a luminous star in the horizon of His Kingdom, an illumining candle burning in the assemblage of the Bahá’ís; that thou mayest be confirmed by a power of the Kingdom and attain divine bounty and providence. </p>


 <p id='389.3'> As to the question of women being chosen rather <span data-pg='336'></span> than men: In this cycle there were men who arose through a divine power and who shone forth as the sun from the dawning-point of holiness; and, likewise, there appeared certain women who became side by side with men. The expression which you quote, “Every woman who is directed to the guidance of God in this great age, will surpass men in every respect,” signified that, in this age, certain women will appear who will surpass some men. It does not mean that they will surpass all the men who have given their lives as sacrifices in this Cause; for in this wonderful cycle there appeared such men as his holiness Quddús, his holiness Bábu’l-Báb, his holiness the “King of Martyrs” and his holiness the “Beloved of Martyrs,” his holiness the great Vaḥíd,<a data-fnid='135'></a> and such ones who have no equals in the world of existence. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn135'> All martyred in Persia. Quddús, in the city of Bárfurú<u>sh</u>; Bábu’l-Báb, in Ṭabarsí; King of Martyrs and Beloved of Martyrs, both in Iṣfahán; Vaḥíd, in Nayríz. </aside>

 <p id='389.4'> If, in the letters to the maid-servants of the Merciful, there hath been written in the sense of encouragement (that from which such meanings can be inferred), the purport is that some women in this wonderful age have surpassed some men, and not that all women have surpassed all men. The members of the House of Spirituality must give unlimited encouragement to women. In this age, both men and women are in the shadow of the Word of God. Whosoever endeavors the most will attain the greatest share, be it of men or of women, of the strong or of the weak. </p>


 <p id='389.5'> As to the matter of teaching and the choosing of men, the letters which I have written to the Spiritual Meeting (House of Spirituality) of which you are a <span data-pg='337'></span> member, will answer this question wand will manifest the station of men who remain firm in the Covenant of God. Refer to them. </p>


 <p id='389.6'> As to the number of Tablets to women, this is due to the fact that most of the letters which come to the Holy Land are from women. Rarely do letters come from men and, naturally, to women the most are written. Men are enjoined more than women to give the Message of the Cause of God and to diffuse His fragrances. </p>


 <p id='389.7'> My dear friend! If thou didst know how dear thou art to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, thou wouldst spread wings, and through excess of joy, soar and begin teaching all that country. </p>


 <p id='389.8'> As to the question: “Whither shall we turn in our prayers?” There is an appointed center toward which one must direct himself in prayer, but at present this center is not unfolded because of wisdom. In its time this shall be announced. At present, in those regions, you should direct yourself, as formerly, to the East. The appointed and certain center will be announced in its time. </p>


 <p id='389.9'> You also ask: “To whom shall we turn?” Turn to the Ancient Beauty. If it be the will of God, the blessed likeness (of the Manifestation) will be sent in its proper time, so that, in the world of the heart, thou mayest direct thyself to that holy likeness and thus be saved from imagination and phantasy. However, in the Temple (Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár) the blessed picture must never be placed (or hung) on the wall. This you should know. </p>


 <p id='389.10'> As to the subject of babes and infants and weak ones <span data-pg='338'></span> who art afflicted by the hands of oppressors: This contains great wisdom and this subject is of paramount importance. In brief, for those souls there is a recompense in another world and many details are connected with this matter. For those souls that suffering is the greatest mercy of God. Verily that mercy of the Lord is far better and preferable to all the comfort of this world and the growth and development of this place of mortality. If it be the will of God, when thou shalt be present this will be explained in detail by word of mouth. </p>

 <p id='393' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou herald of the Kingdom! </p>

 <p id='393.2' class='dropcap'> Thank God that thou didst come to the holy shrine, put thy head upon the holy dust, reached the gathering-place of the spiritual ones, became a member of the assembly of the Merciful, found friendship with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and with the utmost love and joy spent a few days there.

I hope that, with a divine strength and a god-like personality, with a heavenly guidance, with a divine attraction and with a spiritual zeal, thou wilt educate the people. </p>


 <p id='393.3'> O thou, the firm one in the Covenant! Give my respectful greeting to they honored wife and say to her from me: “The Jewish people were expecting the manifestation of Jesus and were at the same time attracted to Moses. When His Holiness Christ appeared, they (the Jewish people) thought that holy personality intended to take away the eternal honor of Moses. Moses, in the eye of Israel, had no equal. Now, these had never thought that a greater than him (Moses) would appear. So this way of thinking became the cause of their being kept away from the Light of Christ and they were prevented from the precious things of the Holy Spirit, notwithstanding the fact that the greatest friend of Moses was Christ and He made His Holiness Moses great in the eye of the world and made Him to be glorious in the contingent world; whereas, even now, Israel (that is, the Jews) deny His Holiness, the promised Christ, and count Him to be <span data-pg='342'></span> an enemy of His Holiness Moses and of Aaron and David; and they were kept away from the bounties of Christ. They think that no other great person like Moses could ever come upon the earth and if such a person should be sent (by God), he must come under the shadow of His Holiness Moses and promulgate the law of the Torah. This negligence on the part of the Jews became the cause of keeping away a multitude from the heavenly bounties and from the beneficence of the Holy Spirit for nineteen-hundred years. </p>


 <p id='393.4'> “The Sun is ever the same, but the place whence the Sun hath appeared hath changed. Then, at Christ’s time, it appeared in the sign of Aquarius, but now it hath manifested itself from the sign of Cancer. These signs are just for an illustration. The sun is the same sun, no matter from what sign it may manifest itself or from what spot it may arise. Thou must look at the Sun; do not become veiled by the places from which the Sun appears.” </p>


 <p id='393.5'> O Mr. ______! Likewise instruct and give my love to thy dear son and say: “O dear one of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! Be the son of thy father and be the fruit of that tree. Be a son that hath been born of his soul and heart and not only of the water and clay. A real son is such an one as hath branched from the spiritual part of a man. I ask God that thou mayest be at all times confirmed and strengthened.” </p>


 <p id='393.6'> O thou servant of Bahá! Thou hast asked regarding the political affairs. In the United States it is necessary that the citizens shall take part in elections. This is a necessary matter and no excuse from it is possible. My object in telling the believers that they should not <span data-pg='343'></span> interfere in the affairs of government is this: That they should not make any trouble and that they should not move against the opinion of the government, but obedience to the laws and the administration of the commonwealth is necessary. Now, as the government of America is a republican form of government, it is necessary that all the citizens shall take part in the elections of officers and take part in the affairs of the republic. </p>

 <p id='395' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

 <p id='395.2'> The letter, which thou hast written to his honor Mírzá ______, was considered. </p>


 <p id='395.3' class='dropcap'> Be thou happy! Be thou happy! that thou hast put aside rest and composure; that thou hast traveled through and visited different states and endured innumerable inconveniences so that thou might diffuse the fragrances of mysteries and perfume the nostrils of the spiritual ones. When thou wert engaged in the service of the Cause, thou wert my partner in all trials and difficulties. Thou hast been my associate and companion and both of us were intoxicated and exhilarated with the wine of the love of God. </p>


 <p id='395.4'> Praise be to God that thou hast been confirmed in the service and I have likewise been assisted in visiting the Holy Threshold. In one day <a data-fnid='136'></a> the world hath become another world and the chains and manacles of prison and incarceration have been broken to pieces, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá hath attained to the meeting of the Holy Threshold. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn136'> July 24, 1908, the day of the proclamation of a constitutional government in Turkey, and the freeing of all political prisoners and exiles. </aside>

 <p id='395.5'> Although in prison, I have experienced the utmost joy and fragrance, the heart was attracted, the spirit rejoiced, the eyes turned toward the Kingdom of God and the tongue mentioning the Name of the True One and displaying the utmost effort and endeavor in the promotion of the Word of God and the diffusion of the fragrances of God; yet, under all difficulties, there <span data-pg='345'></span> have been no shortcomings, nor hath there been any lack of enthusiasm. The call hath been raised uninterruptedly and the fragrances of holiness have been diffused through all regions and empires. </p>


 <p id='395.6'> In the meeting that had been organized in Los Angeles the rays of the Sun of Truth shone forth, making it an assembly of illumination. The house of Mr. and Mrs. ______ became the nest and shelter of the birds of the Kingdom, and the house of Mrs. ______ and the residence of Miss. ______ in Pasadena became the gathering-place of the Merciful and the rose-garden of realities and significances. I supplicate from the bounty and favor of His Highness the Almighty to assist those holy souls by the invisible confirmations and that they be helped by the providence and grace of His Highness the One. </p>


 <p id='395.7'> Convey on my behalf longing greeting to the brother of Mr. ______ and say: “Praise God that thou hast followed in the footsteps of thy respected brother, associated with him and become his confidant.” </p>


 <p id='395.8'> Likewise announce my longing greeting to the assemblies of Oakland and San Francisco. The houses of Mrs. ______ and Mrs. ______ have become the place of reading the divine verses and the nests of the nightingales of the heavenly orchard. A sweet fragrance hath reached the spirit and soul from those assemblies. </p>


 <p id='395.9'> Praise be to God, that in all cities the believers have met thee with the utmost attraction and thy shining face and joyful disposition became the cause of the enkindlement of the fire of their souls and hearts. Undoubtedly thou shalt also make a trip to Green <span data-pg='346'></span> Acre. </p>

 <p id='395.10'>  The utmost joy was produced by the news of the purchase of the ground for the erection of the Temple. I hope that ere long they may lay the foundation.</p>

 <p id='395.11'> Deliver on my behalf divine glad-tidings to the assembles in Seattle, the members of the houses of Mrs. ______ and Mrs. ______ and the assemblies in Portland and Denver and say: “O ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom! Be ye thankful that although the light of guidance hath dawned from the East, yet, praise be to God, it illuminated both the East and the West! In order that glorification and thanks may be shown for these bounties, the word and actions must be in accordance with the advices and behests of His Highness Bahá’u’lláh. Thanks does not depend upon words but upon deeds!” </p>

 <p id='398' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O ye two revered persons, ye servants in the vineyard of God!  <a data-fnid='139'></a></p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn139'> To two members of the Chicago assembly. </aside>

 <p id='398.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, I read your letter and was informed of its contents filled with spiritual attractions and thanked <span data-pg='349'></span> God — glorified is He! — for His grace and His merciful bestowals. </p>


 <p id='398.3'> It behooveth you to be the first assistant to the Word of God, the first servant of the Cause of God and the first one to withstand the spreaders (of false rumors) who say that which they know not, who calumniate God, well knowing that they are calumniators and that they, themselves, have contrived the thing for their own sakes, and evil is that which they do. </p>


 <p id='398.4'> Remember what the Pharisees published concerning Jesus, attributed to Him and said about Him and how they oppressed Him until they paraded Him in Jerusalem in such a form as made the angels of sanctity to weep in the Sublime Kingdom. They put on His head a crown of thistles; nay, more, they cast dust in His face — into a face whereby the heaven and the earth is illuminated! They turned their backs upon Him, then bowed and said: “Peace be unto thee, O King of kings! Peace be unto thee, O King of the Jews!” </p>


 <p id='398.5'> Of the same class are the Pharisees and priests in this manifest day. “Leave them to amuse themselves with their vain discourse.” They are as people deluded by their temptations and are isolated from the gifts of your Lord, the Clement, the Merciful. “They are deaf, dumb and blind; therefore, they will not understand.” </p>


 <p id='398.6'> Verily, I, through the grace of my Lord, have never heeded these souls, even to reading their articles, inasmuch as their articles signify no other than the buzzing of flies to the hearing of an eagle, or the croaking of a frog of the material world to the ears of the leviathan of the sea of the Kingdom. Is it to be considered as <span data-pg='350'></span> anything? No, by no means! Verily, the eagle soareth high in the supreme apex while the flies rumble in the lowest rubbish. </p>


 <p id='398.7'> But it is incumbent upon you to block them up as a stone with decisive arguments before which heads are bowed and voices are made humble. God will strengthen you therein. You will surely find these Pharisees in manifest loss. Can one ever prevent the waves of the sea of the Lofty One from rolling? Or is it possible for me to restrain the fragrances of sanctity from diffusion? Or can one withhold the sun from casting its rays to all regions? No, by no means! Nay, rather such souls make the table sent down from heaven unlawful unto themselves. </p>


 <p id='398.8'> How is the bat to be compared with the most great orb which bestows bounty upon all regions! How is the gnat to be compared with the eagle soaring in the spacious firmament! How are Caiaphas and Annas to be compared with the Christ mounted on the clouds with great power and glory! </p>


 <p id='398.9'> Thank God that He hath opened your insight to the Light which is shining from the Supreme Concourse and caused you to witness His most mighty signs. By my life! the hearts of the people of Bahá are cheered with such gifts! </p>

Pay not the slightest attention to that which is said by these children, for their statements and sayings are nothing but confused dreams. </p>


 <p id='399.4'> The Star of the Covenant shall shine intensely upon all horizons and regions, and the violators will be as bats hiding themselves in dark holes! It is enough humiliation and abasement to them that they have violated the Covenant of God and contradicted the Appointed Center, and desired to demolish this solid edifice — which, alas, could not be! By God, they did not demolish but their own edifice, did not shake but their own foundations, and did not scatter but their own union, and to them shall come the news of what they have done! </p>

 <p id='402' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O ye dwellers of the Kingdom!  <a data-fnid='146'></a></p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn146'> To fifteen members of the Chicago assembly. </aside>

 <p id='402.2' class='dropcap'> Thank ye God that ye have turned your faces toward the Kingdom of Abhá, and are yearning for the outpouring of the Exalted Realm. Ye are accepted in the Threshold of the True One and are chosen by the Most Great <span data-pg='354'></span> Guidance! </p>


 <p id='402.3'> Ye have asked regarding the word of the “Ransomed Ones.” The mystery of “Ransom” (or Sacrifice) is a most great subject and is inexhaustible. </p>


 <p id='402.4'> Briefly it is as follows: The moth is a sacrifice to the candle. The spring is a sacrifice to the thirsty one. The sincere lover is a sacrifice to the loved one and the longing one is a sacrifice to the beloved. The point lies in this: He must wholly forget himself, become a wanderer (in the Abode of the Beloved) enamoured with His Tresses. He must consign to oblivion the body and soul, the life, comfort and existence. He must seek the good pleasure of the True One; desire the Face of the True One; and walk in the Path of the True One. He must become intoxicated with His Cup, resigned in His Hand and close the eyes to life and living, in order that he may shine like unto the Light of Truth from the Horizon of Eternity. This is the first station of sacrifice. </p>


 <p id='402.5'> The second station of sacrifice is as follows: Man must become severed from the human world, be delivered from the contingent gloominess, the illumination of mercifulness must shine and radiate in him, the nether world become as non-existent and the Kingdom become manifest. He must become like unto the iron thrown within the furnace of fire. The qualities of iron, such as blackness, coldness and solidity which belong to the earth disappear and vanish while the characteristics of fire, such as redness, glowing and heat, which belong to the Kingdom become apparent and visible. Therefore, iron hath sacrificed its qualities and grades to the fire, acquiring the virtues of that element. </p>


 <p id='402.6'> Likewise, when the souls are released from the fetters <span data-pg='355'></span> of the world, the imperfections of mankind and the animalistic darkness, and have stepped into the Realm of Abstraction, have partaken a share from the outpouring of the Placeless and have acquired lordly perfections, they are the “ransomed ones” (or the martyrs) of the Sun of Truth, who are hastening to the altar of heart and soul. </p>

In this day, whatever soul intendeth to raise the voice of the Kingdom, and to draw people under the Tree of Life in the ideal paradise, and to invite them to eternal life, must first be delivered from all attachments, must even shut his eyes to rest, quietude and to the mortal life of this world. </p>

 <p id='407.4'> Consequently, do thou show a steadfast and firm footing in this station, engage in guiding the people and call them unto the Kingdom; then wilt thou find how the divine magnet — the power of the Word of God — will attract the hearts and bestow ecstasy and enthusiasm upon souls! </p>

Indeed, there is need of a thousand teachers, each one severed from the world, attracted by the Holy Spirit in the Supreme Concourse and joyful through the Kingdom of God and in perfect sanctity, holiness and sufficiency. </p>


 <p id='409.3'> This matter of teachers requires the greatest condition; that is, they should never stain themselves with <span data-pg='360'></span> the world, they should not look for the least pecuniary reward from any soul; nay, rather they should bear the utmost poverty and with the perfect wealth of nature,<a data-fnid='148'></a> through the bounty of God, may they associate with the people. They should seek no reward nor recompense. Freely have thy received, freely should they give. His Holiness Christ sayeth: “When ye leave the city, clean off from your shoes the dust thereof.” The holiness of the teachers must reach this degree. Thus may they utter with eloquence, while in ecstasy and great joy, and guide the people to the manifest light. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn148'> “Wealth of nature” refers to a state wherein man can dispense with things and be happy in their absence. </aside>

 <p id='410.5'> This is the custom and sentence of the people of bygone ages. Undoubtedly these things must transpire in these days even with a greater intensity. </p>


 <p id='410.6'> That is why His Holiness the Christ sayeth: “Everything which hath happened in the cycles of the former prophets will certainly occur again in these days.” Consider ye! What calumny, slander, cruelty and oppression were brought down upon the apostles by the Israelites for the sake of faith and assurance! They unlocked the hands of pillage, persecuted and tortured those sanctified souls. Therefore, there is no doubt but that you will become afflicted with trial, calamity and oppression in the path of the Beauty of Abhá. These trials are the essence of bestowal and pure bounty and the proofs of your acceptance in the Threshold of Oneness. Consequently, when the fire of trials is ignited, celebrate ye in joy, dance with overflowing emotions and be ye happy that — praise be to God! — ye have become <span data-pg='362'></span> the target of contempt in the path of the Beauty of Abhá and are hated by the people of passion and desire. </p>

 <p id='417.10'> O friends of God, and assistants of this humble servant! When the Sun of Truth shone forth with His infinite bounties from the dawning-place of hopes, and the horizon of existence was illuminated through the radiance of sanctity — then He cast forth such splendor whereby the gloomy darkness disappeared! Therefore, the earth became the envy of the celestial world, and the realm of dust was made a scene of the exalted kingdom. Then the fragrances of holiness exhaled, and the sweet odors were diffused. The breeze of the divine spring blew, and the fruitful winds of infinite generosity passed by from the point of favor. The brilliant morning dawned and the glad-tidings of the greatest gift were announced. The divine spring appeared throughout the contingent world. The earth of existence moved and the material world was put in motion. The barren and dried up soil turned into an eternal garden, and the inanimate earth was endowed with eternal life. The flowers and myrtles of knowledge grew, and the fresh herbage of the knowledge of God flourished. The material world showed forth the bounties of the Merciful, and the visible world displayed the scene of the invisible world. The call of God was raised, the divine banquet celebrated, the cup of the Testament was circulated and the universal acclamation was <span data-pg='371'></span> uttered! </p>


 <p id='417.11'> Among the people, a multitude became intoxicated with this divine wine — and a multitude were deprived of this great favor. Many a soul enlightened his sight and insight by the radiance of grace, and many were cheered and rejoiced at the melodies of unity. Some birds sang melodies and harmonies, and some nightingales began to warble on the branches of the rose-tree of mercifulness. The Kingdom and the phenomenal world were adorned, and became the envy of the delectable paradise — but, alas — and a thousand times alas! — that the heedless souls are still in the sleep of negligence, and the ignorant are keeping clear of this holy gift. The blind are veiled, the deaf are bereft and the dead despair of attaining to it; just as it is said (in the Qur’án) “They despair of the life to come, as the infidels despair (of the resurrection of) those who dwell in the graves.” </p>


 <p id='417.12'> As to you — O friends of the Merciful! — move your tongues to thank the Loving Lord, and employ yourselves in praising and glorifying the Beauty of the Adored One, for ye were granted the privilege to be exhilarated from this most pure cup, and became full of cheer and attraction from this goblet of wine. Ye have perfumed your nostrils with the fragrances of sanctity, and delighted your senses with the scent of the garment of the Joseph of faithfulness. Ye tasted the honey of devotion from the hand of the Unique Beloved and partook of the eternal table at the feast of the blessing of the Presence of the Unity. This favor is one of the special gifts of the Presence of the Merciful, and this grace and generosity is one of the incomparable gifts of our Loving Lord. This is in accordance with what Christ said: “Many are called, but few <span data-pg='372'></span> chosen.” That is to say, there are many who are invited, but those souls who are signalized with the grace and favor of guidance are but very rare. “This is the bounty of God; He will give the same unto whom He pleaseth; and God is endowed with great bounty.” </p>


 <p id='417.13'> O friends of God! the candle of the Testament is surrounded by the hypocritical winds of the people of the world and the nightingale of faithfulness is surprised by the crows of ill-nature — the violators. The mindless birds of night are plotting against the dove of commemoration and the ferocious beasts are prowling after the gazelle of the plain of the love of God. So, He is in great danger and painful affliction. </p>

They must cling to the hem of Glory and trust in the Beauty of the Most High. They must lean on the help and assistance of the Ancient Kingdom and confide in the care and protection of the Generous Lord. They must at every instant nourish and refresh themselves with the dew of favor, and in every breath revive and cheer themselves through the waves of the Holy Spirit, raise themselves to serve the Cause of the Supreme, and endeavor their utmost to diffuse the breath of God. They must be as a strongly fortified fortress for the defense of the blessed Cause, and as a well-made fortification for the protection of the hosts of the Pre-existent Beauty. They must in all conditions faithfully guard the edifice of the Cause of God, and be scintillating stars on the horizon of the visible; because the gloomy darkness of all nations prevailed from all <span data-pg='373'></span> directions, and all the creeds of the world are plotting to quench their evident light. Notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of all tribes, how can ye continue heedless thereof? So, ye must be conscious and aware thereof, and be ready to guard and preserve the Cause of the Creator. For this day the most necessary duty is to purify your morals, to correct your manners, and to improve your deeds. The beloved of the Merciful must appear with such morals and habits among the creatures that the fragrant odor of the garden of sanctity may perfume all the horizons and may quicken all the dead souls, because the Manifestation of Divinity and the dawning of the infinite lights of the Invisible is intended for the education of souls and the refinement of the morals of all in existence, so that some blessed souls may be delivered from the gloomy world of brutality and be characterized with attributes which tend to adorn the being of man; that the earthly people may become godlike, the dark ones may become illuminated, the uninstructed ones may become familiar with the mystery of the Kingdom, and the mortal souls may be associated with the Immortal Splendor; the deprived ones may partake of the endless sea, and the ignorant may drink from the living water of knowledge; the savage may give up their ferocity, and the cruel may become forbearing; that the warlike may search after true conciliation and the pitiless savage may be favored with ideal peace; that the degraded may learn about the condition of purity and the soiled ones may attain to the stream of sanctity. If these divine bounties do not appear in the being of men, the bounty of the <span data-pg='374'></span> Divine Manifestation will prove fruitless and the splendor of the Sun of Truth will become without effect. </p>


 <p id='417.15'> So, O beloved of God, endeavor with your hearts and souls, that ye may be qualified with the morals and attributes of the Blessed Perfection, and partake of the bounties of His sanctity; that ye may become signs of unity and standards of oneness, discover the essence of singleness and sing harmonies and lays in this divine garden, in merciful melodies; that ye may become as thankful birds, and sing a song in the rose-garden of existence which may astonish minds and senses; that ye may hoist a standard on the apex of the universe which may flutter in the winds of favor, and plant a tree in the field of the visible world which may bring forth fruits of the utmost delicacy and freshness. </p>


 <p id='417.16'> I swear by the Ideal Educator that, if ye act in compliance with the divine exhortations, as revealed in brilliant Tablets, this gloomy earth will become a mirror of the Exalted Kingdom, and the inferior page will display the Kingdom of Abhá! </p>


 <p id='417.17'> O friends of God! Praise be unto God that the invisible bounties of the Sun of Truth are encompassing you from all directions, and the doors of mercy are opened from all parts. Now is the time to be benefited and filled therewith. Seize the opportunity, and lose not the chance. Keep yourselves entirely clear of the world’s conditions of gloom, and show forth the characters and qualities of divine souls, that ye may consider to what an extent the radiance of the Divine Sun is shining and brilliant, and how the signs of favor are showing forth from the invisible World of Unity. </p>


 <p id='417.18'> O friends of God! Praise be unto God that His <span data-pg='375'></span> Imperial Majesty, the <u>Sh</u>áh, acts with the utmost kindness, and His Highness, the Prime Minister, is practising the greatest fairness and equity towards the people. So, the friends of God must night and day pray for the permanence of the glorious empire, and raise themselves to return thanks to His Majesty for his justice, equity and kindness, because this is one of the indisputable commandments of God, as revealed in all celestial books. </p>

    <h3 class='sectionnum'> — 418 — </h3>
  </div>

 <p id='418' class='nodropcap italic larger'> To the beloved of God in Persia! </p>

 <p id='418.2' class='dropcap'> O ye dear friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! It is some time since any heart-thrilling melody hath reached the ear of life from certain countries, and life and conscience have not found happiness and joy. Howbeit all are remembered at all times and are indeed present before the sight. For, verily, the chalice of the heart is overflowing with the wine of the love of the friends; and their attachment and the desire to see them flow and circulate in the veins and arteries, even as the spirit. </p>


 <p id='418.3'> In this condition it is evident how sad and grieved the heart is. In this storm of ordeal, whose wave hath reached the Supreme Apogee, and the arrow of hate hath come in succession from the six points; with every breath there is bewildering news and every day astonishing signs in the Blessed Spot. </p>


 <p id='418.4'> The center of violation <a data-fnid='153'></a> supposed that through mere pride the foundation of the Covenant and Testament could be destroyed and that the righteous ones would shun and disobey the ordinances of God. Therefore, <span data-pg='376'></span> he spread writings of suspicion to all parts and busied himself with secret plans. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn153'> The unkind brother. </aside>

 <p id='418.5'> At one time he cried that “The Divine Foundation is overthrown, the law of God is abrogated, therefore the Covenant and Testament of God are annulled!” Again, he moaned and grieved that “We are exiles and captives, hungry and thirsty, night and day!” One day he effected disturbance and commotion, saying, “The Oneness of God is abolished, and the Manifestation, before the lapse of a thousand years, hath appeared!”<a data-fnid='154'></a> </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn154'> An accusation that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was claiming to be a Manifestation who is promised after a lapse of a thousand years. </aside>

 <p id='418.6'> Upon finding that these fictions were not successful, he gradually planned corruptions and caused commotion. He grasped every garment (means); he calumniated to the government and he became acquainted with some of the unfriendly, associated and became confidential with them. Together they compiled a report and presented it to the center of the government, which disturbed the members of the cabinet. </p>

 <p id='418.7'> Among their fictitious reports was this: That this oppressed one <a data-fnid='155'></a> has hoisted the banner of independence; upon that banner he has inscribed “Yá-Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” and circulated it in all this country,<a data-fnid='156'></a> in the cities and hamlets, even among the tribes in the desert, and that he has summoned them all to assemble under the banner.</p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn155'> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn156'> Syria. </aside>

 <p id='418.8'> O God, verily I seek shelter in Thee from this action which is contrary to the precepts of Bahá, nay, it is a great wrong, committed only by every persistent sinner. <span data-pg='377'></span> For Thou hast enjoined upon us obedience to kings and rulers! </p>


 <p id='418.9'> Among the fictions was that the building upon Mt. Carmel was purposed to be a fort, built with perfect solidity and strength, assigned it to be the “illumined city” and made the Holy Tomb, the Sacred Mecca; when in truth that is a building containing six vaults. </p>


 <p id='418.10'> Among other fictions was, that he has founded a new monarchy (kingdom) and that he has called all the friends to this great wrong. God forbid; God forbid; God forbid! Praise be to Thee!<a data-fnid='157'></a> — this is a great calumny! — that since the Sacred Tomb <a data-fnid='158'></a> has become a visiting center for the world, it shall be a great misfortune to country and to the public! And that the center of violation is not connected with these affairs, nay rather, he is a Suni, Sanavi, Bekri, and Omari.<a data-fnid='159'></a> That he knows the Blessed Perfection <a data-fnid='160'></a> to be only one of the reformers among the people, and a follower of the Path, and that these affairs were instituted by this oppressed one. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn157'> An expression of astonishment. </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn158'> The Tomb of the Báb on Mt. Carmel. </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn159'> These expressions are intended to convey the inference that he is orthodox. </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn160'> Bahá’u’lláh. </aside>

 <p id='418.11'> In short, an inquisitory body was appointed by the center of the great government — may her glory increase! — and was sent to this land, taking up its abode directly in the home of one of the plaintiffs. The parties who joined in compiling the report and who were co-partners of my brother were sent for and questioned regarding the truth of the report. They amplified the contents of the report, explained them, confirmed them and above all added to them. They were the plaintiffs, <span data-pg='378'></span> the witnesses and the judge. Now that body hath returned to the Capital and every day terrible and frightful news is received. </p>


 <p id='418.12'> But ‘Abdu’l-Bahá — praise be to God! — is in perfect peace, composure and rest. He is not even disturbed through this calumny and fiction, but rather hath referred all affairs to the pre-ordained decree and in perfect joy and happiness is ready to give up his life, expecting every ordeal. </p>


 <p id='418.13'> Praise be to God! — the kind friends of God are also in a state of resignation and submissiveness. All are happy, thankful, joyful and content. But the center of violation presumed that after the shedding of the blood of this oppressed one, or the throwing of him into the great desert, or the casting of him into the Mediterranean Sea, he will become nameless, traceless and forgotten, and that he [himself] would find an arena to gallop in and could win, with the spear of suspicions and fictions, the object of his hopes and desire. In vain! In vain! If there be no permanence to the fragrance of the musk of faithfulness, will any one be attracted by the vile odor of jealousy? If the deer of God be torn asunder by dogs and wolves, no one will run after the blood-thirsty wolf. If the nightingale of significances end his days, no one will listen to the croaking of the raven, nor to the cawing of the crow. What vain imagination is this, and what an ignorant display! Their actions are like unto a mirage in the desert, which the thirsty imagines to be water, but when he reaches it, finds it to be nothing. </p>


 <p id='418.14'> In sooth, O ye friends of God, make firm your feet and heart, make perfect resolve through the power of <span data-pg='379'></span> confirmation of the Blessed Beauty; engage in the service of the Cause of God and withstand the nations and the peoples with the firmness, the solidity and the steadfastness of the people of Bahá. Thus may others wonder how these hearts are fountains of trust and mines of the love of His Majesty, the Merciful One. Thus may ye remain unshaken by the painful occurrences in the Holy Land, and may remain firm through the disastrous events. If all the friends oppose (the Cause of God) with sword and one remain (firm), he will be the proclaimer of God, a divine herald, and will stand before all upon the earth. </p>


 <p id='418.15'> In sooth, you must not mind the events in the Radiant Spot. The Holy Land is ever in danger and the flood of ordeal comes from every side, for the call hath become world-wide and the summons hath spread throughout the earth,and enemies, both the unfamiliar and the familiar, are engaged in their plans, their stratagems and schemes to calumniate; and it is evident that such a place is in danger, for against calumny there is no defence, nay rather, some wandering oppressed souls are imprisoned in a fortress, having no helper, assistant nor shelter from the sword of accusation and the teeth of calumny, save God! </p>


 <p id='418.16'> Ye must think of this: How many dear friends have hastened to the divine altar; how many blessed souls have sacrificed life; what holy blood was shed; what pure hearts were drowned in blood; how many breasts were offered as targets for the arrows of malice, and how many sanctified bodies were cut to pieces. What is our duty? To be thinking of our own life and to dissimulate and associate with enemies and friends, or <span data-pg='380'></span> should we also follow the righteous and walk in the footprints of those who are great? </p>


 <p id='418.17'> The numbered days (of life) will vanish away, and the present existence disappear. The garden of being will lose is freshness and fragrance, the orchard of mirth will miss its joy and beauty. The spring of life will change into the autumn of death, the joy of happiness of the palaces will change into the gloomy darkness of the grave. Therefore, it is not worth attachment and the wise person will not set his heart thereon. The wise and great man seeketh heavenly glory and divine might, desireth eternal life and seeketh nearness to the Threshold of God. </p>


 <p id='418.18'> For in the tavern of the mortal world the bile of the man of God is not removed. He will not rest a moment here and will not stain himself with the attachments of the world. Nay, rather, the friends are the stars of the summit of Providence and the planets of the firmament of Guidance. With perfect strength do they dispel darkness and destroy the foundation of envy and enmity. They wish for the world and its denizens unity and peace; they destroy the basis of war and strife; they seek integrity, faithfulness and friendliness, and are well-wishers even of the evil-disposed enemy. Thus they make this prison of infidelity the sublime mansion of fidelity, and this dungeon of envy a delectable paradise. </p>


 <p id='418.19'> O ye friends, endeavor with life and heart that this world may become the mirror of the world of the Kingdom; that the earthly kingdom be filled with the bounty of the heavenly; that the voice of the Supreme Concourse may be raised in commendation, and that the <span data-pg='381'></span> traces of the bounty and grace of the Beauty of Abhá may envelop the earth! </p>


 <p id='418.20'> His honor, Ameen,<a data-fnid='161'></a> hath praised highly the honored servants and the maid — servants of the Manifest Light; commending each one separately and eulogizing the firmness and steadfastness of all; that — praise be to God! — the friends and maid-servants of the Merciful in all Persia are in perfect resignation and firm and steadfast, like unto a firm and solid foundation, and in an absolute state of ecstasy and attraction are engaged in spreading the fragrance of the Lord of Lords. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn161'> One of the teachers of the Bahá’í Revelation in Persia. </aside>

 <p id='418.21'> Through this news, at this time of great jeopardy, much happiness was realized, for the supreme hope and desire of this oppressed one is the spirituality of the hearts and the radiance of the beings of the friends. When this gift is obtained every ordeal is for him as an abundant bounty and a great shower. </p>


 <p id='418.22'> O my God! O my God! Thou seest me drowned in the sea of ordeals, seized upon by the fire of infidelity, with tears flowing in the dark night rolling in the bed of sleeplessness, mine eyes expectant to see the dawn of the lights of Faith. And when I am anxious, as the fish whose bowels are inflamed upon the dust, I anticipate the manifestation of Thy bounties from all sides! </p>


 <p id='418.23'> O Lord! Surround the friends in other regions with Thy great bounties and uplift those who are weak among Thy chosen, through Thy strength and providence, in every remote place! </p>


 <p id='418.24'> O Lord, verily they are the captives of Thy love and the prisoners of Thy host, the birds of the atmosphere <span data-pg='382'></span> of Thy guidance, the fish of the sea of Thy providence, the stars of the horizon of Thy bounty, the army of the fortress of Thy law, the banners of Thy remembrance, the eyes of Thy mercy, the fountains of Thy grace and the springs of Thy generosity. Therefore, guard them with the eye of kindness, confirm them in promoting Thy Word, strengthen their hearts in Thy love, reinforce their backs in Thy service, make firm their loins in Thy servitude, spread through them Thy fragrances, reveal through them Thy signs, manifest through them Thy proofs, accomplish through them Thy words and perfect through them Thy mercy! </p>


 <p id='418.25'> Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, and, verily, thou art the Clement, the Merciful! </p>

A seeing eye beholdeth the splendors of the sun and a hearing ear listeneth to the melody of the Supreme Concourse. Although the mercy of the vernal shower and the heavenly outpouring descend upon all the earth, yet only from a virgin soil vegetation groweth while the brackish ground is deprived and unproductive, for the traces of the outpouring are not evident and manifest.

These souls have taken a share from (the benefits) of being and obtained results. </p>


 <p id='422.5'> O ye friends of this wronged one! Purify your eyes from beholding any [as] strangers. Do ye not see foreignness, nay rather, know all as friends; for with the observation of strangeness, the practice of love and unity is difficult. </p>


 <p id='422.6'> In this wonderful age, according to the divine texts, ye must befriend all nations and communities. Ye must not look upon violence, force, evil intentions, persecutions or hostility, nay rather, ye must raise your eyes to the horizon of glory and [see] that each one of these creatures is a sign of the Lord of Signs and [has] stepped upon the arena of existence through divine favor and supreme energy. Thus they are known and not unknown, are friends and not strangers. We must deal with all according to the above criterion. </p>


 <p id='422.7'> Therefore, the beloved must, with infinite kindness and love, associate and sympathize with both friends and strangers and not look at all upon the merits and capabilities of the persons. Under all circumstances they must show forth genuine love and be not defeated by the intensity of rancor, hatred, quarrel, malice and the grudge of the people. Should they (the people) shoot arrows they (the friends) must administer milk and honey; if they give poison, the believers must impart delicacies; if they cause pain, let the beloved be a <span data-pg='390'></span> remedy; if they strike a blow, let them become the antidote. </p>


 <p id='422.8'> O my God! O my God! Verily, these are Thy weak servants and Thy submissive, faithful ones and Thy sincere maid-servants who are humbled before Thy illumined Threshold, acknowledging Thy Oneness which hath appeared like unto the appearance of the sun in midday, listening to Thy call from Thy mysterious Kingdom and uttering Thy prayers with hearts overflowing with Thy love and devotion! </p>


 <p id='422.9'> O my Lord! Pour upon all of them the rain of Thy mercy, cause [to] descend upon every one the showers of Thy bounty from the clouds of Thy munificence, make them graceful plants in Thy divine Rose-garden and suffer these myrtles to become verdant, green and refreshed by the outpouring from the Cloud of Thy Singleness. </p>


 <p id='422.10'> Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Most High, the Mighty and Omnipotent, and the Creator of the earth and heaven, and verily there is no God but Thee, the Lord of the Manifest Signs! </p>

 <p id='423' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O servants of the Blessed Beauty!  <a data-fnid='168'></a></p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn168'> To the assembly of Ṭihrán, Persia. </aside>

 <p id='423.2' class='dropcap'> It is a well known fact that, owing to the frequency of disturbances, the work of delivering the Message hath been for a short time discontinued. In consequence, persons travel less frequently to the different parts of the country. It is known and clear that today the unseen divine assistance encompasseth those who deliver the Message. And if the work of delivering <span data-pg='391'></span> the Message be neglected, the assistance shall be entirely cut off, for it is impossible that the friends of God could receive assistance unless they be engaged in delivering the Message. Under all conditions the Message must be delivered, but with wisdom. If it be not possible openly, it must be done quietly. The friends should be engaged in educating the souls and should become instruments in aiding the world of humanity to acquire spiritual joy and fragrance. For example: If every one of the friends (believers) were to establish relations of friendship and right dealings with one of the negligent souls, associate and live with him with perfect kindliness, and meanwhile through good conduct and moral behavior lead him to divine instruction, to heavenly advice and teachings, surely he would gradually arouse that negligent person and would change his ignorance into knowledge. </p>


 <p id='423.3'> Souls are liable to estrangement. Such methods should be adopted that the estrangement should be first removed, then the Word will have effect. </p>


 <p id='423.4'> If one of the believers be kind to one of the negligent ones and with perfect love should gradually make him understand the reality of the Cause of God in such a way that the latter should know in what manner the Religion of God hath been founded and what its object is, doubtless he will become changed; excepting abnormal souls who are reduced to the state of ashes and whose hearts are like stones, yea, even harder. </p>


 <p id='423.5'> If by this method every one of the friends of God were to try to lead one soul to the right path, the number of the believers would be doubled every year. But this should be carried out with perfect wisdom and in <span data-pg='392'></span> such a manner that no harm would ever result therefrom. </p>


 <p id='423.6'> In the same way those who deliver the Message should travel to all parts of the country. And if delivering the Message should be the cause of disturbance, let them then be engaged in encouraging and educating the friends, in order that those souls receive spiritual attraction and rejoice, seek delight and ecstasy, acquire new life and through the fragrances of sanctity gain vivacity and freshness. </p>


 <p id='423.7'> The object is this, that in the time of peace and safety this work of delivering the Message should be carried on with the utmost fervor. But when there is no peace and safety, extreme wisdom should be exercised, though no complete cessation of effort is permissible, for in that case the divine assistance shall be entirely cut off. </p>


 <p id='423.8'> With regard to the formation of benevolent associations, surely this subject should be given due attention. The disciples of His Holiness Christ — may my life be a sacrifice unto Him! — were only eleven persons and they had established a benevolent fund. So the establishment of the fund had that degree of importance. </p>

 <p id='424' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O ye sincere ones! O ye favored ones! O ye beseeching ones! O ye supplicating ones!  <a data-fnid='169'></a></p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn169'> To the assembly of Ṭihrán, Persia. </aside>

 <p id='424.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, I set my forehead on the dust and turn my face toward the Lord of Lords and invoke my Lord with intense fervor and attraction, that He may look upon you with the glances of the eye of His providence, watch over you with the gaze of His protection, unite <span data-pg='393'></span> your hearts, dilate your breasts, harmonize your souls, rejoice you with gladness, exhilarate you with the chalices of salvation, make you steadfast in the divine Cause and that He may enable you to cling to the hem of the Almighty, to hasten toward the place of sacrifice and to be sheltered under the shadow of the Blessed Tree whose roots are planted firm and whose branches are extended to heaven: </p>


 <p id='424.3'> O my Lord! O my Lord! These are the chosen ones whose faces are illumined with the light of guidance, who found the heavenly table pleasing to their tastes, who submitted willingly to every matter which happened in the land and sought help from the hosts of the Supreme Concourse. Their feet are indeed made firm, their banners hoisted, their deeds righteous and their actions just. O Lord! Make them fragrant plants of Thy paradise, flowers of the garden of nearness, verses of Thy glorious book, words of Thy “Published Tablet” unto the people of the world and as falcons soaring on the loftiest summit. Verily Thou art the Beneficent, the Merciful, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower! </p>


 <p id='424.4'> O my dear friends! Yours was not merely a letter; it was perfumed with amber and diffused a sweet fragrance. Every word thereof was a rose in the rose-garden of the love of God and was a flower, a hyacinth. </p>


 <p id='424.5'> When the breeze of Providence blows from the direction of gift, the gardens of hearts attain thereby exceeding purity and freshness. Such significances arise from the soul and consciousness and impart joy and <span data-pg='394'></span> fragrance. </p>


 <p id='424.6'> O friends! It is the wish of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that the friends may establish general unity and not a particular meeting of unity. You must have great consideration for this fact, for during the past cycles though such events (founding of particular, i.e., exclusive unity meetings) were, in the beginning, a means for harmony, they became in the end the cause of trouble. </p>


 <p id='424.7'> We are all servants of one Threshold, attendants at one Court, waves of one sea, drops of one stream, the dust before one door and plants of one garden. There must arise no trouble to deprive one from that which is the real purpose. The beloved of God must be friendly even with strangers and intimate even with outsiders — how much more with others among the righteous (i.e., believers)! </p>


 <p id='424.8'> To organize assemblies is praiseworthy and acceptable, but these must be established for certain matters. For example: Assemblages for teaching (the Truth), gatherings for the spread of the fragrances of God, gathers for the relief of the orphans, gatherings for the protection (i.e., feeding, etc.,) of the poor, assemblages for the spread of learning and, in a word, there must be gatherings for matters which concern the well-being of men, such as organizations of a society of commerce, societies for the expansion of agriculture. To be brief, similar societies are very acceptable and praiseworthy and concern all in general and not a particular number. </p>


 <p id='424.9'> In a word: That which is conducive to the life (or growth) of the people is acceptable and whatever is the cause of disaffection is blameworthy. I hope all the friends of the East and West shall rest in the same <span data-pg='395'></span> assemblage and adorn one gathering, appearing with all the heavenly attributes and virtues in the world of humanity. </p>


 <p id='424.10'> O my Lord! O my Lord! Enable me to witness the most great sign and to realize the fulfillment of this hope throughout all regions. Verily Thou art the Bestower, the Beneficent, whose bounties are great! </p>


 <p id='424.11'> Some of the friends have asked to present themselves in these parts. In these days this does not conform with wisdom. God willing, permission shall be given at some favorable time. </p>

 <p id='425'> Glory be unto Thee, O Thou whose mercy hath encompassed all things, whose gift is made perfect, whose power hath encircled the world, whose proof is demonstrated, whose signs have become manifest, whose words are promulgated, whose arguments are established and whose ensigns are hoisted! Thanks be unto Thee for that which Thou hast bestowed! Thanks be unto Thee for that which Thou hast granted! Glorification behooveth Thee for Thou hast manifested Thyself! Glory be unto Thee! Glory be unto Thee! How inaccessible is Thy station! How manifest is Thy proof and how all-embracing is Thy munificence! </p>

 <p id='425.2'> Verily the dark night hath been spreading its wings over all the regions and the face of the heaven and earth was hidden behind the clouds of inky gloom and blackness — wherefore the sights were veiled from beholding the most great signs and inner perceptions were blinded <span data-pg='396'></span> and unable to find the fire of divine guidance; souls were wandering in the desert of error and heedlessness and the possessors of intelligence were lost in the wilderness of amazement and skepticism, crying and weeping as a mother bereft of her babe — bewailing and lamenting like unto a thirsty one in the midst of a vast and boundless Sahara! </p>


 <p id='425.3'> But through Thy greatest bounty, the glorious dawn broke and the lightning of guidance flashed from the Supreme Horizon upon the face of heaven! Then the First Point (the Báb) appeared among mankind with the glad-tidings of Thy Manifestation, the fragrances of Thy Holiness and the verses of Thy Singleness, spreading Thy good news, heralding Thy Name, declaring and praising Thee in numerous epistles! </p>


 <p id='425.4'> Thine is favor for this gift which hath cheered the souls of the pure ones! Thine is generosity for Thou hast enabled every righteous and devoted one to adore Thee by causing the Sun of Truth to shine upon all the regions of existence! Thine is glory and excellence! Thine is power and beauty! Thine is sovereignty and authority! Thine is dominion and kingdom! Thine is exaltation and omnipresence! Thine is divinity and lordship! For thou hast manifested Thy bounty from the horizon of emanation, rent asunder the veil and raised the covering from Thy illumined countenance in the promised day and shone forth upon the world of being with the rays gleaming from the dawn of revelation! </p>


 <p id='425.5'> Then the “Resurrection” appeared, the “Day of Judgment” became manifest, the “earth” heaved and shook, the “mountains” were levelled, the “seas” boiled, <span data-pg='397'></span> the “sun” was eclipsed, the “luminaries” were darkened, the “stars” scattered, the “signs” became known, the “bridge” expanded, the “conditions” were fulfilled, the “balance” was set up, the “fire” burned fiercely and the “paradise” became begemmed! — wherefore the devoted ones entered into delectable gardens with beatitude and the veiled ones were left to amuse themselves with their own imaginations; the possessors of perception beheld the lights and those whose eyes were weak vanished in gloomy darkness before the appearance of the mid-day Sun! </p>


 <p id='425.6'> Then those whose ears were unstopped and open rejoiced in listening to the call, while the deaf (or ignorant) were astonished, crying out, “What is the cause of this acclamation and rejoicing?” Then the fluent speakers loosened their tongues in thanksgiving and glorification, while the dumb became as hard and lifeless stones; then the souls were purified, the hearts were attracted, the breasts were dilated, the characters were sanctified, the secret thoughts became manifest and the realities stepped into the arena of existence; they sought illumination, were guided, became ablaze, enflamed and enkindled, called forth and proclaimed, saying: </p>


 <p id='425.7' class='blockquote verse italic'> “Glad-tidings be unto the righteous ones! Rejoicing be unto the perceiving ones! Happiness be unto the favored ones! Joy be unto the yearning ones! Cheerfulness be unto the attracted ones!

  Glory be unto Him who hath shone forth the Manifest <span data-pg='398'></span> Light!
  Glory be unto Him who showered Glorious Outpourings upon the contingent beings!
  Glory be unto Him who illumined the Supreme Horizon with such a Radiance by which the gloom of the dark night hath been dispelled!
  Glory be unto Him who causeth to descend the Food from heaven!
  Glory be unto Him who causeth the Running Spring to gush forth from the rugged cliff! Glory be unto Him who poured down the Pure Water from on high!

 <p id='425.8'> O ye merciful friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! At this moment a letter hath been received from America containing the good news that that region of the Occident hath become the Orient; that is, in that region the rays of the Sun of Truth have appeared and shone forth with such penetration that the bright light of the morn of guidance hath dawned and every longing one hath attained to the desire of this heart, and that the melody of the Kingdom of Abhá ascends continuously to the Supreme Concourse and the soul-refreshing strains of “Yá-Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” reach the ears of the peoples and communities of that country. </p>


 <p id='425.9'> According to what they have written, they have celebrated the day of the “Birth anniversary” in twenty-four cities by giving public feasts and beautiful receptions. They have spent that day in the utmost joy and happiness, they have sent out general invitations, spread the table of gifts, engaged in the commemoration of the True One and in imparting glad-tidings to each other. Likewise, letters of congratulation and felicitation have been received from these twenty-four cities and assemblies. Consider ye what influence the penetrative power of the Word of God hath displayed in existence and how the universe is stirred and moved <span data-pg='400'></span> through it! How in America on the “Birth anniversary” such feasting and banqueting is prepared! How the remote ones have become the near ones and how the customs and habits of the East are spread abroad! This is the penetrative power of the Word of God and this is the might of the subduing desire of God! </p>


 <p id='425.10'> O ye friends of God and maid-servants of the Merciful! His honor Ameen <a data-fnid='171'></a> hath mentioned you with the highest praise and commendation, saying that, thank God, the believers in all parts of the cities and towns are the manifestations of bounties and the dawning-places of justice and equity; are mindful, obedient, kind-hearted and steadfast; are engaged in reading the verses and occupied with spreading the signs; are in the utmost ecstasy and exhilaration and intoxicated with the pure wine; are active in praising and adoring the Most Great Name and intimate in paying homage to the Holy Threshold; are living in accord with the divine teachings and exhortations and are in every way endowed with all human excellences and attributes; that they are in the utmost unity and agreement and in great zeal and enthusiasm; are kind to every soul and treat all the communities with exceeding joy and fragrance; that they have sympathy even for the enemies and are faithful friends even to the unjust; that to the outsiders they are as relatives and to the strangers they are a swift-healing antidote instead of a poisonous sting; are the servants of world of humanity and manifestors of the attributes of the Merciful One! Blessed are they for this testimony, which is expressive of the beauty of their characters and the merit of their. <span data-pg='401'></span> virtues! Truly, I say, his honor Ameen is the well-wisher of all. In the day of the Manifestation he was the Ameen (Faithful) of the Blessed Perfection <a data-fnid='172'></a> and in the days of the Covenant <a data-fnid='173'></a> he is the confidant of this yearning one. Therefore, his testimony is heard and accepted and his evidence is praised and beloved. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn171'> One of the teachers of the Bahá’í Revelation in Persia </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn172'> Bahá’u’lláh. </aside>
  <aside class='fn' id='fn173'> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </aside>

 <p id='425.11'> O ye beloved of God! According to what is heard, some of the ‘ulamás of the <u>Sh</u>í‘ah sect (Persian moslem mullás), as well as some leaders of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í school, are engaged constantly in instigating revolts and have arisen against the government with enmity and opposition, confusing the affairs of the state more than before. </p>


 <p id='425.12'> Praise be to God! <a data-fnid='174'></a> What is this heedlessness and ignorance and what is this antagonism and insubordination! Verily, the Persian empire hath been at all times deprived of every bounty on account of the encroaching influence of the ritualistic mullás! Whenever that just government conceived a good intention to introduce reforms and amelioration of conditions, these ignorant leaders raised vehement opposition, protested severely and prevented the introduction of measures which would better conditions and spread culture and progress. One must be just. The intention of His Imperial majesty is higher and purer than all the other leaders and chiefs, for the sole desire of the throne is the peace and security of the inhabitants and the cultivation and betterment of the conditions of the empire. But alas! they do not give a moment’s rest to the kind Padeshah, in order that he may voluntarily and of his own accord inaugurate reforms as much as may be warranted by circumstances. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn174'> An expression of astonishment. <span data-pg='402'></span> </aside>

 <p id='425.13'> However, the inhabitants of Persia are not the only ones who are afflicted with this ignorance and blindness. The people of the imperial Ottoman government are also in a state of the utmost ignorance and blindness. Diversity of opinions and ignorance of factions do not allow one breath of tranquility to the imperial government, in order that it may adjust internal conditions and rectify foreign relations. Yet, under all these conditions, His Imperial Majesty the Padeshah of the Ottomans is intelligently directing the affairs. The proof and testimony of this assertion is the protection afforded these exiled ones (in ‘Akká) from the rebellious despotism of the enemies. If authority were in the people’s hands or in other hands than those of the government, the conspiracies and seditions of inside and outside enemies would have scattered even the ashes of this imprisoned one to the winds. But the forbearance, intelligence, foresight, far-reaching wisdom and discernment of His Imperial Majesty the Padeshah of the Ottomans have so far protected these exiled ones, notwithstanding the attacks of the calumniators and the party of the slanderers. We are of those who pray for these two just kings and are grateful to these two equitable sovereigns. </p>


 <p id='425.14'> Praise be unto God! One of the imputations of the enemies is this: That — we seek refuge in God — we deny the validity and truth of the Sun of Guidance, the Lamp of the Supreme Concourse, the messenger of the Almighty, His Highness Muḥammad Mostafa — upon Him be greeting and praise! — and that — God forbid! — we have written books in His refutation. Woe unto those who have arisen to spread this great falsehood <span data-pg='403'></span> and calumny! However, all the friends of God who are informed of the mysteries know that this exiled and imprisoned one would readily sacrifice his life at the dust of the Prophet’s feet. Furthermore, the Blessed Perfection — may my life be a sacrifice to His beloved ones — in the book of Íqán, hath established with invincible proofs and clear arguments the prophethood of His Highness the Messenger — may my life be a sacrifice to Him! — and also His Highness the Supreme (the Báb) hath invoked Him (Muḥammad) in many supplications. Notwithstanding all these evidences, the unjust ones are crying out and secretly spreading the falsehood that we — God forbid! — are His deniers and the unfaithful friends (náqiḍín) acknowledge these erroneous imputations. Praise be to God! If we deny the messengers and prophets of God, what have we to say for ourselves? Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Verily this is a great calumny! </p>


 <p id='425.15'> To be brief, the aim is this: Through the interference of the ignorant and fanatical leaders the country of Persia is in a state of decadence, although the pure intention of His Imperial Majesty the crowned <u>Sh</u>áh is for progress. However, ye who are the well-wishers of the government and are sincere, obedient and kind toward it, be ye engaged always in service. Should any one of you enter into the service (or employment) of the government, he must live and act with the utmost truthfulness, righteousness, chastity, uprightness, purity, sanctity, justice and equity. But if — I seek refuge in God — any one betray the least of trusts or neglect and be remiss in the performance of duties which are intrusted to him, or by oppression takes one penny <span data-pg='404'></span> of extortion from the subjects, or seeks after his own personal, selfish aims and ends in the attainment of his own interests, he shall undoubtedly remain deprived of the outpourings of His Highness the Almighty! Beware! Beware! lest ye fall short in that which ye are commanded in this Tablet! </p>

Such souls must appear and engage, with simplicity, freedom and purity, in training the public and in guiding all people. If such souls arise, the Holy Spirit will aid them, the hosts of the heavenly angels will render them victorious, the bounties of the Kingdom of Abhá will surround them the ray of the Sun of Truth will shine, the breezes of the Paradise of Abhá will give spirit, the ocean of favors will boil and the good scent of the fragrances of holiness will perfume the nostrils of the inhabitants of the world. </p>

It contained the good news of the assemblage of the beloved ones, of the Meeting of Faithfulness which was held, the joy and fragrance obtained, the appearance of the lights of the love of the Beauty of Abhá, and the good news that the breasts of the beloved ones were dilated (with joy). This news caused such joy that our afflictions, sufferings and calamities were wholly forgotten, a new carpet was <span data-pg='421'></span> spread and a great joy attained with the utmost exaltation!

 <p id='451.4'> O dear friend! The darkness of error hath encompassed the world; it is now the time to spread the light of guidance. The world hath wholly become the tomb of the dead; it is now time that it shall be transformed into palaces of the living.

Harm (in this wise) is helpfulness, and friendship, enmity and hatred. Therefore, thou shalt not kill the lamb; nay, rather thou shalt be the cause of the spread of His Name; thou shalt share a portion of His eternal life and attain a share of His infinite mercy. The impressions of the heart (the painful feelings of the heart), which were like the blows of a weapon, are interpreted to mean joy and happiness.

  <aside class='fn' id='fn186'> To the New York City Board of Counsel. </aside>

 <p id='459.2' class='dropcap'> The detailed letter which you have written was received and it was read with the greatest attention. From the rose-garden of its significances a perfumed fragrance reached the nostrils and from its suggestions and statements traces of sincerity of intention became manifest. </p>


 <p id='459.3'> Praise be to God! — that each one of that assembly is like unto a shining lamp, is ignited by the fire of the love of God, hath closed his eyes to the world and the inhabitants thereof, hath burned away the veils of superstitions and hath acquired the treasury of Truth. I have loosened my tongue to thank God for this gift at the Threshold of Oneness and praised and glorified the Incomparable God for His bounty, because He assisted those souls in the service of the Kingdom, and established such an assembly in New York that it will finally become a cause of the guidance of that continent. </p>


 <p id='459.4'> You have written that there is a difference among the believers concerning the “Second Coming of Christ.” Praise be to God! — time and again this question hath arisen and its answer hath emanated in a clear and irrefutable text from the pen of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that what is meant in the prophecies by the “Lord of Hosts,” <span data-pg='430'></span> the “Promised Christ” is the Blessed Perfection (Bahá’u’lláh) and His Highness the Supreme (the Báb). The faith of everyone must revolve around this palpable and evident text. </p>


 <p id='459.5'> My name is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, my identity is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, my qualification is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, my reality is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, my praise is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Thraldom to the Blessed Perfection is my glorious refulgent diadem; and servitude to all the human race is my perpetual religion. Through the bounty and favor of the Blessed Perfection, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the Ensign of the Most-Great-Peace, which is waving from the Supreme Apex; and through the gift of the Greatest Name, he is the Lamp of Universal Salvation, which is shining with the light of the love of God. The Herald of the Kingdom is he, so that he may awaken the people of the East and of the West. The Voice of Friendship, Uprightness, Truth and Reconciliation is he, so as to cause acceleration throughout all regions. No name, no title, no mention, no commendation hath he nor will ever have except ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This is my longing. This is my supreme apex. This is my greatest yearning. This is my eternal life. This is my everlasting glory! Express ye the same thing which is issued from my pen. This is the duty of all. Consequently the friends of God must assist and help ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the adoration of the True One; in the servitude to the human race; in the well-being of the human world and in divine love and kindness. </p>


 <p id='459.6'> O ye friends of God! Through the Appearance of the Blessed Perfection the theories are abrogated and the facts established. The time of superficiality is <span data-pg='431'></span> gone by and the cycle of reality hath appeared. One must become the incarnation of Servitude, the personification of Love, the embodiment of Spirituality and the mirror of Mercy. </p>


 <p id='459.7'> The believers must become the cause of life; deliver the people from heedlessness, call the souls to the perfection of humanity, beckon nations to unity and agreement, destroy the foundations of foreignness, make everyone as friends and associates, treat the negligent souls as their own children, and train and educate them with the utmost love — so that the ignorant become wise, the blind become endowed with light, and the deaf be given hearing. </p>


 <p id='459.8'> O ye friends of God! Beware! Beware of differences! By differences the Temple of God is razed to its very foundation, and by the blowing of the winds of disagreement the Blessed Tree is prevented from producing any fruit. By the intense cold of the diversity of opinions the rose-garden of Unity is withered, and the fire of the love of God is extinguished! O ye friends of God! ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the Manifestation of Thraldom and not “Christ.” The servant of the human realm is he, and not a “chief.” Non-existent is he and not “Existent.” Pure nothingness is he and not “Eternal.”<a data-fnid='187'></a> There is no outcome or result to these discussions. We must put aside these disputes and controversies, nay, rather must we consign them to utter oblivion and <span data-pg='432'></span> arise to do that which is indispensable and which is demanded of us in this Day. Controversies are words and not significances, theories and not realities. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn187'> “In the Tablet in which I stated ‘I am not Christ and am not Eternal,’the meaning is this, that I am not Christ — and not the Eternal Lord! But I am ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This is its real purport. Undoubtedly those souls who are under the shadow of the Blessed Cause, believing and assured, firm and steadfast, and living in accord with the divine exhortations and advices, all of them are confirmed in the everlasting life.” — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </aside>

 <p id='459.9'> The quintessence of Truth is this: We must all become united and harmonized in order to illumine this gloomy world, to abolish the foundations of hostility and animosity from among mankind, to perfume the inhabitants of the universe with the holy fragrances of the nature and disposition of the Beauty of Abhá, to enlighten the people of the East and West with the light of guidance, to hoist the tent of the love of God and suffer each and all to enter under its protection, to bestow comfort and tranquillity to every one under the shade of the Divine Tree, to astonish the enemy by the manifestation of the utmost love, to make the ravenous and bloodthirsty wolves to be gazelles of the meadow of the love of God; to administer the taste of non-resistance to the tyrant, to teach long-suffering and resignation of the martyrs to the murderer, to spread the traces of Oneness, to chant the praises and glorification of the Glorious Lord, to raise the voice of “Yá-Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” to the Supreme Apex and to reach the ears of the inhabitants of the Kingdom with the outcry — “Verily the earth is illumined by the lights of its Lord!” This is reality! This is guidance! This is service! This is the consummation of the perfection of the realm of humanity! </p>


 <p id='459.10'> O ye believers of God! Each person must summon the people to the Servitude of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and not the Christhood; and no soul must either publicly or privately utter one word against or in contradiction to the general Teachings, and no one must believe that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá <span data-pg='433'></span> is the “Second Coming of Christ”, nay, rather he must believe that he is the Manifestation of Servitude, the Main-spring of the Unity of the human world, the Herald of the True One with spiritual power throughout all regions, the Commentator of the Book according to the divine text, and the Ransom to each one of the believers of God in the transitory world. </p>

 <p id='462' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O ye sons of the Kingdom!  <a data-fnid='190'></a></p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn190'> To the New York City assembly. </aside>

 <p id='462.2' class='dropcap'> At a time when conditions were most difficult and oppressive and the reception of letters hard and impracticable, your letter was received. Therefore, its reception denoteth that the honorable assembly is confirmed. I hope from the bounties of His Highness the Incomparable One that under all circumstances and conditions ye may become assisted in the service of the Kingdom of God.</p>

 <p id='462.3'> Ye have written regarding the erection of the Temple and the purchase of the ground, or the finding of a place to be as a home for the gathering of the believers. At this moment that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is immersed in the ocean of calamities, this news caused him joy and happiness, that — praise be to God! — the friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful are thinking to serve the Kingdom of God.. </p>


 <p id='462.4'> O ye sanctified souls! It is the time of firmness and steadfastness and the period of arising in the service of the Word of God, for the Blessed City <a data-fnid='191'></a> is environed from all directions with the tempestuous waves of tests and trials and the sweeping hurricanes of persecutions <span data-pg='436'></span> and hardships are blowing and roaring high. The joy and happiness of the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá depends upon the stability and constancy of the believers. For they must live and act in accord with the divine advices and exhortations and show forth to each other the power of the perfection of love with infinite accord and unity, so that they may become the embodiment of one existence, the waves of one sea, the myrtles of one rose-garden, the rays of one sun, the stars of one horizon, the fruits of one tree and the birds of one meadow. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn191'> ‘Akká. </aside>

 <p id='462.5'> Likewise, they must treat with and behave toward all the governments, nations, communities, kings and subjects with the utmost sincerity, trustworthiness, straightforwardness, love and kindness. Even they must make hopeful a bloodthirsty enemy, show sympathy with the utmost faithfulness and honor to the perfidious unjust, know the ill-wisher as the well-wisher and torment not the sinner with reproaches. Should they become the targets of a thousand arrows of persecution, they must challenge it with love and friendship and treat every one with purity of purpose and kindness. </p>


 <p id='462.6'> O ye friends of God! Show ye an endeavor that all the nations and communities of the world, even the enemies, put their trust, assurance and hope in you; that if a person falls into errors for a hundred-thousand times he may yet turn his face to you, hopeful that you will forgive his sins; for he must not become hopeless, neither grieved nor despondent. This is the conduct and the manner of the people of Bahá. This is the foundation of the most high pathway! Ye should conform your conduct and manners with the advices of <span data-pg='437'></span> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>


 <p id='462.7'> Concerning the erection of the Temple: Now all the believers must become united, so that the Temple may be built soon in one place. For should (the believers) undertake (the erection of the Temple) in many places, it will not become completed anywhere; and as in Chicago they have preceded every other place to plan the erection of the Temple, undoubtedly to co-operate and help them is nobler and a necessity. Then, when it is built in one place, it will become erected in many other places. If, for the present, you prepare or establish a home in New York, though by renting it, to become a center for the gathering of the believers of God, it is very acceptable. God willing, in all the states of America in the future there will be erected Temples with infinite architectural beauty, art, with pleasing proportion and handsome and attractive appearances; especially in New York. But for the present, be ye satisfied with a rented place. </p>


 <p id='462.8'> The utmost happiness was produced by hearing the news of unity and agreement among the believers in New York; for the foundation of progress is union and when this object is attained, the Cause will develop. </p>


 <p id='462.9'> Deliver on my behalf longing greeting to his honor Mr. ______. </p>


 <p id='462.10'> When the friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful gather together on Sundays, in the spiritual assemblies, exercise ye toward them on behalf of this imprisoned one, the utmost affection, love and kindness. </p>


 <p id='462.11'> Convey on behalf of this longing one the glad-tidings of the attainment to confirmation to his honor Mr. ______; that ere long he shall in such wise be assisted <span data-pg='438'></span> by the confirmations of the Kingdom of Abhá that he, himself, will become astonished. </p>


 <p id='462.12'> O ye members of the spiritual assembly! Become ye firm and steadfast in the Covenant and Testament to such a degree that your meeting become the expression of one soul and endeavor ye with your hearts and minds so that ye may become the cause of the illumination of this darkened world and that through your efforts the lights of the Kingdom dawn upon this nether sphere. </p>


 <p id='462.13'> Whatever hath and will transpire in this land is through the conspiracy of the brothers who are not resting, neither day nor night, and are thirsting for the blood of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The government is not responsible at all. These difficulties are brought about through the evil slanders and machinations of the náqiḍín.<a data-fnid='192'></a> </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn192'> Náqiḍín — violators, i.e., those who reject after having professed allegiance. Here it refers particularly to those scattered few who profess to believe in Bahá’u’lláh but who refuse to follow His command to turn to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Centre of the Covenant, as appointed by Bahá’u’lláh. </aside>

No, by no means! Verily, the Word of God penetrates into the core of all things and cannot be resisted either by the hosts of the world or by the armies of the enemies! In the past ages there is a warning to every intelligent one! Ye shall see their banners reversed, their sign abolished, their happiness destroyed in those regions in a similar way to the disappointment of their hopes in the East. </p>


 <p id='463.5'> “But, as the people of the West are still children in the Cause <a data-fnid='194'></a> and have not perfect knowledge of its reality and validity, the náqiḍín thought it to be an easy prey and availed themselves of this opportunity for laying doubts and suspicions, speaking false words, divulging seditious calumnies among the people.

Therefore it is incumbent upon thee to enkindle thyself with <span data-pg='447'></span> the fire of the love of God in order that thy words may have an effect in hearts which are as of hard stone. </p>

Rejoice thou by the bounty of thy Lord which hath encompassed the whole existence and sing and warble with the most wonderful melody in the rose-garden of knowledge. Verily thy Lord, the Beneficent, will confirm thee in every moment and second and will empower thee with such a power that the columns of warfare and bloodshed shall shake and the foundation of peace and harmony shall arise.” </p>

Therefore, never deny the spiritual things to the material, rather both are incumbent upon thee. Nevertheless, at the time when thou art working for such a scientific attainment, thou must be controlled by the attraction of the love of thy Glorious Lord and mindful of mentioning His Splendid Name.

Then know thou verily all the souls are created according to the nature of God and all are in the state of (unconscious) purity at the time of the births. But afterward they differ from one another insofar as they acquire excellencies or defects. Nevertheless, the creatures have different degrees in existence insofar as the creation goes, for capacities are different, but all of them are good and pure (in their essence), then afterward they are polluted and defiled. Although there are different states of creation, yet all of them are beneficial. glance thou over the temple of man, its members and its parts. Among them there are the eye, ear, nose, mouth, hands and fingers. Notwithstanding the differences between these organs, all of them are useful in their proper spheres. But if one of them is out of order, there is need of a remedy and if the medicine does not heal, then the amputation of that member becomes necessary. </p>

 <p id='483.8' class='blockquote'>  3. <b>STEADFASTNESS</b>.</p>

 <p id='483.9' class='blockquote'>  4. <b>TRUTHFULNESS</b>. Truthfulness is the foundation of all the virtues of the world of humanity. Without truthfulness, progress and success in all of the worlds of God are impossible for a soul.

 <p id='483.10' class='blockquote'>   5. <b>UPRIGHTNESS</b>. And this is one of the greatest divine attainments.</p>

 <p id='483.11' class='blockquote'>   6. <b>FIDELITY</b>. This is also a beautiful trait of the heavenly man.</p>

 <p id='483.12' class='blockquote'>   7. <b>EVANESCENCE</b> or HUMILITY. That is to say, man must become evanescent in God. Must forget his own selfish conditions that he may thus arise to the station of sacrifice. It should be to such a degree that if he sleep, it should not be for pleasure, but to rest the body in order to do better, to speak better, to explain more beautifully, to serve the servants of God and to prove the truths. When he remains awake, he should seek to be attentive, serve the Cause of God and sacrifice his own stations for those of God. When he attains to this station, the confirmations of the Holy Spirit will surely reach him, and man with this power can withstand all who inhabit the earth.</p>

 <p id='485' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou seeker of the Kingdom! </p>

 <p id='485.2' class='dropcap'> Thy letter *** was received. Its contents became evident. Thou hast written concerning Baltimore — this caused me great joy. </p>

 <p id='485.5'> The news of Camp Mineola brought me utmost joy and fragrance. I pray to God that the power of the Word of God may become more evident and manifest day by day in those regions. </p>


 <p id='485.6'> Convey my respectful greeting to the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ______, likewise to Miss. ______ I supplicate <span data-pg='462'></span> in their behalf that God may bestow upon them heavenly illumination. </p>


 <p id='485.7'> In another letter *** thou hast expressed sorrow and grief concerning the events in the Holy Land. On the contrary, (these events) must cause joy, happiness and exultation, for this is the day of trial and the occasion for the manifestation of the secrets of the soul and heart. Have the utmost joy about the incidents in the Holy Land and do not consider from any other viewpoint; for the deluge of affliction is surrounding always the Holy Land and the sincere servant of the True One is like unto the enkindled lamp around about which the adverse winds blow. Therefore, you must engage in your own occupation, be familiar in spreading the fragrances of God and characterized in promulgating the Word of God. For instance, if you receive news that the Holy Land is entirely changed, you must not become relaxed at all; nay rather you must become firmer, more steadfast and more attracted and more engaged in the service of the Kingdom. </p>

 <p id='487'> Thy last letter was received and its contents brought joy. Thank thou God, for thou art engaged in serving the Word of God and spending thy time with the friends of God. If thou somewhat regard thy father and mother, too, so, that they may be somewhat pleased, this will be the cause of pleasing me. Father and mother are worthy of esteem and it is necessary (to secure their good pleasure); but this on condition that they may not prevent one from nearness to the Threshold of the Almighty and may not withhold one from walking in the path of the Kingdom. Nay, rather they (parents) should encourage and inspire one <span data-pg='464'></span> (to walk in God’s path). </p>

 <p id='487.2'> As to living (or conduct) in accord with the Book of Aqdas: We have spoken of this to his honor Mr. ______, for there is freedom in those lands and there are no obstacles. </p>


 <p id='487.3'> Likewise, the I<u>sh</u>ráqát, Ṭarázát, and Tajallíyát <a data-fnid='202'></a> must be translated and published (and spread) among the friends. </p>

  <aside class='fn' id='fn202'> Names of some important Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, published in 1906. </aside>

 <p id='487.4'> But, whatever writings and articles which the believers may write for the spread of the Cause of God, these they must necessarily send to the Holy Land, in order to be corrected and rectified (or approved of) and then to be returned to them and them published. Before their being corrected here and before securing permission from here, their publication is by no means allowable. </p>


 <p id='487.5'> As to the obligatory prayer (to be said three times a day): Each one must say his prayer alone by himself, and this is not conditional on a private place; that is, both at home and in the worshipping-place, which is a gathering-place, it is allowable for one to say his prayer; but each person must say his prayer by himself (i.e., not in company with others who might recite the same words and continue the same postures together at the same time). But if they chant supplications (communes, etc.) together (and in company), in a good and effective voice, that is very good. </p>

The members of that committee must be composed of several Persians and several Americans, all of whom must have the utmost proficiency in both the Persian and English languages. Then the Tablets will be translated through this committee. For the present the organization of such a committee is not possible. Therefore, whenever the publication of a Tablet becomes necessary, have a proficient person translate it, then circulate it and the end will be attained. </p>


 <p id='491.4'> Regarding the station of this servant: My station is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, my name is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, my qualification is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, my praise is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, my title is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. All the friends of God must declare this word, in order that all of them become united and harmonized upon it. No difference must arise. Collect, translate, print and spread all the Tablets written by me regarding this question. </p>

 <p id='492.3' class='dropcap'> This Feast was established by His Highness the Báb, to occur once in nineteen days. Likewise, the Blessed Perfection [Bahá’u’lláh] hath commanded, encouraged and reiterated it. Therefore, it hath the utmost importance. Undoubtedly you must give the greatest attention to its establishment and raise it to the highest point of importance, so that it may become continual and constant. The believers of God must assemble and associate with each other in the utmost love, joy and fragrance. They must conduct themselves (in these Feasts) with the greatest dignity and consideration, chant divine verses, peruse instructive articles, read the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, encourage and inspire each other with love for the whole human race, invoke God with perfect joy and fragrance, sing the verses, glorifications and praises of the Self-subsistent Lord and deliver eloquent speeches. The owner of the house must personally serve the beloved <span data-pg='469'></span> ones. He must seek after the comfort of all and with the utmost humility he must show forth kindness to every one. If the Feast is arranged in this manner and in the way mentioned, that supper is the “Lord’s supper,” for the result is the same result and the effect is the same effect. </p>

 <p id='492.5'> Thou hast written concerning the Tablet of Bika Yá ‘Alí — Bika Yá Vafí (Tablet of Protection). This Tablet is for the healing of ailments. Whenever one is anxious about the recovery of an ill one, he may read this prayer with a melodious voice while in a state of the utmost attention and concentration. </p>


 <p id='492.6'> Thou hast written regarding Buddha and Confucius. Buddha was an illustrious personage. Confucius became the cause of civilization, advancement and prosperity for the people of China. Now it is not the time when we discuss concerning the stations and positions of those who are passed away. We must concentrate our attention upon the present. What hath transpired in a former time is past. Now is the time when we restrict our discussion to the Most Great Luminary of Peace and Salvation in this Age, to talk of the Blessed Perfection [Bahá’u’lláh] and to voice His exhortations, behests and teachings. Buddha and Confucius were kings in bygone ages who have disappeared. <span data-pg='470'></span> Their sovereignty in this world is ended and their cycle is completed. Now the Throne of the Kingdom of Abhá is established and the Blessed Perfection is sitting upon the Throne of Grandeur. We must raise this Call, promulgate the Word of God and live in accord with the teachings and advices of the Beauty of Abhá. </p>


 <p id='492.7'> Thou hast written regarding ______, the resident of Calcutta (India), that he hath forwarded to thee some addresses so that thou mayest correspond with them about the Cause of God. If thou dost write to them there is no harm done, nay, rather it is advantageous. </p>


 <p id='492.8'> But regarding the tests: Undoubtedly they must be violent so that those souls who are weak may fall back, while the souls who are firm and sincere may shine forth from the horizon of the Most Great Guidance like unto the sparkling stars. </p>

<p id='518.2'> Now I have found the opportunity to answer the petitions recently received and forward them to you in this mail. </p>

<p id='518.3' class='dropcap'> Regarding the subject of Persia: Praise be to God! she became the East of the Sun of Truth in this age. The Light of Eternity dawned, the Everlasting Glory unveiled her countenance and the Reality of Mercifulness became manifest. This is the prosperity of Persia. Undoubtedly she will progress day by day under the shade of the Blessed Tree until her illumination shall penetrate throughout the wide expanse of the earth. </p>

<p id='518.4'> Regarding the question of the establishment of the National Assembly: This National Assembly <a data-fnid='209'></a> will not bring any rapid results. Now some of the agitators are harboring evil intentions and do not let agreement and union be realized between the nations and the government. They are instigating the hopeless ones at every moment and sending them to the British Legation, while on the other hand they ask private assistance and protection <span data-pg='490'></span> from the government so that they may procure wealth. Each and all of the clergy are thinking in this line. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn209'> Established Sept. 12, 1906 </aside>

<p id='518.5'> However, we have nothing to do with these proceedings and counter-proceedings. We are commanded to quicken the souls, to train the characters, to illumine the realm of man, to guide all the inhabitants of the earth, to create concord and unity among all men and to lead the world of humanity to the Fountain of the Everlasting Glory. The reformation of one empire is not our aim; nay, rather we invoke from God that all the regions of the world be reformed and cultivated; the republic of men become the manifestors of the bounty of the most glorious Lord; the East and the West be brought nearer together; and that the Turk and Tajik, Írán and America, India and Arabia, Japan and Persia, China and Germany; in brief, all the nations and peoples of the world become as one soul and one spirit, in order that strife and warfare be entirely removed and the rancor and hostility disappear so that all become as the waves of one ocean, the drops of one sea, the flowers of one rose-garden, the trees of one orchard, the grains of one harvest and the plants of one meadow. </p>

<p id='518.6'> Regarding the statement that hath been given out as the saying of His Majesty the <u>Sh</u>áh: This hath no connection whatever with the Bahá’ís; nay, rather it hath meant the Bábís. Mírzá Yaḥyá, the son of Mírzá Hádí of Dawlih Ábád, and a few souls of Azalís <a data-fnid='210'></a> who are living in Ṭihrán and were at one time secret friends of Jamáli’d-Dín of Af<u>gh</u>án, have allied themselves with the party, which is working against the government,<span data-pg='491'></span> and is engaged in the work of instigating and inciting the people. His Imperial Majesty did mean these souls, that is, the Bábís, not the Bahá’ís. But it is an established fact that the Bahá’ís are the well-wishers of the nation and the government; are showing forth obedience and displaying good intentions; are not interfering in political matters; are engaged in the education and spiritualization of characters and are occupied with the training of the ignorant ones. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn210'> Followers of Ṣubḥ-i-Azal who disturbed the Bábís by claiming to be the One promised by the Báb. </aside>

<p id='518.7'> O thou who art firm in the Covenant! The general historical report about the Cause of God in that country,<a data-fnid='211'></a> that thou hast forwarded to Man<u>sh</u>ádí,<a data-fnid='212'></a> became very acceptable. Undoubtedly you must, every few months, write a report about the general conditions and attitudes of the Cause of God in America and forward it to ‘Akká, so that we may send it to Persia to be printed and spread among the people. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn211'> America. </aside>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn212'> One of the well-known Bahá’ís of Egypt. </aside>

<p id='518.8'> O thou yearning servant of the Beauty of Abhá! In the time that all the ulemas and sages, leaders, merchants and traders, nay, even the public itself from the highest to the lowest have taken refuge in the British Legation and began to complain and clamor that they are oppressed, His royal highness <u>Sh</u>u‘á’s-Sulṭánih, the son of the <u>Sh</u>áh, cried in the Assembly of Nobles: “These ‘ulamás and <u>Sh</u>í‘ahs leaders are always stigmatizing the Bahá’ís, saying, ‘They are the ill-wishers of the government and the corruptors of nations!’ Now consider ye with the eye of justice! Sixty years have rolled by and the Bahá’ís have been the object of the sword of affliction and the target of the arrows of oppression. Thousands of houses have been destroyed, <span data-pg='492'></span> children became captives, women became prisoners, property was pillaged and not even a small child remained safe; yet, notwithstanding all of this, not one single Bahá’í took refuge under the flag of a foreign power! Now these <u>Sh</u>í‘ahs, though they have always been treated with the utmost favor and benefit by the government, yet without the slightest reason they went under the protection of a foreign power and brought down such humiliation and dishonor upon the nation and the government! If they presented primarily their petitions to the government, their wishes would be complied with in a better and more effective way. This is the difference between the <u>Sh</u>í‘ahs and the Bahá’ís!” </p>

  </div>

<p id='519' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='519.2' class='dropcap'> I have received the eloquent article which thou hast written at the moment of the arrival of the most great glad-tidings regarding the establishment of the National Assembly and organization of the constitutional and judicial government of Persia according to the evident command of the Book of Aqdas, and the spontaneous joy and the genuine sympathy demonstrated by the people of science and discernment in America at hearing this soul-refreshing news, and the utmost happiness to the members of the Legation. I read it and it became the cause of the utmost joy and fragrance. </p>

<p id='519.3'> The Constitutional Government, according to the irrefutable text of the Religion of God, is the cause of the glory and prosperity of the nation and the civilization and freedom of the people. However, according to what is known, the hands of the selfish leaders from among the ulemas (Muḥammadan clergy) are in this <span data-pg='493'></span> affair. Outwardly they are desiring the establishment of the National Assembly and at every moment they are crying and clamoring (for its immediate realization), but inwardly they are sowing the seeds of corruption and agitation and try to put at naught the noble intention of the government. In the secret of their hearts and souls they do not favor the upbuilding of the National Assembly, the civilization of Persia, the awakening of the people, the advancement of the age, the spreading of knowledge and public instruction, Thieves like to lurk in darkness; fishers desire disturbed water; the bat shuns the rays of the sun; the black beetle dislikes the fragrance of the rose-garden; the ferocious wolf is in expectation of the sleet and snow; and the wine seller sees his advantage in the inebriate, irrational drinker. These leaders of religion also desire to behold the nation thrown into a weltering chaos of ignorance so that the rein of affairs remain in the hands of the arrogant ulemas. They know that if the nation began to adore wisdom, truthfulness, progression and fidelity, it would bring about their (the ulemas) degradation. </p>

<p id='519.4'> However, rest ye assured upon the favor and bounty of His Highness the Almighty; for the Imperial throne of Persia is confirmed and the Crown of the Sovereignty of the East is protected. Undoubtedly the noble purpose of His Imperial Majesty will play an important role in the development of Persia. May God help and send victory from the Supreme Kingdom, the heavenly powers become supporters and the mercy and bestowal of His Highness the Merciful One become the helpers! Be ye engaged in prayer that with the utmost good-pleasure <span data-pg='494'></span> the nation obey the government, comply with the wise counsels of the attendants of the central dominion, give no heed to the hearsay of the agitators and rise not to quarrel with to protest against the government like unto the Russian Douma, so as to throw the whole empire, the nation and the kingdom into a sea of anarchy and lawlessness. Much prayer is needed so that God may help and protect. </p>

<p id='519.5'> The marks of kindness that thou hast shown to his honor Mr. ______ became highly acceptable. You must treat the strangers, at all times, in this manner and help, as far as possible, all the nations of the world. </p>

<p id='519.6'> O thou who art firm in the Covenant! Truly, I say, thou art firm and have risen to perform the conditions of firmness. This very matter of his honor Mr. ______ is a sign of wonder to all men and the greatest proof of the power of the Word of God and the penetration of the servitude of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. As thou art walking in this road and art steadfast in this path, know thou of a certainty that the assistance of Providence will descend upon thee and the confirmation of the Kingdom unveil herself to thee. </p>

<p id='520' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art firm in the covenant! </p>

<p id='520.2' class='dropcap'> An article in the Broadway Magazine of September, 1906, written by G. A. Dobson and published in New York, was read. It is entitled, “The Strangest Religion in New York.” Unquestionably, you get that magazine and read it. The writer complains of the Ottoman government and its treatment toward the Bahá’í community. There is no doubt that this article will be read by His Excellency the Turkish Minister or the <span data-pg='495'></span> members of the Legation. The truth is that His Imperial Majesty the Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd <u>Kh</u>án hath exercised the utmost justice towards ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Although the internal and external enemies entered into an alliance, wrote reports full of pure calumnies and baseless impositions, became themselves the complainers and witnesses, a body of examiners came from Constantinople for the investigation of the true situation and that committee of commissioners became united with the outside and inside enemies, ratifying all the impositions and adding to those some more important matters, yet His Imperial Majesty ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd <u>Kh</u>án — may God assist him! — acted with deliberation until it became known and evident that all these calumnies were founded upon rancor and hostility. Therefore, he hath treated us, until this present time, with the utmost justice and because of this treatment we are exceedingly happy. If there were any other king beside His Imperial Majesty Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd <u>Kh</u>án, he would exercise his authority in another way in the face of these unjust imputations and conspiracies of the external and internal foes. Nevertheless, the justice and equity of the Sulṭán prevented the attacks of the enemies and the reports of the people of oppositions and falsehood from producing any effect. Therefore, all the friends must pray from their hearts in behalf of their Imperial Majesties the Padeshah of the Ottomans and the <u>Sh</u>áh of Persia. As in these days His Imperial Majesty Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd <u>Kh</u>án is in a state of illness and indisposition, therefore the believers of God, in meetings and assemblages, in private and public, must invoke from the Threshold of Oneness <span data-pg='496'></span> swift recovery for him. The friends and strangers must know and realize that all the believers of God have the utmost love for His Majesty the Padeshah of the Ottoman empire and that they are entreating for him protection and confirmation. </p>

<p id='521' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='521.2' class='dropcap'> The International Congress of Religions was organized this year <a data-fnid='213'></a> in the capital of Japan. Many souls hastened to that empire from different parts of the world, in order that they might talk of and discuss the principles of their own religions, each one longing to convert that assembly to his own religion and establish the validity of his own particular belief. This congress had under discussion the politics of the religions. In truth, it is not a political affair and not the attraction of the heart, faith, advancement toward God nor enkindlement with the fire of the love of God. This congress will not produce a lasting effect, for it is essentially politico-religious. What is effective and conducive to the penetration of the Word of God and the attraction of hearts is the fragrances of holiness and the divine glad-tidings, which the members of the congress do not in the least comprehend. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn213'> During 1906. </aside>

<p id='521.3'> Consequently, if the believers of God go to that country — not to the congress — and through the power of the Word of God, the breath of the Holy Spirit, the reading of the verses of Oneness and associating with the individual inhabitants of that kingdom, undoubtedly untold and tremendous results will be realized and the sweet fragrance of the rose-garden of mysteries will <span data-pg='497'></span> perfume the nostrils of the people of those regions. It is significantly useful if some of the friends of God put forth an effort and hasten from America to those parts (Japan). </p>

<p id='521.4'> O thou servant of God! Unquestionably, through the manifestation of the Infinite Power in this glorious age, wonderful signs will appear in the world and great changes are seen in the present and promised in the future, for the Word of God is like unto the Spirit, and the contingent world like unto the embryo in the womb of the mother. Through the power of the Spirit such various changes and metamorphoses become apparent, transforming them from one form to another. Especially in Persia, through the power of the Word of God, wonderful signs will appear. </p>

<p id='521.5'> O thou servant of the True One! Though I had not the opportunity of reading one line of the paper *** yet I read it with the utmost attention. Truly, I say, it was a superior paper and the details of the reception of the two great ambassadors in the house of the favored and attracted maid-servant of God, Miss. ______, became known. Such receptions are very acceptable and praiseworthy. You must all show forth the utmost consideration to these two ambassadors, neither do ye fall short in serving them in whatever manner possible. </p>

<p id='521.6'> It is very acceptable for you to present to them the excellent praises which the Blessed Perfection hath made in behalf of these two governments, the exhortations which He hath delivered for obedience to them and the prayers He hath written for the confirmation and protection of His Imperial Majesty the <u>Sh</u>áh. <span data-pg='498'></span> Likewise, the advices and recommendations that this servant (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, himself) hath written in Tablets to Persia and America; also the irrefutable command that the Blessed Perfection hath given in Tablets that the believers must obey the kings with the utmost sincerity and fidelity, and He hath forbidden them to interfere at all with political problems. He hath even prohibited the believers from discussing political affairs. </p>

<p id='521.7'> Convey respectful greeting on my behalf to the favored maid-servant of God, Miss. ______, with the utmost kindness and announce to her: “These services and self-sacrifices of thine in the Kingdom of God are acceptable.” </p>

<p id='521.8'> O thou servant of the Blessed Perfection! Since I have found this paper very eloquent, I send it to Persia. </p>

<p id='521.9'> O thou dear friend! I entreat from His Highness the Desired One that He may grant divine confirmation to that illumined youth to such an extent that he may become the main-spring of spiritual emotions in those regions. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn214'> To the Fair Hope (Ala.) assembly. </aside>

<p id='525.2' class='dropcap'> When the darkness of ignorance and heedlessness concerning the realm of eternity and bereavement (or deprivation) from the True One had encircled the universe, then the resplendent Luminary dawned and the brilliant Light illumined the horizon of the East. Hence, the Sun of Reality shone forth, scattering the sparkling lights of the Kingdom to the East and to the West. Those who had seeing eyes found the Most Great Glad-tidings, began to cry the call, “O blessed are we! O blessed are we!” — and have beheld the reality of things in themselves, have discovered the mysteries of the Kingdom, were released from superstition and doubts, perceived the lights of Truth and became so intoxicated with the cup of the love of God, that, wholly forgetting themselves and the world while dancing, they ran with utmost joy and ecstacy to the city of Martyrdom, sacrificing their minds and their lives upon the alter of Love. </p>

<p id='525.3'> But those who were blinded became astonished and on account of these joyous acclamations were bewildered and beginning to cry, “Where is the light?” and said, “We do not behold any light, we do not see any rising sun! It is void of any truth! This is pure imagination!” </p>

<p id='525.4'> However, they have hastened bat-like in the darkness below the ground, and according to their own <span data-pg='503'></span> thoughts they have found a little comfort and tranquility. Nevertheless, it is yet the early dawn and the strength of the heat and rays of the Sun of Truth have not yet made their torrid and complete impression. When it reacheth the zenith, the heat will interpenetrate with such great intensity that it will move and spur to the greatest velocity even the insects below the earth. Although they are not able to behold the light, yet the penetration of the heat will move and agitate all of them. </p>

<p id='525.5'> Consequently, O ye friends of God, be ye thankful that in the Day of Effulgence ye have turned your faces to the Orb of the regions and beheld the Lights! Ye have received a portion from the rays of Truth and are endowed with a share from the Everlasting Outpouring. Therefore, ye must not rest one minute, but thank Him for this bestowal. </p>

<p id='525.6'> Be ye not seated and silent! Diffuse the glad-tidings of the Kingdom far and wide to the ears, promulgate the Word of God, and put into practice the advices and covenants of God; that is, arise ye with such qualities and attributes that ye may continually bestow life to the body of the world, and nurse the infants of the universe up to the station of maturity and perfection. Enkindle with all your might in every meeting the light of the love of God, gladden and cheer every heart with the utmost loving-kindness, show forth your love to strangers just as you show forth to your relations. If a soul is seeking to quarrel, ask ye for reconciliation; if he blame ye, praise [him]; if he give you a deadly poison, bestow ye an all-healing antidote; if he createth death, administer ye eternal life; if he <span data-pg='504'></span> becometh a thorn, change ye into roses and hyacinths. Perchance, through such deeds and words, this darkened world will become illuminated, this terrestrial universe will become transformed into a heavenly realm, and this satanic prison become a divine court; warfare and bloodshed be annihilated, and love and faithfulness hoist the tent of unity upon the apex of the world. </p>

  </div>

<p id='541' class='nodropcap italic larger'>   O thou seeker after Truth! </p>

<p id='541.2' class='dropcap'> The question of the Trinity, since the time of His Holiness Christ until now, is the belief of the Christians, and to the present time all the learned among them are perplexed and confounded. All have confessed that the question is beyond the grasp of reason, for three cannot become one, nor one three. To unite these is impossible; it is either one or three. If we say the Essence of Divinity is divided, even in some aspects, division is one of the necessities of the contingent world and of generation, but the Ancient is holy (i.e., whole and indivisible). If we say that the Trinity was <span data-pg='513'></span> originally one and was later divided, change and transformation will be necessarily applied to the Essence of Oneness, and change and transformation are necessities of the contingent world and not of the Essence of Divinity. If we say this number is Ancient, three Ancients become necessary, and among the three some are distinguished which are also Ancients. In this wise five Ancients are the result, and among the five are those who are distinguished and thus nine Ancients become necessary, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. </p>

<p id='541.3'> Thus considered, Trinity is made a necessity, although the falsity of Trinity is evident. Furthermore, the signs of oneness are evident and plain in all existence. If thou shouldst gather all existent beings, thou wouldst be unable to find two alike in all states and qualities; of necessity there is difference. Thus the signs of oneness are manifest and evident in all things. How much more is the Creator of all things! </p>

<p id='541.4'> But there are, in the Gospels, clear expressions indicative of Trinity; among them: “The Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father.” As Christians did not understand the meaning of this expression, their thoughts were scattered. </p>

<p id='541.5'> The reality of this question is as follows: Divine Oneness is proven and He revealeth Himself in the Holy Essences. The sun is one sun but manifesteth itself in different mirrors. If thou lookest into the mirror and seest the manifestation of the sun, thou wilt say, the sun is in the mirror and this sun manifest in the mirror is the same sun of the heavens; although two suns, yet in reality they are one. The sun hath not descended from its high and lofty station, it hath not <span data-pg='514'></span> taken up its abode in this mirror, but hath manifested itself therein. </p>

<p id='541.6'> The Christ reality was like unto a pure mirror and the Sun of Reality shone upon it from the Holy Horizon. Therefore, it became evident that the sun is one with regard to reality but manifesting itself in all mirrors. </p>

<p id='541.7'> This question was explained in full for Miss. ______, who translated it upon paper. Thou wilt soon learn thereof.<a data-fnid='221'></a>  This difficult question in its entirety was elucidated, explained and proven. </p>

<p id='542.2' class='dropcap'> The Supper of the Lord which His Highness the Spirit (Christ) ate with the apostles was a heavenly supper and not one of material bread and water, for material objects have no connection with spiritual objects. As at that time material food was also present, therefore the leaders of the religion of Christ thought that it was material food which was changed into spiritual food. </p>

<p id='542.3'> The proof that it was not material food is this: The apostles upon many occasions partook of material food with His Highness Christ, yet the supper of that night became designated as the “Lord’s Supper.” From this designation it is plain and evident that they ate heavenly food at that supper. That heavenly food consisted of the love of God, the knowledge of God, the mysteries of God and the bestowal of <span data-pg='515'></span> God. </p>

Today the grandeur, the majesty, the splendor and the magnitude of this station is not clear and manifest because it is the time of seed-sowing and <span data-pg='532'></span> the beginning of the planting of trees in the orchard of the Merciful One. When that seed is grown and the tree reacheth the time of its fruition, then many harvests shall be gathered and all regions and kingdoms shall be adorned with its blossoms and fruits. </p>

<p id='566.4'> Ere long the Adored One of this providence will become the Beloved of the assemblages of the world and the rays of the Sun of Truth will illumine every house, every place and corner. At that time the greatness and superiority of the friends of God will become evident and demonstrated. </p>

<p id='566.5'> Consider ye! In the day of His Highness Christ, the grandeur and majesty of their Holiness the Apostles, was not known. After three-hundred years the loftiness of the station and the exaltation of their attainment became manifest. Ere long the result of the deeds in this cycle of Bahá’u’lláh will appear and every one of the friends and the maid-servants will be crowned with a diadem whose splendid gems will radiate brilliancy and effulgence throughout cycles and ages. </p>

<p id='566.6'> Therefore, O ye servants of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful One, do ye not rest for one moment! Do ye not seek any composure! Do ye not wish for any rest and ease! endeavor and make ye an effort with all your heart and soul to spread the fragrances of Paradise, to raise the eternal melody of the Kingdom of Abhá, to establish the gathering of fellowship, to become assisted with the confirmations of the Holy Spirit; to clothe the temple of existence with a new garment; to bestow eternal life upon the reality of souls; to become a cause of the civilization of the <span data-pg='533'></span> human world; to characterize the bloodthirsty animals with the heavenly attributes and divine commemorations; to pacify the world with peace and salvation, and to adorn man with the favors of His Highness the Merciful One; that perchance ignorance, animosity and strangeness may be removed entirely from among the denizens of the world, and the Banner of Reconciliation, Freedom, Nobleness and Oneness be hoisted; for the chains of existence contain countless links, each connected with the other. This connection is the cause of the appearance of the invisible powers of the world of the visible. </p>

<p id='566.7'> O ye real friends! Make ye an effort that this universe may become another universe and this darkened world find a ray of the Sun of Truth and become luminous and refulgent. </p>

<p id='566.8'> I entreat God that this favor may be realized and this unending outpouring become manifest and apparent, and the friends of God be confirmed by every bounty. </p>

  </div>

<p id='572' class='nodropcap italic larger'>   O thou wooer of Truth and attracted one toward the Kingdom of God! </p>

<p id='572.2' class='dropcap'> Thy detailed letter was received and its reading produced the utmost joy, for it was a glorious proof of the loftiness of thy aim and the exaltation of thine intention. Praise be to God! that thou art the well-wisher of the human world, art attracted to the Kingdom of Abhá and art aspiring for the advancement of the realm of humanity. I hope that, through the instrumentality of these lofty thoughts, attractions of <span data-pg='537'></span> heart and heavenly glad-tidings, thou mayest become so illumined that, through the mildly beaming splendor of the love of God, thou mayest shine and gleam throughout centuries and cycles. </p>

<p id='572.3'> Thou hast written that thou art a student in the progressive spiritual school. Happy is thy condition! If the various progressive schools join themselves to the universal university of the Kingdom, such knowledge and sciences will be brought into light that man will see that the potentialities of the “Open Tablet” of existence are infinite; will realize that all the created things are as letters and words; will be instructed in the lessons of the degrees of significances; will perceive the signs of oneness in the primordial atoms of the earth; will hear the voice of the Lord of the Kingdom; will behold the confirmations of the Holy Spirit and will find such ecstasy and joy that, being unable to contain himself in the vast area of existence, he will prepare himself for the journey toward the Kingdom and will hasten to the immensity of the Realm of Might. As soon as a bird is fledged, it cannot keep itself on the ground; nay, rather it soareth up toward the Supreme Apex — except the birds whose feet are tied, whose wings are clipped and feathers broken and who are soiled with water and clay. </p>

<p id='572.4'> O seeker of Truth! The realm of the Kingdom is a unit. The only difference lies in this: That when the season of spring dawneth, a new and wonderful motion and rejuvenation is witnessed in all the existing things; the mountains and the meadows are revived; the trees find freshness and delicacy and are clothed with radiant and bright leaves, blossoms and fruits. In a <span data-pg='538'></span> like manner the preceding Manifestations form an inseparable link with the subsequent dispensations; nay, rather they are identical with each other. Since the world is constantly developing itself, the rays become stronger, the outpourings becometh greater and the sun appeareth in the meridian orbit. </p>

<p id='572.5'> O thou yearner after the Kingdom! Each Manifestation is the heart of the world and the proficient Physician of every patient. The world of humanity is sick, but the skilled Physician hath the healing remedy and He bestoweth divine teachings, exhortations and advices which are the remedy of every ailment and the dressing for every wound. Undoubtedly, the wise physician discovereth the needs of the patient at every season and prescribeth medicine. Therefore, when thou wilt compare the teachings of the Beauty of Abhá with the requisitions and necessities of the present time, thou wilt conclude that they are to the sick body of the world the swift healing antidote; nay, rather they are the remedy of everlasting health. The prescription of the proficient physicians of the past and the future will not be the same; nay, rather they will be in accord with the ailment of the patient. Although the medicine is changed, yet all of these are for the sole purpose of the healing of the sick. In former dispensations the sick body of the world could not bear the strong and overpowering remedies. That is why His Highness the Christ said: “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when He, the Spirit of the Comforter, who is sent by the Father, is come, He will guide you into all truth.” Therefore, in this age of lights, specific teachings have become universal, <span data-pg='539'></span> in order that the outpouring of the Merciful One environ both the East and the West, the oneness of the Kingdom of humanity become visible and the luminosity of truth enlighten the world of consciousness. The descent of the New Jerusalem is the heavenly religion which secures the prosperity of the human world and is the effulgence of the illumination of the realm of God. In reality Emmanuel was the forerunner of the second coming of His Highness the Christ and the herald of the path of the Kingdom. </p>

<p id='572.6'> This is self-evident that the letter is an organic member of the world. This membership denotes subordination; that is, the letter draws its life from the word and hath spiritual relationship with it and is accounted a part of it. The apostles were the Letters and His Highness Christ the Essence of the Word; and the significance of the Word, which is the Everlasting Outpouring, cast a splendor upon those Letters. Since a Letter is a part of the Word itself, it is intrinsically identical with the Word. </p>

<p id='572.7'> I hope that thou shalt arise to perform all that which His highness Emmanuel hath predicted. Know thou this of a certainty that thou shalt become assisted. The confirmations of the Holy Spirit are descending uninterruptedly. The power of the Word shall penetrate in such wise that the Letter will become the reflective mirror of the Sun of the Word, and the radiation of the lights of the Word shall illumine the whole earth. But the heavenly Jerusalem, which is established upon the Apex of the world and the Holy of Holies of the Almighty, which hath hoisted its banner, comprehendeth and includeth in it all the perfections and teachings of <span data-pg='540'></span> the former dispensations. Likewise, it is the herald of the oneness of the world of humanity, the ensign of universal peace, the spirit of eternal life, the lights of divine perfections, the surrounding bestowal of the realm of existence, the adornment and grandeur of the world of creation and the cause of the tranquility of human-kind. </p>

<p id='572.8'> Turn thy attention toward the holy Tablets. Read and reflect upon the Tablets of I<u>sh</u>ráqát, Tajallíyát, the Words of Paradise, the Glad-tidings, Ṭarázát and the Book of Aqdas.<a data-fnid='228'></a> These divine teachings in this day are the remedy of the ailments of the world of man and the dressing for the wounded body of existence; they are the Spirit of Life, the Ark of Salvation, the Magnet of the Everlasting glory and the penetrative power in the reality of man! </p>

<section class='content tablet' id='tab-573' data-sectionnum='573' data-author='abd'>
  <div class='section_header toc2' id='tab-573_'>
    <h3 class='sectionnum'> — 573 — </h3>
  </div>

<p id='573' class='nodropcap italic larger'>   O thou dear wise man! </p>

<p id='573.2'> Thy letter *** was considered. Its contents were in the utmost of beauty and great joy was realized therefrom. </p>

<p id='573.3' class='dropcap'> Thou hast asked “Is it possible that this new and living Cause is to take the place of the dead religion of England when there hath been organized certain sects who have arrived at high stations of spiritual knowledge and to exalted degrees of merciful powers, and have become distinguished in virtue from all predecessors; notwithstanding this, it is possible that this new Cause will attract the attention of such people to such a degree as to unite their hearts, and gather them under its over-shadowing <span data-pg='541'></span> protection?” </p>

<p id='573.4'> O thou dear friend! Know thou that the Distinguished Individual of every age is according to the virtues of that age. The distinguished Personage who was in the former cycle, His power and virtues were according to the former age, but in this brilliant age and divine cycle, the Noble Personage, the Radiant Star, the Distinguished One, will manifest with virtues which will eventually amaze the peoples, for He is in spiritual virtues and divine perfections loftier than all the Individuals; nay, rather He is the Source of Divine Benediction and the Center of the Radiant Circle. He is certainly comprehensive. There is no doubt that He will reveal Himself to such a degree as to bring all under His over-shadowing shelter. </p>

<p id='573.5'> When thou considereth carefully thou wilt find this order and system to be established in all things. The whole attracteth the part, and the center of the circle is the axis of the compass. Consider His Holiness the Spirit (Christ): Since He was the Center of spiritual power and the Origin of divine benediction, although in the beginning He gathered but a few under His power, yet later through that conquering power, He ushered all sects under the shadow of the Christian tabernacle. Compare the present with the past, see the great difference. By this thou canst measure and reach the reality and know for a certainty that the difference among the sects of the world is due to the difference of comprehensions. As long as the perceptive powers differ, surely the opinions and thoughts also differ. But if One Great Perceptive Power which comprehendeth all, cometh to the Center, the differing opinions become united, and ideal unity and oneness are revealed. <span data-pg='542'></span> For example: when His Holiness, the Spirit (Jesus Christ) appeared, the comprehensions of the creatures, the susceptibilities and minds of the sects then present, such as the Romans, the Greeks, Assyrians and Israelites were different. When the universal power of the Spirit of God appeared in the Center, eventually after three-hundred years, all the differing minds gathered under the protection of the One Center. The same spiritual susceptibilities were attained. </p>

<p id='573.6'> For the sake of illustration (literally, <i>likeness</i>), I will say: When an army is under the command of generals who have differing opinions, certainly it will disagree in regard to maneuvers and in the order of marching to the battlefields. But when the great commander-in-chief who is expert in the arts of warfare cometh to the front, all the differing opinions will be erased and one opinion will prevail; the commander-in-chief will bring all under his own direction. This is an instance and not a likeness. </p>

<p id='573.7'> Now if thou shouldest say, the generals of this army are every one artists in the art of warfare, expert and experienced, why should they obey one person, even though he may have accomplished a great feat — this saying does not deserve attention, for this matter is certain and there is no doubt therein. </p>

<p id='573.8'> Likewise the Holy Manifestations, especially the reality of the Greatest Name, the Beauty of Abhá, when unveiled amid the assemblage of the world, like unto Joseph of Canaan, in the divine Egypt, will appear with such Beauty and Sweetness as to make the lovers of the world His captives. <span data-pg='543'></span> As to the souls who are born into this world radiant entities and who through excessive difficulty are deprived of great benefits and thus leave the world — they are worthy of all sympathy, for in reality this is worthy of regret. It is for this purpose (that is, it is with regard to this wisdom) that the great Manifestations (of God) unveil themselves in this world, bear every difficulty and ordeal — to make these ready souls dawnings of light and confer upon them eternal life. This is the real atonement that His holiness Christ made-He sacrificed Himself for the life of the world. </p>

<p id='573.9'> As to the question that the holy and spiritual souls influence, help and guide the creatures after they have cast off this elemental mould — this is an established truth of the Bahá’ís. Nay even the Holy Manifestations of God extend a great Bounty and an evident Light after their ascent from this world. For His Holiness Christ there was more and greater promotion of the Word, manifestation of divine power, conversion of holy souls, and the giving of eternal life, after [His] martyrdom. Likewise for the Blessed Beauty (Bahá’u’lláh) there was greater bounty and dawning of light, manifestation of divine power, and effectiveness of the Word after His Ascent; and ere long the Sun of His Reality will encircle the world with its motion, heat, radiation and bounty. </p>

<p id='573.10'> Be not sorry on account of the limited extent of the progress of the Bahá’í Cause in that country.<a data-fnid='229'></a>  This is the beginning of the dawn. Consider the Cause of His Holiness Christ, which took three-hundred years to produce great effect. Now sixty years have not passed <span data-pg='544'></span> since the beginning of this Cause, and Its Lights are shed upon all horizons. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn229'> England. </aside>

<p id='573.11'> Regarding the Society for healing of which thou art of a member; when it comes under the protection of the Cause, its power will be a hundred fold. </p>

<p id='573.12'> Thou hast observed how extensive is the love of the Bahá’ís and that the foundation is love. As the power of love among the Bahá’ís is in the utmost degree and superior to that in other religions, it is even the same on other relations, for the cause of all is Love. </p>

<p id='573.13'> As to the question of translating the Books and Tablets of the Blessed Beauty; it will soon be done in all languages with the utmost eloquence and excellence. When the Tablets of His Holiness (Bahá’u’lláh) are translated in accordance with the original, with excellence and eloquence, then the Lights of Significances will dawn and brighten all the eyes. Endeavor thou with all thy power to make the translation as the original. </p>

<p id='573.14'> The Blessed Beauty went to Haifa many times, and thou hast seen Him.<a data-fnid='230'></a>  I hope thou mayest attain the real meeting and that is the witnessing with the eye of insight and not of sight. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn230'> While in Haifa, some years ago, before he became a believer, the recipient of this Tablet saw Bahá’u’lláh and some of the followers and was attracted to Him, but owing to circumstances had no means of communicating with Him at that time. </aside>

<p id='573.15'> The essence of the teachings of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh is Universal Love, which comprehendeth all the virtues of the world of humanity, is the cause of eternal life and of the progress of all the individuals of the human race. Soon thou wilt see that these <span data-pg='545'></span> heavenly teachings, like unto the light of reality, will envelope and enlighten the world. </p>

<p id='573.16'> The short prayer which thou hast written at the end of thy letter is in reality original, beautiful, sweet and effective. Chant it always. </p>

<p id='578' class='nodropcap italic larger'>   O thou seeker of Truth! </p>

<p id='578.2' class='dropcap'> The letter which thou hast written to ______ was received and its contents became known. If thou <span data-pg='547'></span> ask my name and title, it is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and any name beside this is unknown here. Whosoever calleth me by this name, accept from him — otherwise reject. </p>

<p id='578.3'> But about the three questions which thou hast asked for thyself: The first is true. Undoubtedly, when a soul engages in commemoration of the True One, he will naturally feel the rest of soul and tranquility of heart. </p>

<p id='578.4'> The second question about the supernatural power: Without advancing toward the Kingdom of Abhá, it is impossible and inaccessible. But should a soul enter under the shadow of the Blessed Perfection, step into the divine Kingdom, act according to the councils and exhortations of God and practice the New Teachings, unquestionably he will become endowed with a supernatural power. </p>

<p id='578.5'> But about thy third question: “Have I been subjected to such troubles and vicissitudes before?” and the indisputable answer, “No!” — this is also true. </p>

<p id='578.6'> For any soul who walketh in the path of guidance, there is no doubt he shall endure hardships. Consider thou their Highness the Apostles; likewise the Assembly of Christians, who were sanctified souls; what calamities and persecutions hailed them in the Cause during the first and second century and even up to the third century! </p>

<p id='578.7'> Look thou around the world of existence: A little worldly transaction cannot be brought about except through surmounting many an obstacle. How much more important are the objects of the Supreme World! Certainly there existeth troubles, trials, afflictions, persecution, censure and contempt. When thou didst occupy <span data-pg='548'></span> thy time in the past to give out religious exhortations and advices, thou experienced some persecutions and trouble. But thou canst not realize in this present moment what great ordeals are in store and what unbearable calamities, affliction and adversity exist, and that to give up life is the easiest of all those calamities. But the end of all these is bliss, overflowing joy, everlasting exultation, happiness and supreme contentment. It is eternal life, never ending glory, a lordly gift and divine sovereignty! </p>

<p id='578.8'> In brief, thou hast asked concerning my desire for thee: I wish, if thou art worldly, to become heavenly; if thou art of the world of possession, become thou celestial; if thou art of the material sphere, become an inhabitant of the realm of Light; hasten from the world of darkness to the world of illumination and become the manifestor of the exhortations, advices and instructions of the Blessed Perfection. This is my greatest desire for thee. </p>

  <div class='section_header toc2' id='tab-580_'>
    <h3 class='sectionnum'> — 580 — </h3>
  </div>

<p id='580' class='nodropcap italic larger'>   O thou dear friend! </p>

<p id='580.2' class='dropcap'> Although a person of good deeds is acceptable at the Threshold of the Almighty, yet it is first “to know,” and then “to do.” Although a blind man produceth a most wonderful and exquisite art, yet he is deprived of seeing it. Consider how most animals labor for man, draw loads and facilities travel; yet, as they are ignorant, they receive no reward for this toil and labor. The cloud raineth, roses and hyacinths grow; the plain and meadow, the garden and trees become green and blossom; yet they do not realize the results and outcome of all these. The lamp is lighted, but as it hath not a conscious knowledge of itself, no one hath become glad because of it. Moreover, a soul of excellent deeds and good manners will undoubtedly advance from whatever horizon he beholdeth the lights radiating. Herein lies the difference: By the faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds. </p>

<p id='580.3'> Thou hast asked concerning reincarnation: Reincarnation as understood by the people, is untrue; but in the Gospel, “return” is referred to, and that is the return of qualities <a data-fnid='232'></a> and not the return of entities. This <span data-pg='550'></span> matter is explained in detail in the Book of Íqán, which is translated and published. Study that Book. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn232'> i.e., the return of the qualities, powers, and attributes in another human being. </aside>

<p id='580.4'> But the difference between Christ and others is this: Christ was the Spirit, others were bodies; Christ was the Sun, others were mirrors; Christ was the Truth and was bestowing eternal life, others were dead and imparting deadness and negligence. </p>

<p id='580.5'> Thou hast asked concerning the spirits of men: They are not at all annihilated — they are immortal.<a data-fnid='233'></a> The spirits of heavenly souls will find eternal life, that is, they will attain the highest and most great stations of perfection; but the spirits of the heedless souls, although they are eternal, yet they are in a world of imperfection, concealment and ignorance. This is a concise answer. Contemplate and meditate upon it, in order that thou mayest comprehend the reality of the mysteries in detail. For instance: No matter how much the mineral has an existence and life, yet in comparison to man, it is entirely non-existent and deprived of life. For where man is translated from life to death, his comparative station will be that of a mineral existence. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn233'> i.e., in the sense of continued existence after the death of the body. </aside>

<p id='597.3'> Thou hast been earthly, I hope that thou wilt become heavenly; thou hast been gloomy, I desire that thou wilt become luminous. Thou wert wandering in the wilderness, thou hast found a way to the abode of the Beloved One; thou wert a thirsty fish, thou hast attained to the endless Ocean; thou wert a roving bird, thou hast reached the divine Rose-garden; thou wert spiritually sick and thou hast found real health! </p>

<p id='597.5'> Do not wonder at the favor and bounty of the Lord. By the favor of God, how often a drop hath become undulating like a sea, and an atom hath become shining like the sun! </p>

  </div>

<p id='598' class='nodropcap italic larger'>   O thou youth of God! </p>

<p id='598.2' class='dropcap'> Thank God that thou hast found thy way to the <span data-pg='562'></span> Radiant Kingdom, torn asunder the veil of superstition and learned the reality of the mysteries. </p>

<p id='598.3'> All the people have formed a god in the world of thought, and that form of their own imagination they worship; when the fact is that the imagined form is finite and the human mind is infinite.<a data-fnid='243'></a> Surely the infinite is greater than the finite, for imagination is accidental (or non-essential) while the mind is essential; surely the essential is greater than the accidental. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn243'> Infinite in regard to imagination, for without the mind there would be no imagination. Another translation of this paragraph is as follows: “All the people have formed a god in the world of thought and they worship that form of their own imagination, while the fact is that the imagined concept is comprehended by the mind which is comprehensive. Surely that which comprehends is greater than the comprehended for imagination is accidental (non-essential), while the mind is essential. Surely the essential is greater than the accidental.” </aside>

<p id='598.4'> Therefore consider: All the sects and peoples worship their own thought; they create a god in their own minds and acknowledge him to be the creator of all things, when that form is a superstition — thus people adore and worship imagination (or illusion). </p>

<p id='598.5'> That Essence of the Divine Entity and the Unseen of the unseen is holy above imagination and is beyond thought. Consciousness doth not reach It. Within the capacity of comprehension of a produced (or created) reality that Ancient Reality cannot be contained. It is a different world; from it there is no information; arrival thereat is impossible; attainment thereto is prohibited and inaccessible. This much is known: It exists and Its existence is certain and proven — but the condition is unknown. </p>

<p id='598.6'> All the philosophers and the doctors knew that It is, but they were perplexed in the comprehension of Its existence and were at last discouraged, and in great <span data-pg='563'></span> despair they left this world. For the comprehension of the condition and mysteries of that Reality of realities and Mystery of mysteries there is need for another power and another sense. That power and sense is not possessed by mankind, therefore they have not found any information. For example: If a man possess the power of hearing, the power of tasting, the power of smelling and the power of feeling, but no power of seeing, he cannot see. Hence, through the powers and senses present in man the realization of the Unseen Reality, which is pure and holy above the reach of doubts, is impossible. Other powers are needed and other senses required. If those powers and senses are obtained, then information can be had; otherwise, not. </p>

<p id='598.7'> As to the question of marriage, according to the law of God: First you must select one, and them it depends upon the consent of the father and mother. Before your selection they have no right of interference. </p>

<p id='598.8'> Endeavor as much as thou canst to acquire the English language with the utmost of eloquence and excellence, so that thou mayest be enabled to translate the Tablets into the Japanese tongue. This is my advice. Certainly exert thy utmost endeavor to attain this bounty. </p>

<p id='601' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O ye spiritual friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! <a data-fnid='247'></a> </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn247'> The following Tablets up to and including page 585, are “General Tablets” revealed for all the friends throughout the world. </aside>

<p id='601.2'> “Perfume Thou the East! Illumine Thou the West! Bestow Thou light to the North! Grant Thou life to the South! </p>

<p id='601.3' class='dropcap'> This verse hath been revealed from the lips of the Center of the Covenant one year after the departure <a data-fnid='248'></a> of Bahá’u’lláh. But the náqiḍín (not understanding its spiritual purport) wondered and derided. Praise be to God! that now its signs have become manifest, its power evident, and its proof plain. Thanks be unto Him! that the East and the West are stirred into cheerfulness, and through the Holy Fragrances all directions are perfumed. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn248'> Departure, i.e., death — which occurred May 29, 1892. </aside>

<p id='601.4'> The Blessed Perfection, in a clear text, hath promised us in the Book: “Verily I behold you from the Horizon of Abhá and will make victorious whomsoever will arise in the service of my cause with the hosts of the Supreme Concourse and the cohorts of the favored angels!” Praise be to God! that this victory and confirmation became visible and manifest and hath shone forth from the horizon of the world like unto the sun. </p>

<p id='601.5'> Therefore, O ye friends of God! Show ye forth an earnest endeavor and display ye a resolute effort, so that ye may become assisted in the adoration of the Ancient Beauty and the Manifest Light; to be the cause of spreading the light of the Sun of Truth; to infuse into the dead, antiquated body of the world a new spirit; to cast in the fields of the hearts pure seeds; to arise in the service of the Cause; to speak with eloquent <span data-pg='567'></span> tongues; to become candles of guidance in the assemblage of the world; to become shining stars in the horizon of existent being; to become merciful birds in the rose-garden of oneness; to sing the melodies of realities and significances; to spend every breath of your lives in the most great Cause; and to devote the period of your existence to the service of this conspicuous Light; so that in the end ye may be freed from loss and failure and attain to the inexhaustible treasury of the Kingdom. For the life of man is wholly subject to danger and impermanency. A person cannot put his assurance even in one moment’s continuity. Notwithstanding this, the nations of the world, deceived by the mirage of superstition, imagine themselves secure in the heavenly way. Alas! Alas! Former communities in bygone ages entertained the same perishing thoughts; but by one of those periodical fluctuations they were all hidden under ground and afflicted with deprivation and loss, except those souls who had become pure evanescence and had arisen with great self-abnegation in the path of God. Such souls shine forth as brilliant stars from the Horizon of the Ancient Glory, and the results which emanated from their lives in succeeding ages and cycles are the proofs of this statement. Therefore, do ye not rest, neither day nor night; seek ye not for composure; talk ye not of the mystery of servitude, and seek ye the path of thralldom; so that through the promised confirmations ye may become assisted from the Kingdom of Oneness. </p>

<p id='601.6'> O ye friends! Dense and gloomy clouds have covered the horizon of the world, and the darkness of hatred, malignity, persecution, tyranny, and the greatest <span data-pg='568'></span> cruelty is spreading. All the people are drunk with the wine of heedlessness; and blood-thirstiness and rapaciousness are considered the noblest excellencies of the world of men. </p>

<p id='601.7'> His Highness the Almighty hath chosen the friends from among the concourse of men and hath especialized them with the most eminent guidance and the highest gift; so that we may with our souls and hearts exert ourselves, sacrifice our lives, be engaged in the guidance of the people and the training of souls; so that the wild beasts may become the gazelles of the meadows on unity; the wolves the sheep of God; the blood-thirsty ones the heavenly angels; the fire of malice be extinguished and the flame of safety in the blessed tabernacle bestow illumination; the odor of the nether realm of infidelity be dispelled and the fragrances of the rose-garden of faithfulness be diffused in all parts; the weak draw light from the Universal Reason and evil souls seek to be purified with the holy and divine Breath. There are needed manifestors for this gift; farmers for this field; gardeners for this rose-garden; fishers for this sea; luminous stars for this heaven; spiritual physicians for these ill ones, and loving guides for these wanderers; so that they may bestow a share to those who are deprived, grant a portion to those who are shareless, give unmeasured treasure to the indigent ones, and show forth the power of proof to the seekers. </p>

<p id='601.8'> Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I supplicate unto Thee, O Thou my Helper! I invoke Thee, O Thou my Refuge! I utter to Thee my agonies, O Thou my Physician, entreat Thee with all my heart, my soul and my spirit, <span data-pg='569'></span> saying: </p>

<p id='601.9'> O my God! O my God! Verily, the gloomy night hath fallen upon all regions and the clouds of ignorance have extended in all directions; the people are immersed in the darkness of surmise and the tyrants are sunk in the depths of brutality and lawlessness; the red glare of the burning fire is flashing forth from the neither world; roaring, ominous voices are rising from the cruel, destructive and terrible armaments; every region is crying out with its dumb secret tongue: “Nothing that I possess hath benefitted me and power and strength are taken away from me!” Verily, O my God, the lamps of guidance are extinguished; the fire of animosity is enkindled; wrath and antipathy are spread abroad and provocation and maliciousness are disseminated upon the face of the earth. Yet I see only Thy wronged followers who are crying at the tops of their voices and summoning the people: </p>

<p id='601.10' class='blockquote verse italic'> “Hasten ye toward affinity!
  Hasten ye toward faithfulness!
  Hasten ye toward generosity!
  Hasten ye toward guidance!
  Hasten ye toward union!
  Hasten ye to behold the Light of the World!
  Hasten ye toward love and prosperity!
  Hasten ye toward peace and reconciliation!
  Hasten ye toward the law of disarmament!
  Hasten ye toward harmony and success!
  Hasten ye toward co-operation and mutual help in the path of guidance!” </p>

<p id='601.11'> Verily, these wronged ones do sacrifice themselves with infinite joy and happiness for the sake of the people, with all their souls and spirits throughout all regions. <span data-pg='570'></span> Verily, thou beholdest them weeping at the misfortunes of every one of Thy creatures and becoming grieved at the distress of Thy children; they are kind to all the people and pained at the sight of the calamities of the inhabitants of the world. O my Lord! make the wings prosperity to grow upon their shoulders, so that they may ever soar toward the apex of their aspirations; strengthen their loins in the service of Thy people, and confirm them in the thralldom and adoration of the threshold of Thy Holiness. </p>

<p id='601.12'> Verily, Thou art the Merciful! Thou art the Clement, and there is no God but Thee, the Powerful, the Compassionate, and the Ancient! </p>

There is no land in which the fame of Thy Merciful Cause hath not been spread, and there is no region in which Thy manifest ensign hath not been hoisted! Verily, Thy voice hath reached the ears of all inhabitants of the globe, and the attracted ones have become exhilarated by its holy and divine fragrances! </p>

<p id='602.5'> O my Lord! O my Lord! Assist the weak ones with the Supreme Energy; shelter the indigent ones near the asylum of Thy Greatest Majesty; strengthen the loins of those souls whose faces radiate with Thy lights and whose tongues become eloquent in the glorification and commemoration of Thy Name; make them the plants of Thy luminous orchard, the blossoms of Thy blessed tree, the leaves of Thy Sadratu’l-Muntahá <a data-fnid='249'></a> and the flowers of Thy exalted rose-garden!

 <aside class='fn' id='fn249'> Sadratu’l-Muntahá — The name of a tree planted by the Arabs in ancient times at the end of a road, to serve as a guide. As a symbol it denotes a Manifestation in His day. </aside>

<p id='602.6'> O ye beloved ones of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! This servant longeth to write a special Tablet to each one of the <span data-pg='572'></span> friends of God — but what can be done! For there is neither opportunity nor time. The affairs are like unto the waves, and the requirements are like unto the vernal showers. I do not rest a moment, neither do I have leisure for an instant. Letters are received every day from all the regions and it is impossible and impracticable to answer one among ten; yet there is no other mode than to answer the letters which are the most important, for the urgent affairs must be attended to. Therefore, I request the pardon and ask the forgiveness of the friends, that they may overlook these shortcomings and be content and happy with that which is possible. </p>

<p id='602.7'> O ye friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! The East is illumined, the West is perfumed and the world is in motion and acceleration. Such a tumult is visible in the regions; and such a spiritual commotion is perceived in the pillars of the earth! The fame of the grandeur of the Word of God hath reached the ears of the inhabitants of the world, and the voice of the Cause of God holdeth universal sway! It is the time for joy and happiness and the moment of exhilaration and ecstasy. One must live in accord with the exhortations and advices of the Blessed Perfection and behave with such deeds and actions as to become conducive to the illumination of the world and the manifestation of mercifulness among the nations. </p>

<p id='602.8'> All the denizens of the earth, the communities and the people have taken an axe in their hands to uproot the life-tree of each other; they are blood-thirsty and the instigators of corruption; they are armed to the teeth with destructive implements; each seeketh the <span data-pg='573'></span> death and annihilation of the other. But the heavenly power, the divine energy and the celestial hand of strength, hath raised the canopy of the oneness of the realm of humanity on the pinnacle of the contingent being and hoisted the standard of the most great peace, friendship, love, uprightness and the adoration of truth. The friends are the servants of this canopy and the beloved are the hosts of this standard. Therefore they must with one accord arise to that which is the requirement and the merit of this day, become overflowing with joy and beatitude, perfume the nostrils with fragrances, sweeten the tastes with the honey and delicacy of love, become the signs of guidance, be the glad-tidings of the Supreme Concourse and the army of the Kingdom of Abhá; so that they may destroy the edifice of war and bloodshed, efface the traces of battle and strife from the face of the earth, uproot the tree of foreignness and plant the tree of unity in the rose-garden of the regions, extinguish the fire of hatred and animosity and set in motion the sea of love and affinity, erase the traces of discord from the Tablet of the earth and register thereon the verses of concord, clear the field of existence from the thorns and brambles of hostilities and ill-feeling and adorn it with the hyacinths and anemones of harmony, train and educate the souls and loosen the tongue in the delivery of the instructions and teachings of the Blessed Perfection! </p>

<p id='602.9'> O ye beloved ones! It is the moment of the ecstasy of the soul and consciousness and the season of running in the arena of sacrifice! Show ye kindness to all; be ye engaged in the refinement of the souls. Become ye as ignited lamps and adorn ye the orchard of <span data-pg='574'></span> being! These days are swiftly passing and this mortal life will remain fruitless and without result. Therefore, while there is yet time and the arrow is in the bow, enter ye the chase and strike ye the game. This game is the good-pleasure of God, and this chase is the merciful Providence; that is, living accord with the divine instructions. </p>

<p id='603' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O Thou Pure God! </p>

<p id='603.2' class='dropcap'> Thou art the Seer and the Hearer! Thou art the Powerful and the Mighty! The fame of Thy Most Great Cause hath traveled forth and radiated from all the horizons! The believers have the utmost joy and fragrance, and the friends are attracted to the Face of that Brilliant Orb. The tongues are engaged in Thy Commemoration and the hearts are at all times dilated with the Fragrances of Thy Holiness. The faces are all turned toward Thee; the hearts are captive of Thy Abode, and the souls are athirst for the Salubrious Water of Thy River. The call of Thy Greatest Name hath caused a mighty reverberation throughout all the kingdoms, and the Power of Thy Consummate Word hath unfurled Thy Ensign to the East and to the West! The favored ones supplicate with the utmost humility, and the righteous ones are in an attitude of soulful invocation to the Kingdom of Beauty. </p>

<p id='603.3'> O my God! Assist Thou all of them and pour upon them the showers of Thy Supreme Confirmations; so that they may become the cause of the tranquility of the world of creation; to be the servants of the human race; to become, with all their hearts and souls, the real friends of all nations; to become with the utmost joy <span data-pg='575'></span> and fragrance, the spiritual companions of the adherents of all religions; to dispel the darkness of strangeness and to spread the lights of friendship in this transitory world! </p>

<p id='603.4'> O God! Grant Thou to all them an Asylum in Thy Neighborhood and gladden their hearts and impart to them rejoicing through Thine Incomparable Bounties! Thou are the Omnipotent and the Mighty! Thou art the Seer and the Hearer! </p>

<p id='603.5'> O ye real companions! Day and night ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is engaged in the remembrances of the friends, and time after time doth he associate with them and behold their blessed faces. I entreat in the Threshold of the Lord of Existence to confirm them in a befitting manner and assist them to follow wholly the Commands of God! </p>

<p id='603.6'> O ye friends of God! According to what is heard, some of the friends have celebrated my birthday in some countries on the fifth of Zamádí-Avval (23rd day of May). Although their intention is no other than good, their aim be to promote the Word of God and to commemorate the True One among the people in this manner, yet, according to the text of the Religion of God and the irrefutable command, the fifth of Zamádí-Avval (May 23rd) is the day of the Declaration of His Highness the Supreme (the Báb) — may my life be a sacrifice to Him! Consequently, they must celebrate and adorn that Blessed Day in the name of the Declaration of that Orb of regions; make rejoicing and happiness, and impart the glad-tidings of heavenly beatitude to each other. For that holy essence was the Herald <span data-pg='576'></span> of the Most great Name. Therefore, no one must mention that day of the fifth of Zamádí-Avval (May 23rd) except as the Day of the Declaration of His Highness the Báb. This is the unquestionable text of the Religion of God. </p>

<p id='603.7'> Regarding the birth of this servant, which also happened on that day, this a proof of the favors and bounties of God toward this servant. However, this Blessed Day must be known as the Day of the Declaration of His Highness the Supreme (Báb) and the beginning of the effulgence of the Sun of Reality. You must on this account be engaged in rejoicing, happiness and gladness. This is the truth! Beware! Beware! that you avoid that which is mentioned; otherwise, it will cause the utmost grief to the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>

<p id='603.8'> I ask from the inexhaustible bounties of His Highness the Almighty, that the righteous ones become assisted to live in accord with the Religion of God; neither do they deviate a hair’s breadth therefrom; and spread this Tablet throughout all regions, so that all the friends may comprehend the truth and act accordingly. </p>

<p id='604' class='nodropcap italic larger'>   O ye beloved of God and maid-servants of the Merciful! </p>

<p id='604.2' class='dropcap'> The republic of wise men believes that the difference in minds and opinions is due to the difference of education and the acquisition of ethics. That is, that minds are equal in origin, but education and the acquisition of ethics cause minds to differ and comprehensions to be at variance; that this difference is not in entity but in education and teaching; that there is no individual distinction <span data-pg='577'></span> for any soul. Hence, the members of the human race all possess the capacity of attaining to the highest station, and the proof they adduce therefor is this: “The inhabitants of a country like Africa are all as wandering savages and wild animals; they lack intelligence and knowledge; all are uncivilized; not one civilized and wise man is to be found among them. On the contrary, consider the civilized countries, the inhabitants of which are living in the highest state of culture and ethics, solidarity and inter-dependence; possessing, with few exceptions, acute power of comprehensions and sound mind. Therefore, it is made clear and evident that the superiority and inferiority of minds and comprehensions arises from education and cultivation, or from their lack and absence. A bent branch is straightened by training the wild fruit of the jungle is made the product of the orchard. An ignorant man by learning becomes knowing, and the world of savagery, through the bounty of a wise educator, is changed into a civilized kingdom. The sick is healed by medication, and the poor man, by learning the arts of commerce, is made rich. The follower, by attaining the virtues of the leader, becomes great, and the lowly man, by the education of the teacher, rises from the nadir of oblivion to the zenith of celebrity.” These are the proofs of the wise men. </p>

<p id='604.3'> The prophets also acknowledge this opinion, to wit: That education hath a great effect upon the human race, but they declare that minds and comprehensions are originally different. And this matter is self-evident; it cannot be refuted. We see that certain children of the same age, nativity and race, nay, from the same <span data-pg='578'></span> household, under the tutorship of one teacher, differ in their minds and comprehensions. One advanceth rapidly, another is slow in catching the rays of culture, still another remaineth in the lowest degree of stupidity. </p>

<p id='604.4'> No matter how much the shell is educated (or polished), it can never become the radiant pearl. The black stone will not become the world illuming gem. The calocynth <a data-fnid='250'></a> and the thorny cactus can never by training and development become the blessed tree. That is to say, training doth not change the human gem (i.e., human nature or entity), but it produceth a marvelous effect. By this effective power all that is registered latent of virtues and capacities in the human reality will be revealed. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn250'> Cucumis calocynthis. </aside>

<p id='604.5'> Cultivation by the farmer maketh of the grain the harvest, and the effort of the gardener maketh of the seed a noble tree. The gentle teacher promoteth the children of the school to the lofty altitude and the bestowal of the trainer placeth the little child upon the throne of ether. Therefore, it is demonstrated and proven that minds are different in the original entity or nature, and that education commandeth a decided and great influence. Were there no educator, all souls would remain savage, and were it not for the teacher, the children would be ignorant creatures. </p>

<p id='604.6'> It is for this reason that, in this New Cycle, education and training are recorded in the Book of God as obligatory and not voluntary. That is, it is enjoined upon the father and mother, as a duty, to strive with all effort to train the daughter and the son, to nurse them from the breast of knowledge and to rear them in <span data-pg='579'></span> the bosom of sciences and arts. Should they neglect this matter, they shall, be held responsible and worthy of reproach in the presence of the stern Lord. </p>

<p id='604.7'> This is a sin unpardonable, for they have made that poor babe a wanderer in the Sahara of ignorance, unfortunate and tormented; to remain during a lifetime a captive of ignorance and pride, negligent and without discernment. Verily, if that babe depart from this world at the age of infancy, it is sweeter and better. In this sense, death is better than life; deprivation than salvation; non-existence lovelier than existence; the grave better than the palace; and the narrow, dingy tomb better than the spacious, regal home; for in the sight of mankind that child is abased and degraded and in the sight of God weak and defective. In gatherings it is ashamed and humiliated and in the arena of examination subdued and defeated by young and old. What a mistake is this! What an everlasting humiliation! </p>

<p id='604.8'> Therefore, the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful must train their children with life and heart and teach them in the school of virtue and perfection. They must not be lax in this matter; they must not be inefficient. Truly, if a babe did not live at all it were better than to let it grow ignorant, for that innocent babe, in later life, would become afflicted with innumerable defects, responsible to and questioned by God, reproached and rejected by the people. What a sin this would be and what an omission! </p>

<p id='604.9'> The first duty of the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful is this: They must strive by all possible means to educate both sexes, male and female; <span data-pg='580'></span> girls like boys; there is no difference whatsoever between them. The ignorance of both is blameworthy, and negligence in both cases is reprovable. “Are they who know and they who do not know equal?” (Qur’án) </p>

<p id='604.10'> The command is decisive concerning both. If it be considered through the eye of reality, the training and culture of daughters is more necessary than that of sons, for these girls will come to the station of motherhood and will mould the lives of the children. The first trainer of the child is the mother. The babe, like unto a green and tender branch, will grow according to the way it is trained. If the training be right, it will grow right, and if crooked, the growth likewise, and unto the end of life it will conduct itself accordingly. </p>

<p id='604.11'> Hence, it is firmly established that an untrained and uneducated daughter, on becoming a mother, will be the prime factor in the deprivation, ignorance, negligence and the lack of training of many children. </p>

<p id='604.12'> O ye beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful! Teaching and learning, according to the decisive texts of the Blessed Beauty (Bahá’u’lláh), is a duty. Whosoever is indifferent therein depriveth himself of the great bounty. </p>

<p id='604.13'> Beware! Beware! that ye fail not in this matter. Endeavor with heart, with life, to train your children, especially the daughters. No excuse is acceptable in this matter. </p>

<p id='604.14'> Thus may eternal glory and everlasting supremacy, like unto the mid-day sun, shine forth in the assemblage of the people of Bahá, and the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá become happy and <span data-pg='581'></span> thankful. </p>

<section class='content tablet' id='tab-605' data-sectionnum='605' data-author='abd'>
  <div class='section_header toc2' id='tab-605_'>
    <h3 class='sectionnum'> — 605 — </h3>
  </div>

<p id='605' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O pure friends of God! </p>

<p id='605.2' class='dropcap'> Cleanliness and sanctity in all conditions are characteristics of pure beings and necessities of free souls. The first perfection consists in cleanliness and sanctity and in purity from every defect. When man in all conditions is pure and immaculate, he will become the center of the reflection of the manifest Light. In all his actions and conduct there must first be purity, then beauty and independence. The channel must be cleansed before it is filled with sweet water. The pure eye comprehendeth the sight and the meeting of God; the pure nostril inhaleth the perfumes of the rose-garden of bounty; the pure heart becometh the mirror of the beauty of truth. this is why, in the heavenly Books, the divine counsels and commands have been compared to water. So, in the Qur’án it is said, “and we have caused a pure water to descend from heaven;” and in the Gospel, “Except a man hath received the baptism of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.” Then it is evident that the divine teachings are the heavenly grace and the showers of the mercy of God, which purify the hearts of men. </p>

<p id='605.3'> The meaning is, in all conditions, cleanliness and sanctity, purity, and delicacy exalt humanity and make the contingent beings progress. Even when applied to physical things, delicacy causeth the attainment of spirituality, as it is established in the Holy Scriptures. </p>

<p id='605.4'> External cleanliness, although it is but a physical thing, hath a great influence upon spirituality. For example, although sound is but the vibrations of the air which affect the tympanum of the ear, and vibrations <span data-pg='582'></span> of the air are but an accident among the accidents which depend upon the air, consider how much marvelous notes or a charming song influence the spirits! A wonderful song giveth wings to the spirit and filleth the heart with exaltation. To return to the subject, the fact of having a pure and spotless body likewise exerciseth an influence upon the spirit of man. </p>

<p id='605.5'> Now, see how much purity is approved in the Court of God, that it should be especially mentioned in the Holy Books of the Prophets. So the Holy Books forbid the eating of any unclean thing, or the use of anything which is not pure. Certain prohibitions are absolute and imperative for all: he who commits that which is forbidden is detested by God and excluded from the number of the elect. This applieth to the things forbidden by an absolute prohibition and of which the perpetration is a grave sin; they are so vile that even to mention them is shameful. There are other forbidden things which do not cause an immediate evil and of which the pernicious effect is only gradually produced. They are also abhorred, blamed and rejected by God, but their prohibition is not recorded in an absolute way, although cleanliness and sanctity, spotlessness and purity, the preservation of health and independence are required by these interdictions. </p>

<p id='605.6'> One of these last prohibitions is the smoking of tobacco, which is unclean, malodorous, disagreeable and vulgar and of which the gradual harmfulness is universally recognized. All clever physicians have judged, and have also shown by experiment, that one of the constituents of tobacco is a mortal poison and that smokers are exposed to different indispositions and <span data-pg='583'></span> maladies. That is why cleanly people have a marked aversion for its use. </p>

<p id='605.7'> His supreme Highness (the Báb) — may my soul be His sacrifice! — in the beginning of His Cause, openly forbade it and all the friends abandoned its use. But, as it was a time for caution and he who abstained from smoking was ill treated, persecuted and even killed, therefore the friends were obliged, as a matter of prudence, to smoke. Later, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas was revealed and as the prohibition of tobacco was not clearly stated in it, the friends did not renounce it. But the Blessed Perfection had always a marked aversion for its use. At the beginning of the Cause, for certain reasons, he smoked a little, but later he abandoned it completely, and the holy souls who obeyed him is all circumstances, also entirely gave up smoking. I wish to say that, in the sight of God, the smoking of tobacco is a thing which is blamed and condemned, very unclean, and of which is the result is by degrees injurious. Besides it is a cause of expense and of loss of time and it is a harmful habit. So, for those who are firm in the Covenant, it is a thing reprobated by the reason and by tradition, the renouncement of which giveth gradual repose and tranquility, permitteth one to have stainless hands and a clean mouth, and hair which is not pervaded by a bad odor. </p>

<p id='605.8'> Without any doubt, the friends of God on receiving this epistle will renounce this injurious habit by all means, even if it be necessary to do so by degrees. This is my hope. </p>

<p id='605.9'> As to the question of opium, disgusting and execrated, I resign myself to God for its punishment. The formal <span data-pg='584'></span> text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas forbids and reproves it and, according to reason, its use leads to madness. Experience hath shown that he who giveth himself up to it is completely excluded from the world of humanity. Let us take refuge in God against the perpetration of so shameful a thing, which is the destruction of the foundations of humanity and which causeth a perpetual unhappiness. It taketh possession of the soul of man, killeth the reason, weakeneth the intelligence, maketh a living man dead and extinguisheth the natural heat. It is impossible to imagine anything more pernicious. Happy is he who never mentioneth the word opium! But what is the fate of those who make use of it! </p>

<p id='605.10'> O friends of God! Force and violence, constraint and oppression are condemned in this divine cycle, but to prevent the use of opium, all means must be employed, so that the human species may be delivered and freed from this great calamity. Otherwise, alas! for all the negligent before God. </p>

<p id='605.11'> O Lord! Give to the people of Bahá cleanliness and holiness in all conditions, purify and free them from all defilement, deliver them from the use of all that is execrated, liberate them from the chains of habits, so that they may be pure and free, clean and spotless, that they may be worthy servants of the Sacred Threshold and may deserve to enter into relation with God. Deliver them from alcohol and tobacco, and save them from opium, the purveyor of madness! Make them companions of the holy breezes, in order that they may know the pleasures of the wine of the love of God, and that they may attain to the joy and the happiness of attraction to the Kingdom of <span data-pg='585'></span> Abhá! </p>

<p id='605.12'> Hast Thou not said, “All that thou hast in thy cellar will not appease the thirst of my love — bring me, O cup-bearer, of the wine of the spirit, a cup full as the sea!” </p>

<p id='605.13'> O friends of God! Experience hath shown how much the renouncing of tobacco, wine and opium, giveth health, strength and intellectual enjoyments, penetration of judgement and physical vigor. There exists today a tribe <a data-fnid='251'></a> which refrains and abstains from tobacco, alcohol and opium and it completely excels all others in power, in bravery, in health, beauty and grace. A single one of these men can withstand ten men of other tribes, and this hath been universally proved; that is to say, generally, the individuals of this tribe are superior to the individuals of the other tribes. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn251'> The Druse’. </aside>

<p id='605.14'> Therefore strive that the greatest cleanliness and sanctity, which is the great desire of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, should be resplendent among the Bahá’ís, and that the companions of God should surpass the rest of mankind in all conditions and perfections; that they may be physically and morally superior to others; that through cleanliness and purity, refinement and health, they may be the chief of wise men, and that by their affranchisement, their prudence, and the control of their desires, they may be the princes of the pure, the free and the wise. </p>

<p id='605.15'> Upon you be the glory of Abhá! </p>

<p id='608' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O seeker for the Truth! </p>

<p id='608.2' class='dropcap'> There are two ways of healing sickness, material means and spiritual means. The first is by the use of remedies, of medicines; the second consists in praying to God and in turning to Him. Both means should be used and practiced. </p>

<p id='608.3'> Illness caused by physical accident should be treated with medical remedies; those which are due to spiritual causes disappear through spiritual means. Thus an illness caused by affliction, fear, nervous impressions, will be healed by spiritual rather than by physical treatment. Hence, both kinds of remedies should be considered. Moreover, they are not contradictory, and thou shouldst accept the physical remedies as coming from the mercy and favor of God, who hath revealed and made manifest medical science so that His servants may profit from this kind of treatment also. Thou shouldst give equal attention to spiritual treatments, for they produce marvellous effects. </p>

<p id='617.6'> Convey respectful greeting to Mrs. ______ and say: “I hope that through the breath of the Holy Spirit the mysteries may become disclosed to thee, for without this channel it is impossible and unattainable. Turn thine attention to the days of His Highness the Christ; some people imagine that without the Messianic outpourings, it is possible to attain to Truth, but this very imagination became the cause of their deprivation.” </p>

<p id='617.7'> O thou maid-servant of God! Whenever thou art desiring to talk and answer questions, turn thy face toward the Kingdom of Abhá and beseech for assistance; then loosen thy tongue. Thou wilt behold at that time how thou art able to answer all the questions! </p>

<p id='617.8'> O thou maid-servant of God! The aim of the theosophists is to attain to Truth, but the Truth is unattainable except through the favor of the Holy Spirit. The light hath a center and if one desire to seek it otherwise but from the center, he can never attain to it. In this solar system the source of light is the sun and every light is acquired from it; even the lamps of the night are ignited through the sun, for if there were no sun the trees would not grow nor the mines develop, so that the oil be extracted from those trees and mines, and the lamps of the night be lit by it. Is it possible that one attain to the light in this globular sphere without <span data-pg='593'></span> the mediation of the sun? No, by the life of God! To suppose it, is pure imagination. But the Truth is this: The main source of the lights is the Sun and the rays are shed from it upon all the regions. </p>

  </div>

<p id='622' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou who art attracted by the brilliant lights of the Merciful One, shining from the Supreme Kingdom! </p>

<p id='622.2' class='dropcap'> I opened thy letter with the greatest happiness and considered the meaning of thine address; but sadness became most intense within me when I learned about the dissensions among the brethren <a data-fnid='260'></a> in those countries. By the life of God! “This is a wonderful thing!” </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn260'> During the year 1899. </aside>

<p id='622.3'> Verily, the mission of all the prophets, the relation of all the scriptures, the diffusion of the instructions of God and the descent of His law, were all in order to establish agreement and union and to strengthen love and harmony among nations of different customs and thoughts, of diverse beliefs, doctrines, rites and habits; of various classes, tribes and races. So likewise, as thou seest in this beautiful religion, verily, men of different beliefs, creeds and religions, of contrary ideas and thoughts, of various races, languages and natal <span data-pg='597'></span> land — whether from East, West, North or South-all have entered under the shade of this Blessed Tree, planted, grown and reared in the midst of Paradise, and are formed into a single nation and religion in mutual union and agreement, ready to sacrifice their souls and bodies, each to the other. This harmony is not effected but through the influence of the Word of God and is circulated and spread in all directions among the believers of God, who are firm in the Covenant. </p>

<p id='622.4'> The dissensions prevailing in those parts (America) is altogether to surprising and strange; and I entreat God to purge it out through the power of unity and oneness and unite the congregations and gather together the dispersed multitude. Verily, He is powerful in all things! </p>

<p id='622.5'> But for thee, leave such matters and disturbances and withdraw from those districts and places and turn thy face sincerely to God; take His instructions and be expanded through the breaths of God. The Spirit of God shall assist thee and His angels will confirm thee; the life of holiness of God will be breathed into thy mouth and thou wilt find thyself in a position free from these ideas and thoughts resulting from worldly grades. (Verily, these are disgraces to all who are in the habit of reading the verses of unity in the assemblies of existence!) Seize the opportunity, use every effort and depend not upon circumstances which produce no fruits. Spend thy days, with all joy and fragrance, in speaking to the praise of God, being gladdened through His good tidings, in rejoicing through His graces and in spreading His breaths. Then thou shalt, with the eye of joy, see the banners of the Covenant fluttering above <span data-pg='598'></span> all stately mansions. Verily, God effecteth that which He pleaseth; naught can annul His Covenant; naught can obstruct His favor nor oppose His Cause! He doeth with His will that which pleaseth Him and He is powerful over all things! At that time thou wilt find the waverers in manifest loss. </p>

<p id='622.6'> As for the instructions: They will be revealed to thee and spread all through those regions by the translation of the divine verses. </p>

<p id='622.7'> As for the symbol of the cross, appointed in former times: Know verily, that the cross form is a wonderful figure and consists of two right lines placed crosswise-one perpendicular to the other — and this figure exists in all things. </p>

<p id='622.8'> Meditate upon these words and pay attention to the tissue in all existing substances, either plant, animal or man, and thou wilt see that they all are formed of the cross figure or two crosswise lines. Consider this intently with true meditation. Then thou wilt be taught by the Holy Ghost that it is for this reason that God hath chosen this symbol to be displayed as the token of sacrifice in all periods of ages. </p>

<p id='622.9'> I will explain to thee, in future time, the mystery of sacrifice. There is nothing more beautiful than this tree united with the cross. Verily, this tree is a type of the Tree of Life in conjunction with the cross; in this, the mystery of sacrifice. </p>

<p id='622.10'> As for the crescent: It hath reference to the beginning of the religion of God which shall grow to be a full moon. </p>

<p id='622.11'> As for the stars: They are types of the guides; for, verily, the star is a guide to people, even in the <span data-pg='599'></span> most gloomy darkness, on both land and sea. In former centuries, people were guided by the pole-star in whatever direction they went. </p>

<p id='622.12'> Verily, I supplicate God to raise the instrument of sacrifice in those regions and to reveal there the mystery of sacrifice; to cause the crescent of the religion of God to rise until it groweth into a shining full moon; it brighten the stars of guidance and guide all through it; and I beseech Him to assist those brethren to promote His Word in those most distant places, cause them to be servants to His precious olive-garden, keepers of His inaccessible fortress and guides to His straight path! </p>

<p id='622.13'> May glory be unto thee and unto them! </p>

<p id='630' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art speaking the praise of God in that vast and extensive region! </p>

<p id='630.2' class='dropcap'> Thank God, who hath raised such women from the essences of the love of God in that distant place and hath made them as fountains of knowledge, sources of assurance and dawning-places of the commemoration of thy Lord, the Merciful! I beg of God to strengthen them through the most strong power, by the hosts rushing forth from the Kingdom of Abhá and by the angels successively coming from heaven. Verily, He is the Assister, the Beneficent! </p>

<p id='630.3'> As to thy question concerning the husband and wife, the tie between them and the children given to them by God: Know thou, verily, the husband is one who hath sincerely turned unto God, is awakened by the call of the Beauty of Bahá and chanteth the verses of Oneness in the great assemblies; the wife is a being who wisheth to be overflowing with and seeketh after the attributes of God and His names; and the tie between them is none other than the Word of God. Verily, it [the Word of God] causeth the multitudes to assemble together and the remote ones to be united. Thus the husband and wife are brought into affinity, are united and harmonized, even as though they were <span data-pg='606'></span> one person. Through their mutual union, companionship and love great results are produced in the world, both material and spiritual. The spiritual result is the appearance of divine bounties. The material result is the children who are born in the cradle of love of God, who are nurtured by the breast of the knowledge of God, and who are brought up in the bosom of the gift of God, and who are fostered in the lap of the training of God. Such children are those of whom it was said by Christ, “Verily, they are the children of the Kingdom!” </p>

<p id='630.4'> Consequently, O thou maid-servant of God, go unto the maid-servant of the Merciful One and tell them from the tongue of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “O maid-servants of the Merciful! It is incumbent upon you to train the children from their earliest babyhood! It is incumbent upon you to beautify their morals! It is incumbent upon you to attend to them under all aspects and circumstances, inasmuch as God — glorified and exalted is He! — hath ordained mothers to be the primary trainers of children and infants. This is a great and important affair and a high and exalted position, and it is not allowable to slacken therein at all!” </p>

<p id='630.5'> If thou walkest in this right path, thou wouldst become a real mother to the children, both spiritually and materially. I beg God to make thee severed from this world, attracted to the fragrances of sanctity which are being diffused from the garden of the Kingdom of Abhá, and a servant of the Cause of God in the vineyard of God. </p>

<p id='630.6'> Greeting and high respects to the maid-servant of God Miss. ______, who is attracted, enkindled, hath <span data-pg='607'></span> spoken and called out, and hath stripped herself from the garment of dependence of this mortal world and its concerns and is clothed with the embroidered garments of separation (from the world) in this great Paradise. </p>

<p id='631' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God! </p>

<p id='631.2' class='dropcap'> Know thou that some of the souls who arrive at this Blessed Spot possess hearing, seeing, and smelling; they see what no eye hath ever seen, they hear the melodies of the Dove of Holiness on the Tree of Life, they inhale the fragrances of God from this Garden, and they surely realize that, verily, this Blessed Spot is a center for pure seeing and strong hearing and is the direction from which the breezes of the Holy Spirit blow. </p>

<p id='631.3'> But those who have neither seeing nor hearing apprehend nothing and say what they understand not. </p>

<p id='631.4'> As to thee and thy daughter who is devoted to God, who presented herself, saw and heard: Know ye, verily, (one possessing) a pure insight is a servant to the people of Bahá, but only the prudent can understand this. </p>

<p id='631.5'> Know thou, verily, insight (or mental perception) seeth that which sight (or physical perception) seeth not and apprehendeth that which the body perceiveth not, inasmuch as the sight seeth the mirage as water, the images pictured in the mirror as a reality and genuine, and it seeth the earth as stationary, the great stars as small. But the insight correcteth the mistake of the sight and apprehendeth the reality and seeth that the mirage is not water, that the images pictured in mirrors are naught else save mere reflections, that the earth is moving and the distant stars are great. Consequently, <span data-pg='608'></span> the truth of insight, its effectiveness and power is proven, as well as the weakness of sight, its inefficiency and defects. </p>

<p id='631.6'> Then, know thou that the power of the Word of God is effective, both in the spirit and the body, and the influence of the Spirit of God is predominant over the material as well as the essential and spiritual. And that, verily, God is powerful in all things, and that the signs (or verses) have exoteric and esoteric meaning, and neither their outward preventeth their inward, nor doth their inward prevent their outward meaning. </p>

<p id='631.7'> Greeting and praise to the maid-servant of God, thy revered daughter, and to all who commemorate the praise of God, long for the Kingdom of God and are cheerfully moved by the fragrances of God! </p>

<p id='632' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God! </p>

<p id='632.2' class='dropcap'> Consider not thy capacity and merit, nay rather consider the grace of thy Lord, the Clement, the Merciful. Verily, thy Lord confirmeth whomsoever He willeth of His servants, through the glad-tidings of the Kingdom, the signals of clemency and the spiritual fragrances. Forsake every commemoration and thought in the cell of oblivion (i.e., forget everything) and confine thy days and time in preaching the Kingdom of God, spreading the teachings of God and igniting the lights of guidance in the hearts which are awaiting the Kingdom of God. Truly, I say unto thee, to be engaged in diffusing the fragrance of God (teaching the Truth) for one hour of time is better than the dominion of the world and all therein; for the latter is mortal and temporary, while the former is permanent and <span data-pg='609'></span> endless. This is the day of Life, the day of Salvation and the day of the Bestowal; it is not the day of death, unless it be martyrdom in the path of God, or embracing the cross in the love of God. </p>

  </div>

<p id='633' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God! </p>

<p id='633.2' class='dropcap'> As to thy question, “If the husband preventeth his wife from entering into the Light, or the wife preventeth the husband from entering into the Kingdom of God.” In reality neither one of them preventeth the other from entering into the Kingdom of God, except when the husband hath a great attachment to the wife, or the wife to the husband. When either one of the two adoreth the other to the exclusion of God, then each will prevent the other from entering into the Kingdom of God. </p>

<p id='633.3'> As to thy question concerning the additions to the Old and New Testament: Know thou, verily, as people could not understand the words, nor could they apprehend the realities therein, therefore they have translated them according to their own understanding and interpreted the verses after their own ideas and thus the text fell into confusion. This is undoubtedly true. As to an intentional addition: This is something uncertain. But they have made great mistakes as to the understanding of the texts and the comprehending of the references and have therefore fallen into doubts, especially in regard to the symbolical verses. </p>

<p id='633.4'> As to thy question, “That ‘Abdu’l-Bahá hath said to some of the believers that evil never exists, nay rather, it is a non-existent thing:” This is but truth, inasmuch as the greatest evil is (man’s) going astray and being <span data-pg='610'></span> veiled from Truth. Error is lack of guidance; darkness is absence of light; ignorance is lack of knowledge; falsehood is lack of truthfulness; blindness is lack of sight; and deafness is lack of hearing. Therefore, error, blindness, deafness and ignorance are non-existent things. If we say that according to the text of the Bible, “God hardened Pharaoh’s heart” that he might not believe in Moses, this signifies that, verily, He did not soften his heart. And when we wish to say that God hath not guided a certain one of His servants, this would be interpreted (by people) that God led him astray. The darkness spoken of in the Bible as being created by God, signifieth that, verily, God hath not caused light to shine; inasmuch as where there is no light, there will be darkness; when there is no sight, there will be blindness; when there is no life, there will be death; when there is no riches, there will be poverty; and when there is no knowledge, there will be ignorance. </p>

<p id='633.5'> Consequently, it is proven by indisputable argument and clear explanation that, verily, evils are non-existent, but people have not understood the meaning of the verses of the Bible. </p>

<p id='633.6'> I beg of God to make thee a faithful servant in His great vineyard, enable thee to speak His praise, to diffuse His fragrances, to chant His verses and to herald His name at every moment. </p>

  </div>

<p id='634' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art rejoiced at the explanation of the maid-servant of God ______! </p>

<p id='634.2' class='dropcap'> Thank thou God that He hath sent forth unto thee such a spiritual and loving sister, who is preserved from egotism an desires and is rejoiced at the glad-tidings <span data-pg='611'></span> of God. Can there be imagined any greater mercy than this? No! by the One who hath created the heaven and earth! Blessed thou art, for thou hast inhaled the fragrances of life from the garden of the Kingdom of Bahá before thine ears had heard the call! </p>

<p id='634.3'> As to ______ whom thou hast mentioned, it behooveth him to seek only the divine bounties and subjects which lead to the real knowledge of the invisible (world of God), through the mediation of the Holy Spirit. Then he will perceive the reality of the triune powers in man, through his innate perception. For, verily, the sign of these triune powers which exist in mankind are spirit, mind, and soul. The spirit is the power of life, the mind is the power which apprehendeth the reality of things, and the soul is an intermediary between the Supreme Concourse (or Spiritual World) and the lower concourse (or material world). It, i.e., the soul, hath two phases: The higher aspireth to the Kingdom of Bahá, and the light of the mind shine forth from the horizon (or kingdom) unto its higher sphere; the other phase inclineth to the lower concourse of the material world and its lowest sphere is enveloped in the darkness of ignorance. But when light is poured upon this phase, and if this phase of the soul is capable of receiving it, then “truth hath come and falsehood vanisheth, for falsehood is of short duration” — otherwise, darkness will surround it from all directions and it will be deprived of association with the Supreme Concourse and will remain in the lowest depths. </p>

<p id='634.4'> As to the ‘voice:” There are two kinds of voices. One is the physical voice and it is expressed by atmospheric <span data-pg='612'></span> vibrations which affect the nerves of the ear; the other is the breath of the Merciful and this is a call which is continually heard from the Supreme Concourse and cheereth the pure and holy souls. May it be beneficial to those who have heard the Call! </p>

<p id='634.5'> Know thou that the Ancient Light and the Manifest Beauty (God) hath sown seeds in the soil of existence and hath irrigated it through His spiritual bounties. This soil will surely bring forth good plants of divine gifts; the leaves of this growth are love and union, its stem is the teachings of the True One and His supreme laws, and the grain pods are the heavenly blessings which giveth life to the souls. Depend thou on these! Depend thou on these! Depend thou on this, and abandon every imagination and be attracted to the light of reality and discover both the divine truths and physical truths! </p>

<p id='634.6'> Also, know thou that the greatest spiritual divine “chaplet” is the Word of God and the Sun of Truth which penetrateth the reality of the created things and attracteth the entire soul of man in the world of existence and shineth forth unto all horizons (or regions). Hast thou ever perceived a greater “chaplet” than this? No! by the Splendor of Bahá! </p>

<p id='634.7'> Verily, I yearn for the visit of those souls who are cheered, dilated and moved by and attracted to the Holy Spirit and the Word of God. </p>

<p id='635' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art awakened to the Cause of God! </p>

<p id='635.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, I read thy letter and my heart was rejoiced at thine interesting words; and I thanked God for He hath favored those souls who earnestly desire to <span data-pg='613'></span> guard His strongly fortified fortress and His inaccessible cave and who love unity, affinity, harmony and accord and who agree on one opinion, one idea and one word. This behooveth the sincere souls! This behooveth such as believe in the divine unity! This behooveth such as are firm and steadfast in the Covenant, which is throbbing within the heart of the whole creation! </p>

<p id='635.3'> Be ye guardians of the throne of the Kingdom of God and armies of defense for the Religion of God. Whenever ye find someone desiring to separate himself from the flock, it is incumbent upon you to treat him with fragrance and kindness and persuade and encourage him, so that this secluded sheep may return to the flock. </p>

<p id='635.4'> Verily, thy Lord loveth union and hateth discord; for the appearance of the Holy Manifestations and divine laws is only for the sake of affinity, union and concord, so that the remote, contradictory and different nations and creeds may enter under the shadow of the Blessed Tree in unanimous love and agreement. </p>

<p id='635.5'> I beg of God to confirm all of His dearly beloved ones in one opinion, one belief, one movement, one path and one manner. This is that by which the station of the beloved ones will be elevated, the Word of God will be promoted, the fragrances of God will be diffused and the faces of the sincere ones will be illumined in the path of God. It is incumbent upon you to practice these [instructions] under all aspects and circumstances. </p>

<p id='635.6'> As to the manifestation of the Greatest Name (Bahá’u’lláh): This was the Divine Manifestation <span data-pg='614'></span> which appeared upon the earthly world. This is He whom God promised in all His Books and Scriptures, such as the Bible, the Gospels and the Qur’án. All of these Books indicate this fact, and the least doubt cannot possibly occur to the minds concerning this clear fact, as is recorded in detail in the heavenly Books, especially in the brilliant and holy Tablets. But notwithstanding this fact, if there is anyone who hesitates therein, do not dispute with him, nay rather prove this to him with all joy and fragrance, lest he may be obstinately compelled to rebellion. </p>

But it is not necessary, for the present, to travel in the Turkish, Egyptian and Persian territories, for internal troubles <span data-pg='625'></span> make the traveling of women very difficult.

  </div>

<p id='655' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou favored maid-servant of the Kingdom of God! </p>

<p id='655.2' class='dropcap'> The letter, which thou hast written, was received. Its contents evinced high aspiration and rare magnanimity; and that thou hast the intention to travel to the far-eastern countries and bear great trouble, so that thou mayest become the cause of the guidance of the souls and spread the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of God. This desire indicateth that that beloved maid-servant of God hath a very high aim. However, thou mayest deliver the glad-tidings in the following manner: </p>

<p id='655.3'> “The Promised One of all the nations of the world hath become apparent and manifest! Each community and religion expecteth the coming of their Promised One, and His Highness Bahá’u’lláh is the Promised One of all! Therefore, the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh is conductive to harmony, raiseth the canopy of the oneness of the kingdom of humanity upon the apex of the contingent beings and unfurleth the ensign of universal brotherhood and ideal commonwealth upon the summit of the hills and mountains!” </p>

<p id='655.4'> When thou openest thy tongue with such glad-tidings, it will become conductive to the teachings of others. But this trip is indeed very remote and unless there are several [teachers], the delivery of the glad-tidings will not produce the desired results in those parts. Shouldst thou deem it advisable, thou mayest take a trip to Persia and on thy return pass by Japan and China. This plan seems much better and more pleasant. Otherwise, thou mayest act according to thy judgment and it will be acceptable. </p>

<p id='655.5'> The contribution that thou hast made to the Temple is beloved. The Temple is the most great foundation <span data-pg='627'></span> of the world of humanity and it hath many branches. Although the Temple is the place of worship, with it is connected a hospital, pharmacy, pilgrims’ house, school for the orphans, and a university for the study of high sciences. Every Temple is connected with these five things. I hope that now in America they will build a Temple and gradually add to it the hospital, school, university, pharmacy and pilgrims’ house with the utmost efficiency and thoroughness. Thou shouldst make known to the believers these details, so that they may realize how important the Temple is. The Temple is not only a place for worship; nay, it is perfect in every way. </p>

<p id='655.6'> O thou beloved maid-servant of God! Didst thou know what station is destined and appointed, under the protection of His Highness Bahá’u’lláh, for those souls who are severed, attracted and teachers of truth, undoubtedly thou shouldst find the utmost joy and happiness, and, by reason of exultation and rejoicing, soar toward the heaven of peace, inasmuch as thou art walking in this road and advancing toward such a Kingdom. </p>

<p id='655.7'> Regarding the statement that I have written thee, about dedicating thyself to the service of the Cause of God, it means this: Center thy thoughts in the teachings of the Cause, day and night, and act according to the teachings and behests of His Highness Bahá’u’lláh. This is not contrary to marriage. It is possible for thee to be married and be engaged in the service of the Cause of God. The first does not interfere with the latter. </p>

<p id='655.8'> Briefly, avail thyself of the opportunity and do not let it slip from the grasp; i.e., supplicate God that in this darkened world thou mayest become an ignited candle and the cause of the guidance of many <span data-pg='628'></span> souls. </p>

Likewise, this imprisoned one is greatly attached with his heart and soul to the beloved ones and this very attachment is the faithful Messenger and the manifest Tablet. Therefore, my request is this: Should ye send a hundred letters and no answers be received, do ye not feel at all sad; nay, rather think of this occurrence as a glorious proof of the power of love, as it will demonstrate that there is no incumbency (or formality) between us. Were there any opportunity, undoubtedly answers would be forwarded.

Likewise, after His Holiness Christ — may the spirit of the world be a sacrifice to Him! — the first institute by the disciples was a Temple. They planned a church in every country.

  <div class='section_header toc2' id='tab-678_'>
    <h3 class='sectionnum'> — 678 — </h3>
  </div>

<p id='678' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou servant of the Threshold of God! <a data-fnid='270'></a> </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn270'> To a believer in Baku, Russia. </aside>

<p id='678.2' class='dropcap'> I read what flowed from thy pen in the love of God, and found charming meanings from the contents (of thy letter). I hope, through the gift of the glorious Lord, that thou wilt be always refreshed and revived by the fragrances of the Merciful. </p>

<p id='678.3'> As to what thou hast written concerning “Reincarnation”: Believing in reincarnation is one of the old tenets held by most nations and creeds, as well as by the Greek and Roman philosophers and wise men, the old Egyptian and the chief Assyrians. But all these sayings and superstitions are vanity in the sight of God. </p>

<p id='678.4'> The greatest [argument] produced by those who held to reincarnation has been this: “That it is necessary to the justice of God to give every one his due. Now everybody who is afflicted by any calamity is said to have sinned; but when a little child, which is still in the womb of its mother and hath just been formed, is found to be blind, deaf or imperfect, how could it have committed <span data-pg='643'></span> any sin that we might say this imperfection is given to it as a punishment therefor — so, though such a child hath no done outwardly any sin in the womb of its mother, yet [they say] it must have sinned when it was in its former body, which hath caused it to suffer this punishment.” </p>

<p id='678.5'> Indeed, these people have been negligent of the fact that had the creation been carried out in a uniform fashion, how could the statement be true, that “God doeth whatever He wisheth and God doeth whatever he desireth!” <a data-fnid='271'></a> </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn271'> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá elucidated Jesus’ teaching against the theory of “blindness from birth” and the defects being caused by the sin of the individual in a former state (see St. John 9:1-3), thus: “Jesus states that this defect exists in order to prove and show that the gift of sight is from God alone and is one of his bounties. Because were all created with sight the people would consider it a mere natural fact that they must be so made, and not give God thanks for His great gift.” — Translator. </aside>

<p id='678.6'> Though the fact of “Return” is mentioned in the Divine Books, by this is intended the return of the qualities, characters, perfections, truths and lights (of the past age), which re-appear in every age, and not (the return) of certain persons and souls. For example: If we say this lamp is the return of that of last night, or that the last year’s flower hath returned in the garden (this year), in this sense the return of the individual, or identity, or personality is not meant; nay, rather, it is intended that the same qualities and states existing in that lamp or flower, which are now seen in this lamp or flower, have returned. That is, the same perfections and virtues and properties which existed in the past springtime have returned during this present springtime. For instance: When one says, these fruits are the same as those of last year; in this sense, he hath reference to the freshness and delicacy of the fruit, which hath returned, <span data-pg='644'></span> although there is no doubt that the identical fruit of last year hath not returned. </p>

<p id='678.7'> Have the friends of God found such enjoyments and repose during their existence on this visible earth, that they might wish to have their return renewed and repeated constantly? Are all these calamities, injuries, trials and difficulties of the once coming not sufficient for them that they should wish a repeated life in this world? Hath this cup been of such sweetness that they should long for it successively and repeatedly? No! the friends of the Beauty of Bahá never seek any recompense or reward except the meeting and the visit (of God) in the Kingdom of Bahá; and they never walk but in the valley of desire to attain the Supreme Height. They only wish the immortal blessing and the eternal gift, which are sanctified above the worldly understanding. </p>

<p id='678.8'> Because, when thou lookest with the iron sight, thou wilt find that all mankind is suffering in this earthly world; there is no one in such tranquility that this (state) might have been a reward for his good deeds in a former life and there is no soul so happy that this might be the fruit of his past pain! Had the life of a man in his spiritual being been only confined to his life in this world, the creation would have proved useless; the divine qualities would have no result and effect; nay, all things, created beings and the world of creation would have proved abortive. I ask pardon of God for such false imaginations and for such errors! </p>

<p id='678.9'> As the usefulness and powers of the life (of a child) were not seen in that dark and narrow world (of the womb), but when it is brought into this vast world, all <span data-pg='645'></span> the use of its growth and development becometh manifest and obvious in it, so likewise, reward and punishment, paradise and hell, and the requital of deeds and actions done by it in the present life become manifest and evident when it is transferred to the world to come — which is far from this world! Had the life and growth of the child in the womb been confined to that condition, then the existence of the child in the womb would have proved utterly abortive and unintelligible; as would the life of this world, were its deeds, actions and their results not to appear in the world to come. </p>

<p id='678.10'> Therefore, know thou that the True One possesseth invisible worlds which human meditation is unable to comprehend and the intellect of man hath no power to imagine. When thou wilt purify and clarify thy spiritual nostrils from every worldly moisture, then thou wilt inhale the holy fragrances diffusing from the merciful gardens of these worlds. </p>

<p id='678.11'> Bahá be upon thee and upon all those who are gazing and turning unto the Kingdom of Bahá, which God hath sanctified above the understand of the heedless souls and from being perceived by the eye of those who deny! </p>

Make them the companions of and partaker with this servant [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] in the devotion of Thy Threshold. O my God! Strengthen the weak ones and open the eyes of those who are anxious to behold the <span data-pg='647'></span> beauty of the Kingdom, that they may arise with divine strength, heavenly bounty, spiritual blessing, ethereal breaths and mighty assistance for Thy service, dispelling the superstitions of the doubters, elucidating the proofs and evidences before all seekers, healing the sick, being kind to the poor, a refuge and home for the helpless and a light for the hopeless. </p>

<p id='679.6' class='blockquote italic'> Thou art the Powerful and the Able, the Pitiful and Compassionate God! </p>

<p id='679.7'> O my friends! Endeavor to your utmost ability that, day by day, unity and harmony will increase and the love of God will so firmly capture the hearts that they will forget all save Him and be engrossed, night and day, in mentioning the Kingdom, the heavenly signs and the divine verses. If love, friendship, association and unity be established among the believers, the door of all significances will be opened and each believer of God will be able to explain and interpret all of the holy Books. </p>

<p id='679.8'> O believers! The tests of God are very severe; you should beseech and cry unto Him that you may be firm and steadfast during all temptations. </p>

<p id='682.3'> Yea, some of the intellectually cultured people in those countries exert themselves to reach the loftiest summits of prosperity in worldly affairs and most of them are desiring wealth and are making an effort to attain it somehow. But they are unmindful of the treasury of the Kingdom, the spiritual affluence and the wealth of mind; therefore, thou findest them subject to the rage of lusts and under the influence of egotistic and selfish desires, sinking into intemperance and engaged <span data-pg='649'></span> in drinking the cup of lust. Were they to become mindful of their heedlessness and awakened from the sleep of ignorance, they would become intoxicated by the cup of the love of God and exhilarated by the good cheer of the wine of the knowledge of God. </p>

<p id='682.4'> I beg of God to shine forth unto you with the lights of His sanctity and send to you divine souls, that they may fully reveal to you the divine teachings. </p>

<p id='682.5'> The letters which I sent to you are as the fragrant breezes of the garden of the knowledge of God, which can be smelled by every one whose sense of smelling is clean and purified from any rheum, because they are glad-tidings proceeding from pure lips which are fluent in explaining the mysteries of God. I beg of God to ordain for us to meet one another. </p>

<p id='690.3'> The world of humanity is encompassed by the darkness of conventionalities, disagreements, discords, avoidance, animosity, enmity, ignorance, folly, lustful desires and animal tendencies; the gloomy night had darkened the horizon of the world in such manner that all had forgotten the light and deemed the darkness inevitable in the world of humanity, and its solution impossible; when, unexpectedly, the Light of Reality appeared and enlightened the horizon of the world, diffusing its rays throughout the East and West, the beholding of which instantly delighted the perfect and perceiving eyes; but the imperfect eyes, afflicted by the darkness, were dazzled by the radiance, while the negligent closed theirs and turned away entirely. That light is the Love of God, the Spirit of God, unity, concord, science and knowledge, bounty and perfection, redemption of life spiritual perception, universal peace, alliance of the nations, unification of all peoples and <span data-pg='654'></span> the reality of the attributes of the Merciful One, which I hope thou wilt fully attain. </p>

  </div>

<p id='691' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O seeker of the truth! </p>

<p id='691.2' class='dropcap'> There are two ways of healing diseases, the material and the spiritual way. The first is the remedies of the physicians; the second prayers and turning one’s self to God. Both must be practiced and followed. The diseases that happen to be caused by physical accident are cured by medical aid; others, which are due to spiritual causes, will disappear by spiritual means. For instance: For a disease due to grieving, fear, nervous impressions, the spiritual remedies will take more effect than the physical. Therefore, these two kinds of remedies must be followed; neither is an obstacle to the other. You must take care of the physical remedies. These also came from the bounty and mercy of God who revealed and made evident the science of medicine, so that His servants may also be benefited by this mode of healing. In the same way take care of the spiritual healing, because it giveth wonderful results. </p>

<p id='691.3'> And if thou art looking for the divine remedy which will cure the spirit of man of all diseases and make him obtain the health of the divine Kingdom, know that it is the precepts and teachings of God. Take the greatest care of them. </p>

  </div>

<p id='692'> Thy letter was received and its contents noted. In truth, thou hast been thrown amid dire ordeals, enduring agonizing afflictions. These trials were according <span data-pg='655'></span> to the consummate wisdom, therefore they were for the best. It is good for man to endure (in such moments). </p>

<p id='692.2'> Reflect upon his holiness Job: What trials, calamities and perplexities did he not endure! But these tests were like unto the fire and his holiness Job was like unto pure gold. Assuredly gold is purified by being submitted to the fire and if it contain any alloy or imperfection, it will disappear. That is the reason why violent tests become the cause of the everlasting glory of the righteous and are conducive to the destruction and disappearance of the unrighteous. </p>

<p id='692.3'> The wisdom of all these tribulations that poured successively upon thee was this, that thou shouldst be prepared and made ready for this Cause, that thou mightest expect the attainment to the greatest guidance, for all these trials were but a preparation for thine entrance into the Most Exalted Paradise and the beginning of obtaining this most great benefit. </p>

<p id='692.4'> Unless the season of winter appear, thunder roll, lightning flash, snow and rain fall, hail and frost descend and the intensity of cold execute its command, the season of the soul-refreshing spring would not come, the fragrant breeze would not waft, the moderation of temperature would not be realized, the roses and hyacinths would not grow, the surface of the earth would not become a delectable paradise, the trees would not bloom, neither would they bring forth fruits and leaves. That fierce inclemency of cold, snow, frost and tempest was the beginning of the manifestation of these roses, hyacinths, buds, blossoms and fruits. </p>

<p id='692.5'> Therefore, be not distressed on account of those adversities which fell upon thee; nay, rather, arise and <span data-pg='656'></span> render thanks that the ultimate goal is the attainment to this eminent bounty and the enjoyment of this highest gift of the Almighty God. Consequently gird up the loins of thine endeavor, that thereby some results might be produced, some fruits gathered, the lamp of everlasting life ignited and the gifts of the Lord of the Kingdom be manifest, so that thou mayest accomplish again, with great yearning and exaltation, the worship of the Lord of Hosts. </p>

<p id='693' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='693.2' class='dropcap'> Thy last letter, sent by Mírzá ______, hath arrived. It is not a very long time since I wrote thee a letter in which I said how contented I was with thee and I explained to thee the importance of thy visit to India and showed thee the results and fruits of that visit. </p>

<p id='693.3'> At this moment hath arrived a letter in which thou hast praised the believers in Rangoon, especially Siyyid ______, Mírzá ______, Mírzá ______ and Kay-<u>Kh</u>usraw <a data-fnid='274'></a> who sacrificed his life for thine; yea, this is the truth! Consider what a difference exists between his country and thine and what a great effect this Bahá’í spirit hath manifested that an Oriental sacrificeth his life for an Occidental! What attraction, what love, what relationship is this! Blessed are those who are able to arrive at an understanding of the reality of the power of this love! </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn274'> Kay-<u>Kh</u>usraw was a Zoroastrian Bahá’í of Bombay, India, who left his home and went to Lahore to nurse Mr. Sydney Sprague who was sick of a fever. Mr. Sprague recovered, while the great Kay-<u>Kh</u>usraw died. He was the first Oriental friend to give his life for a Western Bahá’í brother. </aside>

<p id='693.4'> Concerning Mr. ______, one of the Hindus of <span data-pg='657'></span> whom thou hast written: Say to him, “To me thou art not a stranger, but a friend; thou art not unknown, but known.” </p>

<p id='693.5'> Thou hast spoken of a spiritual wave. This is not a wave, but a sea; nay, the very ocean! But this is not to destroy the cities, but to purify them; and soon it will submerge them all. This does not mean destruction, but salvation; it is not death, but life; it is not enmity, but love; it is not pain; it is a remedy. The world of existence is the body, and this is its spirit; this immense world is the glass [chimney], and this is the lamp [lighted wick]; humanity is the heaven, this is its sun. The signs of this bounty are clear and visible. The proof is the changing of the characters of the friends and the perfection that the believers have made in their actions and words: They were dark, they became luminous; they were terrestrial, they became celestial; they were human, they became divine; they were diabolic, they became angelic; they were a drop, they became the sea; they were an atom, they became the sun. These are the signs of those who are entirely submerged by this wave; that is to say, this ocean. </p>

<p id='693.6'> O thou ______! I hope that thou wilt progress more and more; that thou wilt increase thy knowledge and science; and that thou wilt ever strive for gentleness and love. </p>

<p id='693.7'> Perhaps it will be possible for thee, next winter, to go to Persia. </p>

<p class='question'>  (Question: “Master, who art thou? Art thou the Christ?”)</p>

<p id='695.3'> As to what thou asked concerning me: Verily, I say unto thee, that I am indeed an humble, submissive and <span data-pg='659'></span> imploring servant of God; a servant of His Beloved; a messenger of the exaltation of His Word; a spreader of His Fragrances; an extoller of the banner of love and harmony; a promoter of the greatest peace among all nations and tribes; a kindler of the fire of the love of God in the hearts of the people; a runner to the place of martyrdom in the Cause of God; a yearner for every calamity in the love of God; a longer for suspension upon the cross for the love of the beloved; a herald of the Kingdom of God among the sects of all horizons. This is my station and condition; this is my blazing crown; this is my glorious throne; because my servitude to the Holy Threshold is my brilliant light, my shining star and my drawn sword; and beside this I have no other name. </p>

<p id='695.4'> Then know that for the dominion of the reality of Christ there is no beginning and there is no end. Everlastingly that luminous Entity hath been sitting on the throne of might and everlastingly It will have a penetrating dominion over the worlds of existence. This dominion is eternal and everlasting and has no abrupt end. </p>

<p class='question'>  Question: “When is the time of the millenium? Will I see it? </p>

<p id='695.5'> Concerning the one thousand years as recorded in the Book: It signifieth the beginning of this Manifestation until the end of its predominance throughout the contingent world; because this Cause is great, its powers are growing and its signs are dazzling. It shall continue in elevation, exaltation, growth, promulgation and promotion until it shall reach the apex of its glory in one thousand years — as the day of this Manifestation <span data-pg='660'></span> is one thousand years. Thou shalt see its conquering power, its manifest dominion, its eternal might and its everlasting glory. </p>

<p class='question'>  Question: “At the time of thy departure will there not be some great spiritual manifestation all over the earth?” </p>

<p id='695.6'> As to the question of “after my departure” to the neighborhood of the mercy of my Lord: Know there shall appear wonderful traces; the breath of God shall pass by; the fragrance of God shall spread and the Spirit of God shall run in the body of the contingent world both before and after my departure; but I supplicate God that He may grant the greatest spirituality in these days. Endeavor, therefore, that thou mayest have a great portion in it. </p>

<p class='question'>  Question: “What did the vision of a paper signify in my dream?” </p>

<p id='695.7'> Concerning the appearance of a paper in thy dream, before thine eyes, which thou wast unable to read: Thou shalt read it through the permission of God and thou shalt comprehend its meanings. It is a diary of the Word of God and the divine mysteries. </p>

<p id='696.4'> But those who have advanced to the Kingdom of God have assuredly advanced to a sea of clear and limpid water and thus have attained unto the greatest bounty, the perfect rest and the eternal life to which there is no abrupt end. Their faces have shined with joy, their souls delighted with pleasure, their hearts illumined and their cups overflowed with abundance. Their edifice hath risen high, their palaces have been adorned, their suns shone, their stars gleamed and their diadems radiated with a dazzling light. Their dominions have expanded and their lights have spread to all ages and generations. These are their set-up thrones, their high palaces, their luminous lamps and their shining moons throughout all horizons. These are their traces in the world; how much more then would be their lights in the highest of the high — consider, therefore, O ye maid-servants of the Merciful! </p>

<p id='696.5'> This being the case, care no more for the world and its desires, but cling to the spiritual world and its gifts, spread the fragrances of God, be submissive to the Word of God, establish a spiritual meeting place where from the incense of sanctity and purity will rise up to God, assemble there with fragrance and spirituality and celebrate the Name of your Lord by day and by night. At that time ye would become illumined lamps, spiritual stars: rather, eternal suns.

<p id='698.7'> Briefly, O thou dear maid-servant of God! Praise be to God! thou didst see with thine own eyes, thou didst hear with thine own ears and thou didst comprehend with thine own heart. Thou didst witness the qualities and the life and conduct of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and thou didst behold the love and kindness, faith and assurance of the friends of Persia. Thou didst see the exaltation (or progress) of the Cause of God and thou didst test the general character (or qualities) of the friends; and thou didst know with perfect assurance that the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh is the means for the quickening of the world and for the extraordinary progress of mankind; that it hath quickened Persia and hath removed the darkness of ignorance, that the friends are kind unto all the people of the world and self-sacrificing servants of mankind. </p>

<p id='726' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God! </p>

<p id='726.2' class='dropcap'> Give thanks unto God for having revealed unto thee, in visions, the mysteries of His Kingdom and for having <span data-pg='679'></span> strengthening thee to attain certain revelations which show thine utmost attraction and constancy unto this great Cause. </p>

<p id='726.3'> Verily, the three birds are the three holy souls. The one on the right is His Holiness the great Báb, the one on the left is His Honor Quddús,<a data-fnid='285'></a> the glorious soul, and the great bird in the middle is the Greatest Name.<a data-fnid='286'></a> The light shining from the Supreme Horizon is the Beauty of Abhá. These birds descended from an infinite height and the nearer they came to earth the more their majesty and glory became manifest. All nations were promised by a sure promise and were awaiting with anxiety and longing the coming of the Promised One. The two birds accompanying the great bird in the center signifies that the Báb and His Honor the Khudoos were both under the wings of the Greatest Name. As those birds descended and their shadows extended vertically over the expectants, as the sun approacheth the zenith at noontide, at this time thou hast seen a majestic being in the form of man upon the back of the huge bird in the center. This person in the human form is the “divine station” mentioned in the Bible: “Let us make man in our image after our likeness.” And the divine lights were reflected from the reality of the Greatest Name. Although this station is far from the minds and understandings, yet its lights are apparent, its rays reflected and its brilliancy manifested throughout the universe. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn285'> Quddús: literally, Holy; the title given to one of the great martyrs of Persia. </aside>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn286'> Bahá’u’lláh. </aside>

<p id='726.4'> The white garments signify holy dignity and a station sanctified from color, i.e., free from the universal <span data-pg='680'></span> conditions and material qualities. That luminous countenance, manifested in beauty, signifieth that the divine lights shone forth from the human form, which were reflected and descended upon thee, dazzling the eyes of those who were perceiving it as the sun dazzles the eyes of those who try to look upon it. That divine form manifested itself in America and entered the great Temple which shall soon be constructed therein. This glorious Temple resembles the Oriental edifices and soon thou wilt see it erected there with a most solid foundation and strongest basis. That divine face will beam upon numberless souls who will enter this Temple. </p>

<p id='726.5'> Regarding the table laid in that magnificent house: This is the heavenly table of divine knowledge, love and eternal life. As to the people gathered there, they are the beloved of God and His chosen ones whose faces shine with wonderful and heavenly beauty. The woman sitting at the side of the Temple is the law of God, which will soon dispel all veils and its beauty will appear, after which it shall be established forever and ever. The stamped coins presented to the woman sitting in that honored station, are the good deeds and actions of the beloved of God and His maid-servants, submitted with praise, greetings and great thanksgiving unto that holy law. The beautiful woman is blessed by being touched by that Merciful Being the glory of whose blessing shall suffuse the universe. Then the Merciful Being returned to His station, mounting the bird and ascended to the Supreme Horizon in the infinite realm. </p>

<p id='726.6'> This vision showeth that thou, O confirmed and attracted one, by the breezes of God will soon be acquainted with the ancient mysteries, for the Manifest <span data-pg='681'></span> Light will appear to thee. The vision also signifieth that a Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár will soon be established in America. The cries of supplication and invocation will be raised to the Highest Kingdom therefrom and, verily, the people will enter into the religion of God by troops with great enthusiasm and attraction. </p>

<p id='726.7'> Concerning thy vision of the angels surrounding the great white throne: This “throne” is the body of the Greatest Name. The beautiful and glorious person riding upon the white horse is the Greatest Name and the white horse means also His glorious body. The herald who proclaimed the written names in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who announceth the names of those who deserve salvation and are firm in the Covenant of God, and thou art one of those people, the people of salvation. Be thankful for this great favor. </p>

  </div>

<p id='727' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God! </p>

<p id='727.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, thy coming, at this time, unto this shining, blessed Holy Land is not consistent with wisdom, but when the (proper) time cometh, we shall give thee permission to come to this Spot of Light. Thank thou God for that the love of God hath pervaded thee and seized the reins from thy hands. This spiritual love shall surely pervade all regions. </p>

<p id='727.3'> As to human souls (or individuals): Unless they acquire the light, they are unable to shine upon other individuals. But when a man ariseth to expound the arguments of God and invite people to enter in the religion of God, and when he uttereth those arguments and advanceth consummate proofs concerning the appearance of the great Kingdom, then intense love shall <span data-pg='682'></span> become manifest in his heart. This love causeth the development of this spirit by the grace of the beneficent Lord. Consider, O maid-servant of God, the bearer who brought the garment of Joseph to Jacob. That messenger was the bearer of the garment, but he could not inhale the fragrance of Joseph. But Jacob, whose nostrils were pure, inhaled the fragrances of Joseph from a long distance. </p>

<p id='727.4'> It may be that man can guide a blessed, holy soul into the Kingdom of God while he, himself, is deprived thereof. Consider Judas Iscariot: He invited others, while he, himself, was deprived of the Kingdom of God. But in spiritual training (or development) it is impossible for an imperfect one to perfect another or train another unless he first conquers his own self and desire and becomes purified from selfish impurities in order to become capable of merciful splendors. When he acquires divine bounties, then he is able to train another. An ignorant man hath no power to teach a seeker (of knowledge) and a poor man hath no power to succor a needy one. Consequently, be thou assured that, verily, man needs to wish for eternal life and then confer the same upon another. These human perfections and merciful bounties are that peace which was promised and spoken of by Christ. </p>

<p id='727.5'> Then know thou that, verily, the people of Bahá must needs be distinguished from others in all respects, until they become the lamps of the True One among the creatures and the stars of guidance shining from the Supreme Concourse. </p>

<p id='727.6'> Then know thou, verily, that Luminous Man, the lights of whose Face dazzle the eyes and before whom <span data-pg='683'></span> thou knelt down when thou sawest His light, is the Greatest Name, the Ancient Light, the Honorable Temple! </p>

<p id='728' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou sincere servant of Bahá’u’lláh! </p>

<p id='728.2' class='dropcap'> Thy letter was received and its content was the cause of infinite happiness, for it was an indication of thy firmness in the faith and thy steadfastness in the Covenant and Testament. Today, the greatest of all titles and praises are firmness and steadfastness, for the tests and trials are of the utmost intensity. I ask God that day by day thou mayest increase in steadfastness, so like unto a solid rock thou mayest withstand the tempestuous sea of test. </p>

<p id='728.3'> The people of the world are like unto trees (i.e., trees without roots), they are torn up by the passing of a gust of wind, but trees which are deeply rooted, strong and sturdy, are not uprooted by the most violent tempest — therefore they produce leaves, blossoms and fruits. </p>

<p id='728.4'> O thou spiritual friend! Thou hast asked the wisdom of prayer. Know thou that prayer is indispensable and obligatory, and man under no pretext whatsoever is excused from performing the prayer unless he be mentally unsound, or an insurmountable obstacle prevent him. The wisdom of prayer is this: That it causeth a connection between the servant and the True One, because in that state (i.e., prayer) man with all heart and soul turneth his face towards His Highness the Almighty, seeking His association and desiring His love and compassion. The greatest happiness for a lover is to converse with his beloved, and the greatest <span data-pg='684'></span> gift for a seeker is to become familiar with the object of his longing; that is why with every soul who is attracted to the Kingdom of God, his greatest hope is to find an opportunity to entreat and supplicate before his Beloved, appeal for His mercy and grace and be immersed in the ocean of His utterance, goodness and generosity. </p>

<p id='728.5'> Beside all this, prayer and fasting is the cause of awakening and mindfulness and conducive to protection and preservation from tests. The obligatory prayer is revealed from the Supreme Pen and is translated in America. Ask for it from the believers and use it. </p>

<p id='737.4'> Therefore, this meeting is blessed. But if it is firmly established and become constant, it will bring forth great results and most weighty developments will be attained. Consequently, persevere ye in renewing your meetings and display utmost magnanimity in firmness and steadfastness.

<p id='738' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou lover of humanity! <a data-fnid='289'></a> </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn289'> To believer in New Zealand. </aside>

<p id='738.2' class='dropcap'> Thy letter was received and its contents imparted spiritual significances. Thank thou God that from thy <span data-pg='691'></span> early childhood thou hast been always a seeker after salvation and hast been spending thy energy and effort in charitable affairs and the excellences of the world of humanity. However, every great Cause in this world of existence findeth a visible expression through three means; first, intention; second, confirmation; third, action. Today on this earth there are many souls who are the spreaders of peace and reconciliation and are longing for the realization of the oneness and unity of the world of man; but this intention needs a dynamic power, so that it may become manifest in the world of being. Today the divine instructions and lordly exhortations of Bahá’u’lláh promulgate this most great aim and the confirmations of the Kingdom are the supports and defenders of this eminent intention. For the power of the Word of God is penetrative and the existence of the divine Kingdom is uninterrupted. Therefore, ere long it will become evident and clear that the ensign of the Most Great Peace is the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. For the intention, the power and the action, all the three essential elements are brought together and the realization of everything in the contingent world dependeth upon these three principles. </p>

<p id='738.3'> Therefore, O thou lover of the oneness of the world of humanity! spread thou as much as thou canst the instructions and teachings of His Highness Bahá’u’lláh, so that the desired Beloved become unveiled in the assembly of humankind and cast her light upon all the people. </p>

<p id='738.4'> Likewise, some of the ancient philosophers have spoken regarding the oneness of the world of humanity, <span data-pg='692'></span> but confirmation and assistance become not their supports and helpers. Consequently their endeavors ended in being without result and the tree of their hope without fruit. </p>

<p id='738.5'> Thou hast written regarding the language of Esperanto. This language will be spread and universalized to a certain degree, but later on a language more complete than this, or the same language will undergo some changes and alterations and will be adopted and become universal. I hope that Dr. Zamenhof become assisted by the invisible confirmation and do a great service to the world of humanity. </p>

<p id='738.6'> O thou maid-servant of God! Whatsoever question thou hast in thy heart, turn thou thy heart toward the Kingdom of Abhá and entreat in the Threshold of the Almighty and reflect upon that problem, then unquestionably the light of truth shall dawn and the reality of that problem will become evident and clear to thee. For the teachings of His Highness Bahá’u’lláh are the keys to all the doors. Every hidden secret will become discovered and every hidden mystery will become manifest and apparent. *** </p>

<p id='740.5'> O thou maid-servant of God! Verily, the tongue of the Supreme Concourse uttereth the praise of those women who are the glory of men; women who have forgotten themselves, have abandoned their own rest, attached their hearts to the Kingdom of God, raised their voice in the Name of God, diffused the signs of God and uttered clear arguments and firm proofs concerning the manifestation of the Kingdom of God. Trust thou in this promise; then depart to those regions with infinite joy and gladness and bear unto people glad-tidings in commemoration thy Lord. Verily, thy Lord assist thee under all aspects and circumstances. And in the coming year, if it is possible for thee to come, present thyself at this Blessed Spot and fragrant region. </p>

It is my hope that the desire of the friends of God be as such, so that they may be released from the influence of the ephemeral word, shine in the Kingdom of eternity, be exhilarated by the wine of the love of God and, like unto the tempestuous sea, rage and roar with the ardor of the love of God.

<p id='754' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou who are supplicating to God and turning to the Spirit of His Kingdom! </p>

<p id='754.2' class='dropcap'> I have read the texts of thy praise to God on the occasion of the arrival of my letter to thee. Know thou, that letter sent to thee by me, was only because of my perfect love for thee and my pity upon thee, for I had the desire that the fragrance of the Holy Spirit, which hath perfumed all regions and imbued the entire body of the world with the Spirit of Life, should pas over thee and abide with thee. Notwithstanding the high position it occupieth, still, with an eloquent tongue, through which the Spirit moveth, hearts are attracted and bosoms burn, it speaketh to the pure hearts and to the good and righteous souls in every spot of the earth. This is the powerful Spirit, the dazzling light, the brilliant star and the overwhelming and universal abundance. And, from its traces, spread and divulged everywhere, thou wilt know and realize its influence and comprehend its radiance. I ask God to expose thee to its fragrance, move thee by its breeze, enkindle thee by its coals of fire and illuminate thee by its brightness. Turn thyself wholly to it — thus thou shalt be enabled to ascertain its influence and power, the strength of its life and the greatness of its confirmation. Verily, I say unto thee, that if for the appearance of that Divine Essence thou desirest to have a definite proof, an indisputable testimony and a strong, convincing evidence, thou must prepare thyself to make thy heart empty and thine eye ready to look only toward the Kingdom of God. Then, at that time, the radiance of that widespread effulgence will descend upon thee successively, and that motion rendered thee by the Holy Spirit will <span data-pg='706'></span> make thee dispense with any other strong evidence that leadeth to the appearance of this Light, because the greatest and strongest proof for showing the abundance of the Spirit to the bodies is the very appearance of its power and influence in those bodies. </p>

<p id='754.3'> Think deeply of this in order to know the reality of my explanation and demonstration. </p>

<p id='755' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou that virtuous soul and individual who art ready for the confirmation of the Holy Spirit! </p>

<p id='755.2' class='dropcap'> I, with the utmost clemency, have read thy brilliant letter which showeth thine advancement toward the Kingdom of God and the excessive preparation for the effulgence of the lights of God and the greatest tendency for the baptism of the Spirit of God and thy pleasure at the glad-tidings of God, thine attraction by the fragrance of God and thy gladness in the love of God. May God strengthen thee so thou mayest come nearer to God, to separate thyself from aught else save Him and to assist thee in spreading His lights and uttering the abundance of His mysteries, to perfume thy nostrils with the fragrance of His holiness and to prepare for thee the heavenly table, that thou mayest taste the delight of His loving-kindness. I now assure thee, O servant of God, that, if thy mind become empty and pure from every mention and thought and thy heart attracted wholly to the Kingdom of God, forget all else besides God and come in communion with the Spirit of God, then the Holy Spirit will assist thee with a power which will enable thee to penetrate all things, and a Dazzling Spark which enlightens all sides, a Brilliant Flame in the zenith of the heavens, <span data-pg='707'></span> will teach thee that which thou dost not know of the facts of the universe and of the divine doctrine. Verily, I say unto thee, every soul which ariseth today to guide others to the path of safety and infuse in them the Spirit of Life, the Holy Spirit will inspire that soul with evidences, proofs and facts and the lights will shine upon it from the Kingdom of God. Do not forget what I have conveyed unto thee from the breath of the Spirit. Verily, it is the shining morning and the rosy dawn which will impart unto thee the lights, reveal the mysteries and make thee competent in science, and through it the pictures of the Supreme World will be printed in thy heart and facts of the secrets of the Kingdom of God will shine before thee. Christ said — glory be to Him! — “Many are called but few chosen.” Thank thou thy Lord for He hath made thee of the chosen. By my life! verily, this is a station which God giveth to whomsoever He pleaseth. Know its value and appreciate it according to its desserts! Arise with all thy power to answer [i.e., to perform] all that is necessary to obtain this grace and bounty and be strengthened in all circumstances and conditions of this existence. How many noble-minded women, who were the queens of all provinces and countries, have died and passed away and thou no longer hearest any many mention of them; but every servant of the servants of the Merciful, who were in the past decades and centuries, owing to their bright faces illumined by the lights of truth and knowledge, their stars shine until today in the horizon of the highest and their rays dazzle in the mirrors of the world and their fame is divulged in the Supreme World and their sanctification spread in <span data-pg='708'></span> the Kingdom of God; and if — God forbid! — the foot of man deviate as did that of Judas, so that he became human after he was divine and sold the blood of Christ for a small and trifling sum — verily, there is in that a great lesson to the people of understanding! </p>

<p id='755.3'> Although I am far away from thee in body, still I am near unto thee in spirit. But I ask God that the body will follow the spirit and our meeting will be facilitated. The most essential thing is the spiritual relation, the hearty friendship and the heavenly attraction. Thou must accomplish this. </p>

  </div>

<p id='756' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou gem of the Kingdom and brilliant leaf! </p>

<p id='756.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, I have read thy letter which showeth how thou art turning unto God, moved by the breath of God, drawn by the Spirit of God and how the mystery of existence, the image of the Lord of Hosts, was revealed unto thee. This indicates that God shall open before thee the doors of revelation and the Spirit of Truth shall confirm thee with evident signs. </p>

<p id='756.3'> Seeing this servant in thy prayers is a proof of the ideal nearness, of the spiritual unity and of the impression that was printed within thine own consciousness. At all times I do supplicate to the divine Kingdom to make thy heart a pure, clear and polished mirror, facing the most glorious Kingdom, Abhá, that the pictures of the Supreme Concourse may be printed in it, and this is exactly what was meant in the Bible by this text: “Let us create man after our own image and likeness.” </p>

<p id='756.4'> To see repeatedly is an evidence that the vision will take place both in the spirit and body; but separation <span data-pg='709'></span> and union, parting and meeting are things which belong to the material body. The spirit is sanctified from association, departure, nearness, remoteness, connection and separation, for these are of the properties of material bodies and of the characteristics of the elementary facts; but the Spirit is everlastingly in the station of its loftiness and supremacy in a similar way to the sun which is continually stationed in its sphere orbit; its appearance and disappearance signify the clearness of the place and the firmness of the body which is facing it, and as long as the confronting surface continues to be in a well polished condition, the lights of the sun will then appear in it; but when it becometh rough and impure, the lights disappear. </p>

<p id='756.5'> Consequently, it hath been proven that nearness and remoteness signify smoothness, clearness and fineness; or rust, impurity and roughness, respectively. </p>

<p id='756.6'> And if God wisheth, through the clearness of the heart, we will be continually in the assembly of alliance and friendship, resting permanently in the spiritual and heavenly realm, adoring and worshipping God, meeting and uniting by the holy fragrances, drawn by the magnet of the love of God and thanking Him for this great bounty and evident victory. </p>

<p id='756.7'> As to our meeting materially (i.e., face to face), I ask God that He may ordain this for us in the way He deemeth best. </p>

<p id='756.8'> Then know, O thou virtuous soul, that as soon as thou becomest separated from aught else save God and dost cut thyself from the worldly things, thy heart will shine with lights of divinity and with the effulgence of the Sun of Truth from the horizon of the Realm of <span data-pg='710'></span> Might, and then thou wilt be filed by the spirit of power from God and become capable of doing that which thou desirest. This is the confirmed truth. </p>

<p id='756.9'> As to the desire shown by thee towards serving holy and spiritual souls, it is indeed of the best desires and of the most noble qualities. Blessed is he who is strengthened and confirmed by such a desire during all his life, in the hope of attaining eternal life. </p>

<p id='756.10'> As to thee, O thou being who art attracted to God, announce the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of God through the breaths of the Holy Spirit; for He will confirm thee in similar manner to the confirmation He bestowed upon the holy souls in the past decades and former ages. </p>

<p id='757.4'> O maid-servant of God! Verily, the Holy Spirit breathes, in this day, unto the hearts which are moving, beating, pure and attracted by the love of <span data-pg='711'></span> God. </p>

<p id='757.5'> Abandon thou every occupation and be engaged in the affairs of thy Lord and serve the “Spirit of Truth” which hath poured a spiritual, divine and everlasting life upon the brilliant hearts. </p>

<p id='757.7'> O maid-servant of God! Many spiritual women came (into the world) and passed away in vain; no sound is heard of them and no trace is seen of them, inasmuch as their spirits were not dependent upon the Holy Spirit, nor were they attracted to the fragrances of truth; nor were they ever baptized by the water of life, by the fire of the love of God, nor by the “Spirit of Truth” which speaketh in the assemblies of the Kingdom and breatheth upon spirits the breezes which waft and eternal glory, the signs of which are everlasting. </p>

<p id='763'> The contents of thy last letter were extremely rejoicing, for they were a glorious evidence of the glowing of the fire of the love of God, of attainment to the gift of God and of the spiritual connection of the spirits. For as much as hearts are like unto mirrors, when the light of the love of God is enkindled, brilliant rays will reflect and merciful phenomena become manifest and clear. Physical nearness or remoteness is of no importance; the essential fact is the spiritual affinity <span data-pg='720'></span> and ideal nearness. Judas Iscariot was for a long time favored in the holy court of His Holiness Christ, yet he was entirely far and remote; while Paul, the apostle, was in close embrace with His Holiness. The Egyptian carrier of glad-tidings was the bearer of the garment of Joseph, yet he could not inhale the fragrance of the garment. His holiness Jacob, in Canaan, longed for meeting (Joseph), yet he was near and inhaled the fragrance of the garment. Consequently, it is evident that one can certainly and surely inhale the perfume of affinity even from a far distance. I beg of God that He may strengthen and solidify such connections between the friends (believers), so that the spiritual unity may become a manifest light and the earthly world may become a camping-place for the heavenly hosts. </p>

<p id='763.2'> O thou dear maid-servant of God! Be thou aglow and illumined and be thou enkindled in soul with the fire of the love of God in every assemblage. Be not quiet for a moment and do not seed composure even for an hour (i.e., be active in spreading the light). Be thou a cause for the illumining of hearts and spiritualizing of souls. Always communicate about this (truth) with that great personage in France and write to him: “No matter how clear, pure and polished the mirror may be, not until it is turned unto the Sun of Truth will it find glorious bounty and become reflective of rays.” *** </p>

<p id='764.2' class='dropcap'> We considered all that thou hast written. It seems that the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ______, hath arisen to deliver (the truth). If she advanceth in this <span data-pg='721'></span> manner, maketh more effort and day by day groweth in spirituality, sincerity, devotion and severance, in a short time she will become purely merciful and will spiritualize others; she will progress in the stations of sanctity and purity; she will become the possessor of a fluent speech and will find her heart brilliant and full of serenity and faith to such an extent that her pure breath will so take effect even in stone, tree and clay (i.e., in all people), that she, herself, will be astonished. When the interior parts of musical instruments become clear and polished, their tone will take effect and warm the hearts. I hope the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ______, may attain to this degree, for she is capable. </p>

<p id='765.2' class='dropcap'> It is some time since news hath come from thee, though I have the utmost kindness toward that favored maid-servant of the Threshold of the Almighty. I beg of God that the power of the Spirit will cause in thee such ecstasy and attraction that thou mayest be the cause of everlasting life to the seekers; mayest hold a cup of knowledge of God in thy hand and give people to drink the wine of the love of God; that thou mayest exhilarate the souls, awaken the heedless, bring the ignorant to consciousness, make the blind seeing, quicken the dead, enkindle the faded souls and refresh the withered ones. </p>

<p id='765.3'> Convey greeting and praise to the favored maid-servant of God, thy revered daughter. Also, announce thou on my behalf the confirmations of the Holy Spirit unto the other maid-servants of the Merciful <span data-pg='722'></span> One. </p>

<p id='766' class='nodropcap italic larger'>  O thou flame of the Love of God! </p>

<p id='766.2' class='dropcap'> What thou hast written caused joy, for that letter was like unto a rose-garden whose roses of significances bestowed the sweet odor of the love of God upon the nostrils. Similarly, my answers to thy letters will, like unto rain and dew, bestow infinite purity and freshness upon those myrtles of significances which have blossomed in the garden of the heart. </p>

<p id='766.3'> Thou hast written concerning the tests that have come to thee. To the sincere ones, tests are as a gift from God, the Exalted, for a heroic person hasteneth, with the utmost joy and gladness, to the tests of a violent battlefield, but the coward is afraid and trembles and utters moaning and lamentation. Likewise, an expert student prepareth and memorizeth his lessons and exercises with the utmost effort, and in the day of examination he appeareth with infinite joy before the master. Likewise, the pure gold shineth radiantly in the fire of test. Consequently, it is make clear that for holy souls, trials are as the gift of God, the Exalted; but for weak souls they are an unexpected calamity. This test is just as thou hast written: it removeth the rust of egotism from the mirror of the heart until the Sun of Truth may shine therein. For, no veil is greater than egotism and no matter how thin that covering may be, yet it will finally veil man entirely <span data-pg='723'></span> and prevent him from receiving a portion from the eternal bounty. </p>

<p id='766.4'> O thou attracted maid-servant of God! When the men and maid-servants of God pass in my mind, I feel the heat of the love of God and I pray the Almighty God to assist those blessed souls with the invisible hosts. Praise be to God! the prophecies of all the prophets have become manifest and are fulfilled in this holy and blessed age and this great day of Bahá’u’lláh! </p>

<p id='766.5'> O thou attracted maid-servant of God! Nearness is, in reality, of the soul, not of the body, and help and receptivity of help are spiritual, not physical. Notwithstanding this, I hope that thou mayest attain nearness in every respect. Be thou assured that the divine bounties will so encompass holy souls even as the light of the sun doth the moon and stars. </p>

<p id='766.6'> Convey thou, on behalf of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the sweet odor of the fragrances of holiness to the nostrils of each one of the friends of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful and inspire and encourage thou all of them to diffuse the fragrances of God (i.e., to teach the truth). </p>

<p id='767.2' class='dropcap'> The letter arrived at a time when — praise be to God! — calamities and sufferings in the path of God have surrounded us from every direction and arrows and darts are flying from every bow. but, through the love of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh, we, in this intense darkness, are like unto a shining torch, and while in this tempest of calamities, we are turning toward the Kingdom of the Almighty and engaged in remembering <span data-pg='724'></span> thee. We do not consider this calamity as billows of the sea of afflictions and sufferings; nay, it is the ark of deliverance and the shore of peace and security. </p>

<p id='767.3'> Praise be to God! according to the commandments and exhortations of Bahá’u’lláh, we are the well-wishers of all the governments and act toward all the nations of the world in peace and love. We have no intention but that which is good and no desire but the good pleasure of God. We mean well toward every people and seek to have sincerity and good-will toward every government. In return for arrows and swords, we present milk and honey and we heal the deadly poison with the swift healing antidote. Night and day we are in action and exertion, in order to dress the wounds and cure the pain (of the people), to care for the afflicted and comfort even the ill-natured one, so that, through the assistance and favor of God, this darkness of selfish prejudice shall vanish and the error of folly and ignorance shall be changed into divine guidance. </p>

<p id='767.4'> O thou dear sister! Whenever the daughters of the Kingdom are ready in the Presence, they become initiated into the mystery and are always companions and associates (with us). </p>

<p id='767.5'> Convey respectful greeting to the favored maid-servant of God, Mrs. ______, and tell her: “Be thou assured in the divine favors and rejoice in the glad-tidings of the Merciful One.” </p>

<p id='769.3'> O thou maid-servant of God! Display thou an effort, gird up the loins of endeavor, dilate thy breast and be thou prepared for the manifestation of the breaths of the Holy Spirit in thine heart.

Then thou shalt behold that which none have seen! At that time thou shalt fall upon the ground before God the True One, for He hath favored thee with this most great bounty. </p>
