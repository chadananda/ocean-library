<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section4'> 1922-12-16 Letter on Return to Haifa </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> SOTW Volume 13 No. 11, February, 1923, p299 </p>

<p class='noid verse'> To the loved ones of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá throughout the continent of America,
  Dear fellow-workers in the Holy Vineyard of Bahá </p>

<p> Now that my tong hours of rest and meditation are happily at an end I turn my face with renewed hope and vigour to that vast continent the soil of which is pregnant with those seeds that our beloved Master has so tenderly and so profusely scattered in the past. Prolonged though this period has been, yet I have strongly felt ever since the New Day has dawned upon me that such a needed retirement, despite the temporary dislocations it might entail, would far outweigh in its results any immediate service I could have humbly tendered at the Threshold of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> I am now confident that the energies of my beloved brethren and sisters across the seas, far from being damped by my sudden disappearance from the field of service, will henceforth be fully maintained, nay redoubled in their intensity, that we may all together carry triumphantly to the uttermost corners of the world the glorious Standard of Bahá. </p>

<p> Bereft of all news whatsoever during my hours of restful seclusion, I now feel the more the thrill of the various tidings, few but indeed promising, that have been awaiting my return to the Holy Land. The work of the noble Edifice that the mighty hands of the All-Wise Master has reared in this world can suffer no delay, nor can its foundations be made to totter, whatever the apparent obstacles its enemies in their impotent wrath and despair may throw in its way. We need not wait too long, for already from various quarters there comes the news that the awful promises of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá regarding the Covenant-breakers have been strikingly fulfilled. </p>

<p> But it behooves us not to dwell for a moment on these doomed and darkened efforts for the shining light of the Master’s unfailing guidance is beckoning us to more constructive service, to nobler and worthier achievements. </p>

<p> We have, not a long time ago, with tearful eyes commemorated the world over the passing hour of our beloved Master. Would to God it has marked in our lives which we all have consecrated to his service a fresh, solemn and unswerving re solution of devotion and fidelity to his Cause. </p>

<p> May I assure you in this short message of mine of my sincere admiration for and firm attachment to those old and tried believers who have been engaged ever since the earliest days of the Cause in that land in the noble pursuit of spreading far and wide the Universal Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.

  Dear Friends! </p>

<p> I need not tell you how pleased I feel at this moment when I enter into correspondence with the loved ones of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in that city, who I am sure, fired with the spirit of service and teaching which His passing has kindled in every heart, are striving to proclaim His Word and promote His Teachings in that great country. </p>

<p> The services you have rendered and are still rendering in the Path of God, the accounts of which have been reaching the Holy Land, have served to renew my unshaken confidence in those faithful children of ‘Abdu’1-Bahá to whom He has shown abundant favors in the past and from whom He expects an undying devotion to the service of His Cause. </p>

<p> No need for me to remind you of the assurance He has so repeatedly given in His tablets to His friends in America as to the glorious triumphs that await every believer, who with determination, selflessness and ardor, arises for the diffusion of the Light of this Divine Revelation throughout the world. And we, who witness from every quarter the crying need of humanity, what nobler service can we render, than to raise the call of Yá Bahá’u’1-Abhá-a call which amid the rising tumult of so many conflicting sects and creeds can alone assure to distracted mankind the reign of true felicity and lasting peace. </p>

Are not these words wherein He assures us of the onward march of the Cause — a march which no one can resist and which is sure to lead humanity to its glorious destiny? </p>

<p class='noid'> To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful, throughout the City of New York, U. S. A. Care of the members of the Spiritual Assembly. </p>

<p class='noid'> Dear and faithful friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá </p>

<p> The welcome letter which the members of your Spiritual Assembly have sent me is indeed a fresh and remarkable testimony of your wise, patient and persistent efforts to promote the Cause of God and deepen its foundations in the heart of that great city. </p>

<p> All throughout the various vicissitudes which the Movement has encountered during this past year of bereavement and uncertainty, the faithful lovers of the Master in New York have, by their wisdom in teaching, the range and character of their activities, their perseverance in their labors and their unity in service, proved themselves worthy of the blessings which our beloved ‘Abdu’I-Bahá showered upon them during his repeated visits to their city. It is my earnest hope and prayer that now at this decisive hour of the Cause of God the friends may with clear vision and redoubled energy endeavor to deepen still further the essential truths of the Cause in their own lives, and then extend the sphere of their activity, endeavoring at all times to infuse the regenerating Spirit of Bahá’u’lláh into the divers communities, creeds and classes that arc represented in that most cosmopolitan city of the American continent. </p>

<p> From the leaflets, the circular letter and the pamphlet enclosed in the letter of your Spiritual Assembly, I can see clearly how well you have undertaken the task of acquainting the intellectual and religious circles of your city with the Divine Teachings, how admirably you have co-ordinated your efforts for service and how beautifully you have immortalized the memory of the Be· loved’s sojourn in your midst. </p>

<p> As I have already intimated in my first letter to the National Spiritual Assembly, I shall be most pleased to receive from every Bahá’í center throughout America regular and comprehensive reports on the position of the Cause and the activity of the friends. These I shall gladly transmit to the friends throughout the East, who in their present hour of restlessness and turmoil will, I am sure, be cheered to hear of the steady and peaceful growth of the Cause in your land. I have already shared the news you have conveyed to me with the resident friends in the Holy Land, and shall soon, by the aid of the Spiritual Assembly of Haifa, send them to the believers throughout the East. </p>

<p> Our departed Master, whose Call first awakened that city, who later visited it and with his own hands watered its soil, and who to last hour bestowed his tenderest care upon it, is now, as ever before, watching ‘from his Station on High the progress of the work which he entrusted to you, his beloved children, ready to bless, guide and strengthen you in your efforts to achieve success for his Cause. </p>

<p> Awaiting your joyful news, and wishing you from alt my heart the highest success in all your endeavors, </p>

<p class='signature noid verse'> I am your devoted brother,

<p> I have read with deep interest the recent numbers of the STAR OF THE WEST, and note with intense delight and gratitude the rapid advance it has made toward the fulfillment of that noble aim which the Master has clearly set before it. I have had its contents carefully translated and circulated among the resident friends in the Holy Land and the surrounding regions, and they, one and a1l, feel gratified and hopeful of the pre-eminent role it is destined to play in future. </p>

<p> I have requested every Spiritual Assembly throughout Persia, Turkestan. Caucasus, India, Egypt, ‘Iráq, Turkey, Syria and Palestine to contribute periodically carefully written articles to your Magazine, and submit regularly for publication a special report on their spiritual activities and the progress of the Cause in their own province. I trust that thereby you may be enabled to revive and enrich the Persian Section, and add considerably to the size and importance of the STAR as a whole. </p>

<p> True, the rays it now sheds are as yet faint and insignificant, yet our hopes and reliance are in the Master’s Words, that by your ceaseless efforts. reinforced in time by the assistance of friend s and Assemblies the world over, this STAR OF THE WEST shall grow to become so powerful a propounder of the Holy Writ of God and may so mirror forth the beauty of the Abhá Revelation as to become itself the Day — Star of the world. </p>

<p> Broad in its outlook, forceful in its appeal, universal and comprehensive in the range of its articles, wise and tactful in its selection of materials for publication, at once elevated and simple in its style, correct and reliable in the translations it publishes, the interpretations it makes, the information it gives — -in a word, illuminating and convincing in all its aspects-such is the standard of excellence which every reader of the STAR and every contributor to its columns wishes it to attain. </p>

<p> I have read your individual letters with the deepest interest and enclose for you all in this short answer of mine flowers planted in the close vicinity of the Holy Shrine and placed upon the Sacred Thresholds of the Báb and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

<p> I very strongly urge you to devote your time to a very serious and profound study of the history of the Cause and of the various Writings of Bahá’u’lIah and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

  c/o the Secretary, Mr. Horace Holley, New York City, U.S.A. </p>

<p class='noid'> My Friends and Fellow-Workers: — </p>

<p> The letters which our able and devoted friend, Mr. Horace Holley, has addressed in your behalf to the Greatest Holy Leaf and myself have all been received, and, together with their enclosures, read with the closest attention. It is indeed highly gratifying to observe that notwithstanding the strain and stress of the critical period through which our beloved Cause is passing, the elected representatives of the friends in America have, with unflinching faith, undaunted courage, and conspicuous ability, perse[r]vered in their task and fulfilled their arduous duties. </p>

<p> The splendid contribution you have made to the efforts of your fellow-workers in England in connection with the Conference on the Living Religions within the British Empire, we all heartily appreciate and regard as a fresh evidence of the growing power and solidarity of the Cause of God. Both in the admirable paper which you arranged to be drafted and prepared, and in the person of your devout, trusted and talented President, who performed his duty with absolute fidelity and high distinction, you have rendered the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh a fresh and distinguished service. May the results achieved lend a fresh impetus to the onward march of the Cause in the West. </p>

<p> The recent measures you have adopted in view of the necessity of promoting fuller confidence and a greater measure of understanding and cooperation between the body of the believers and the local and National Assemblies, will, I am confident, be of the greatest value, and indicate clearly that you are fully aware of the true position, the privileges and responsibilities of every Bahá’í Assembly. </p>

<p> We all long to hasten by wise and effective measures the completion of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, and we fervently supplicate the All-Bountiful to bless richly our Teaching work that our numbers may be reinforced in time by men who with sufficient means at their disposal may voluntarily and abundantly support this vast and noble endeavor. I trust that you will encounter no further obstacles in receiving the necessary support to meet the immediate needs of this Universal House of Worship as decided at your recent general gathering in Chicago. The Star of the West, the latest issues of which I have read with genuine satisfaction, has admittedly made a notable advance towards the ideal which the Master has set before it. Articles on broad humanitarian lines, well-conceived, adequately treated, and powerfully presented, should have their proper place in every issue together with such accounts of the History and the teachings of the Cause as will portray to the Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í alike the unique beauty as well as the compelling power of the Bahá’í spirit. Matters political and partisan in character should be carefully avoided as they would eventually lead to entanglements that would be not only futile but positively harmful. As regards the Persian Section: I feel that in view of the severe restrictions imposed on the friends in Persia its temporary suspension would be well-advised, particularly as it makes such a disproportionate demand on the meagre resources of the friends in America. </p>

<p> The increasing efforts displayed by my beloved brothers and sisters in America, both individually and collectively, and the action taken by you in constituting regional Teaching Committees are of vital importance to the spread of the Cause in the present stage of our work. I feel that we should all collaborate in widening its scope, intensifying its influence, assuring its continuity, and endeavoring to subordinate every other activity to this most urgent and vital task. It is our bounden duty to do all in our power to give the Cause from day to day a fuller publicity, to maintain and stimulate the interest aroused, and to concentrate at the same time our attention on a chosen few, endeavoring tactfully and persistently to make of them earnest and unreserved supporters of the Bahá’í Faith. </p>

<p> I am deeply conscious of the manifold and unavoidable difficulties that confront you in your labors for the administration of the affairs of the Cause. Vast distances; personal professional pre-occupations; insufficient number of capable and experienced teachers, unhampered by the necessity of earning their means of livelihood; the inadequacy of the means at your disposal, financial and otherwise; the prevailing tendencies in the general thought, sentiment, and manners of the people in whose midst you work — all these, though insuperable obstacles at present, will, if we stand steadfast and faithful, be one by one removed, and pave the way for the ultimate ascendency of the Cause and the fruition and triumph of our labors. </p>

<p> As to the projected prayer-book, I feel the need for a specially prepared compilation of the prayers of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá designed for the general public which would both prove of value for devotional purposes and act as a fresh incentive to eager and inquiring minds. I am enclosing copies of prayers which you may have not yet received and trust to send you more in future. I should be glad to receive any particulars you might wish me to consider in this connection. </p>

<p> Our untiring and devoted sister, Dr. Moody, (the handmaid of the Most High), has had to her profound regret to discontinue for a time the invaluable and unique services she has been rendering to the Cause in Persia. She is proceeding to America, and will familiarize you with the deplorable state of affairs in that unhappy country. You will get first-hand information from her regarding the present condition and activities of our long-suffering friends in Persia, and she will take counsel with you as to the best way to meet the needs and serve the Cause of Education in Ṭihrán. I hope and pray that as soon as circumstances permit, the friends in America may enable Dr. Moody to take back with her to Persia suitable, capable and ardent collaborators who will contribute their distinct share towards the uplift and the advancement of their brethren and sisters in that land. </p>

<p> Concerning the magazine “Reality,” I feel we must make it unmistakeably plain to those in charge of it that the Bahá’ís would gladly and gratefully respond to the invitation to cooperate with those that are responsible for it immediately they are fully satisfied that nothing is or will be published by them, whether in the magazine or elsewhere, that would, however indirectly, prejudice or reflect upon their conception of what the Bahá’í Movement is or stands for. Should this be refused, and unfriendly and harmful matters be published against them, the attitude of all of us should be a definite refusal to help and absolute non — interference, as well as the absence of any form of retaliation which will instead of achieving our end defeat our purpose. We should leave him in the hands of God. </p>

<p> As to the suggestion of the Annual Convention being held next summer at Green Acre, I believe it to be both wise and helpful, and trust that it will forge another link between the Bahá’ís as a body and its founders and trustees, and will serve to draw them closer and closer to the outward form as well as to the spirit of the activities of the friends in America. </p>

<p> The financial help extended recently by the friends in America to their fellow-workers of the Faith in Qadiyan, Punjab, has given us all intense satisfaction and made us deeply grateful. Their contribution has immediately been forwarded to them through the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma, and will, I am certain, enhance the prestige and the influence of the Cause. I feel that the conditions are now favorable for the circulation of the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá only in manuscript form and among recognized believers in America. Every such believer should be trusted with a single copy with the express understanding that no duplicate copies or extracts of it be made or published anywhere. </p>

<p> The suggestion made by my dear and able friend, Mr. Horace Holley, as to the compilation of an annual “Bahá’í Year Book” is extremely valuable and timely. I am much impressed by it, and feel that an immediate start should be made. I believe it can best be now undertaken under the direction and supervision of your Assembly until the time should come for the friends in the East and particularly Persia to participate effectually in its development. I trust you will send me a copy of the skeleton of the material you propose to include, and I shall here attempt to fill up any gap and render any assistance I can to make it as comprehensive, as attractive, and as authoritative as possible. </p>

<p> I am sending through my dear brother, Mr. M. Mills, various relics and Tablets of our beloved ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the only and priceless treasures of the devoted gardener of Bahá’u’lláh’s Shrine, Ustad Abú’l-Qásim <u>Kh</u>urasáni, who has offered them to be preserved on his behalf in the Archives of the friends in America. I am hoping to be able to send you in future precious additions to what the Archives Committee has already collected, and may I in this connection express to those who have conceived so admirable a plan my profound admiration and heartfelt gratitude. </p>

<p> I wish to assure you in conclusion of my readiness and genuine desire to help you and serve you to the utmost of my ability. I fully realize the enormous burden that weighs on your shoulders, and am constantly mindful of the distinct and eminent share you are contributing to the advancement of the Cause. I wish you from the depths of my heart entire satisfaction in your glorious work. Our beloved Master is surely watching from the Realm Beyond over His children whom He nurtured and loved so well, and will certainly guide you in every step you take, and crown your patient efforts with signal success. </p>

<p> Your brother and fellow-worker. </p>

<p> It gave our dear Shoghi Effendi much joy to read your interesting and encouraging letter and he is looking forward with great hopes to see the spread of the Cause in the Western States as never before. Indeed whenever we remember how much our dear Master spoke of that country and what a great deal He expected from every pioneer worker there, we feel assured that the glorious days He foretold are not far distant. Our Guardian wishes you all to realize what a stirring pleasure it is for him to cooperate with you in the promulgation of the Cause we all adore and it gives him great joy to help you and give you his advice in the task you have so gladly chosen. </p>

<p> In respect to the little library for the Juniors in memory of Mrs. Rasmussen’s dear son, Chester, he wishes me to write you of his deep pleasure in its establishment; and he feels that her son who now dwells in realms more holy, will have his name remembered forever by all the children who will use that little library. The fact that Mrs. Rasmussen has had to save that sum from her little earnings will certainly add a touch of true self-sacrifice to that library. </p>

<p> It might interest you to know that we already have a very large group of Western friends here in Haifa and how we would wish everybody could come over. </p>

<p class='noid verse'> Mrs. Grace B. Holley,
  Secy. Bahá’í Spiritual Assembly
  Visalia, California, U.S.A. </p>

<p class='noid'> Dear Bahá’í Sister, </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi was very pleased to receive your letter of 14th Jan. and has asked me to reply to it. We are glad to hear that some of the seed Mr. Hyde Dunn patiently sowed there years ago has now taken root. Shoghi Effendi has been greatly cheered by reports of the fine work Mr. and Mrs. Hyde Dunn have been doing in Australasia. By this time I think they will have established Spiritual Assemblies in all of the Capitals of Australia except Brisbane and also in Auckland, New Zealand. Within two years they hope to have a National Spiritual Assembly in Australia. Both Mr. and Mrs. Dunn appear to be very devoted souls and their work is being greatly blessed. </p>

<p> We hope that Mrs. Brittingham’s prophetic intuition will be fulfilled and that your assembly will “sound the trumpet which will arouse the great San Joaquin Valley.” Limited financial means and the care of children will not prove insuperable obstacles. Christ and his disciples had but little of this world’s goods, and Bahá’u’lláh and the Master were prisoners for many years and unable to travel, but that did not prevent them from raising the Call of the Kingdom very effectually. As for the children, they will, it is to be hoped, soon become Heralds of the Cause themselves, and carry the Glad Tidings wherever they go. The great thing is to “live the life” — to have our lives so saturated with the Divine teachings and the Bahá’í Spirit that people cannot fail to see a joy, a power, a love, a purity, a radiance, an efficiency in our character and work that will distinguish us from worldly-minded people and make people wonder what is the secret of this new life in us. We must become entirely selfless and devoted to God so that every day and every moment we seek to do only what God would have us do and in the way He would have us do it. If we do this sincerely then we shall have perfect unity and harmony with each other. Where there is want of harmony, there is lack of the true Bahá’í spirit. Unless we can show this transformation in our lives, this new power, this mutual love and harmony, then the Bahá’í teachings are but a name to us. </p>

<p> There is no need to fear opposition from without if the life within be sound and vigorous. Our Heavenly Father will always give us the strength to meet and overcome tests if we turn with all our hearts to Him, and difficulties if they are met in the right spirit only make us rely on God more firmly and completely. </p>

<p> We hope and pray that you will find many souls in your neighbourhood who are ready to receive the teachings and who will soon themselves become devoted Bahá’ís, heralds and teachers of our beloved Cause. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi, the members of the Holy Family and all the friends here join in sending most cordial Abhá greetings, and we pray that the confirmations of the Spirit may descend upon you in torrents. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> Published in The Bahá’í News Letter, March 1925 </p>

<p class='noid'> To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the West. </p>

<p class='noid'> My dear friends :— </p>

<p> From various reliable reports, recently received from Persia, it is becoming increasingly evident that this most unhappy country is passing through yet another crisis of extreme violence and far-reaching results. The growing instability of its affairs, the unceasing turmoil caused by conflicting personalities and factions, the economic stagnation of the country, are all signs that are highly disquieting to every well-wisher of Persia. These evidences of discontent may conceivably lead to an upheaval that might react most unfavorably on the fortunes of the Movement in Persia. </p>

<p> Already the exigencies of the present political life of the country have brought about a gradual recrudescence of religious fanaticism which, in its stubbornness and ferocity, can hardly find a parallel even in the semi-civilized countries of the world. I have just received a communication addressed by the secretary of the Qaghan Spiritual Assembly to the National Assembly of Persia, dated January 7th, and recording the following facts:— </p>

<p class='blockquote'> “In the village of Qamṣar, not very far from Ṭihrán, a Persian, Áqá Riḍá by name, embraces the Bahá’í faith. His friends and relatives are indignant and furious. They determine to persecute him. He is several times beaten severely and injured. They secure the sanction of the local Mullá to enable his wife, without obtaining a divorce, to marry another man. This unhappy person hastens desperately to Qashan and appealing to local authorities seeks and obtains temporary and partial relief. A few days ago, the son of a Mullá, Áqá Aḥmad by name, visited Qamṣar. Mischief-makers instantly incite him to humiliate, torment, and even murder the miserable convert. He immediately orders his arrest. His agents without notice and in a barbaric manner break into the house of a believer called Naṣru’lláh, accuse him of having sheltered his co-religionist, and command him to deliver the refugee immediately. Unsatisfied by his protestations and emphatic assurances, they start to search his house, violate the privacy of his home, enter the chamber of his wife, find her lying in bed having given birth to a child the night before, approach her, violently expose her, and shamelessly injure her to the point of almost ending her life. They then turn to her wretched husband and, with the aid of clubs, sticks, and chains, pitilessly mutilate his body. Fallen unconscious, they leave him, thinking him dead, and continue their search. Having fully investigated the matter they find that the husband was right after all and that Áqá Riḍá had fled to Mazkan. Reinforced by two Siyyids they immediately resolve to pursue him, and arriving in the village suddenly make their appearance at a meeting where the Bahá’ís were gathered and there instantly recognize their victim. They mercilessly drag him out, bind his hands behind his back, thrust him to the front, and with their whips, chains, and the butt end of their rifles drive him on to Qamṣar. The Bahá’í women in the vicinity, alarmed and grief-stricken, run after these heartless villains, and with loud lamentations vainly implore their mercy. Annoyed by their wailing they fire at them and disperse them. They drag him to Qamṣar till at last he is brought before the Mullá’s son who orders him to recant. But this ardent devotee, though young in faith, refuses to yield and with remarkable fortitude and sublime composure disdains the threats and insults of his enemies. The Mullá’s son, angry and exasperated, gives order first to throw him into the river, then to tie him to the trunk of a tree and inflict on him the most severe corporal punishment. The people, however, with unutterable cruelty drag him through the streets into the main throughfare and start to force handfuls of straw into his mouth and with blows and kicks strive to compell him to swallow. They then befoul his face with filth. Finally they so disgrace and dishonor him and resort to such vile methods that the pen would shrink from recording the further unspeakable indignities to which this unfortunate man was subjected...” </p>

<p> A previous communication addressed to me by the same National Spiritual Assembly and dated October 22nd, reveals a parallel incident:— </p>

<p class='blockquote'> “In Farahán, province of ‘Iráq-i-Ajám, an old believer, Riḍá-Qulí <u>Kh</u>án, who for years past had at the instigation of the fanatical clergy suffered humiliations and heavy losses at the hands of the mob, proceeded a few days ago to Sulṭán-Abád in order to renew his complaints to the provincial authorities. Profiting by his absence, a band of ruffians break into his house at night in order to carry away any valuable property. His wife, an expectant mother, is awakened and offers resistance. Armed with poignards they rush on her and inflict on her in a most brutal fashion several mortal wounds. They even proceed to murder her son and are only prevented from doing so by the cry of the neighbors who rush forth to intervene.” </p>

<p> In the province of Fárs, Yazd, and <u>Kh</u>urasán similar cases of atrocities and outrageous conduct have been witnessed. Houses have been sacked, property confiscated, homes destroyed. In addition to the murder of the American Consul in Ṭihrán, we know of three Bahá’ís who in the course of the past year have suffered martyrdom. A considerable number have deserted their homes and belongings, and, panic-stricken, have either migrated to another province or sought refuge in neighboring mountains. </p>

<p> To this sad tale of unbridled cruelty must be added the devastation caused by the recent floods which have destroyed nearly half of Nayríz including five hundred houses which belonged to the Bahá’ís of that town. </p>

<p> Mindful as we are of the repeated and emphatic injunctions of our beloved ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to scrupulously avoid meddling by word or deed with the political affairs of Persia, we cannot but feel gravely concerned at the plight and the perilous position of a vast number of our brothers and sisters in that beloved yet most backward of countries. Whilst we disassociate ourselves with the confused political aspirations of the contending factions in Persia, we should, if we be faithful to our trust, watch carefully every development in the situation, and by every lawful and legitimate means strive to alleviate the sufferings of our patient friends and ensure the protection of our Sacred Cause. </p>

<p> Free from every desire to be offensive or provocative, without seeking in the least to accuse or denounce any nation or individual, we should as much as it lies in our power broadcast the true facts of the situation. We should intelligently endeavor to enlighten the public opinion of the world on these ugly incidents and incredible happenings that will stain for ever the memory of this twentieth century civilization. </p>

<p> Conscious as all Bahá’ís are, of the absolute necessity and wisdom of non-resistance and abiding loyalty to the sovereign authority in the land they live in, we can have but one recourse and can appeal for redress only to the recognized authority in whose jurisdiction such glaring offences are being committed. You will gather from the above-mentioned reports how grievous and perplexing the situation is at present. You will realize with horror the shameless brutality of the ignorant masses as well as the insatiable hostility and unrestrained power of the clerical element. You will admire the tenacity of faith and the Spirit of magnificent heroism displayed with undiminished splendor by those who only recently have adhered to the Cause. </p>

<p> Should the friends on the spot fail to obtain redress and this calamitous condition continue unchecked, I will I then inform you by cable, and request your National Spiritual Assemblies to communicate both by cable and letter with the recognized authority in Persia. You will in the name of all the Bahá’ís in your respective countries demand that prompt and effective action be taken for the protection and well-being of your fellow-workers in Persia. Any grievance that is submitted should be supported.by evidence based on the actual facts of the situation. It should be expressed and presented in a sober yet firm language, should be conciliatory in tone, and moving in its appeal. We must make it abundantly clear that in giving publicity to these disgraceful and atrocious acts, the Bahá’ís the world over are in no wise animated by a hostile and revengeful spirit, that their purpose is not to retaliate nor to accuse or offend any soul, but only to ensure the safety and tranquility of law-abiding, devoted and patriotic citizens. </p>

<p> And having resorted to very practical and legitimate means for that end, and done our best, through prayer and supplication, to mitigate the endless sufferings of our dear ones in Persia, let us rest assured of the high destiny of their sorely-tried fatherland. Let us also remember that having done our duty towards them whatever else befalls Persia is truly ordained from on high and is but the means for the working out of His purpose for ‘that chosen country. Let us finally recall His promise that in the fullness of time the Government of Bahá’u’Hah’s native land will he universally recognized as the most honored of all earthly governments, that its sons will be so raised in the esteem of mankind as to become the envy and the admiration of all the world. </p>

<p> I feel confident that my dearly-beloved friends throughout the West, desirous to maintain the growing solidarity of the Cause, and fully alive to the critical conditions in Persia, will arise to do their utmost for the immediate relief as well as the ultimate deliverance of their long-suffering expectant fellow-workers in Persia, </p>

<p> May Bahá’u’lláh bless richly your efforts. </p>

  3rd May, 1925 </p>

<p class='noid verse'> To Miss Marion Carpenter
  1209 Stanford University
  California

  Alláh–u–Abhá! </p>

<p class='noid'> Dear Bahá’í Sister, </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi was greatly interested and pleased by your letter of March 31st — so much so that he had it translated into Persian and read at a meeting of the friends. We are delighted to hear that you have managed to establish a regular weekly Bahá’í meeting in the Club House in the campus and we pray that it may become permanent and grow in numbers and influence, and that soon you may have a Local Spiritual Assembly in the University. </p>

<p> I was greatly interested lately in reading a book called “The Life Changers”, by Harold Bigbie, describing a movement among University Students for a consecrated Christian life, initiated by a man called Frank Buckmann [Buchman], which has already become international and seems to have achieved really remarkable results in many cases. Mr. Buckmann [sic] and a party of his friends called on Shoghi Effendi a few months ago. I hope this start you have made at Leland Stanford University may be the beginning of a work among University undergraduates that will spread to other Universities and become something much bigger even than that of Mr. Buckmann [sic] and his group of “Life-changers.” If, as we believe, Bahá’u’lláh is the prophet of the new age in which we live, then in the light of His teachings and in the strength of the new spiritual outpouring through Him, we ought to achieve even greater things than are possible to those who walk in the light of the “old dispensation” and have not yet become fully aware of the value of the New Revelation. </p>

<p> We hope that soon you may find opportunities of carrying the message to the undergraduates of other universities, or of linking up with Bahá’í students at other Universities and encouraging them to start Bahá’í meetings also. Then inter-university meetings of Bahá’í groups could be arranged, exchange of speakers and so on, and from this germ you have started an organization might grow that would have very powerful and far-reaching effects. A “summer school” or Bahá’í Camp for undergraduates in Vacation time might prove very valuable. </p>

<p> We are very glad to hear that the lectures given by Mr. Remy [Remey], Mrs. Cooper, Jináb-i-Fádil and others were so successful and that your friend... has already become a devoted and active Bahá’í. </p>

<p> Entire and selfless devotion is what is most needful. The brighter our torch bums, the more light will it give and the more readily will it impart its blaze to others. It is fine too that you have the cooperation of your brother Howard, and of friends on the staff of the college paper. </p>

<p> The blessings of Bahá’u’lláh and the Beloved Master will assuredly be with you in this work and Shoghi Effendi and the friends here will offer heartfelt prayers that you may be richly confirmed in your service to the Kingdom. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi does not think it necessary for you to come to Haifa at present. His correspondence and other duties leave him very little time for translation work, and the Girls School on Mt. Carmel cannot be started until there is a good deal more money in hand for it. Conditions in Persia are at present too unsettled to make it advisable for you to go there. So it seems as if, for the near future, it would be better for you to work in America, where there is certainly ample opportunity. We pray that you will be clearly guided to whatever God would have you do, and we hope you will keep us informed of your activities, from time to time, so that we may keep in as close touch as possible with you and your group of coworkers.Shoghi Effendi was very pleased to see the articles by your brother, Barbara Probasco and yourself in the March Star and hopes that you will all three be enabled to do great service to the Cause both by tongue and pen. </p>

<p> With kindest regards and best wishes in which Shoghi Effendi and all the friends here join. </p>

<p class='noid'> My precious fellow-worker: </p>

<p> Your letter with its refreshing news rejoiced my heart. Surely the seeds which our Beloved has so abundantly sown in the fertile soil of that great University are germinating under your loving care and I trust great results will be speedily achieved. I would be delighted to learn of the formation of a regular, elected, Spiritual Assembly in the heart of that far-famed seat of learning and assure you of my keen desire to help it grow in power and influence in any way I can. As to your future career, I feel that for the present, until the conditions in Persia are stabilized you should concentrate your energies and efforts on publicity work, through the spoken as well as the written word. I will not fail to pray for you from the bottom of my heart and assure you of my deep appreciation of your much-valued efforts. </p>

<p> An Archives has also recently been established in the Holy Land, and whatever Sacred Writings and precious relics the individual believers and the Spiritual Assemblies donate voluntarily to this Archives — in particular those items that are more suitably and profitably collected together in one place, and whose dispersal would be a source of loss and detriment — will remain guarded and preserved in their name in a place set aside for the purpose.

<p> He approves fully the programme you set out in the leaflet and hopes that you will advance the cause of peace that way.

It is just as you say, there are some persons who are ready to accept social teachings and work for them if they do not bear a special religious stamp, nor have the taint of some creed. This movement of yours, therefore, serves the purpose admirably and can appeal to such tastes. </p>

<p> There was one point, however, which Shoghi Effendi particularly wanted Sitárih to bear in mind, </p>

<p> ... namely that all these are means followed in the pursuit of another still nobler aim, which is the progress of the Cause. Such movements help the cause of peace, but real peace cannot be established until and unless the whole Bahá’í programme is adopted.

<p class='ref noid'> The Priceless Pearl, Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, p98-9 </p>

<p> ... my unfortunate illness, amounting almost to a break-down, combined with the receipt of the most distressing news from Persia reporting the martyrdom of twelve of our friends in the town of Jahrum, south of <u>Sh</u>íráz. I have wired for full particulars and will communicate them to the various Bahá’í centres immediately I receive detailed information. Political considerations and personal rivalries appear to have played no small part...I have transmitted a message to the <u>Sh</u>áh through the Persian National Spiritual Assembly..I have also requested foreign Assemblies to give in an unoffensive language full publicity to these reports in their respective newspapers, but have thought it premature for them to get into direct relation with the <u>Sh</u>áh... It is sad and annoying to reflect that the Bahá’ís, pressed as they are by so many afflicting and humiliating circumstances, seem at the present time quite impotent and helpless in their efforts to secure the needed assistance from recognized authorities. There must surely be some wisdom underlying this apparent futility of their strenuous efforts. </p>

<p class='noid blockquote'> We are privileged to quote from a letter written by Shoghi Effendi in his own hand to Dr. John Herman Randall of the Community Church of New York, dated July 10th, 1926. </p>

<p> “I desire to take the present opportunity to assure you in person of my deep admiration for those unique gifts which have characterized your able presentation of the Bahá’í Principles as well as my unshaken confidence in the part you are destined to play for their universal recognition and triumph. Your clear vision, your high courage, your grasp of the needs of present-day society, your eminent position and penetrating eloquence qualify you in a remarkable manner to champion the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh and establish its truth in the West. “We are gradually and imperceptibly entering upon a new stage of our progressive life and the qualities which are needed to supplement the essential characteristics that are common to the followers of the Faith are just the ones you are in a position to contribute and increase. That is why every well-wisher of the Cause looks upon you as the chief instrument and factor that can provide and contribute those necessary elements which a gradually unfolding movement imperatively demands at present. I would therefore earnestly request you to pursue your labors, untrammeled and unhampered by the existing conditions, striving in your own admirable manner to add to the number of those capable, enlightened and devoted servants of the Cause, who will eventually by the force of their numbers and the brilliancy of their powers, revitalize the Cause, widen its scope, establish its Principles and vindicate its truth. </p>

<p> “It would undoubtedly grieve me to learn that any imperfections and failings on the part of the friends whether individually or collectively have tended to damp the zeal, or lessen the enthusiasm with which you are upholding and expounding the Bahá’í Principles, for I cherish the greatest hopes for your eventual triumph in such a glorious field of service.” </p>

<p class='noid'> Your gracious Majesty: </p>

<p> As one of the humble followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, upon whose youthful shoulders have fallen the responsibilities of His mighty Cause, may I venture to approach your Majesty and express in the name of the Bahá’ís of both the East and the West our feelings of joyous admiration and boundless gratitude for the queenly tribute which your Majesty has paid to the beauty and nobility of the Bahá’í teachings. </p>

<p> To my dear fellow-workers in Persia, particularly — the downtrodden victims of relentless religious fanaticism — your Majesty’s eloquent testimony to the potency of the message they bear has been of immense significance and will certainly prove a great relief. Broadcast at the very time when they were just emerging from one of those severe trials which periodically afflict them, your soul-stirring message has been to them a most welcome consolation as well as an abiding assurance of ultimate deliverance and victory. They rejoice to observe that the sufferings borne so long and so heroically by the Báb, by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and the unspeakable atrocities which unnumbered martyrs of the Faith have silently and patiently endured, are but beginning to yield their promised fruit. They cannot but wonder and feel truly grateful at the thought that the call to Universal Peace and Brotherhood so clearly voiced by Bahá’u’lláh, yet so cruelly ignored, nay stifled, for over eighty years by their own fellow-countrymen, has at last found in the heart of an honoured and beloved Queen a warm and ready response. </p>

<p> My dearly-beloved brethren of the East and the West, whose one object in life is to promote and in some measure to establish the sublime Principles proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh, are convinced that the moving appeal penned by your Majesty will prove of incalculable benefit to the Cause so dear to their hearts. They recall with profound emotion the explicit promise of Bahá’u’lláh to every Sovereign that rises to summon the multitude to the Message He has given to the world, and they feel confident that the unfailing grace of the Almighty will be abundantly showered upon the eminent advocate of so noble a Cause. </p>

<p> And in conclusion, may I convey to your Majesty on behalf of the family of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and myself the expression of our profound and heartfelt sympathy in the sorrows that have recently weighed so heavily upon you. Your beautiful and spontaneous appreciation of our beloved Cause, the memory of which we shall preserve and cherish, has forged a link of abiding affection and fellowship that will unite our hearts. We earnestly pray that this darkening cloud may soon pass away and yield to the sunshine of a joyous reunion. </p>

  My dear co-worker: </p>

<p> I am glad to hear from a recent letter of the increasing interest and support of the friends to the Plan. We must continually repeat, appeal and urge them to realize afresh the vital urgency of the task before them. I am herewith enclosing the sum of $95 as my October contribution towards the Plan for Unified Action. Please assure the friends of my continued prayers for the success of their persistent efforts and devoted labors for the spread of the Cause. </p>

  My dear co-worker: </p>

<p> I am anxious to learn of the response of the friends to the Plan for Unified Action since June 30th: I attach extreme importance to it and I wish you to concentrate your splendid efforts on this so as to insure its success. So much that is vital depends upon this Plan. We must at all costs make it a success, for its failure would be a reflection on the Cause and would delay indefinitely and lamentably the construction of the Temple. Exert every effort along this line and rest assured of my constant prayers for the success of your efforts. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> Lights of Fortitude, pp. 211-22, by Barron Harper </p>

<p> Your letter was received by the Guardian of the Cause of God... and brought much joy to his heart. He spoke of you and praised God that you... are assisted by divine confirmations in your education, that you intend to complete it and wish to diffuse the heavenly fragrances, to serve the Faith, and to teach the Cause of God. This intention attracts the confirmations of the One true God and the favours of the Kingdom of eternity. Therefore, he cherishes the hope that you will eventually attain the goal of your desire... </p>

<p> Teaching the Cause of God is possible under all circumstances, even through trade and commerce and through proper conduct, as it is said that goodly deeds and a praiseworthy character are in themselves the teachers of the Cause. Therefore, any individual, in whatever profession he may be engaged if he conduct himself in a praiseworthy manner and exemplify the human perfections, he will himself become the sign of the propagation of the Word of God and will hoist the banner of the glory of the Cause of God. </p>

<p> Concerning the determination of your duty the Guardian stated that you should in no way be disturbed and distressed. If in all circumstances you resort and cling to the cord of consultation you will be confirmed in all your efforts. In all cases, you should refer to the Spiritual Assembly and act according to the wishes and approval of its respected and elected members. </p>

<p> Whatever the result of the consultation of the Spiritual Assembly may be, that is the correct course of action and will meet with the good pleasure of the Lord... </p>

<p> The beloved Guardian also remembered your parents and prayed for them. </p>

<p class='noid'> Shoghi Effendi wrote in his own hand in the margin of this letter: </p>

<p class='noid'> O spiritual Friend: </p>

<p> This servant in this illumined spot prays at the Sacred Threshold from the depths of his heart for your peace of mind, prosperity and success, so that you may excel in divine knowledge and material learning.. </p>

Shoghi Effendi’s hope is that they will, the three of them, become able and devoted speakers on the Cause and subjects akin to it. To do this properly they will need a firm foundation of scientific and literary training which fortunately they are obtaining. It is just as important for the Bahá’í young boys and girls to become properly educated in colleges of high standing as it is to be spiritually developed. The mental as well as the spiritual side of the youth has to be developed before he can serve the Cause efficiently. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi is very glad to see that some of the friends are appreciating the difficult and depressing circumstances Mr. and Mrs. Randall are living through, and sympathizing with them, are arising to give them that Bahá’í love and affection which should characterize our relations. In many instances we cannot extend to a friend any material help which would relieve him of the very cause of worry.

It is a great relief for a suffering person to see around him some loving friends who, though unable to extend an appreciable amount of help, share in his sorrows.

<p class='ref noid'> 1926?-XX-XX Correspondence w/ the Guardian </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #15, p1, Jan 1927 </p>

<p> “Shoghi Effendi wishes me to inform the beloved friends that if, at any time, any of the friends feels that it is necessary, in the interest of the Cause, to correspond with him about any matter, he should do so without the slightest hesitation, and his letters will be gladly and promptly considered.” </p>

<p class='noid'> ========= </p>

<p class='noid ed'> The following commentary was attached to the above — - — - </p>

<p> A circular letter issued bv the Spiritual Assemblv of Haifa, through Badi‘ Bushrui. secretary. contains the following reference to the subject of correspondence with Shogbi Effendi. </p>

<p> “The Cause is fast advancing, new centers are being established. introduction of more system and organization is indispensable, events of great consequence transpire, all calling for the concentrated attention of the beloved Guardian. Under such circumstances it is eyident that we should strain every nerve to lighten the burden of correspondence which is increasingly pouring in from different parts of the world. The idea seems, however, to be taking root with some of the friends that individual correspondence with Shoghi Effendi should be discontinued under all circumstances; which is quite a wrong interpretation of the case.” </p>

<p> This announcement was undoubtedly the result of the resolution passed by the last National Convention of the Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada, which however did not express the delegates as desiring to advise individuals not to write the Guardian, but rather aimed to bring home to all American believers the thought that we should refrain from giving utterance to personal complains which ought to be removed through local or national consuItation. </p>

<p class='noid'> My dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p> I am enclosing my April contribution to the National Fund. It is a matter of deep concern to me that the response of the believers to the call embodied in the Plan of Unified Action has been so feeble and uncertain. The National Assembly, while not justified to oppose specific contributions for newly originated activities, should by every means in its power impress upon the friends the paramount necessity of unlabelled contributions to the National Fund. The Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár undoubtedly undoubtedly constitutes the most important item in the activities provided by the Plan, but these must not be unduly restricted or neglected in order to further the interests of the Temple. I would be grieved to learn that any believer would ever attempt to support an activity that lies outside the province of the Plan and would neglect thereby his sacred obligation towards the Budget. May the believers, one and all, arise to support the Plan as they have never done before and with all the resources at their disposal secure its triumph. </p>

<p> I trust you will do all you can to stimulate the ardour and faith of the Queen and infuse in her a desire to lend a helping hand to the sufferers in Persia. Only last week a fresh case of persecution in the town of Kirmán has been reported to me, and the same indifference, neglect has been shown by the authorities. The hope of our downtrodden brethren in Persia lies in the action that the free and devoted servants of the Cause in the West can take on their behalf and I pray that you will continue in your unique mission of drawing the attention of those who are in authority to the incredible atrocities so frequently perpetrated in Persia. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> Extracts from Shoghi Effendi’s Letters to Ruth and Robert Moffett </p>

<p class='signature noid'> October 28, 1927, Haifa. </p>

<p> “...He was much interested in your ideas over the solution of the economic problem in the West. A question that must have meant a good deal of thought among enlightened people, and he is delighted to see in your thoughts, much that runs along the same general lines as in principles laid out by the Movement. </p>

<p> Of course, conditions in the East differ where the countries are rarely industrial and mostly agricultural. We should have to apply different laws from the West, and that is why the principles of the Movement strike at the root, which is common to them both. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has developed in various of His talks, which you will find in different compilations, the principles upon which the Bahá’í economic system would be based. A system that prevents, among others, the gradual control of wealth in the hands of a few and the resulting state of both extremes, wealth and poverty. </p>

<p> I strongly advise you to make a thorough research and study of the economic teachings of the Cause, as you seem to have the necessary background for a complete understanding of their significance and value. I will pray that you may diffuse by your words and deeds the spirit that animates the Faith and thus render distinguished and memorable service to our Beloved Cause.” </p>

The Bureau has been functioning for a period of three months. during which time they have received clippings of their publicity to the extent of about thirty-three newspaper columns. The subjects presented so far have been the Year Book. the World Unity Conferences and the Green Acre Institute of World Unity, in addition to which special articles have been prepared and issued by the Bureau.

<p> The following letter received recently by Mr. Scheffler, Treasurer of the National Assembly, contains a message for us all. “My dear Bahá’í brother: — I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to thank you for your welcome letter of December 18th with enclosures, all of which he was very glad to receive. </p>

<p> He has always thought it a great pity and one that should certainly be remedied, that the friends should cease or refuse to support the Plan of Unified Action on such ill-founded and illegitimate excuse as the extravagance of the members, especially when they have all the figures they want given them. He does hope that it really is not an indirect expression of their lack of confidence in their duly elected National Assembly or their unwillingness to cooperate. At any rate, one thing should be made clear, that when it has the full and wholehearted support of our Guardian, it simply means that they must contribute to it if they really have the interest of the Cause at heart. It is to be lamented if the best interests of the Cause are made to suffer only due to lack of cooperation and perhaps personal sentiment. </p>

<p> However, our Guardian thinks that it is very urgent and necessary that the National Assembly make a special effort to explain and remove all difficulties and encourage all the various Assemblies to save the Plan even at the eleventh hour, especially as our Guardian has such high hopes in that. </p>

I have talked the matter over with Mr. Schopflocher and urged him to transmit my earnest plea to all the believers to make a supreme and self — sacrificing effort to raise the necessary sum before the end of this year, as otherwise the prestige of the Cause will be gravely affected. Not only those who have ample means at their disposal should display a greater effort, but those who are of humbler position must also make a self-sacrificing effort, that the Temple may become the embodiment of the self-sacrifice of all the believers. </p>

The news, however, which has been widely circulated, has created a deep impression in all circles, and has greatly stimulated interest and inquiry among all classes both far and near. I wonder whether they had in mind such a visit and whether these premature disclosures deterred them from accomplishing their intended pilgrimage. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> Compiled by the Research Dept at the direction of the House of Justice, 1 Nov 79(?) </p>

<p> What Bahá’u’lláh says is that the Supreme House of Justice will appoint a committee that will study the whole matter and then either choose one of the existing languages or create a new one, to function as an international language. The Master never went beyond that, i.e. He never tried to solve the problem Himself and choose that language. He still leaves it to the Supreme House of Justice. But He says that Esperanto will spread and even went so far as to encourage all the friends who possibly can to study it. In fact the knowledge of Esperanto has proven very useful for one who tries to teach in different countries of the world. But whether Esperanto will become the international language which is to be a part of our religious and social duties to study, no one knows, and we have no evidence that the Master made any definite statement along that line. The Master has scarcely ever assumed the solution of a problem that Bahá’u’lláh has referred to the Supreme House of Justice. Esperanto may become an international language, but it depends upon the House of Justice to choose it as the international language. And no one is in a position to foretell. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi will also remember you in his prayers &amp; ask for you divine blessings, so that you may succeed to render inestimable services to our beloved Cause. </p>

<p class='noid verse'> Haifa, Palestine
  Dec. 21, 1928 </p>

<p class='noid'> My dear Laura <u>Kh</u>ánum: </p>

<p> We were all profoundly moved when we received the news of the passing of our dear Hippolyte, and I assure you that since the ascension of our Beloved, the family, and myself included, never felt the sense of loss &amp; the pain of overwhelming sorrow as acutely as we did the night we received your wire, announcing the passing of one who was close &amp; dear to us all. </p>

<p> Needless to say how overpowering is the sense of his loss to me, in particular, who received from him such comfort and support in perhaps the darkest days of my life, &amp; cherished the fondest hopes for his future contribution to the advancement of the international work of the Cause. </p>

<p> None, I can confidently assert, among the Bahá’ís of the East &amp; the West, combined to the extent that he did the qualities of genial &amp; enlivening fellowship, of intimate acquaintance with the manifold aspects of the Cause, of sound judgement &amp; distinctive ability, of close familiarity with the problems &amp; condition of the world — all of which made him such a lovable, esteemed &amp; useful collaborator &amp; friend. </p>

<p> I have, impelled by my love &amp; admiration for him, addressed the enclosed message to my co-workers throughout the West, that those who knew him not may recognise his standing &amp; appreciate his achievements. I am certain that the National Spiritual Assemblies of America &amp; Persia, responding to my cabled request, will take the necessary measures for the holding of memorial gatherings as a tribute to one who advanced so effectively the international interest of the Cause. </p>

<p> I will for ever regret that, not realizing the gravity &amp; the hopelessness of the illness which afflicted him, I failed to demonstrate in a fuller manner, the sentiments of profound &amp; abiding affection that I have always cherished for him in my heart. </p>

<p> My mother wishes me to express to you her deep sense of affectionate sympathy in the loss of one who proved such a sustaining &amp; sympathetic friend in her gloomiest hours of anxiety &amp; sorrow. </p>

<p> Rest assured, dear Laura <u>Kh</u>ánum, that in my hours of prayer &amp; meditation at the holy Shrines, I will frequently &amp; tenderly remember my dearly-beloved friend &amp; fellow-worker who has served so well our beloved Cause &amp; is now receiving from the hands of our Master the reward of his notable achievements. </p>

<p class='ed noid'> Certain sincere believers, for the sake of what they have felt to be a distinctive and ‘fundamental principle: of the Cause, have consistently held the opinion that living and traveling expenses of Bahá’í teachers should not be defrayed from the Bahá’í Fund, The well known passage in the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá granting permission to individuals to make it possible for others to serve as teachers does not, it was felt, apply to Local or National Spiritual Assemblies administering a Bahá’í Fund. The National Assembly recently referred to the Guardian the question whether, in one particular instance brought to its attention for consultation, the donations made by a believer should be transmitted through the National Fund or to the teacher direct. The following reply, which we understand represents the Guardian’s views, was received through his secretary “He would personally much prefer, if any of the friends think of helping ... to do so not personally but through either the local or National Assembly.” This statement makes it dear that a Spiritual Assembly is perfectly justified in voting an appropriation of this character during the present transitional era of the Cause. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> February 13, 1929, Haifa </p>

<p> “...We all know that the recognition of the Manifestation is itself the source of all inspiration. Without that the world cannot be carried.a step further. Many beautiful philosophies have been voiced in the past, but it is only the simple teachings of Christ, of Muḥammad, etc., that have shaped the conduct of the masses. Likewise, it is only through Bahá’u’lláh that the Golden Era will be ushered in. Meantime, all these different movements that are humanitarian in their aspect, do their share in getting the world ready for hearing these Teachings by which Bahá’u’lláh will heal the ills that have befallen humanity.” </p>

I find it difficult to make the appointment in person, as I find no one here in Haifa or the adjoining countries that could really use to the best advantage the opportunities presented by such a university. Furthermore, a direct connexion with the recognized national representatives of the Bahá’ís of Persia, would I feel, be more appropriate &amp; closer to the wish of Hippolyte himself. </p>

<p class='ed noid'> The National Assembly urgently requests those believers who possess original Tablets from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to cooperate in the special effort now being made by Mrs. Corinne True, acting under appointment by the Assembly, to catalog all available Tablets with a view to the publication of a Volume Four of Tablets from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>

<p class='ed noid'> The three volumes edited with such loving care and distinction by Mr. Albert Windust contain only Tablets received before 1914.

<p> “My dear and valued co-worker: I wish to add a few words in person regarding the commemoration of my birthday anniversary. I would earnestly request all believers and Assemblies not to observe, under any circumstances, whether officially or privately, my birthday anniversary. I strongly feel that only anniversaries in connection with the life of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá should be celebrated by the believers. It will, I am sure, prove conducive to my own spiritual growth and happiness, and would be in the best interests of our beloved Faith. I trust that you will acquaint all the believers with this insistent request of mine and I feel sure that they will all joyfully respond. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> Against Incredible Odds, pp65-6 </p>

<p> That spiritual friends letter has attained the glance of His Highness, the Guardian of the Faith, may my spirit be sacrificed for his friends. The account of the recent tragic events in Nayríz and the description of the calamities sustained by the loving friends there have become known in his presence and caused him sadness. He said: ‘This Servant will, with tongue and heart, offer thanks at the Court of the Munificent Lord for having enabled His tested servants and trusted friends to appear, in the face of a deluge of trials and an onslaught of adversities and afflictions, with such firmness, steadfastness and integrity as to cause the Concourse on High to utter their praise and the dwellers of the Abhá Paradise to glorify them. Neither had the blade and shaft of the ungodly any effect on their glorious spirits, nor has the fatal poison and torture affected their illumined and attracted inner selves. Undoubtedly those sincere, detached and steadfast believers have, with their acceptance of various persecutions, caused the Blessed Tree to grow further throughout the world, have added to the splendours of the light of the brilliant truth of BahauTláhs Cause and the manifestation of the power and might of the Word of God.’ </p>

<p class='noid'> He then said: </p>

<p> This Servant, with a heart throbbing with love and a soul overflowing with affection for those gems of firmness and steadfastness, praises and extols the spirit of fidelity and sacrifice evinced by those chosen by the Almighty in the path of that Luminous Moon, and will continually pray in the Holy Shrine, beseeching God to protect and preserve those servants of His Sacred Threshold from the cruelty of tyrants and the oppression of the ungodly, and to cut off the hands of the transgressors. Assure all the persecuted and dear admirable friends of Nayríz of this Servants loving-kindness. Impart to their hearts the hope that, God willing, soon will the ancient glory reveal the beauty of its countenance and the sun of aspiration of the people of Bahá will shine on the highest peak. Patience and composure are essential, calmness and tranquillity needed. The evildoers will definitely pay for their evil deeds and will serve as a lesson to others. </p>

<p> The praise in his holy presence of the extraordinary steadfastness shown by Jináb-i Ḥájí Mírzá Aḥmad, the merchant, upon him be the glory of God, caused his bounteous favours to flow. </p>

<p> Convey loving-kindness and favours on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to your esteemed wife, Amatu’lláh Túbá <u>Kh</u>ánum, your mother, Amatu’lláh Núríyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, and your children, Áqá Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Ḥusayn, Áqá Mírzá Masíh and Shamsu’d-Duhá. </p>

  Your Majesty: </p>

<p> I have received, through the intermediary of my dear Bahá’í sister, Miss Martha Root, the autographed portrait of your Majesty, bearing in simple and moving terms the message which your Majesty has graciously been pleased to write in person. I shall treasure this most excellent portrait, and I assure you that the Greatest Holy Leaf and the Family of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá share to the full my feelings of lively satisfaction at receiving so strikingly beautiful a photograph of a Queen whom we have learned to love and admire. </p>

<p> I have followed during the past few years with profound sympathy the disturbed course of various happenings in your beloved country, which I feel must have caused you much pain and concern. But whatever the vicissitudes and perplexities which beset your Majesty’s earthly path, I am certain that even in your saddest hours you have derived abundant sustenance and joy from the thought of having, through your glowing and historic utterances on the Bahá’í Faith as well as by your subsequent evidences of gracious solicitude for its welfare, brought abiding solace and strength to the multitude of its faithful and long-suffering adherents throughout the East. Yours, surely, dearly-beloved Queen, is the station, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh in the realms beyond, to which the strivings of no earthly power can ever hope to attain. </p>

<p> I have, immediately upon the publication of the second volume of ‘The Bahá’í World’ by the American Bahá’í Publishing Committee, forwarded directly to Bucharest, to the address of your Majesty and that of H.R.H. Princess Ileana, copies of this most recent and comprehensive of Bahá’í publications. I will take the liberty of presenting in the course of the coming year the third volume of this same publication, which I trust will prove of interest to your Majesty. </p>

<p> May I, in closing, reiterate the expression of profound appreciation and joy which the Family of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Bahá’ís in every land universally feel for the powerful impetus which your Majesty’s outspoken and noble words have lent to the onward march of their beloved Faith. </p>

<p> The Family also join me in extending to your Majesty, as well as to H.R.H. Princess Ileana, a most cordial welcome, should your Majesty ever purpose to visit the Holy Land, to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s home in Haifa, as well as to those scenes rendered so hallowed and memorable by the heroic lives and deeds of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>

To correspond in person with some and not write to others, I am sure you realize will lead gradually to friction, discouragement and even animosity, as you know fully well the considerable number of friends who expect much and do little. To do away utterly with individual correspondence, and rely on indirect written messages, penned by my helpers and associates, whilst I would devote my time to direct correspondence with the Assemblies throughout the world, is also a difficult problem. I would indeed value your views on this thorny problem. The latter course has the obvious objection of severing all personal relationships with the individual friends. </p>

<p class='noid'> Dear Dr. Locke: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi has been lately spending his leisure hours translating the Book of Íqán for he considers it to be the key to a true understanding of the Holy Scriptures, &amp; [sic] can easily rank as one of the most, if not the most, important thing that Bahá’u’lláh revealed explaining the basic beliefs of the Cause. He who fully grasps the purport of that Book can claim to have understood the Cause. </p>

<p> Yet, Shoghi Effendi believes that mere translation into English phrases is not sufficient. It is essential to make the idioms &amp; expressions lively English, a thing which he alone cannot possibly achieve. Thinking, therefore, that you will be the best fitted to render him an assistance along that line, he is sending you the part that he has already completed. He would be most appreciative if you go over it carefully, studying every sentence— its structure as well as choice of words — &amp; giving him your criticism as well as constructive suggestions that would make it more lucid, English [sic] &amp; forceful. As it is a Holy Scripture, Shoghi Effendi has tried to put it in the English of the Bible, preferring its ways of expression better than any other. What he sends you now is half of the book, the rest he will mail as it is translated. </p>

<p> The form that it is in at present is far from being the last one. Yet he wishes to have all the possible suggestions before he puts it in its final form. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi is fully aware of the many duties you have &amp; how pressing your time is, &amp; had he known of an equally fitting person he would surely have saved you the trouble. Yet he finds himself to be compelled. He hopes, therefore, that you will give this work your close attention. </p>

<p> If the book is completed &amp; rendered into a lucid &amp; forceful language, the service it will render to the Cause will surely repay all your endeavours. In many places you will see the same idea expressed in other words &amp; inserted in paranthesis [sic]. You can chose [sic] any of the two. In case you have any suggestions just mention in what page &amp; line it is. You need not send him back the copy after going over it, for he may desire to refer to them later. He has enough copies here. Though he wishes you to give it all your attention he will be much obliged if you take it up immediately. </p>

 Yours ever sincerely

<p> I am now writing to you quite confidentially regarding the projected visit of the Queen to Haifa. Unfortunately it did not materialize. The reason, I absolutely ignore. Although I sent her two wires, renewing my invitation to her already expressed in the letter I wrote her when you were here, and deploring the unauthorized publicity given by the Press in Palestine, England and America, I have had no reply from her whatever. All I received was a wire from Cairo on March 28 from the Romanian Minister, Lahovary, who wired as follows: ‘Her Majesty regrets that, not passing through Palestine, she will not be able to visit you’. I do not know whether my letter of December last, which I showed you, and in which I acknowledged receipt of her photograph, as well as my two wires to her after her arrival in Egypt, have been intercepted or miscarried. The two wires I sent her were as follows ...’Deeply regret unauthorized publicity given by the Press.’ I should not be surprised if these communications as well as your letters and the rosaries have not reached her at all. I so much wish to know the real situation, whether any malicious propaganda has not damped her enthusiasm, or whether she is unable to communicate with us. Reporters who called on me, representing the United Press of America, telegraphed to their newspapers just the opposite I told them. They perverted the truth. I wish we could make sure that she would at least know the real situation! But how can we ensure that our letters to her Majesty will henceforth reach her. I feel that you should write to her, explain the whole situation, assure her of my great disappointment. I hope your letter will reach her ... I cherish the hope that these unfortunate developments will serve only to intensify the faith and love of the Queen, and will reinforce her determination to arise and spread the Cause. Please, let me know of any news you receive. I thirst for news and find all ways to her barred and blocked. </p>

<p> Be not sad or distressed, dearest Martha. The seeds you have so lovingly, so devotedly and so assiduously sown will surely germinate. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is guiding you and will bless your heroic efforts. Persevere, and never lose heart. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> The Maxwells of Montreal Vol II, Violette Nakhjavani, p122-3 </p>

<p> Every one who has studied the Cause deeply cannot but be certain that Bahá’u’lláh’s purpose in His Mission was not merely to expound certain principles &amp; renew the spirit that the previous prophets brought to the world, but also to establish a definite social fabric that would make those principles of practical value. In a word what Bahá’u’lláh has come to this world for is a World State — the Kingdom of God — the greatest institution that the world has yet seen. </p>

<p> The administrative side of the Cause which is the embryonic stage of that world order, is therefore just as much an intrinsic &amp; indispensable part of the teachings, as the principle of unity of mankind etc. To consider a person a Bahá’í, who does not believe in the administration, is just as if we were to consider him as such when he takes exception to those basic principles ... </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi does not have anything to say against Mrs. Chanler for she is making all that sacrifice for a certain noble ideal of service. He only pities her to be so duped by Aḥmad. All of Shoghi Effendis grudge is against Aḥmad who, appearing in the garb of a servant, is doing nothing more than to injure the Cause by sowing the seeds of dissension among the friends, &amp; of securing his own means of livelihood ... </p>

<p> Regarding Aḥmad, I feel that if the friends individually &amp; collectively are not watchful, a gradual departure from the spirit &amp; form of the Faith on his part, aided by the resources placed at his disposal by Mrs. Chanler, may soon bring about a state of grave confusion among the believers, &amp; create a split in their ranks. We should be both firm and conciliatory. I look to you as a powerful instrument for the preservation of the unity &amp; of the integrity of our beloved Faith, &amp; will continue to pray for your high endeavour from the depths of my heart. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #48 — February 1931 — page 9-10 </p>

<p class='noid'> to the BW Editorial Secretary </p>

<p class='noid'> Dear Mr. Windust: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi desires me to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of April 6th and March 23rd. The packages of photographs that you sent for “The “Bahá’í World have all reached him. He has selected the most appropriate and has returned the rest to your address in a number of packages. He is deeply grateful to you for the painstaking efforts and the thoroughness and the devotion with which you have collected the material for the forthcoming issue. The entire manuscript has reached him safely. He went over it most carefully, rearranged the whole material, added a few articles, prepared a table of contents which he inserted in the manuscript, arranged the photographs and the captions for each, divided the material into Four Parts and sent them under three separate covers a few days ago to your address. </p>

<p> He is delighted with the illuminated manuscript insert which he has chosen as a frontispiece of the book, and has placed it in its proper place in Part One. We need not insert the translation of the text of the manuscript. He prefers the non-varnished copy. If you think, however, that moisture will affect it, he has no objection to your inserting instead the varnished copy. The photographs for “The Bahá’í World, he has inserted them all in the manuscript. He would advise the Committee neither to add to, nor to discard, any of the photographs already inserted. He has divided each of the Four Parts into Sections. He has grouped the photographs of each Section and added them to their respective Sections. As to the exact locality of each photograph in these Sections, he has left it to the discretion of the Committee. He would not advise to displace these photographs from one part to another. He would ask you to kindly return to him all the photographs that are within the manuscript after the printing of the book. Among these photographs are two collective ones. On each page of these two collective photographs are nineteen reproductions of outstanding Bahá’ís in the East and in the West. The one is entitled, “Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh”; the other, “Disciples of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.” He has joined to each a list of the name and title of these Bahá’ís. He would request the Committee to arrange the two collective photographs in a manner that they would face each other in the book. In the back of each he feels the list of their respective names should be inserted. Shoghi Effendi has not yet received Horace’s article on “Survey of Current Bahá’í Activities in the East and West.” He would advise you to insert it immediately if it is finished without awaiting a further word from Shoghi Effendi. He feels that the sooner the book is printed the better. He would advise the utmost care both on the part of the proof reader and the printer. Particularly regarding the transliteration of Oriental terms, he would urge you to exercise the minutest care. He has carefully revised both the list and the articles in this connection. The book should present a distinctive scholarly character and should be free from all manner of type error. The appreciative replies he has received from eminent men to whom he has sent “The Bahá’í World and to whom he hopes to send Volume III, makes it absolutely imperative to maintain, nay even to improve if possible, the standard already attained. He would particularly request you to insert in the beginning of the book, on a separate page, a statement saying that all the photographs in Volume III are strictly copyrighted and should not, without specific authorization, be reproduced. As to the color of the book, Shoghi Effendi feels that as Volume I has a green cover and Volume II a blue one, that Volume III should be red. He is sending you enclosed the particular shade of red which he feels it advisable to adopt. He would request you to ensure that the cloth cover of Volume III should be exactly in this shade. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi is sending enclosed a check for twenty pounds as his promised contribution towards the expense involved in the preparation of the illuminated manuscript. He has already informed the friends in the East and particularly Persia to take the necessary measures for a prompt and substantial order immediately the book is published. The sacred photographs, most of which have never been published before, are of such a nature as to excite the interest of both the Bahá’ís of the East and the West. The graphic and detailed description of the declaration of the Báb in <u>Sh</u>íráz, which Shoghi Effendi has included in Part One is bound to arouse much interest, as the details of that historic meeting are unknown to even the old believers in Persia. That is why he feels that the greatest care should be exercised in the printing of the book. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi would wish to have mailed to his name, immediately the book is published, which he hopes will be by the middle of the summer, one hundred (100) copies. He hopes that the friends in every part of the world will cooperate in making the issue of this book a successful financial undertaking. He wishes in conclusion to express his deepest appreciation of your continued and devoted endeavors and wishes me to assure you of his prayers for your success in your many services to the Cause. This letter should not be published in “The Bahá’í World. It is only for the information of “The “Bahá’í World Committee. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Yours Sincerely, </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Rúḥí Afnán. </p>

<p> P.S. — Shoghi Effendi will be pleased to send the price of the hundred copies he has ordered immediately he receives them. R.A. </p>

<p class='noid'> My Dear and precious co-worker: </p>

<p> I cannot refrain from adding a few words to this already detailed letter, the expression of may deepest admiration for your unsparing efforts in the service of our beloved Faith. Your whole-hearted devotion, conscientious labors, and thoroughness of service are greatly valued and prized by me, and I trust that in the days to come your scope of service may increasingly widen and bear the richest fruit. I have asked Rúḥí to convey my messages and suggestions in my behalf in this letter regarding “The Bahá’í World, and I am sure that they will be duly considered, as I have great hopes in this publication. I am sending you under separate cover a photo of the London friends which I would suggest to be inserted before or after George Townshend’s “Reflection” on the Hidden Words in Part IV. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Bahá’í Studies Bulletin Vol 2 #1 June 1983 pp73-4 </p>

<p class='noid'> Persian Colony </p>

<p class='noid'> Haifa, Palestine </p>

<p class='noid'> 30-5-30 </p>

<p class='noid'> Dear Mr. Lunt: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated May 12th 1930 as well as the enclosed minutes of the N.S.A. He hopes that the changes made in the secretarial work will be for the good, for generally dividing the work between heads brings confusion. After a few years of labour the secretarial work became systematic, and organized. Shoghi Effendi hopes that the present form it has taken will be a step forward. Anyhow you have his earnest prayers and best-wishes. </p>

<p> Concerning the New History Society which seems to have aroused great admiration among some — &amp; great indignation among others, it has really become a problem very difficult to solve. Even though both the Assembly and individuals have written to Shoghi Effendi &amp; asked his opinion none seems daring enough to take a stand. As long as Aḥmad does not want to accept the administration, Shoghi Effendi cannot conscientiously trust him. To accept the Cause without the administration is like to accept the teachings without acknowledging the divine station of Bahá’u’lláh. To be a Bahá’í is to accept the Cause in its entirety.To take exception to one basic principle is to deny the authority &amp; sovereignty of Bahá’u’lláh, &amp; therefore is to deny the Cause. The administration is the social order of Bahá’u’lláh. Without it all the principles of the Cause will remain abortive. To take exception to this, therefore, is to take exception to the fabric that Bahá’u’lláh has prescribed, it is to disobey His law. </p>

<p> In his letters to the Assembly as well as to the individual friends, Shoghi Effendi has made it clear that the friends should in no way associate themselves with the New History Society if these fail to obey the Assemblies. What the friends have been doing is to win over the Assemblies to the New history Society rather than by showing a firm stand make the History Society come to the Assemblies. And this has greatly displeased Shoghi Effendi. </p>

<p> In the May Number of the ‘Psychology’ a copy of which the History Society sent one there is an article on the Bahá’í movement. It definitely states that there are “two sister organizations; one meetting at 110 West 57th Street; the other the New History Society.” It is strange that old and experienced Bahá’ís should acquiesce with such articles that strike at the unity of the Cause, that the Master tried to secure. </p>

<p> It may be that the New History Society has succeeded to attract many souls into the Cause. No one denies that. But there is no reason why such work should not be achieved by the Bahá’ís. The teachings are Bahá’í teachings only polluted. The only thing they have is that they possess on their staff a person who refuces to accept the social order of Bahá’u’lláh &amp; whose main object is personal ascendancy. That they succeed only shows that the Bahá’ís are failing to do their duty and nothing more. </p>

<p> Excuse me for writing so strongly but it is a candid expression of Shoghi Effendi’s attitude. Notwithstanding this, however, it all rests with the National Assembly to see what is advisable. It is a local problem that they have to solve. Shoghi Effendi only hopes that the members of that spiritual body will be guided in their work and will follow what is to the best interest of the Cause. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi hopes that this newly elected assembly will succeed to accomplish a great deal in the field of teaching. We have to add to our numbers &amp; get in new blood if we desire to live and inaugurate the social status that Bahá’u’lláh has brought to the world. With best wishes and loving greetings, </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Yours ever sincerely, </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Rúḥí Afnán </p>

<p class='noid'> My dear co-workers </p>

<p> The newly established Secretariat as well as the character of the proceedings of this year’s memorable convention have filled my heart with joy and hopefulness. I strongly feel that the teaching work should be regarded henceforth as the paramount issue facing the American believers. Aḥmad Sohrab’s activities should be watched carefully, lest a weak handling of this extremely delicate situation may confuse the minds of the friends &amp; cause a split in the Cause. The Cause has already triumphed over such cases which flare up for a tine &amp; then recede into the shadows of oblivion &amp; are thought of no more. The case of <u>Kh</u>ayru’lláh, Fareed, Dyar, Mrs. Whyte and others testify to this truth. May the Beloved guide your steps, inspire your hearts &amp; bless your efforts. </p>

<p> “As the ‘Íqán is the most important book wherein Bahá’u’lláh explains the basic beliefs of the faith, he thought a proper rendering of it would infinitely enhance the teaching work in the West. He hopes that this new rendering will be an improvement on the previous one, but he fully admits that it is far from perfect, far from the original itself. Shoghi Effendi has given the proper transliteration of the Eastern terms and wants you to abide by them, keeping every dash, point, accent or inverted comma. To help you in this, he has also on a separate sheet written these in their proper form. He wishes you further not to include the introduction that exists in the last edition, for he does not think it worthwhile and enlightening. Drop also the glossary that exists at the end of the last edition and form a glossary using the definitions that he has sent to be put in the forthcoming Bahá’í World. As Shoghi Effendi has been emphasizing the need of submitting all publications to the Reviewing Committee, he wants to be the first to abide by that rule, though he hopes that they will not make unnecessary delay. In Germany they have translated the Íqán from the last translation and they are waiting for Shoghi Effendi’s rendering to make the necessary alterations and publish their own. The proceeds of the sale of the book Shoghi Effendi wishes to go to the American National Assembly in an unlabelled form. This is a gift of his own personal labors that he wishes to present that body and he wishes it to be considered as a token of appreciation for the help they have rendered him in carrying on his arduous task.” </p>

<p> “Unable to find a good typist, I have had to do the work myself, and I trust that the proofreaders will find it easy to go over and will not mind the type errors which I have tried to correct. I would especially urge you to adhere to the transliteration which I have adopted. The correct title is, I feel, ‘The Kitáb-i-Íqán,’ the sub-title ‘The Book of Certitude.’ May it help the friends to approach a step further, and obtain a clearer idea of the fundamental teachings set forth by Bahá’u’lláh.” </p>

<p class='noid'> Dear Prof. Locke: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter as well as the mss. of the Íqán which you had so kindly gone over. Though they were not so many, he found the suggestions you gave most helpful. In translation work the greatest difficulty is to give the thought a lively English expression. This is most difficult for the person who gets absorbed into the original form &amp; is charmed with its beauty. Shoghi Effendi has already incorporated your suggestions &amp; sent his manuscript to the National Assembly for publication. It naturally depends upon that body &amp; the reviewing &amp; publishing committees to decide whether it should come out immediately or not. </p>

<p> The most important service that can now be rendered to the Cause is to put the writings of Bahá’u’lláh in a form that would be presentable to the intellectual minds of the west. Shoghi Effendi’s hope in this work has been to encourage others along this line. </p>

<p> In closing may I express Shoghi Effendi’s best wishes for your health as well as for the services you are rendering to the Cause. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Yours ever sincerely </p>

<p> I wish to add a few words expressing my deep appreciation of your valued suggestions in connexion with the translation of the Íqán. I wish also to express the hope that you may be able to lend increasing assistance to the work of the Cause, as I have always greatly admired your exceptional abilities &amp; capacity to render distinguished services to the Faith. I grieve to hear of the weakness of your heart which I trust may through treatment be completely restored. I often remember you in my prayers and ever cherish the hope of welcoming you again in the Master’s home. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #46 — November 1930 — page 9 </p>

<p class='ref noid'> Letter from the Guardian, Through His Secretary, to a Believer of Yonkers, N.Y. </p>

<p> “A year ago, Mrs. Chanler wrote Shoghi Effendi of her plan to work independently of the Assembly. In answer he expressed his disapproval in a most unquestionable term. In the letters and cables that Mrs. Chanler wrote subsequent to that, Shoghi Effendi expressed the same view again. He knew that for a body to defy the Assembly is contrary to the best interests of the Cause; that not only will conflict arise but it will react unfavorably in other parts of the world. </p>

<p> “Some persons in the (United) States feel that the History Society was badly represented to Shoghi Effendi. The source of all our information is the writings of Aḥmad, and the publications of that group. In all his circular letters he harped on the note of freedom, and denounced the red tape that characterizes organizations. Freedom, which Aḥmad reiterates... is not a bad thing if considered in view of the interpretation that Bahá’u’lláh gives in the Aqdas. (See quotation No. 1, above — Editor). The freedom that He commends is a freedom which is a fruit and result of law and proper administration. The other kind of freedom which is in defiance of law He considers to be animal, and far from being of any good to man. He says, ‘True freedom is in obedience to My law.’ </p>

<p> “No one wrote to Shoghi Effendi against the History Society; it is Aḥmad’s reports that caused Shoghi Effendi’s mistrust. This literature has not had this effect only on Shoghi Effendi but also on the friends of Australia and New Zealand. In the last two weeks we have had two letters from prominent and firm Bahá’ís of New Zealand and Australia who referred to the History Society and its literature with greatest disapprobation, and with great astonishment that nothing is being done. </p>

<p> “The Cause is an international institution. Every act done in one Center will have some reaction in some other locality. What if the spirit that Aḥmad preaches should be practised in its full? The whole Cause will as a result be destroyed.” </p>

<p class='ref noid'> Bahá’í Studies Bulletin Vol 2 #1 June 1983 pp74-5 </p>

<p class='noid'> 30-8.30 </p>

<p class='noid'> Dear Kr. Lunt: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated June 20th, July 14th, 17th &amp; 18th, copies of the Bahá’í directory &amp; the minutes of the National Assembly of June 17th to 29th 1930. </p>

<p> Concerning Aḥmad’s attitude towards the Assembly &amp; the decision you have taken, Shoghi Effendi has already sent you a cable heartily approving the language as well as the purport of the decision. Since then we have received letters from different parts of the world such as Australia &amp; New Zealand informing us that Aḥmad has been sending them his literature &amp; keeping them informed of his activities. They all expressed indignation at his attitude &amp; were astonished that nothing had been done. Anyhow, Shoghi Effendi is glad that the decision was taken for it would have had a very bad offset upon those countries where the friends are still unexperienced &amp; where the Assemblies cannot stand the flouting of some individuals. </p>

<p> I Personally believe that the reason why the New History Society succeeded in attracting new individuals was because that were so many devoted Bahá’ís found there a field for teaching &amp; lend the society their whole-hearted assistance. I think if the Assembly provides a similar field for service &amp; gives them a chance for work such greater work would be achieved.The work of the Assembly should be to capitalize the energy &amp; devotion that exists among the friends and guide them along proper channels, whereby good work would be accomplished &amp; no harm be done to the Cause. The first quality for leadership, both among individuals and Assemblies, is the capacity to use the energy &amp; competence that exists in the rank and file of its followers, otherwise the more competent members of the group will go at a tangent &amp; and try to find elsewhere a field of work &amp; where they could use their energy. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi hopes that the Assemblies will do their utmost in planning such teaching activities that every single soul will be kept busy. </p>

<p> In a cable that he sent about ten days ago Shoghi Effendi left left the question of the publication of the Íqán in the hands of the Assembly. The help he could render was in translation work, the financial side has to be considered by the Assembly itself. Only a few days after sending the first part he mailed the second. I hope you have received that also. </p>

<p> Please convey to all the friends Shoghi Effendi’s loving greetings, especially to the members of the National Assembly &amp; the blessed angels working at the Evergreen Cabin. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Yours ever sincerely, </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Rúḥí Afnán </p>

<p> PS. Concerning the cornerstone of the Temple which was laid by the Master, Shoghi Effendi says that it has no other special significance than a great honour conferred by the Master upon that building &amp; it should be treated as a cornerstone &amp; nothing more. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> Looking back in Wonder, Philip Hainsworth, p101-2 </p>

<p class='noid'> Dear Bahá’í Brother; </p>

<p> Your two letters, one undated, and one dated April 19, have been received by our beloved Guardian, as well as the pamphlet — which he was delighted to see. </p>

<p> He would be delighted to see you go as a pioneer to Africa and to later have your mother join you. She seems the true heroic pattern! He feels that in as far as possible the African pioneers should seek to get a job which will take them to one of the countries chosen and ensure employment for them there. It does not seem wise or necessary for a Bahá’í to stress the fact he or she is going there to teach. A people’s religion is their own business, and they can talk about it privately as much as they like without neglecting their employer’s work. </p>

<p> Also, he feels no rules can be laid down about how to teach. Usually one teaches those receptive souls one finds. The same should apply to the beginning of the work in Africa. Any direct teaching work with the more primitive tribes would have to be done after finding out the best and most tactful way of doing it. The first step is to get to Africa, and, in view of the cost involved, and the state of the Fund, the pioneers should make every effort to get sent out there or at least get employment after arriving, thus relieving the Bahá’í Fund as much as possible. If this fails, then of course all the expense will have to be paid by the Fund. </p>

<p> The Guardian is very pleased over the publications in African languages, and greatly appreciates what you have accomplished in this field, as well as your many other services. </p>

<p> He will certainly pray you may settle your affairs satisfactorily at home, and then find a way to go to Africa. </p>

<p> At present no pilgrims are permitted, as you know, but he feels sure some day you will again be a welcome guest in Haifa. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> With Bahá’í love, R. Rabbání. ‘ </p>

<p> May the Almighty bless your strenuous’, constant and high endeavours, and enable you to enrich continually the splendid record of your valuable services to His Faith and its nascent institutions. </p>

<p class='noid'> Dear Mr. Lunt: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge in his behalf the letters that you have written him on behalf of the National Spiritual Assembly dated September 27th, December 10th, February 18th, January 20th and March 3rd. all of which he read with the deepest interest, but was unable to answer in view of the pressure of work due to his translation of Nabíl’s history. </p>

<p> Concerning individual teaching, Shoghi Effendi would urge every Bahá’í who feels the urge to exercise his right of teaching unofficially the Cause, to keep in close touch with the Local Spiritual Assembly of the locality in which he is working. The Local Spiritual Assembly while reserving for itself the right to control such activities on the part of individual Bahá’ís, should do its utmost to encourage such teachers and to put at their disposal whatever facilities they would need in such circumstances. Should any differences arise, the National Spiritual Assembly would naturally have to intervene and adjust matters. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi feels that in any locality where the number of adult believers reaches nine, A Local Assembly should be established. He fed* this to be an obligation rather than a purely voluntary act. Only in exceptional cases has the National Spiritual Assembly the right to postpone the formation of an Assembly if it feels that the situation does not warrant such a formation. This right, however, should be exercised if the situation absolutely demands it. As to the principle according to which the area of the jurisdiction of a Local Assembly is to be determined, he feels this to be the function of the National Spiritual Assembly; whatever principle they uphold should be fairly applied to all localities without any distinction whatever. </p>

<p> As to the character of the meetings in the Auditorium of the Temple, he feels that they should be purely devotional in character, Bahá’í addresses and lectures should be strictly excluded. For the present, he feels that there would be no objection to having Bahá’í meetings including addresses and the business sessions of the Convention held in the Foundation Hall. Shoghi Effendi would urge that choir singing by men, women and children be encouraged in the Auditorium and that rigidity in the Bahá’í service be scrupulously avoided. The more universal and informal the character of Bahá’í worship in the Temple the better. Images and pictures, with the exception of the Greatest Name, should be strictly excluded. Prayers revealed by Bahá’u’lláh and the Master as well as the sacred writings of the Prophets should be read or chanted as well as hymns based upon Bahá’í or non-Bahá’í sacred writings. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi would wish you to get in touch with the Egyptian authorities and press for Bahá’í recognition in that land. The petition that you have prepared should be forwarded and the National Spiritual Assembly in Egypt should be pressed to take whatever measure is necessary to insure its success. </p>

<p> The letter you have received from Constantinople is by no means representative of the actual conditions there, and Shoghi Effendi is urging the friends in that city to re-establish their Assembly and resume their relationships with the Bahá’í world. </p>

<p> Concerning the qualifications required for voting, Shoghi Effendi has laid down the essential conditions already in his letters, no further restrictions should be added to them. It is for the Local Assembly to decide in this matter. They should exercise this right with extreme tact and caution and avoid rigidity and formalism. There is no distinction in this respect between new and old believers, nor should contributions to the national or local funds be made a condition for voting. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi feels deeply the delicacy and complexity of these problems with which you are constantly being faced, and he will pray for you all that you may be guided in your efforts to extend the scope and consolidate the foundations of God’s Holy Faith. </p>

<p> “Shoghi Effendi believes that the Temple and teaching work should be continued to be regarded as the twin outstanding activities of the Believers in America. Everything else should be subordinated to this urgent need. The work of applying the exterior ornamentation to the completed structure should proceed steadily and as speedily as possible. Shoghi Effendi feels that the full effect and influence of the Temple can be revealed only when the work in its entirety is accomplished. All the beauty and glory of the Temple depends upon the exterior garment of stone with which it is to be adorned, while the consummation of the task will in itself act as a magnet that will draw the promised blessings of the Master. Nothing short of continued self-sacrifice can achieve this end. In fact, the greater the obstacles in our way, the greater will be the reward we are destined to reap. The present financial depression should be regarded both as a challenge and an opportunity to prove the reality and potency of our faith. Shoghi Effendi will continue to pray for the American Believers who are destined to render still more glorious services to the Cause in the future.” </p>

<p> The Artist’s Daughter, Nancy Douglas Bowditch, p254-5 </p>

<p> Dear Mrs. Bowditch: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter written from Dublin. He was pleased to know of the work you and Mrs. Parsons succeeded to do this last summer, and hopes that it is the beginning of a greater work in the future. He trusts that every one of those who were interested will keep on studying the literature until they become well grounded in the tenets of the Faith. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi saw your article published in the Star and was so pleased with it that he hopes to include it in the Bahá’í World. Shoghi Effendi does not know of any special Tablet of the Master concerning Dublin. He would however like to see Mrs. Parsons stress the dynamic influence the Master’s personality had upon those who entered His presence, and also state some incidents to confirm that fact. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi was very glad to hear that you are busy working on a portrait of Dr. Esslemont. When completed, he would like to see it hung in the Mansion of Bahá’u’lláh in Bahjí, adjoining to His room. </p>

<p> Please extend Shoghi Effendi’s greetings to Mr. Frank Chant; he hopes that you will keep in touch with him, for without a personal touch such persons may gradually be lost to the Cause. Though the seed planted in their heart will never die out completely, yet they will fail to bear fruit and render some service to the Faith. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi was also glad to hear that Polly is keeping up her interest and conscientiously studying the literature. Please remember him to her. </p>

<p> In closing may I assure you of Shoghi Effendi’s prayers and of his appreciation for the services you are rendering to the Cause. </p>

<p> Yours ever sincerely, </p>

<p> Rúḥí Afnán. </p>

<p> “It would interest you to know that the American National Spiritual Assembly, Palestine Branch, has been incorporated according to the law in Palestine, not as a foreign corporation or a charitable trust, but as a “religious society” enjoying all the privileges attaching to recognized religious institutions in the Holy Land. Shoghi Effendi hopes to transfer to the name of your Assembly additional plots of land in the vicinity of the shrine of Bahá’u’lláh in ‘Akká and of the Báb at Mount Carmel as soon as he obtains the necessary authorization from the authorities, inasmuch as the right of holding real estate by religious institutions is strictly limited according to Palestinian law. This step which he has taken, which has necessitated many months of careful and delicate negotiations with both the local and central authorities, our Guardian feels will constitute the prelude to the eventual formation and recognition, by the Palestine Government, of a properly constituted International Bahá’í Assembly, functioning as an independent religious body in the Holy Land.” </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister: </p>

<p> your kind letter of July 30th, 1931, and to extend to you his loving appreciation </p>

<p> Regarding the statements which you had made in your recent talk to the </p>

<p> American believers to abide by them. He wishes you, therefore, to write again and </p>

<p> recommend Dr. Morris, whose last letter addressed to you he read with careful </p>

<p> attention, to not let himself become involved in the policies of the different new </p>

<p> movements that are springing up in the States, and to concentrate all his efforts </p>

<p> on activities which are purely Bahá’í in character. </p>

<p> This should not mean that the ideal which these societies are promoting are </p>

<p> contrary to those proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh. Most of them present great </p>

<p> similarities to the Bahá’í teachings. But the chief difference is that the Bahá’í </p>

<p> principles and the Bahá’í institutions are divine in their origin and their </p>

<p> character and that they are under the divine protection of Bahá’u’lláh. It is in </p>

<p> His Name therefore, that the Bahá’ís should strive. It is to Him that they should </p>

<p> look for help, and it is in His Bounty that they should have an unswerving faith. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #56 — October-November 1931 — page 3 </p>

<p> To the National Spiritual Assembly </p>

<p> Mr. Alfred Lunt, Secretary. </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother: </p>

<p> I am directed by Shoghi Effendi to acknowledge on his behalf the receipt of </p>

<p> your three letters dated July 6th, June 4th and July 9th, together with their </p>

<p> enclosures, all of which he has read with careful attention and deep interest. </p>

<p> Our Guardian wishes me to express his lively satisfaction at the efficiency </p>

<p> and promptness with which the National Spiritual Assembly have undertaken the </p>

<p> publication of “Nabíl’s Narrative. The plan you have conceived to further the </p>

<p> means for its production has met with his unqualified approval, and he hopes that </p>

<p> the response of the believers, not only among the English speaking Bahá’ís, but </p>

<p> the friends throughout the world, will be such as to repay fully the painstaking </p>

<p> efforts which you have exerted to insure its success. </p>

<p> He has already cabled you expressing his desire to associate himself with </p>

<p> the effort that you have made, and he will be glad to forward in the month of </p>

<p class='signature noid'> October a check for the hundred copies of the standard edition which he has </p>

<p> requested you to send him. In addition he will mail a sum of three-hundred dollars </p>

<p> for nine copies of the special edition which he hopes to send to a few well-known </p>

<p> friends of the Cause. Shoghi Effendi would be pleased to hear of the response of </p>

<p> the believers to the call for both editions and would be glad to help in any way </p>

<p> he possibly can for a wide and prompt distribution of the volume published by your </p>

<p> committee... . </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi was rather affected to learn of the meagre response of the </p>

<p> believers to the call urging them to maintain the standard of their self — </p>

<p> sacrificing endeavors in connection with the Temple. He is fully alive to the </p>

<p> critical character of the financial situation throughout the world and is well </p>

<p> aware of the extent of sacrifice that the completion of the structure has already </p>

<p> entailed. The publication of the “New Plan of Unified Action,” he fervently hopes </p>

<p> and prays, will prove the signal for a fresh outburst of self-sacrificing zeal </p>

<p> which can alone carry this sacred enterprise to a successful conclusion. </p>

<p> Regarding the report of the Committee on Persian travel, Shoghi Effendi </p>

<p> feels that the paramount needs of the Temple should be given first consideration </p>

<p> by the believers. Not until the work of the exterior ornamentation on the first </p>

<p> unit (superstructure) of the Temple has sufficiently advanced would he advise the </p>

<p> American believers to embark on a fresh financial enterprise, however valuable and </p>

<p> significant it might be. </p>

<p> Our Guardian trusts that a careful reading of Nabíl’s Narrative will not </p>

<p> only serve to familiarize the American believers with the character of the </p>

<p> stirring events that have marked the birth of the Cause in that land, but will </p>

<p> serve to deepen their realization of the spirit that animated those who have </p>

<p> achieved such immortal renown on its soil. </p>

<p> With Shoghi Effendi’s renewed assurance of unqualified admiration for the </p>

<p> manner in which you have arisen, in collaboration with the other members of the </p>

<p> National Spiritual Assembly, to discharge your sacred and arduous duties. </p>

<p> Yours sincerely, </p>

<p class='signature noid'> (Signed) H. Rabbání. </p>

<p> My dear and esteemed co-worker: </p>

<p> The “New Plan of Unified Action: conceived, adopted and published by your </p>

<p> Assembly is an admirable one. It is at once concise, appealing in tone, dignified </p>

<p> in presentation and practical in its conception. It fully and truly deserves the </p>

<p> unreserved support of every American believer. I shall be glad to associate myself </p>

<p> with this further collective and heroic effort exerted by the friends by </p>

<p> contributing to your National Fund every month for a period of three years, the </p>

<p> sum of ninety-five dollars. Your Assembly, faithful to its trust and conscious of </p>

<p> its high calling, has sounded the call for a further and final effort on the part </p>

<p> of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in that land. It is for them, now if ever, to </p>

<p> arise for the speedy consummation of a divinely appointed task. </p>

<p> In his moments of prayer Shoghi Effendi will think of you and the other new believers of Bulgaria. He sincerely hopes that each of you will become a flaming light and become a centre of radiation throughout that region. The Balkans have for over a century been a hot-bed of political conflicts and war; may they through your spirit and the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh become the fountain-head of peace and goodwill for all that continent.

<p> Compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice </p>

<p> Shortly after His departure from Adrianople where He was exiled for five years, Bahá’u’lláh wrote a Tablet in which He states that under every stone He has laid a seed which will soon germinate.1 This promise refers to the regions around Adrianople which naturally include Bulgaria. His actual words are very promising and who knows but now is the beginning of the day when those promises are to be fulfilled. </p>

<p> The Balkan people have for long been suffering from war and social and political strife. It is high time that peace may reign, that differences may be set aside, that strife may cease... </p>

Those countries are in great need of the Divine Message because they have been divided into warring factions that have endangered the life of Europe. Through constant war those countries have come to the verge of ruin. They need the Message of Bahá’u’lláh to bring peace and change the prevailing hatred between the factions into a mutual understanding based upon the love of God and human brotherhood. </p>

<p> Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union A Compilation From the Bahá’í Writings, #22 </p>

<p> Compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice </p>

<p> The Balkans, Shoghi Effendi believes, are a very fertile field, their people very ready. They have so long and severely suffered from wars, and their aftermath, that they undoubtedly long to enjoy a reign of permanent peace. But the work is nevertheless not so very easy, and not free from its own stumbling blocks. There is undoubtedly much prejudice to overcome, and much religious antagonism to be faced. But these are the thorns that any new field will have. We should not mind them. We should concentrate upon the promise given by Bahá’u’lláh that the hosts of the Kingdom are ever ready to pour down and assist anyone who would rise with a determined mind and a free heart. </p>

<p> It is needless to say how deeply he was interested in the news you had to give him, especially in the names of those who have accepted the message and those who show enough interest to study it. He sincerely hopes that you will pursue your work and establish a regular Assembly. </p>

<p> If you already have five believers it is easy to find the rest. </p>

<p> Let every person teach one other soul and immediately you will have the necessary number completed ... </p>

<p> The Balkan states are in an awful condition. It has been for the last century a centre of constant strife and hatred, and wars that have sprung up there have invariably brought misery to others also. It is therefore very essential that the message of peace be brought to these lands, that swords may be changed into ploughshares and the love of God be inculcated in the heart of the people. Among them are undoubtedly some ready and receptive souls who are fit to act as a leaven of goodness to those regions. Try to win them over and enlist them in the army of God. </p>

<p> In his moments of prayer and meditation Shoghi Effendi will surely remember you and ask for you divine guidance and help. Look not to your own ability to present the message; look to the promise of Bahá’u’lláh that He would help every soul who would rise to His service. </p>

<p> [In Guardian’s handwriting] </p>

<p> ... Your splendid services, rendered with such faith, such humility, such perseverance and devotion, have at last been crowned with success. You have achieved a task that will ever live in, nay adorn and enrich, the annals of Goďs immortal Faith. What is now necessary is to consolidate the work already achieved. I have already cabled you urging a prolongation of your stay which I consider as vital and essential. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #58 — January 1932 — page 1 </p>

<p> Letter from Shoghi Effendi — To a Believer </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated </p>

<p class='signature noid'> October 14, 1931. You seem to complain about the calamities, that have befallen </p>

<p> humanity. In the spiritual development of man a stage of purgation is </p>

<p> indispensable, for it is while passing through it that the over-rated material </p>

<p> needs are made to appear in their proper light. Unless society learns to attribute </p>

<p> more importance to spiritual matters, it would never be fit to enter the golden </p>

<p> era foretold by Bahá’u’lláh. The present calamities are parts of this process of </p>

<p> purgation, through them alone will man learn his lesson. They are to teach the </p>

<p> nations, that they have to view things internationally, they are to make the </p>

<p> individual attribute more importance to his moral, than his material welfare. </p>

<p> In such a process of purgation, when all humanity is in the throes of dire </p>

<p> suffering, the Bahá’í should not hope to remain unaffected. Should we consider the </p>

<p> beam that is in our own eye, we would immediately find that these sufferings are </p>

<p> also meant for ourselves, who claimed to have attained. Such world crisis is </p>

<p> necessary to awaken us to the importance of our duty and the carrying on of our </p>

<p> task. Suffering will increase our energy in setting before humanity the road to </p>

<p> salvation, it will move us from our repose for we are far from doing our best in </p>

<p> teaching the Cause and conveying the Message with which we have been entrusted. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi, will pray for you as well as the other friends, so that you may </p>

<p> “It is surely very important to give to the Local Spiritual Assemblies some </p>

<p> schools that would provide the children the intellectual and spiritual education </p>

<p> as prescribed in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and the Master. </p>

<p> “For such duties that will naturally devolve upon the Local Spiritual </p>

<p> revealed in the form of Tablets have a binding power over the friends. Hearsays </p>

<p> may be matters of interest but can in no way claim authority. This basic teaching </p>

<p> of Bahá’u’lláh was to preserve the Faith from being corrupted like Islám which </p>

<p> attributes binding authority to all the reported sayings of Muḥammad. </p>

<p> This being a basic principle of the Faith we should not confuse Tablets that </p>

<p> were actually revealed and mere talks attributed to the founders of the Cause. The </p>

<p> first have absolute binding authority while the latter can in no way claim our </p>

<p> obedience. The highest thing this can achieve is to influence the activities of </p>

<p> the one who has heard the saying in person. </p>

<p> Those talks of the Master that were later reviewed by Him and corrected or </p>

<p> in some other form considered authentic by Himself, such as the “Some Answered </p>

<p> “Questions, these could be considered as Tablets and therefore be given the </p>

<p> necessary binding power. All the other talks such as are included in Aḥmad’s diary </p>

<p> or the other diaries of pilgrims, do not fall under this category and could be </p>

<p> considered only as interesting material to be taken for what they are worth. </p>

<p> For this reason Shoghi Effendi has not been encouraging the publication of </p>

<p> reported sayings that were not authenticated by the Master Himself. Shoghi Effendi </p>

<p> is trying to prevent the friends from considering as actual words of the Master </p>

<p> things that were not authenticated by Him. </p>

<p> Now in so far as the “Divine Art of Living is concerned, some of the friends </p>

<p> wrote Shoghi Effendi and stated that the book is very much liked, so he did permit </p>

<p> its publication in its old form. The question, however, totally changes when the </p>

<p> plates no more exist. He would surely not advise you to undertake that expense at </p>

<p> this time and bring out a book where authentic and non-authentic material is </p>

<p> hopelessly confused. It greatly detracts from the worth of a book to have in it </p>

<p> quotations from Tablets which are absolutely binding and reported sayings that </p>

<p> have no authority. </p>

<p> In closing may I assure you of Shoghi Effendi’s prayers and best wishes and </p>

<p> assure you of his loving greetings. </p>

<p> Yours ever sincerely </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1931-xx-xx Introduction To Nabíl’s Narrative </p>

<p> Introduction To Nabíl’s Narrative </p>

<p> The Bahá’í Movement is now well known throughout the world, and the time has come when Nabíl’s unique narrative of its beginnings in darkest Persia will interest many readers. The record which he sets down with such devoted care is in many respects extraordinary. It has its thrilling passages, and the splendour of the central theme gives to the chronicle not only great historical value but high moral power. Its lights are strong; and this effect is more intense because they seem like a sunburst at midnight. The tale is one of struggle and martyrdom; its poignant scenes, its tragic incidents are many. Corruption, fanaticisms and cruelty gather against the cause of reformation to destroy it, and the present volume closes at the point where a riot of hate seems to have accomplished its purpose and to have driven into exile or put to death every man, woman, and child in Persia who dared to profess a leaning towards the teaching of the Báb. </p>

<p> Nabíl, himself a participant in some of the scenes which he recites, took up his lonely pen to recite the truth about men and women so mercilessly persecuted and a movement so grievously traduced. </p>

<p> He writes with ease, and when his emotions are strongly stirred his style becomes vigorous and trenchant. He does not present with any system the claims and teaching of Bahá’u’lláh and His Forerunner. His purpose is the simple one of rehearsing the beginnings of the Bahá’í Revelation and of preserving the remembrance of the deeds of its early champions. He relates a series of incidents, punctiliously quoting his authority for almost every item of information. His work in consequence, if less artistic and philosophic, gains in value as a literal account of what he knew or could from credible witnesses discover about the early history of the Cause. </p>

<p> The main features of the narrative-the saintly heroic figure of the Báb, a leader so mild and so serene, yet eager, resolute, and dominant; the devotion of his followers facing oppression with unbroken courage and often with ecstasy; the rage of a jealous priesthood inflaming for its own purpose the passions of a bloodthirsty populace-these speak a language which all may understand. But it is not easy to follow the narrative in its details, or to appreciate how stupendous was the task undertaken by Bahá’u’lláh and His Forerunner, without some knowledge of the condition of church and state in Persia and of the customs and mental outlook of the people and their masters Nabíl took this knowledge for granted. He had himself travelled little if at all beyond the boundary of the empires of the <u>Sh</u>áh and the Sulṭán, and it did not occur to him to institute comparisons between his own and foreign civilisations. He was not addressing the Western reader. Though he was conscious that the material he had collected was of more than national or Islámic importance and that it would before long spread both eastward and westward until it encircled the globe, yet he was an Oriental writing in an Oriental language for those who used it, and the unique work which he so faithfully accomplished was in itself a great and laborious task. </p>

<p> There exists in English, however, a literature about Persia in the nineteenth century which will give the Western reader ample information on the subject. From Persian writings which have already been translated, or from books of European travellers like Lord Curzon, Sir J. Malcolm, and others not a few, he will find a lifelike and vivid if unlovely picture of the </p>

<p> Page 17 </p>

<p> 17 </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Augean conditions which the Báb had to confront when He inaugurated the Movement in the middle of the nineteenth century. </p>

<p> All observers agree in representing Persia as a feeble and backward nation divided against itself by corrupt practices and ferocious bigotries. Inefficiency and wretchedness, the fruit of moral decay, filled the land. From the highest to the lowest there appeared neither the capacity to carry out methods of reform nor even the will seriously to institute them National conceit preached a grandiose self-content. A pall of immobility lay over all things, and a general paralysis of mind made any development impossible. </p>

<p> To a student of history the degeneracy of a nation once so powerful and so illustrious seems pitiful in the extreme. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who in spite of the cruelties heaped on Bahá’u’lláh, on the Báb, and on Himself, yet loved His country, called their degradation “the tragedy of a people”; and in that work, “The Mysterious Forces of Civilisation,” in which He sought to stir the hearts of His compatriots to undertake radical reforms, He uttered a poignant lament over the present fate of a people who once had extended their conquests east and west and had led the civilisation of mankind. “In former times,” he writes, “Persia was verily the heart of the world and shone among the nations like a lighted taper. Her glory and prosperity broke from the horizon of humanity like the true dawn disseminating the light of knowledge and illumining the nations of the East and West. The fame of her victorious kings reached the ears of the dwellers at the poles of the earth. The majesty of her king of kings humbled the monarchs of Greece and Rome Her governing wisdom filled the sages with awe, and the rulers of the continents fashioned their laws upon her polity. The Persians being distinguished among the nations of the earth as a people of conquerors, and justly admired for their civilisation and learning, their country became the glorious centre of all the sciences and arts, the mine of culture and a fount of virtues. ...How is it that this excellent country now, by reason of our sloth, vanity, and indifference, from the lack of knowledge and organisation, from the poverty of the zeal and ambition of her people, has suffered the rays of her prosperity to be darkened and well-nigh extinguished?” </p>

<p> Other writers describe fully those unhappy conditions to which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers. </p>

<p> At the time when the Báb declared His Mission, the government of the country was, in Lord Curzon’s phrase, “a Church-State.” Venal, cruel, and immoral as it was, it was formally religious. Muslim orthodoxy was its basis and permeated to the core both it and the social lives of the people. But otherwise there were no laws, statutes, or charters to guide the direction of public affairs. There was no House of Lords nor Privy Council, no synod, no Parliament. The <u>Sh</u>áh was despot, and his arbitrary rule was reflected all down the official scale through every minister and governor to the lowliest clerk or remotest headman. No civil tribunal existed to check or modify the power of the monarch or the authority which he might choose to delegate to his subordinates. If there was a law, it was his word. He could do as he pleased. It was his to appoint or to dismiss all ministers, officials, officers, and judges. He had power of life and death without appeal over all members of his household and of his court, whether civil or military. The right to take life was vested in him alone; and so were all the functions of government, legislative, executive, and judicial. His royal prerogative was limited by no written restraint whatever. </p>

<p> Descendants of the Sháhs were thrust into the most lucrative posts throughout the country, and as the generations went by they filled innumerable minor posts too, far and wide, till the land was burdened with this race of royal drones who owed their position to nothing better </p>

<p> Page 18 </p>

<p> 18 </p>

<p> than their blood and who gave rise to the Persian saying that “camels, fleas, and princes exist everywhere.” </p>

<p> Even when a <u>Sh</u>áh wished to make a just and wise decision in any case that might be brought before him for judgment, he found it difficult to do so, because he could not rely on the information given him. Critical facts would be withheld, or the facts given would be distorted by the influence of interested witnesses or venal ministers. The system of corruption had been carried so far in Persia that it had become a recognised institution which Lord Curzon describes in the following terms: </p>

<p> “I come now to that which is the cardinal and differentiating feature of Iranian administration. Government, nay, life itself, in that country may be said to consist for the most part of an interchange of presents. Under its social aspects this practice may be supposed to illustrate the generous sentiments of an amiable people; though even here it has a grimly unemotional side, as, for instance, when, congratulating yourself upon being the recipient of a gift, you find that not only must you make a return of equivalent cost to the donor, but must also liberally remunerate the bearer of the gift (to whom your return is very likely the sole recognised means of subsistence) in a ratio proportionate to its pecuniary value. Under its political aspects, the practice of gift-making, though consecrated in the adamantine traditions of the East, is synonymous with the system elsewhere described by less agreeable names. This is the system on which the government of Persia has been conducted for centuries, and the maintenance of which opposes a solid barrier to any real reform. From the <u>Sh</u>áh downwards, there is scarcely an official who is not open to gifts, scarcely a post which is not conferred in return for gifts, scarcely an income which has not been amassed by the receipt of gifts. Every individual, with hardly an exception, in the official hierarchy above mentioned, has only purchased his post by a money present either to the <u>Sh</u>áh, or to a minister, or to the superior governor by whom he has been appointed. If there are several candidates for a post, in all probability the one who makes the best offer will win. </p>

<p> “...The ‘madakhil’ is a cherished national institution in Persia, the exaction of which, in a myriad different forms, whose ingenuity is only equalled by their multiplicity, is the crowning interest and delight of a Persian’s existence. This remarkable word, for which Mr. Watson says there is no precise English equivalent, may be variously translated as commission, perquisite, douceur, consideration, pickings and stealings, profit, according to the immediate context in which it is employed. Roughly speaking, it signifies that balance of personal advantage, usually expressed in money form, which can be squeezed out of any and every transaction. A negotiation, in which two parties are involved as donor and recipient, as superior and subordinate, or even as equal contracting agents, cannot take place in Persia without the party who can be represented as the author of the favour or service claiming and receiving a definite cash return for what he has done or given. It may of course be said that human nature is much the same all the world over; that a similar system exists under a different name in our own or other countries, and that the philosophic critic will welcome in the Persian a man and a brother. To some extent this is true. But in no country that I have ever seen or heard of in the world, is the system so open, so shameless, or so universal as in Persia. So far from being limited to the sphere of domestic economy or to commercial transactions, it permeates every walk and inspires most of the actions of life. By its operation, generosity or gratuitous service may be said to have been erased in Persia from the category of social virtues, and cupidity has been elevated into the guiding principle of human conduct.... Hereby is instituted an arithmetical progression of plunder from the sovereign to the subject, each unit in the descending scale remunerating himself from the unit next in rank below his, and the hapless peasant being the ultimate victim. It is not surprising, under these </p>

<p> Page 19 </p>

<p> 19 </p>

<p> circumstances, that office is the common avenue to wealth, and that cases are frequent of men who, having started from nothing, are found residing in magnificent houses, surrounded by crowds of retainers and living in princely style. ‘Make what you can while you can’ is the rule that most men set before themselves in entering public life. Nor does popular spirit resent the act; the estimation of any one who, enjoying the opportunity, has failed to line his own pockets, being the reverse of complimentary to his sense. No one turns a thought to the sufferers from whom, in the last resort, the material for these successive ‘madakhils’ has been derived, and from the sweat of whose uncomplaining brow has been wrung the wealth that is dissipated in luxurious country houses, European curiosities and enormous retinues.” </p>

<p> To read the foregoing is to perceive something of the difficulty of the Báb’s mission; to read the following is to understand the dangers he faced, and to be prepared for a story of violence and heinous cruelty. </p>

<p> “Before I quit the subject of the Persian law and its administration, let me add a few words upon the subject of penalties and prisons. Nothing is more shocking to the European reader, in pursuing his way through the crime-stained and bloody pages of Persian history during the last and, in a happily less degree, during the present century, than the record of savage punishments and abominable tortures, testifying alternately to the callousness of the brute and the ingenuity of the fiend. The Persian character has ever been fertile in device and indifferent to suffering; and in the field of judicial executions it has found ample scope for the exercise of both attainments. Up till quite a recent period, well within the borders of the present reign, condemned criminals have been crucified, blown from guns, buried alive, impaled, shod like horses, torn asunder by being bound to the heads of two trees bent together and then allowed to spring back to their natural position, converted into human torches, flayed while living. </p>

<p> “...Under a twofold governing system, such as that of which I have now completed the description-namely, an administration in which every actor is, in different aspects, both the briber and the bribed; and a judicial procedure, without either a law or a law court-it will readily be understood that confidence in the Government is not likely to exist, that there is no personal sense of duty or pride of honour, no mutual trust or co-operation (except in the service of ill-doing), no disgrace in exposure, no credit in virtue, above all no national spirit or patriotism.” </p>

<p> From the beginning the Báb must have divined the reception which would be accorded by His countrymen to His teachings, and the fate which awaited Him at the hands of the mullás. But He did not allow personal misgivings to affect the frank enunciation of His claims nor the open presentation of His Cause. The innovations which He proclaimed, though purely religious, were drastic; the announcement of His own identity startling and tremendous. He made Himself known as the Qá’im, the High Prophet or Messiah so long promised, so eagerly expected by the Muḥammadan world. He added to this the declaration that he was also the Gate (that is, the Báb) through whom a greater Manifestation than Himself was to enter the human realm. </p>

<p> Putting Himself thus in line with the traditions of Islám, and appearing as the fulfilment of prophecy, He came into conflict with those who had fixed and ineradicable ideas (different from His) as to what those prophecies and traditions meant. The two great Persian sects of Islám, the shí’ah and the sunnís, both attached vital importance to the ancient deposit of their faith but did not agree as to its contents or its import. The shí’ah, out of whose doctrines the Bábí Movement rose, held that after the ascension of the High Prophet Muḥammad He was </p>

<p> Page 20 </p>

<p> 20 </p>

<p> succeeded by a line of twelve Imáms. Each of these, they held, was specially endowed by God with spiritual gifts and powers, and was entitled to the whole-hearted obedience of the faithful. Each owed his appointment not to the popular choice but to his nomination by his predecessor in office. The twelfth and last of these inspired guides was Muḥammad, called by the shí’ah “Imám-Mihdí, Hujjatu’lláh [the Proof of God], Bagíyyatu’lláh [the Remnant of God], and Qá’im-i-‘Alí-Muḥammad [He who shall arise of the family of Muḥammad].” He assumed the functions of the Imám in the year 260 of the Hegira, but at once disappeared from view and communicated with his followers only through a certain chosen intermediary known as a Gate. Four of these Gates followed one another in order, each appointed by his predecessor with the approval of the Imám. But when the fourth, Abu’l-Ḥasan-‘Alí, was asked by the faithful, before he died, to name his successor, he declined to do so. He said that God had another plan. On his death all communication between the Imám and his church therefore ceased. And though, surrounded by a band of followers, he still lives and waits in some mysterious retreat, he will not resume relations with his people until he comes forth in power to establish a millennium throughout the world. </p>

<p> The sunnís, on the other hand, take a less exalted view of the office of those who have succeeded the High Prophet. They regard the vicegerency less as a spiritual than as a practical matter. The Khalíf is, in their eyes, the Defender of the Faith, and he owes his appointment to the choice and approval of the People. </p>

<p> Important as these differences are, both sects agree, however, in expecting a twofold Manifestation. The shí’ahs look for the Qá’im, who is to come in the fulness of time, and also for the return of the Imám Ḥusayn. The sunnís await the appearance of the Mihdí and also “the return of Jesus Christ.” When, at the beginning of his Mission, the Báb, continuing the tradition of the shí’ahs, proclaimed His function under the double title of, first, the Qá’im and, second, the Gate, or Báb, some of the Muḥammadans misunderstood the latter reference. They imagined His meaning to be that He was a fifth Gate In succession to Abu’l-Ḥasan-‘Alí. His true meaning, however, as He himself clearly announced, was very different. He was the Qá’im; but the Qá’im, though a High Prophet, stood in relation to a succeeding and greater Manifestation as did John the Baptist to the Christ. He was the Forerunner of One yet more mighty than Himself. He was to decrease; that Mighty One was to increase. And as John the Baptist had been the Herald or Gate of the Christ, so was the Báb the Herald or Gate of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> There are many authentic traditions showing that the Qá’im on His appearance would bring new laws with Him and would thus abrogate Islám. But this was not the understanding of the established hierarchy. They confidently expected that the promised Advent would not substitute a new and richer revelation for the old, but would endorse and fortify the system of which they were the functionaries. It would enhance incalculably their personal prestige, would extend their authority far and wide among the nations, and would win for them the reluctant but abject homage of mankind. When the Báb revealed His Bayán, proclaimed a new code of religious law, and by precept and example instituted a profound moral and spiritual reform, the priests immediately scented mortal danger. They saw their monopoly undermined, their ambitions threatened, their own lives and conduct put to shame. They rose against Him in sanctimonious indignation. They declared before the <u>Sh</u>áh and all the people that this upstart was an enemy of sound learning, a subverter of Islám, a traitor to Muḥammad, and a peril not only to the holy church but to the social order and to the State itself. </p>

<p> Page 21 </p>

<p> 21 </p>

<p> The cause of the rejection and persecution of the Báb was in its essence the same as that of the rejection and persecution of the Christ. If Jesus had not brought a New Book, if He had not only reiterated the spiritual principles taught by Moses but had continued Moses’ rules and regulations too, He might as a merely moral reformer have escaped the vengeance of the Scribes and Pharisees. But to claim that any part of the Mosaic law, even such material ordinances as those that dealt with divorce and the keeping of the Sabbath, could be altered— and altered by an unordained preacher from the village of Nazareth-this was to threaten the interests of the Scribes and Pharisees themselves, and since they were the representatives of Moses and of God, it was blasphemy against the Most High. As soon as the position of Jesus was understood, His persecution began. As He refused to desist, He was put to death. </p>

<p> For reasons exactly parallel, the Báb was from the beginning opposed by the vested interests of the dominant Church as an uprooter of the Faith. Yet, even in that dark and fanatical country, the mullás (like the Scribes in Palestine eighteen centuries before) did not find it very easy to put forward a plausible pretext for destroying Him whom they thought their enemy. </p>

<p> The only known record of the Báb’s having been seen by a European belongs to the period of His persecution when an English physician resident in Tabríz, Dr. Cormick, was called in by the Persian authorities to pronounce on the Báb’s mental condition. The doctor’s letter, addressed to a fellow practitioner in an American mission in Persia, is given in Professor E. G. Browne’s “Materials for the Study of the Bábí Religion.” “You ask me,” writes the doctor, “for some particulars of my interview with the founder of the sect known as Bábís. Nothing of any importance transpired in this interview, as the Báb was aware of my having been sent with two other Persian doctors to see whether he was of sane mind or merely a madman, to decide the question whether he was to be put to death or not. With this knowledge he was loth to answer any questions put to him. To all enquiries he merely regarded us with a mild look, chanting in a low melodious voice some hymns, I suppose. Two other siyyids, his intimate friends, were also present, who subsequently were put to death with him, besides a couple of government officials. He only deigned to answer me, on my saying that I was not a Musulman and was willing to know something about his religion, as I might perhaps be inclined to adopt it. He regarded me very intently on my saying this, and replied that he had no doubt of all Europeans coming over to his religion. Our report to the <u>Sh</u>áh at that time was of a nature to spare his life. He was put to death some time after by the order of the Amír — Nizám, Mírzá Taqí <u>Kh</u>án. On our report he merely got the bastinado, in which operation a farrásh, whether intentionally or not, struck him across the face with the stick destined for his feet, which produced a great wound and swelling of the face. On being asked whether a Persian surgeon should be brought to treat him, he expressed a desire that I should be sent for, and I accordingly treated him for a few days, but in the interviews consequent on this I could never get him to have a confidential chat with me, as some government people were always present, he being a prisoner. He was a very mild and delicate-looking man, rather small in stature and very fair for a Persian, with a melodious soft voice, which struck me much. Being a Siyyid, he was dressed in the habit of that sect, as were also his two companions. In fact his whole look and deportment went far to dispose one in his favour. Of his doctrine I heard nothing from his own lips, although the idea was that there existed in his religion a certain approach to Christianity. He was seen by some Armenian carpenters, who were sent to make some repairs in his prison, reading the Bible, and he took no pains to conceal it, but on the contrary told them of it. Most assuredly the Musulman fanaticism does not exist in his religion, as applied to Christians, nor is there that restraint of females that now exists.” </p>

<p> Page 22 </p>

<p> 22 </p>

<p> Such was the impression made by the Báb upon a cultivated Englishman. And as far as the influence of His character and teaching have since spread through the West, no other record is extant of His having been observed or seen by European eyes. </p>

<p> His qualities were so rare in their nobility and beauty, His personality so gentle and yet so forceful, and His natural charm was combined with so much tact and judgment, that after His Declaration He quickly became in Persia a widely popular figure. He would win over almost all with whom He was brought into personal contact, often converting His gaolers to His Faith and turning the ill-disposed into admiring friends. </p>

<p> To silence such a man without incurring some degree of public odium was not very easy even in the Persia of the middle of last century. But with the Báb’s followers it was another matter. </p>

<p> The mullás encountered here no cause for delay and found little need for scheming. The bigotry of the Muḥammadans from the <u>Sh</u>áh downwards could be readily roused against any religious development. The Bábís could be accused of disloyalty to the <u>Sh</u>áh, and dark political motives could be attributed to their activities. Moreover, the Báb’s followers were already numerous; many of them were well-to-do, some were rich, and there were few but had some possessions which covetous neighbours might be instigated to desire. Appealing to the fears of the authorities and to the base national passions of fanaticism and cupidity, the mullás inaugurated a campaign of outrage and spoliation which they maintained with relentless ferocity till they considered that their purpose had been completely achieved. </p>

<p> Many of the incidents of this unhappy story are given by Nabíl in his history, and among these the happenings at Mázindarán, Nayríz, and Zanján stand out by reason of the character of the episodes of the heroism of the Bábís when thus brought to bay. On these three occasions a number of Bábís, driven to desperation, withdrew in concert from their houses to a chosen retreat and, erecting defensive works about them, defied in arms further pursuit. To any impartial witness it was evident that the mullás’ allegations of a political motive were untrue. The Bábís showed themselves always ready-on an assurance that they would be no longer molested for their religious beliefs-to return peacefully to their civil occupations. Nabíl emphasises their care to refrain from aggression. They would fight for their lives with determined skill and strength; but they would not attack. Even in the midst of a fierce conflict they would not drive home an advantage nor strike an unnecessary blow. </p>

<p> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is quoted in the “Traveller’s Narrative,” pp. 34–35, as making the following statement on the moral aspect of their action: </p>

<p> “The minister (Mírzá Taqí <u>Kh</u>án), with the utmost arbitrariness, without receiving any instructions or asking permission, sent forth commands in all directions to punish and chastise the Bábís. Governors and magistrates sought a pretext for amassing wealth, and officials a means of acquiring profits; celebrated doctors from the summits of their pulpits incited men to make a general onslaught; the powers of the religious and the civil law linked hands and strove to eradicate and destroy this people. Now this people had not yet acquired such knowledge as was right and needful of the fundamental principles and hidden doctrines of the Báb’s teachings, and did not recognise their duties. Their conceptions and ideas were after the former fashion, and their conduct and behaviour in correspondence with ancient usage. The way of approach to the Báb was, moreover, closed, and the flame of trouble visibly blazing on every side. At the decree of the most celebrated doctors, the government, and indeed the common people, had, with irresistible power, inaugurated rapine and plunder on all sides, and were engaged in punishing and torturing, killing and despoiling, in order that </p>

<p> Page 23 </p>

<p> 23 </p>

<p> they might quench this fire and wither these poor souls. In towns where there were but a limited number, all of them with bound hands became food for the sword, while in cities where they were numerous, they arose in self-defence in accordance with their former beliefs, since it was impossible for them to make enquiry as to their duty, and all doors were closed.” </p>

<p> Bahá’u’lláh, on proclaiming some years later His Mission, left no room for uncertainty as to the law of His Dispensation in such a predicament when He affirmed: “It is better to be killed than to kill.” </p>

<p> Whatever resistance the Bábís offered, here or elsewhere, proved ineffective. They were overwhelmed by numbers. The Báb Himself was taken from His cell and executed. Of His chief disciples who avowed their belief in Him, not one soul was left alive save Bahá’u’lláh, who with His family and a handful of devoted followers was driven destitute into exile and prison in a foreign land. </p>

<p> But the fire, though smothered, was not quenched. It burned in the hearts of the exiles who carried it from country to country as they travelled. Even in the homeland of Persia it had penetrated too deeply to be extinguished by physical violence, and still smouldered in the people’s hearts, needing only a breath from the spirit to be fanned into an all-consuming conflagration. </p>

<p> The Second and greater Manifestation of God was proclaimed in accordance with the prophecy of the Báb at the date which He had foretold. Nine years after the beginning of the Bábí Dispensation-that is, in 1853—Bahá’u’lláh, in certain of His odes, alluded to His identity and His Mission, and ten years later, while resident in Ba<u>gh</u>dád, declared Himself as the Promised One to His companions. </p>

<p> Now the great Movement for which the Báb had prepared the way began to show the full range and magnificence of its power. Though Bahá’u’lláh Himself lived and died an exile and a prisoner and was known to few Europeans, His epistles proclaiming the new Advent were borne to the great rulers of both hemispheres, from the <u>Sh</u>áh of Persia to the Pope and to the President of the United States. After His passing, His son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá carried the tidings in person into Egypt and far through the Western world. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited England, France, Switzerland, Germany, and America, announcing everywhere that once again the heavens had opened and that a new Dispensation had come to bless the sons of men. He died in November, 1921; and to-day the fire that once seemed to have been put out for ever, burns again in every part of Persia, has established itself on the American continent, and has laid hold of every country in the world. Around the sacred writings of Bahá’u’lláh and the authoritative exposition of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá there is growing a large volume of literature in comment or in witness. The humanitarian and spiritual principles enunciated decades ago in the darkest East by Bahá’u’lláh and moulded by Him into a coherent scheme are one after the other being taken by a world unconscious of their source as the marks of progressive civilisation. And the sense that mankind has broken with the past and that the old guidance will not carry it through the emergencies of the present has filled with uncertainty and dismay all thoughtful men save those who have learned to find in the story of Bahá’u’lláh the meaning of all the prodigies and portents of our time. </p>

<p> Nearly three generations have passed since the inception of the Movement. Any of its early adherents who escaped the sword and the stake have long since passed away in the course of nature. The door of contemporary information as to its two great leaders and their heroic disciples is closed for ever. The Chronicle of Nabíl as a careful collection of facts made in the </p>

<p> Page 24 </p>

<p> interests of truth and completed in the lifetime of Bahá’u’lláh has now a unique value. The author was thirteen years old when the Báb declared Himself, having been born in the village of Zarand in Persia on the eighteenth day of Safar, 1247 A.H. He was throughout his life closely associated with the leaders of the Cause. Though he was but a boy at the time, he was preparing to leave for <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Ṭabarsí and join the party of Mullá Ḥusayn when the news of the treacherous massacre of the Bábís frustrated his design. He states in his narrative that he met, in Ṭihrán, Ḥájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí, a brother of the Báb’s mother, who had just returned at the time from visiting the Báb in the fortress of Chihríq; and for many years he was a close companion of the Báb’s secretary, Mírzá Aḥmad. </p>

<p> He entered the presence of Bahá’u’lláh in Kirmansháh and Ṭihrán before the date of the exile to ‘Iráq, and afterwards was in attendance upon Him in Ba<u>gh</u>dád and Adrianople as well as in the prison-city of ‘Akká. He was sent more than once on missions to Persia to promote the Cause and to encourage the scattered and persecuted believers, and he was living in ‘Akká when Bahá’u’lláh passed away in 1892 A.D. The manner of his death was pathetic and lamentable, for he became so dreadfully affected by the death of the Great Beloved that, overmastered by grief, he drowned himself in the sea, and his dead body was found washed ashore near the city of ‘Akká. </p>

<p> His chronicle was begun in 1888, when he had the personal assistance of Mírzá Músá, the brother of Bahá’u’lláh. It was finished in about a year and a half, and parts of the manuscript were reviewed and approved, some by Bahá’u’lláh, and others by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>

<p> The complete work carries the history of the Movement up to the death of Bahá’u’lláh in 1892. </p>

<p> The first half of this narrative, closing with the expulsion of Bahá’u’lláh from Persia, is contained in the present volume. Its importance is evident. It will be read less for the few stirring passages of action which it contains, or even for its many pictures of heroism and unwavering faith, than for the abiding significance of those events of which it gives so unique a record. </p>

<p> Dear Roy: </p>

<p> ... Concerning the general letter he has sent lately to the Western </p>

<p> friends, to which you refer in your letter; Shoghi Effendi thinks that the friends </p>

<p> should spread the message it conveys to the public. It should undoubtedly be done </p>

<p> in a very judicious way lest the people think that we have entered the arena of </p>

<p> politics with rather drastic programs of reform. But we should at the same time </p>

<p> show the lead that the teachings take towards the realization of the international </p>

<p> ideal. The primary importance of the Cause among the existing religions of the </p>

<p> world is that, whereas the others have no coherent program upon which they are </p>

<p> united, the Movement is rich with the very spirit and teachings of world needs for </p>

<p> solving its present international problems. It is wonderful chance for the Cause </p>

<p> to absorb the interest of the intelligent elements in the public... . </p>

<p> Please convey Shoghi Effendi’s greetings to your Mother as well as to the </p>

<p> Members of the National Spiritual Assembly. </p>

<p> My dear Roy [Wilhelm] </p>

<p> Many thanks /or your card of Jan. 12th ... . Shoghi Effendi and the rest of us are delighted as to the work that is being accomplished in America. This failure of material civilization should bring man near to spiritual matters. Working for material comfort and prosperity is becoming so useless and hopeless that we may well turn our attention more to God and the future life. The Temple also seem. to be attracting so much attention and arousing so much interest in the teachings. We do hope that the friends are availing themselves of these opportunities and are really active in spreading the Message. </p>

<p> Dear Miss Craighead: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dates Jan 13th 1932 telling him that you have decided to join the Bahá’í group in Pittsburgh. This news gave him great pleasure, both because you have seen and appreciated the source of divine guidance in the present day and have thereby been lead to the Faith of Salvation, and also because in you we can expect a servant as devoted and self-sacrificing as your spiritual Mother Miss Martha Root. </p>

<p> If complete destruction of our civilization is to be averted, if the world is to become a land of peace and good-will where our personality an be enhanced and developed spiritually, souls will have to arise who will first get imbued with the spirit of God revealed in this age through Bahá’u’lláh, and the diffuse it into the consciousness of mankind. Unless this happens the darksome clouds that threaten a terrific storm to an already ravaged society, will not be dissipated, and the era ‘when the lion and the lamb shall lie together’ will never dawn. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi will remember you in his prayers and ask God to assist you. He trusts that you will exert all your efforts to deepen your knowledge of the history and teachings of the Faith and then arise to spread, what you have received, throughout the land. </p>

<p> With best wishes </p>

<p> Yours ever sincerely </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Haifa, Palestine. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> February 2, 1932. </p>

<p> Dear Mr. and Mrs. Ober: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated </p>

<p class='signature noid'> January 22nd, 1932. You inquired concerning the Ḥuqúq. Shoghi Effendi would much </p>

<p> prefer if the friends in America concentrate their financial resources towards the </p>

<p> completion of the Temple, rather than dissipate their energy along the channels </p>

<p> that do not as yet call for immediate attention. When the time comes that the </p>

<p> Cause would need the enforcement of this religious donation Shoghi Effendi would </p>

<p> say it and would set forth the amount prescribed. It is only gradually that the </p>

<p> teachings of Bahá’u’lláh can be enforced. The time has to become ripe of the </p>

<p> desired result is to be obtained. </p>

<p> Concerning the number of Bahá’ís throughout the world. This is a very </p>

<p> difficult question to answer. Shoghi Effendi has been trying hard to obtain even </p>

<p> an approximate figure but without result. This is true especially in Persia where </p>

<p> besides the large number of the friends who are declared believers, there are </p>

<p> innumerable souls who for some reason or other prefer to keep their faith a </p>

<p> secret. </p>

<p> Orientalists who wrote many years ago gave the figure as two million. Sir </p>

<p> Dennison Ross in an article published last year in the “London Times said that </p>

<p> over one-half of the educated people of Persia are Bahá’ís. All these, however, </p>

<p> are personal impressions, the best thing is to say that we do not know. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi hopes that before long the friends in Persia would send him </p>

<p> an approximate figure, but he does not know when that will be, for he has been </p>

<p> waiting for this figure ever since he took up the reins of the administration. </p>

<p> In closing may I assure you of Shoghi Effendi’s prayers and best wishes for </p>

<p> the services you are rendering the Cause. </p>

<p> Yours very sincerely, </p>

<p> Rúḥí Afnán. </p>

<p> Dear and Precious co-workers: </p>

<p> I wish you to urge the friends, far and near, to concentrate their energy, </p>

<p> attention and resources on the immediate needs and requirements of the Temple. </p>

<p> Everything else, except the Teaching work, must be sub-ordinated to this pressing </p>

<p> issue, this high enterprise, this noble ideal. I will continue to pray at the </p>

<p> Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh for the success of your unsparing efforts, and wish to </p>

<p> assure you in person of my great love and appreciation of your many past and </p>

<p> The crisis that exists in the world is not confined to the farmers. Its effects have reached every means of livelihood. The farmers are in a sense better off because they at least have food to eat. But on the whole the crisis is serving a great purpose. It is broadening the outlook of man, teaching him to think internationally, forcing him to take into consideration the welfare of his neighbours if he wishes to improve his own condition. In short it is forcing humanity to appreciate the significance of and follow the precepts laid by Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> souls who would arise and help the promotion of our beloved Faith and the carrying </p>

<p> Effendi but for some reason or other it does not seem to be realized. It may be </p>

<p> because we have failed to do our best, in living the life, and promoting the </p>

<p> material with which we have to work and then hope to succeed. In the Bayán the Báb </p>

<p> reluctance to concentrate our efforts in spreading the Cause, retard the </p>

<p> realization of that ideal. And what would that mean? It shall mean that we will be </p>

<p> held responsible before God, that the race will remain longer in its state of </p>

<p> Plan of Unified Action, and compensate for the disadvantages it has, unavoidably </p>

<p> and owing to unforseen circumstances, suffered. I would appeal to every </p>

<p> conscientious follower of the Faith in that land, not to rest until the means have </p>

<p> been made available to insure the completion of the decoration of the Dome of this </p>

<p> imposing and marvelous edifice before the end of the spring of next year. The </p>

<p> Cause will suffer, its prestige will no doubt be affected if the Plan, so </p>

<p> admirably conceived, should again fall into abeyance. This we must at all costs </p>

<p> prevent. May the Almighty inspire and sustain you in your arduous task. </p>

<p> Letter from Shoghi Effendi to Mr. Albert Windust, </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Haifa, Palestine. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> February 28, 1932. </p>

<p> Dear Mr. Windust: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated </p>

<p class='signature noid'> February 7th, 1932, written on your arrival in Chicago. </p>

<p> The account of your trip, of the centers you have visited and the friends </p>

<p> you have met, was very interesting. Shoghi Effendi is sure that they have enjoyed </p>

<p> seeing you as much as you have obtained from meeting them. There is always a </p>

<p> mutual give and take in such visits and commerce of love. How much Shoghi Effendi </p>

<p> hopes that other pilgrims would do the same! The service rendered is far beyond </p>

<p> what we can estimate at the time. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi was especially glad to hear of the nice re-union you had with </p>

<p> your relatives in England. He sincerely hopes that this introduction you have </p>

<p> given them to the Cause, will awaken their interest and induce them to study the </p>

<p> teaching. While visiting the Shrines, Shoghi Effendi will pray for them and ask </p>

<p> for them all divine guidance and blessings. The Cause in England is at a </p>

<p> standstill. It is only occasionally that someone enters the folds as a confirmed </p>

<p> believer. They generally get interested and then drop off. The friends there are </p>

<p> constantly writing Shoghi Effendi to ask the Bahá’ís who come to Haifa, to so </p>

<p> arrange their plan as to visit England on their way home. They need assistance and </p>

<p> the friends in America are in a position to render it. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi hopes that by now your business has taken some shape and that </p>

<p> you do not find life so very exacting. Please convey his greetings to all the </p>

<p> friends, especially to your daughters. Assuring you of his prayers and loving </p>

<p> greetings. </p>

<p> Yours ever sincerely, </p>

<p> Rúḥí Afnán. </p>

<p> Dearly-beloved co-worker: </p>

<p> The days of our companionship under the shadow of the holy shrine, our </p>

<p> collaboration, our discussions, and prayers at the sacred threshold, will long </p>

<p> linger in my memory. Much as I had heard, and through correspondence learned, of </p>

<p> your tenacity of faith, your thoroughness, your passionate devotion to our beloved </p>

<p> Cause, the intimate experience of our meeting in this sacred spot has served only </p>

<p> to heighten my admiration for the spirit that animates you in the service of the </p>

<p> Cause. The sequel of your pilgrimage, your journey to Europe, I regard as an added </p>

<p> blessing and invaluable service which I greatly value. The letters I received </p>

<p> regarding your visit to the Bahá’í centers testify to the deep impression you have </p>

<p> made upon the believers. I will from the depth of my heart supplicate for you and </p>

<p> your daughter, the Almighty’s richest blessings. </p>

<p> Letter from Shoghi Effendi to Mrs. Corinne True </p>

<p> “Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated </p>

<p class='signature noid'> January 28, 1932, together with the enclosed photograph of the Master. </p>

<p> Concerning the number nine: the Bahá’ís reverence this for two reasons, </p>

<p> first because it is considered by those who are interested in numbers as the sign </p>

<p> of perfection. The second consideration, which is the more important one, is that </p>

<p> it is the numerical value of the word “Bahá.” (B equals 2, h equals 5, a equals 1, </p>

<p> and there is an accent at the end of the word which also equals 1; the “a” after </p>

<p> the “B” is not written in Persian so it does not count). In the Semitic languages, </p>

<p> both Arabic and Hebrew, every letter of the alphabet has a numerical value, so </p>

<p> instead of using figures to denote numbers they used letters and compounds of </p>

<p> letters. Thus every letter had both a literal meaning and also a numerical value. </p>

<p> This practice is no more in use but during the time of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb it </p>

<p> was quite in vogue among the educated classes, and we find it very much used in </p>

<p> the Bahan. As the word Bahá also stood for the number nine it could be used </p>

<p> interchangeably with it. </p>

<p> Besides these two significances the number nine has no other meaning. It is, </p>

<p> however, enough to make the Bahá’ís use it when an arbitrary number is to be </p>

<p> chosen. </p>

<p> Rúḥí Afnán. </p>

<p> Dear and precious co-worker: </p>

<p> The news of the splendid results of the completion of the Temple </p>

<p> superstructure is a source of great joy and satisfaction and greatly heartens me </p>

<p> in my arduous work. I would urge you to do all in your power to arouse the </p>

<p> believers, far and near, to continue in their heroic efforts for the completion of </p>

<p> their great enterprise. You should regard it as your first and most sacred </p>

<p> obligation to stimulate the friends to maintain, nay to raise, if possible, the </p>

<p> already high standard of their self-sacrifice. You will thereby be ennobling and </p>

<p> enriching the record of your manifold and unforgettable services to the Cause in </p>

<p> that land. </p>

<p> “Concerning your question whether a person is to contribute to the Bahá’í Fund when he obtains his means of livelihood through public charity. Practically this is impossible, for a person who is so dependent upon the community cannot be of much help to others. Generally he does not have sufficient even for himself alone. In principle however, this is a secondary issue. Donations to the Cause are free. It is for every person to judge for himself whether he is in a position to contribute and whether he desires to do it; how he has obtained that sum is immaterial. A poor person may be readier than a rich man in sharing with others, and if he does, his sacrifice would be greater. A rich man’s gift may not be a sacrifice, but a poor man’s is sure to be.” </p>

<p> Dear Miss Wright: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to drop you these few lines to acknowledge the receipt of your cable asking his advice concerning your teaching tour. He believes that the most advisable thing is to concentrate upon northern Germany and Holland. He has already asked Miss Jack to stay in Sofia and Mr. Benke [George Adam Benke] is going to join her. Mrs. Gregory and Martha are to devote most of their time to Central Europe especially Hungary, Austria and Poland. This makes Eastern and Central Europe well provided for. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi therefore believes that you could render greater services if you visit the centers in Germany especially the northern part and also include Holland. </p>

<p> As far as we can learn through the correspondence we receive, the greatest amount and most lasting work has been achieved by those teachers who instead of covering much ground stay for at least a few weeks in the same city and try to confirm those whom they interest. Mere meeting the people and speaking to them about the general aspects of the Cause does not generally produce a lasting result. So if you chose some of the towns in Northern Germany and Holland and stay at least [a] few weeks in each place you could achieve more. Holland is a totally new country to the Cause so it will be true pioneer service. We do not know how receptive the people are but through the grace of God some real opening could be made. </p>

<p> We have only one Bahá’í there and his name is: Herr G.I. Bertelink [Gerrit Jan Bertelink ], Hoogstraat 3, Enschede, Holland. Perhaps you could use his help; other wise you will have to rely on your own resources and divine help. </p>

<p> Anyhow Shoghi Effendi hopes you will succeed and create a new and prosperous center in Holland. Assuring you of his prayers and best wishes I remain. </p>

<p> Please thank Mr. Maxwell for the splendid photographs of the Montreal Youth Group which I was very pleased to receive. The report of their activities was highly encouraging, &amp; I have forwarded it to Horace for incorporation in the Bahá’í World. I would have so wished to include your article in the forthcoming issue, but in view of my decision to reserve all the material I had received for the future publication, I felt it unfair to discriminate in favour of your splendid account. You will, I am sure, realize the delicacy &amp; difficulty of my position. I trust &amp; pray that you will continue in close collaboration with Mary &amp; her father your inestimable services to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section408'> 1932-04-21 Effect of martyrs blood on Germany </h3>

<p> Germany, France, Italy, and Switzerland, #20 </p>

<p> Compiled by Research Department of the Universal House of Justice. </p>

<p> Published in Bahá’í Studies Review 4:1 </p>

<p> O spiritual brothers and sisters: Think for a while of the signs of greatness, of supremacy and victory which have appeared in this first century of the Bahá’í Dispensation within the two continents of Europe and America, and indeed across the whole earth. These have come about solely from the powerful effect of the bitter cruelty tasted as if it were purest honey all these long years by those who are overwhelmed in tribulation at the hands of the malevolent in that sorely afflicted land. </p>

<p> It is the shedding of the sacred blood of the martyrs in Persia which has turned the lofty heart of Her Majesty the Queen {Queen Marie of Romania} toward this new-sprung plant of God, and caused her, through her successive and stirring messages, to awaken and alert a whole world. </p>

<p> It is the shedding of the sacred blood of the martyrs in Persia which has enabled the knights of the arena of servitude unto God to win the honour of raising and completing, in the heart of America, the noble and exalted structure of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár in the Western world, so that great multitudes from different races, religions, sects and classes were fascinated by and enamoured of that manifest sign, that safe haven, that entrancing Temple of the Cause of the Lord of the worlds. </p>

<p> It is the shedding of the sacred blood of the martyrs in Persia which has guided and assisted the standard-bearers of this oppressed community in the remotest West, to establish distinguished administrative institutions, to found Bahá’í endowments, to obtain official recognition from the high authorities, to put into effect divine laws and ordinances and to formulate a constitution for National Spiritual Assemblies.... </p>

<p> It is the shedding of the sacred blood of the martyrs in Persia which, in Germany, has raised up those who have held fast to the strong handle of faith, with such constancy and firmness that, mountain-solid in face of the bitter blasts of tests and the fiery storms of delirious outcries from the foes-which except in America had never blown so fiercely across the West-they withstood every mischief-maker and their feet never stumbled on the narrow path. Nay rather, their fervour, their boldness, their endurance, their help to one another, only increased, and they toiled more than ever to extend in their country the scope of the Cause of God and the range of Bahá’í publications, and to consolidate the institutions of the Faith. </p>

<p> “As regards the statement of our own views and explanations of the teachings: Shoghi Effendi believes that we should not restrict the liberty of the individual to express his own views so long as he makes it clear that these views are his own, In fact, such explanations are often helpful and are conducive to a better understanding of the teachings. God has given man a rational power to be used and not killed. </p>

<p> “This does not, however, mean that the absolute authority does not remain in the revealed Words. We should try and keep as near to the authority as we can and show that we are faithful to it by quoting from the Words of Bahá’u’lláh in establishing our points. To discard the authority of the revealed Words is heretic and to suppress completely individual interpretation of those Words is also bad. We should try to strike a happy medium between these two extremes.” </p>

<p> “The Artist’s Daughter” , Nancy Douglas Bowditch, p255-6 </p>

<p> 55. Letter from The Guardian via Rúḥí Afnán to Nancy Bowditch. Dated 20-6-‘32, Persian Colony, Haifa, Palestine. </p>

<p> Dear Mrs. Bowditch: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated May 18th, 1932. He is very glad to know that you have liked the “Dawn-Breakers’, for his greatest reward is to see that this work, which has cost him much labour and anxiety, is helping the friends to understand better and more fully the spirit that animates the movement and the exemplary life of the heroic souls that ushered it into the world. </p>

<p> The Guardian sincerely hopes that by reading this book the friends will be stirred to greater activity and a higher measure of sacrifice, that they will obtain a deeper realization of this Cause whose spread and ultimate victory is entrusted to their care. As some who have read the book have remarked: no one can become familiar with those lives and not be inspired to follow in their way. </p>

<p> It is surely true that the spirit of those heroic souls will stir many artists to produce their best. It is such lives that in the past inspired poets and moved the brush of the painters. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to impress you with the importance of keeping in touch with those two young architects in Prague. The Cause has not yet been established in that country and Shoghi Effendi is doing his best to start something there. Through correspondence you could help them to be confirmed. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi was very glad to hear of the engagement of Polly. May God help her to establish a family fully representative of the true Bahá’í spirit. The Guardian will pray for both of them and ask God to shower His blessings upon them. Please convey to her as well as to the other members of your family Shoghi Effendi’s loving greetings and best wishes. </p>

<p> With best wishes and loving greetings, </p>

<p> Yours very sincerely, </p>

<p> Rúḥí Afnán. </p>

<p> Note in Shoghi Effendis handwriting: </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p> I wish to assure you in person of my deep and genuine appreciation of the splendid work you have achieved and the valuable contribution you have made to the Mansion of Bahá’u’lláh in Bahjí. The portrait will adorn its walls, and serve as a constant reminder of your last visit to the Shrines, the memory of which is still fresh in my mind. I pray that you may be sustained and guided by the beloved Master to accomplish all that is your hearts desire in the service of the Cause, and may be enabled to undertake another pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the not distant future. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section434'> 1932-07-15 meditation on passing of Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum </h3>

<p> Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, compiled by the Research Department pp23-30 </p>

<p> O ye who burn in the flames of bereavement! By the Day-star of the World, my bereaved and longing heart is afire with a grief that is beyond my description. The sudden, the grievous and calamitous news that the Most Exalted, the pure, the holy, the immaculate, the brightly shining Leaf, the Remnant of Bahá, and His trust, the eternal fruit and the one last remembrance of the Holy Tree-may my life be offered for the wrongs she suffered-has ascended, reached me like live coals cast into a frail and afflicted heart. The foundations of my serenity were shattered, and tears of desolation came like a flood that carries all away. </p>

<p> Alas, that I was prevented from being with her at the close of her earthly days, at that moment when she ascended to her Lord, her Master, and when her delicate body was placed in the tomb. Not mine that honour, that high privilege, for I was far away, deprived, bereft, excluded. </p>

<p> O brothers and sisters in the spirit! In this solemn hour, from one direction we can hear the sounds of loud weeping, and cries of mourning and woe, rising out of the throats of the people of Bahá throughout this nether world, because of their separation from that rich mine of faithfulness, that Orb of the heaven of eternal glory-because of her setting below the horizon of this holy Spot. But from another direction can be heard the songs of praise and holy exultation from the Company on High and the undying dwellers in Paradise, and from beyond them all God’s Prophets, coming forth to welcome that fair being, and to place her in the retreats of glory, and to seat her at the right hand of Him Who is the Centre of God’s Mighty Covenant. </p>

<p> The community of Bahá, whether in the East of the world or the West, are lamenting like orphans left destitute; fevered, tormented, unquiet, they are voicing their grief. Out of the depths of their sorrowing hearts, there rises to the Abhá Horizon this continual piercing cry: ‘Where art thou gone, O torch of tender love? Where art thou gone, O source of grace and mercy? Where art thou gone, O symbol of bounty and generosity? Where art thou gone, O day-spring of detachment in this world of being? Where art thou gone, O trust left by Bahá among His people, O remnant left by Him among His servants, O sweet scent of His garment, shed across all created things!’ </p>

<p> O ye who loved that luminous face! The oil within that shining lamp was used up in this world and its light was extinguished; and yet, in the lamp-niche of the Kingdom, the fingers of the Lord of the heavenly throne have kindled it so bright, and it has cast such a splendour on the maids of Heaven-dwelling in chambers of red rubies and circling about her-that they all called from out their souls and hearts, ‘O joy upon joy!’ and with shouts of, ‘Well done! Well done! Upon thee be God’s blessings, O Most Exalted Leaf!’ did they welcome that quintessence of love and purity within the towering pavilions of eternity. </p>

<p> At that time, as bidden by the Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting, did the heavenly Crier raise up his voice and cry out: ‘O Most Exalted Leaf! Thou art she who did endure with patience in God’s way from thine earliest childhood and throughout all thy life, and did bear in His pathway what none other hath borne, save only God in His own Self, the Supreme Ruler over all created things, and before Him, His noble Herald, and after Him, His holy Branch, the One, the Inaccessible, the Most High. The people of the Concourse on High seek the fragrance of thy presence, and the dwellers in the retreats of eternity circle about thee. To this bear witness the souls of the cherubim within the tabernacles of majesty and might, and beyond them the tongue of God the One True Lord, the Pure, the Most Wondrous. Blessedness be thine and a goodly abode; glad tidings to thee and a happy ending!’ </p>

<p> To one who was reared by the hands of her loving kindness, the burden of this direst of calamities is well nigh unbearable; and yet praised be the God of glory that her fragile frame has escaped from the prison of continual ordeals and afflictions which, with an astonishing forbearance, and for more than eighty years, she accepted and endured. Now is she free; delivered from her chains of care and sorrow; safe from all the suffering and pain, released from the ills of this nether world. She rolled up and packed away the years of longing for her mighty Father, and for Him, her loving and well-favoured Brother, and departed to her abode in the midmost heart of the Heavens. </p>

<p> This heavenly being, during all the turmoil of her days, did not rest for a moment, nor ever did she seek quiet and peace. From the beginning of her life, from her very childhood, she tasted sorrow’s cup; she drank down the afflictions and calamities of the earliest years of the great Cause of God. In the tumult of the Year of Hin, as a result of the sacking and plundering of her glorious Father’s wealth and holdings, she learned the bitterness of destitution and want. Then she shared the imprisonment, the grief, the banishment of the Abhá Beauty, and in the storm which broke out in ‘Iráq-because of the plotting and the treachery of the prime mover of mischief, the focal centre of hate-she bore, with complete resignation and acquiescence, uncounted ordeals. She forgot herself, did without her kin, turned aside from possessions, struck off at one blow the bonds of every worldly concern; and then, like a lovelorn moth, she circled day and night about the flame of the matchless Beauty of her Lord. </p>

<p> In the heaven of severance, she shone like the Morning Star, fair and bright, and through her character and all her ways, she shed upon kin and stranger, upon the learned, and the lowly, the radiance of Bahá’u’lláh’s surpassing perfection. Because of the intense and deep-seated sorrows and the manifold oppressive trials that assailed her-never failing spring of grace that she was, essence of loving-kindness-in the Land of Mystery her lovely form was worn away to a breath, to a shadow; and during the Most Great Convulsion, which in the years of ‘Stress’ made every heart to quake, she stood as a soaring pillar, immovable and fixed; and from the blasts of desolation that rose and blew, that Leaf of the eternal Lote-Tree did not wither. </p>

<p> Rather did she redouble her efforts, urging herself on the more, to servitude and sacrifice. In captivating hearts and winning over souls, in destroying doubts and misgivings, she led the field. With the waters of her countless mercies, she brought thorny hearts to a blossoming of love from the All-Glorious, and with the influence of her pure loving-kindness, transformed the implacable, the unyielding, into impassioned lovers of the celestial Beauty’s peerless Cause. </p>

<p> Yet another wound was inflicted on her injured heart by the aggressions and violations of the evil-doers within the prison-fortress, yet another blow was struck at her afflicted being. And then her anguish was increased by the passing of the Abhá Beauty, and the cruelty of the disloyal added more fuel to the fires of her mourning. In the midst of that storm of violation, the countenance of that rare treasure of the Lord shone all the brighter, and throughout the Bahá’í community, her value and high rank became clearly perceived. By the vehement onslaught of the chief of violators against the sacred beliefs of the followers of the Faith, she was neither frightened nor in despair. </p>

<p> In the days of the Commission of Investigation, she was a staunch and trusted supporter of the peerless Branch of Bahá’u’lláh, and a companion to Him beyond compare. At the time of His absence in the western world, she was His competent deputy, His representative and vicegerent, with none to equal her. In a Tablet from the pen of the Centre of the Covenant, addressed to His consort, are these words referring to His brilliant sister: ‘To my honoured and distinguished sister do thou convey the expression of my heartfelt, my intense longing. Day and night she liveth in my remembrance. </p>

<p> I dare make no mention of the feelings which separation from her has aroused in my heart, for whatever I should attempt to express in writing will assuredly be effaced by the tears which such sentiments must bring to my eyes.’ </p>

<p> After the ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the realm of the All-Glorious, that Light of the Concourse on High enfolded me, helpless as I was, in the embrace of her love, and with incomparable pity and tenderness, persuaded, guided, and urged me on to the requirements of servitude. The very elements of this frail being were leavened with her love, refreshed by her companionship, sustained by her eternal spirit. Never for a moment will her kindnesses, her favours, pass from my memory, and as the months and the years go by, the effects of them on this mourning heart will never be diminished. </p>

<p> O Liege Lady of the people of Bahá! </p>

<p> Broken is our circle by thy going— </p>

<p> Broken our circle, broken too, our hearts. </p>

<p> That my tongue, my pen could thank thee were a hopeless task, nor can any praise of mine befit thine excellence. Not even a droplet of all thine endless love can I aspire to fathom, nor can I adequately praise and tell of even the most trifling out of all the events of thy precious life. In the courts of the Almighty, for this frail being thy sacred spirit intercedeth, and in this darksome world, the sweet memory of thee is the succourer and friend of this lowly one. Thy comely face is etched for ever on the tablet of my grieving soul, those smiles that refreshed my life are forever and safely imprinted in the innermost recesses of my stricken heart. Let me not be forgotten by thee in the glorious precincts on high; leave me not despairing, nor excluded from the never-ceasing reinforcements that come from the living Lord; and in this world and the Kingdom, help me to reach what thou knowest to be my dearest hope. </p>

<p> O faithful friends! It is right and fitting that out of honour to her most high station, in the gatherings of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh, whether of the East or the West, all Bahá’í festivals and celebrations should be completely suspended for a period of nine months, and that in every city and village, memorial meetings should be held, with all solemnity, spirituality, lowliness and consecration-where, in the choicest of language, may be described at length the shining attributes of that most resplendent Leaf, that archetype of the people of Bahá. If it be possible for the individual believers to postpone their personal celebrations for a period of one year, let them unhesitatingly do so thus to express their sorrow at this agonizing misfortune. Let them read this letter, this supplication, in their memorial gatherings, that perchance the Almighty will lighten my burden, and dispel the clouds of my bereavement; that He will answer my prayers, and fulfil my hopes, out of His bounty, His power, His grace. </p>

<p> [To the Bahá’ís of the East, 15 Jul 1932] </p>

<p> Your sojourn in Sofia seems to have been on the whole quite successful and Shoghi Effendi trusts that if you persevere in your work many new souls will be awakened. You should not, however, measure the value of your teaching services by the number of those who actually embrace the Cause. For conversion is not an easy process.

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp19-20 </p>

<p> Louise Drake Wright, 30 July 1932 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister, </p>

<p> It was with a great sense of appreciation and joy that Shoghi Effendi received your letter of July 3th, 1932 which he read with deep care and interest, and he has directed me to address you these lines expressing his heartfelt thanks for your manifold services to our beloved Faith. </p>

<p> The detailed narrative of your most interesting experiences throughout your visits to the different European countries, the many contacts you made with both Bahá’ís and non-Bahá’ís and especially with some distinguished University professors such as Dr. Fisher of the department of Oriental studies in the University of Leipzig, filled our Guardians heart with thanks and joy and confirmed his hopes for the future of your pioneering work in the many countries you visited. </p>

<p> I need not assure you how appreciative the Guardian is of all the precious efforts you are making for the spread of the Bahá’í teachings. He cherishes the brightest hopes for the future of your work. Your literary and intellectual power, your devotion and invincible faith as well as your perseverance and constancy, all these qualities of your heart and mind make you assuredly equal to the noble and most delicate task you have set yourself to achieve. </p>

<p> However meagre the immediate results of your efforts may be, however sceptical nay cynical the attitude of the public may seem to appear, you should always be confident that wherever you may go and to whomsoever you may speak the Hand of Divine Guidance is with you and will always lead you in the right path. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi will be always delighted to hear of your news and he wishes you to keep him in touch with your activities. And be assured that he will be always glad to give you any advice or help you may need. In his moments of meditation and prayer he will always remember you and ask the Almighty that He may cheer and comfort you and give you the necessary strength for the fulfilment of your most precious task. </p>

<p> Yours in His Service, H. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p> Your message of sympathy cabled in connection with the passing of our beloved <u>Kh</u>ánum has touched me and relieved the burden of grief that weighs so heavily on my heart. Our loss is irreparable, our grief immense. The example of her saintly life will inspire us to follow in her footsteps. Your pioneer services in Holland are highly meritorious in the sight of God and I wish you to persevere in your noble task and not to allow either grief or the apathy of the people to deflect you from your high purpose.

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sisters, </p>

<p> I am directed by the Guardian to acknowledge on his behalf and on the behalf of the members of the Holy Family, the receipt of your kind letter of condolence and sympathy, dated July 17th 1932, and to extend to you all the expression of the heartfelt appreciation and thanks. </p>

<p> Your touching words in connection with the sudden removal of the Greatest Holy Leaf from their midst have greatly alleviated the burden of sorrow that weighs so heavily upon their hearts, and have demonstrated that in their great and irreparable loss, the Friends are faithfully sharing their sorrow and grief. </p>

<p> The passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf, so tragic in its suddenness, has, indeed, divested the Holy Family from its unique adornment and the Bahá’í world at large from one of its noblest and most precious members. She was to us all not only a true friend, but the real embodiment of those traits and characteristics of that genuine and profound love that are born of God, and that we had learned to admire in the Master. Her life at once so eventful and so glorious, is so closely interwoven with the history of the Faith itself, that I will not attempt to describe. Suffice it to say that the share she has had in shaping some of the chief events in the annals of the Faith, though yet in the main unrecorded and unknown, will be one day revealed and its significance will be deeply realized. </p>

<p> In this great loss that the followers of the Faith both in East and West have come to suffer, our Guardians share is the greatest and perhaps the most cruel. His sole comfort in this calamity, is to see the Friends united by working for the spread of the Cause for which our departed <u>Kh</u>ánum had given up all of her life, and for the triumph of which she cherished the highest hopes. </p>

<p> The expressions of highest zealous enthusiasm and hope, of genuine self-abnegation and love that the American believers and especially our precious sister Mrs. Agnes Parsons demonstrated in their last Convention meeting have greatly brightened the closing days of her life. (1) </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi trusts that her memory will increasingly serve to cheer and hearten the Friends in their ever widening activities. </p>

<p> —Yours in His service, </p>

<p> H. Rabbání. </p>

<p> (1). Refers to the Annual Convention held in April 1932, at which the delegates and friends responded in an impressive manner to the need of the Fund associated with the name of the Greatest Holy Leaf, initiated in order to complete the exterior ornamentation of the House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. Mrs Parsons spontaneously removed a valuable pearl necklace from her neck to assist in meeting the Fund’s goal. See Bahá’í News, No. 62, May 1932 for a report of that Convention. </p>

<p> Postscript by Shoghi Effendi </p>

<p> I deeply appreciate your sympathy. My loss is tremendous and my sorrow so profound. I will pray that you, who have felt the power of her spirit at so advanced an age may be enabled to mirror forth its splendour and reveal its beauty to the world. I will continue to pray in your behalf. You are often in my thoughts. Rest assured and persevere in your devoted efforts. </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp21-22 </p>

<p> Louise Drake Wright, 15 August 1932 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í co-worker, </p>

<p> Your letters dated July 19th and 25th, 1932 addressed to Shoghi Effendi were duly received and read with deep interest. He has directed me to address you these few lines expressing his warmest thanks and his lively appreciation of your kind words of condolence and sympathy in connection with the sudden passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf. Your beautiful and touching words greatly alleviated the burden of his sorrow and comforted his aching heart. </p>

<p> At this terrible hour, when hearts are filled with grief and minds are turned towards God imploring His grace, our Guardians sole comfort is to see you as ever active in the service of the Cause. </p>

<p> In this great calamity which has affected all the friends both in East and West, his loss has been the greatest and the most cruel. But his heart is overflowing with thanks to God for the guidance and help which His blessings confer to all those who, scattered in every part of the globe, are striving to promote and consolidate the interests of the Faith. </p>

<p> He has, already, cabled to you regarding your teaching work in Holland and has urged you to concentrate on those few people who are truly interested in the teachings of the Cause and to make of them sincere Bahá’ís. It is no use delivering the Message to the public in a general way. You should strive to take hold of some persons who have a genuine interest in the Faith and to deepen their knowledge and make them ready for teaching. </p>

<p> Assuring you once more of Shoghi Effendi’s warmest thanks and of his continued prayers on your behalf. </p>

<p> Yours in His service, H. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear and precious co-worker: </p>

<p> Your services in Europe, and particularly in Holland, are deeply appreciated. I trust that through your constant efforts a center will be established in that country and will start to function vigorously and prove a prelude to still greater achievements in the future. I am urging Mrs. Greeven in Bremen to hasten the translation of Dr. Esslemont’s book into Dutch, as I feel it to be an essential preliminary to an intensive teaching campaign in that land. May the Beloved assist you to render memorable services and to establish His Faith in the hearts of its inhabitants. Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi </p>

<p> Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, compiled by the Research Department p69 </p>

<p> The ascension of the Greatest Holy Leaf is, indeed, an irreparable loss to us all and will continue to be deeply felt for many, many long years. Her presence among us was such a source of blessings and inspiration! She was to every one of us not only a friend but a real mother, through whose maternal care and love we had learned to feel and experience that consuming love which is born of God and which alone can galvanize the souls of men. </p>

<p> Her departure from our midst, though cruel and heart-rending in its immediate results cannot but ultimately serve the very best interests of the Cause. For this invincible Faith of God has, ever since its inception in darkest Persia, grown and flourished amidst all sorts of tribulations and sufferings and has welcomed all these as providential forces destined to ensure its unity, promote its interests and consolidate its work. </p>

<p> Let us, therefore, not remain disconsolate and hopeless and withstand in a heroic way the shock occasioned by the passing of our beloved <u>Kh</u>ánum. Her ascension is a challenge to us all, a challenge to our faith, to our sincerity and to our love. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May her memory continue to strengthen and deepen our spiritual insight and enable us to render the Faith as many services as we can. </p>

<p> Postscript by Shoghi Effendi quoted in Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, compiled by the Research Department p47 </p>

<p> I greatly value your sympathy in my cruel, my irreparable loss. My only comfort is the assurance of her devoted lovers to remain firm and steadfast in the Cause and to strive to follow in her footsteps. The example of her life is our solace, our inspiration and strength. May the Beloved aid you to follow in her way, and to perpetuate her glorious memory. </p>

<p> The passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf, so cruel in the feelings of unalterable grief that it has evoked, is, indeed, a tremendous loss to us all and particularly to our Guardian. Her presence among us was such a source of inspiration and joy that we cannot too deeply grieve the immensity of our loss. She was a real mother to every one of us, a comforter in our pains and anxieties, and a friend in our moments of utter loneliness and despair. But alas! [69] We failed to appreciate adequately what her presence among us meant and it is only now, when she has gone for ever, that we come to realize the irreparable character of our loss. </p>

<p> And yet, however deep our consciousness of her unexpected removal from our midst may be, we cannot but feel certain that from her heavenly retreat she is continually showering her blessings upon everyone of us and is interceding on our behalf so that we may recover our energies and unanimously arise and dedicate our lives to the service of her Father’s glorious Cause. </p>

<p> Her memory will, assuredly, continue to inspire us for many, many long years and will prove, when the hour of adversity is at its darkest, to be our best sustainer. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May her glorious spirit inspire us with faith and hope, steel our energies and enable us to make every sacrifice in the path lighted by her saintly and eventful life. </p>

<p> Your letter of condolence and sympathy of July 24th, 1932 addressed to our beloved guardian brought immense to and satisfaction to his aching heart and greatly relieved the burden of his sorrow. </p>

<p> He has, accordingly directed me to thank you most warmly on his behalf and to convey to you all the expression of his lively appreciation and sincere love. though overflowing with grief at the unexpected removal of the Greatest Holy Leaf from our midst yet his heart is thankful to God for having given us the privilege of learning through her saintly and eventful life the efficacy of God’s power in moulding our entire existence and making us worthy instruments for the realization of His Divine plan. </p>

<p> The Greatest Holy Leaf’s eventful career of more than eighty years is, indeed, so full of precious incidents, each of which is a living testimony to her devotion, faith, and selfless efforts, that every Bahá’í cannot but feel the necessity of meditating upon its sacredness and of drawing from it the necessary inspiration and hope. </p>

<p> Though gone from our midst yet we feel certain that from her heavenly retreat she is continually showering her blessings upon everyone and is watching expectant to see us arise and dedicate our lives to a cause for the progress of which she toiled so much and for the future of which she cherished the brightest hopes. The expressions of unqualified devotion and self-sacrifice, of enthusiasm and zeal that signalized the proceedings America’s last annual convention greatly cheered and brightened the closing days of her life. May her saintly memory continue to guide our steps, inspire us with faith and hope and keep us ever constant in the faith. </p>

<p> His grief is too immense and his loss too heavy to be adequately expressed in words. But the many letters of condolence he has already received, and especially your message that indicated your profound attachment to our departed <u>Kh</u>ánum, greatly comforted his sorrow-stricken heart and gave him the assurance that in this calamitous event the friends are amply sharing his grief. </p>

<p> However irreparable and heart-rending our loss may be, we cannot but thank God for having released our beloved Holy Leaf from the oppression and bondage of this world. For more than eighty years this Exalted Leaf bore with a fortitude that bewildered every one who had the privilege of knowing her, sufferings and tribulations that few of our present-day believers did experience. And yet, what a joy and what a saintlike attitude she manifested all through her life. Her angelic face was so calm, so serene in the very midst of sufferings and pains. Not that she lacked tenderness of heart and sympathy. But she could overcome her feelings and this because she had put all her trust in God. </p>

<p> And now that she has gone for ever we should rejoice at the thought that she is still living in our hearts and is animating our soul with a devotion, a courage, and a hope of which we are in such a dire need in these days of sufferings and hardships. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the memory of her saintly life inspire you with faith and hope, cheer and strengthen your heart and make of you a servant worthy to promote and consolidate the interests of the Faith! </p>

<p> In these days, when we are all mourning the loss of our beloved Greatest Holy Leaf, Shoghi Effendi’s sole comfort is to see the friends as ever devoted and active and striving day and night to promote the teachings of the Cause. </p>

<p> Concerning the suspension of festivities for a period of nine months it should be made clear that what is meant by this is that all gatherings, whether outdoor or indoor, which are not of a strictly devotional character should be abolished all through the period of our mourning. However, meetings and services that are wholly spiritual as well as those that are necessary for the carrying on of the administration should continue to be held as usual. </p>

<p> Your message of condolence and sympathy, dated July 22nd, 1932 which so fully conveyed your profound grief at the loss occasioned by the unexpected passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf was received and read with great interest.

He sincerely hopes that out of the pangs of this crushing calamity the Faith will strengthen its foundations and extend the sphere of its ever-widening influence. </p>

<p> Our loss is, indeed, immense and even irreparable. But our joy should also be great, for the Greatest Holy Leaf has at least been released from the bondage of this world after more than eighty years of continued suffering. It would take me too long to relate in their fullness those incidents which eloquently proclaim her as one of the greatest sufferers the world has yet seen. And yet, with what a fortitude she bore all these tribulations for she was confident in the grace of God. </p>

My comfort is the thought that the measure of success achieved, under your wise and able leadership, by the collective efforts of the American believers has brightened considerably the last days of her precious life. Would to God that the continued endeavours of this little band of her devoted lovers who have brought so great a joy to her blessed heart, may bring further satisfaction to her soul, and realize, at the appointed time, her dearest wish and fondest hopes for the Cause in your land. To complete the Temple, to clothe its naked dome, and terminate its exterior elaborate ornamentation, is the best and most effective way in which the American believers, the recipients of her untold favours, can demonstrate their fidelity to her memory and their gratitude for the inestimable blessings she showered upon them. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1932-09-02 purchase of Mount Carmel lot </p>

<p> No. 67 — October 1932 — page 2 </p>

<p> On September 2, Shoghi Effendi cabled this important information: </p>

<p> “Prolonged delicate negotiations resulted purchase (for) $5,000 a lot adjoining the precincts of the Báb’s Shrine. The deed has been officially registered (in the name of) American National Assembly, Palestine branch. Mailing documents to national Secretary. Inform all believers who, in response to my appeal, transmitted their donations through the National Assembly.” </p>

<p class='noid'> ========= </p>

<p> This refers to the appeal which the Guardian made in his letter dated October 24, 1925, at which time it had become apparent that certain non — Bahá’í interests were contemplating the purchase of land on Mount Carmel. As the result of that appeal, a number of believers sent contributions to the Guardian. who purchased various pieces of land in the name of the individual donors. Other believers contributed to this special fund through the National Spiritual Assembly, and it is these combined and joint donations which have made possible the latest purchase mentioned in the cablegram. </p>

<p> Within the past few months, the Spiritual Assembly of Honolulu has taken steps to transfer to the National Assembly, Palestine branch, the title to the property on Mount Carmel which they purchased some years ago through the Guardian and had held in the name of one of their members as trustee. </p>

<p> It is for the best interests of the Cause that as many individual believers as possible, who now hold land on Mount Carmel! follow the example of the Honolulu friends. The Guardian will have the transfer of title made at Haifa, and believers may write him of their intention. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section460'> 1932-09-05 Consolation on Passing of Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum </h3>

<p> Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, compiled by the Research Department p75-6 </p>

<p> The letter from that spiritual friend has reached the beloved Guardian, and he is aware of your bitter grieving over the calamitous news that a most glorious fruit of the Holy Tree, the Most Exalted Leaf, the Remnant of Bahá, has passed away. </p>

<p> This disastrous event has had an effect on the Guardian so terrible that no pen can describe it nor paper bear the words; for that bright and surpassingly fair presence, that quintessence of the perfections and attributes of God, was his close companion, and the consolation of his heart, so that his separation from her whom the world wronged, and the ascension of that loved one of the community of love, was unspeakably hard for him to bear. </p>

<p> She was a divine trust, a treasure of the Kingdom, and she spent all the days of her precious life as an exile and a captive, and her every priceless hour was passed under tests and afflictions and ordeals that she endured at the hands of merciless foes. From early childhood she had her share of the sufferings of Bahá’u’lláh, subjected even as He was to hardships and calamities, and she was as well the partner in sorrows and tribulations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>

<p> For her there was never a night of peaceful sleep, for her no day when she found rest, and always, like a moth, would her comely person circle about the bright candle of the Faith. The words of her mouth were ever to glorify the Abhá Beauty, her only thought and her high purpose were to proclaim the Cause of God and to protect His Law, while the [76] dearest wish of her glowing heart was to waft far and wide the sweet breathings of the Lord. </p>

<p> Her heavenly ways were a model for the people of Bahá, and those who dwell in the pavilions of devotion and the denizens of the Abhá Paradise found in her celestial attributes their prototype and their guide. Glory be to God, Who created her, fashioned her, called her into being, sent her forth and revealed her, whose like the eye of the world had never seen. </p>

<p> The Guardian sends his message of consolation to your honoured self and all the friends, and he says that it is fitting that the righteous should hold fast to the cord of resignation and acquiescence, and adorn themselves with the ornaments of faithfulness and servitude, and take for their example that priceless treasure of the Kingdom. </p>

<p> Postscript by Shoghi Effendi quoted in Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, compiled by the Research Department p49 </p>

<p> O well-loved friend, </p>

<p> The emotions that have possessed my grieving [50] heart are such that they cannot be put into words, and tongue and pen are helpless to describe them. The one consolation of this servant is the steadfastness and the redoubled services of those dearly-loved ones in Írán, and the good news of energetic efforts being exerted by the friends in that land. This is what dissipates the clouds of my grieving, and dispels the darkness of my anguish, and quiets the flames that consume my very being, and casts a ray of joy across the darkened sky of my agonized and stricken heart. </p>

<p> Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, compiled by the Research Department p78-80 </p>

<p> What you had written concerning the memorial gatherings of men and women believers to mourn the Most Exalted Leaf, who was the peerless fruit of the Holy Tree, and to commemorate the ascension of her who was the most glorious trust left on earth by the Lord-may the souls of holy men and women be a sacrifice for her sacred resting-place-has been received by the Guardian. </p>

<p> It cannot be imagined to what a degree this terrible and calamitous event has saddened him, and, more than words can tell, clouded the radiance of his heart. For that holy being, that resplendent person, with all her heart and soul and endless love, had ever fostered and cherished him in the warm embrace of her celestial tenderness. She was his single, dear companion, she was his one and only consolation in the world, and that is why he is so burdened down with the passing of her high and stately presence, and why the departure of that comely spirit is so hard for him to bear. </p>

<p> She who was left in trust by Bahá’u’lláh was the symbol of His infinite compassion, the day star in the heaven of His bounty and grace. That sanctified spirit revealed the loving-kindness of Him who was the Beauty of the All-Glorious, and was the welling spring of the favours and bestowals of Him Who was the Lord, the Most High. She was the comforter of anyone who grieved, the solace of any with a broken heart. She, that Remnant of Bahá, was a loving mother to the orphan, and for the hapless and bewildered it was she who would find a way. Her holy life lit up the world; her heavenly qualities and ways were a standard for people all over the earth. Like a cloud of grace, she showered down gifts, and her bestowals, like the morning winds, refreshed the soul. </p>

<p> Stranger and friend alike were captured by her loving-kindness, her spiritual nature, her unceasing care for them and tender ways; enamoured of her great indulgence toward them, and how she favoured them and cherished them. The mind could only marvel at that subtle and ethereal being, at the majesty and greatness of her, and the heavenly modesty, and the forbearance and long suffering. Even in the thick of the worst ordeals, she would smile like an opening rose, and no matter how dark and calamitous the times, like a bright candle she would shed her light. </p>

<p> The Guardian sends messages of heartfelt condolence to all of you, and asks you to be submissive and acquiescent and patient, and loyally to arise and serve, and take for your model that precious treasure of the Abhá Paradise. </p>

<p> You had asked the Guardian as to the nine months of mourning, during which all Bahá’í festivities are to be suspended. His answer is that this refers to nine solar months. He says further that the blessed and exalted Leaf ascended at one hour after midnight, on the eve of Friday, July 15. </p>

<p> The letter dated 5 August 1932, from that spiritual friend has been received by the Guardian of the Cause of God, may our lives be sacrificed for him, and he has been informed of your receiving his telegram regarding the ascension of that matchless fruit of the Tree of Glory, the Most Exalted Leaf. </p>

<p> There is no question but that the burden of grief on his sorrowing heart, because of this terrible ordeal, this great calamity, is heavier than minds can conceive, or words can tell. That gem of immortality, that precious and exalted being, was the one consolation, the one companion of the Guardian in his sorrow-filled life; and she, with her sweet encouragement, her gentle words, her never-ceasing, soothing care of him, her smiles that came like fair winds from heavenly gardens, could always gladden and refresh his spirit. </p>

<p> No one has understood the tender, spiritual and celestial bond between the Guardian and her who was the Remnant of Bahá, nor can any mind conceive that plane of being, nor reckon its sublimity. </p>

<p> During her whole life span, that heavenly being was subjected to ordeals and tribulations. She confronted the attacks of the hostile, and she suffered afflictions any one of which could well have shattered a mountain of iron. And yet the sweet and comely face of that spirit-like dove of holiness, was wreathed till her very last hour in life-giving smiles, nor did that patience and endurance, that greatness, that majesty and dignity, ever desert her delicate and fragile person. </p>

<p> She who was the trust left by Bahá’u’lláh had no other aim nor goal but these: to proclaim the Cause of God and exalt His Word; to praise and glorify the Blessed Beauty’s name; to bear ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in mind and serve Him ever; to pity the sorely-troubled and give them endless, loving care; to cherish and comfort them, and bring them joy. There is, then, good reason, that with the passing of this peerless gem, this precious, matchless pearl, we should rend our garments in mourning, and that our eyes should stream with bitter tears. </p>

<p> The Guardian conveys his message of condolence, and says that in this severest of afflictions, it would befit the people of Bahá to hold fast to resignation and acquiescence, and to rise up and loyally serve the Faith, taking for their example that priceless treasure of the Abhá Paradise. </p>

<p> In a letter dated Haifa, September 10, 1932, the Guardian has written the </p>

<p> “The Guardian fully agrees with your idea that the permanent welfare of the </p>

<p> a new contract regarding the dome of the Temple, and various measures involving a </p>

<p> strict retrenchment of administrative expenditure, have met with the Guardian’s </p>

<p> whole-hearted and unqualified approval. He truly admires the spirit which enables </p>

<p> you to face the rigors and surmount the obstacles of a crisis unprecedented in its </p>

<p> gravity and worldwide in its effects. The constancy, wisdom, courage and loyalty </p>

<p> you have so thoroughly displayed are beyond all praise, and are worthy of your </p>

<p> Bahá’u’lláh.” </p>

<p> To this letter the Guardian added the following words: “I am moved to add a </p>

<p> The Guardian’s anguish, because of this tragic occurrence, is such that it can neither be [83] plumbed nor described in words. That sublime and gloried Leaf, that precious jewel of the Kingdom, was the one great solace of his life; she was his glorious companion, and her disappearance, and the separation from her, and her ascending into the heavenly presence and court of her Lord was the direst ordeal to be visited upon the people of Bahá. Alas for any future time that might produce such a calamity, when the world’s eye might see its like. </p>

<p> That sacred treasure, that jewel of Heaven, was the very sign and token of spiritual attributes and qualities and perfections, the very model of high honour and nobility and heavenly ways. The sufferings she bore in the pathway of God were the cruellest ones, the afflictions that assailed her were the severest of all. Fortitude was the rich dress she wore, serenity and tranquil strength were her splendid robe, virtue and detachment, purity and chastity, were all her jewels, and tenderness, care and love for humankind, her beauty’s bright adornings. </p>

<p> Indeed, the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Trust of Bahá’u’lláh amongst us, was the emblem of His boundless grace, a luminary shining in the heaven of [84] tender mercy and gracious providence, the embodiment of the manifold favours of the Abhá Beauty, a repository of the bounty and loving-kindness so characteristic of the Báb, the Exalted One. To every disconsolate one she was an affectionate comforter, to every heart-broken and grief-stricken soul, a token of unfailing sympathy, of kindliness, of cheer and comfort. Her blessed life was a source of spiritual illumination for the whole world and her noble traits and heavenly attributes served as a shining example, an object of emulation for all mankind. Like the showers of heavenly grace, her generosity knew no bounds, and as the breeze of celestial blessing and favour, she breathed a new life into every soul. Both friends and strangers were drawn by her sense of spirituality, her tenderness and refinement, her unfailing solicitude, and were attracted by the magic of her unbounded affection and goodwill. That heavenly being displayed throughout her life such evidence of glory and dignity, such manifestations of majesty and greatness, such a degree of patience and resignation as bewildered the minds and souls. In the midst of trials her radiant face bore the likeness of a sweet rose and in moments of sore tribulation she was resplendent as a brilliant candle. </p>

<p> The Guardian of the Cause of God has received your letter of 21 July 1932, telling of your and the other friends’ profound distress on receiving word of this calamity, this dire ordeal, that is, the ascension of the Most Exalted Leaf, that brightest fruit of the Eternal Tree. </p>

<p> It is certain that this anguish, this harrowing event, has reached into the very depths of his being, and oppressed and darkened his radiant heart more than words can ever tell. For the subtle and spiritual attachment that the Guardian felt for her, and the heavenly tenderness and affection between that lovely fruit of the divine Lote-Tree and himself, was a bond so strong as to defy description, nor can the mind encompass that exalted state. That secret is a secret well-concealed, a treasured mystery unplumbed, and to a plane such as this, the minds of the believers can never find their way. On this account the Guardian’s anguish at being parted from that bright and comely denizen of Heaven is beyond our conceiving. </p>

<p> She who was a sparkling light of God, she who was so full of grace-that widespread ray of Heaven’s splendour, that sign of God’s mercy-was made to appear with all perfections, all goodly attributes, all blessed ways; and never had the world’s eye gazed upon such a welling spring of tender love, of pity and compassion, and never will it behold again such a gem of loving-kindness, such a fount of God’s munificence. </p>

<p> How many a night did she whom the world wronged spend as a prisoner, worn with care, tormented, banished from her home. How many a day did she live through as an exile and a captive! There was no venom of affliction, at the hands of this Faith’s foes, that was not given her to drink, no arrow of cruelty but struck her holy breast. Yet in spite of the endless tribulations and disasters, she who was a spirit of holiness and a songster of Heaven, would even in the midst of dire ordeals, her face aglow, bloom like a rose. </p>

<p> The Guardian sends messages of consolation to you and all the friends in this bereavement, and he says that in this calamitous time all must bow down their heads and be acquiescent, arise in faithful service to His Cause, and model themselves upon that most exalted, sacred and resplendent presence. </p>

<p> The passing away of the Greatest Holy Leaf was a loss every Bahá’í will feel deeply if only he stops to think about it.

Every believer that came in contact with her left her presence with a more determined spirit of service and self-sacrifice. Both Shoghi Effendi and the rest of the Bahá’ís will mourn her loss bitterly. Their only consolation can be her own deliverance from a life of hardship and difficulties, and her entrance into a realm which is naught but eternal bliss and infinite divine grace. </p>

<p> : </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated September 25th 1932. He deeply sympathises with you in your difficulties and earnestly prays that God will guide you and enable you to take the right step at this cross-road of your life. He is sure that ultimately you will appreciate the wisdom of all this and will not be in the least sorry for what has transpired. What is however essential is that you have faith in the love and guidance of Bahá’u’lláh and be certain that He will not forsake a person like you who has for so many years spread his Cause so devotedly. It may be a period during which He will test your power of endurance and tenacity of faith, but with His help you shall win and see yourself victorious both spiritually and also in managing your material affairs. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi knows that you can render inestimable service both if you go to Persia and also if you join Mrs. Gregory in Europe... . but Shoghi Effendi thinks that the place you are needed most is America. The Master asked you to work for the colored and among them and Shoghi Effendi would urge you to do the same. Your own people need you most and you have a duty towards them that you have to fulfil. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes you to take a kind of work like the one Mr. [Hyde] Dunn has taken in Australia, that would enable you to travel throughout the U. S. and both win your bread and serve the Cause. The kind of work Miss [Orcella] Rexford has [i.e., paid lecturing] Shoghi Effendi would not advise you for even though there is no harm in it, it may cause misunderstanding. The people may confuse what you say on the subject of the Cause with what you say in your other lectures. Keep also in mind that the Faith cannot spare your services totally. You should take up a work that will give you ample time to teach among the colored. </p>

<p> In his moments of prayer at the Shrine Shoghi Effendi will pray for you and ask God to guide and assist you in this very critical period of your life. </p>

<p> At the bottom of the letter, as was his custom, Shoghi Effendi added a postscript in his own hand: </p>

<p> Dear and precious co-worker: </p>

<p> The spirit which you have demonstrated and which your welcome letter so powerfully reveals is indeed worthy of the praise and admiration of the Supreme Concourse. The place you occupy in my heart and the measure of admiration I cherish for the sublimity of your faith, I cannot describe. ... I wish you to concentrate, within the limits which your changed material position imposes, on the teaching work in America and particularly among the colored inhabitants. My prayers will accompany you, wherever you may be. With a heart filled with love and gratitude, </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #80 — January 1934 — pages 5 </p>

<p> As regards the meaning of the Bahá’í Covenant: The Guardian considers the </p>

<p> existence of two forms of Covenant both of which are explicitly mentioned in the </p>

<p> literature of the Cause. First is the covenant that every prophet makes with </p>

<p> humanity or, more definitely, with His people that they will accept and follow the </p>

<p> coming Manifestation who will be the reappearance of His reality. The second form </p>

<p> of Covenant is such as the one Bahá’u’lláh made with His people that they should </p>

<p> accept the Master. This is merely to establish and strengthen the succession of </p>

<p> the series of Lights that appear after every Manifestation. Under the same </p>

<p> category falls the Covenant the Master made with the Bahá’ís that they should </p>

<p> accept His administration after Him.... </p>

<p> To divide the inheritance as it is prescribed by Bahá’í we have to divide it </p>

<p> into 2,520 shares. But we can also divide it into 42 shares. Then every one of the </p>

<p> beneficiaries will take so many of these shares. These numbers form like a highest </p>

<p> denominator for the different individuals that will benefit in case of intestacy. </p>

<p> In case of the non-existence of one class of inheritors the Aqdas mentions how it </p>

<p> should be divided. As a general rule a part goes to the House of Justice, a part </p>

<p> “As regards the participation of the friends in general elections, Shoghi </p>

<p> Effendi has written about it in his letters explaining his views on the subject. </p>

<p> He strongly feels that the friends should abstain from any election that is along </p>

<p> party lines. In elections that are not political the friends can enter but not </p>

<p> when it is in any way political. The Assembly can judge best as to what is </p>

<p> political and what is not.” </p>

<p> The postscript: “The Bahá’í Faith as it forges ahead throughout the western </p>

<p> world and particularly in lands where the political machinery is corrupt and </p>

<p> political passions and prejudices are dominant among the masses, should </p>

<p> increasingly assert and demonstrate the fact that it is non-political in </p>

<p> character, that it stands above party, that it is neither apathetic to national </p>

<p> interests nor opposed to any party or faction, and that it seeks through </p>

<p> administrative channels, rather than through diplomatic and political posts to </p>

<p> establish, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the capacity, the sane patriotism, the </p>

<p> integrity and high-mindedness of its avowed adherents. This is the general and </p>

<p> vital principle; it is for the National representatives to apply it with fidelity </p>

<p> and vigor.” </p>

<p class='noid'> ========= </p>

<p> ...in the letter published as “The Golden Age of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh,” </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi declared, “I feel it, therefore, incumbent upon me to stress, now </p>

<p> that the time is ripe, the importance of an instruction which, at the present </p>

<p> stage of the evolution of our Faith, should be increasingly emphasized, </p>

<p> irrespective of its application to the East or to the West. And this principle is </p>

<p> no other than that which involves the non-participation by the adherents of the </p>

<p> Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, whether in their individual capacities or collectively as </p>

<p> local or national Assemblies, in any form of activity that might be interpreted, </p>

<p> either directly or indirectly, as an interference in the political affairs of any </p>

<p> particular government.” </p>

<p> This instruction raised among American believers the important question whether the act of voting, in the normal pursuance of the function of citizenship, should be construed as a participation in political matters. The question was referred to the Guardian by the National Spiritual Assembly, and the following explicit reply has now been received. </p>

<p> The reply was dated Haifa, Palestine, October 22, 1932, and consisted of a </p>

<p> I wish to express to your distinguished assembly my gratitude for the action they have taken in reproducing in facsimile my humble tribute to the Greatest Holy Leaf. The hundred copies you sent me have been received and are splendid reproductions of the original. The finest and most enduring tribute which can be paid to her memory lies within the grasp, and constitutes the supreme opportunity, of the American believers. Her earthly life, as it drew to a close, was much brightened by the brilliant accomplishments of her devoted lovers in the American continent. May her pure angelic soul in the realms beyond derive added satisfaction from the uninterrupted progress and the eventual completion of an enterprise on which she had centered the one remaining joy of her life. </p>

<p> Surely no matter what we say about her still we have not done justice to the abounding love she had and the services she rendered to Bahá’u’lláh and the Master. Her life was full of events, full of sacrifices in the path of God. Ever since her childhood she had to endure hardships and share the exile and persecution that Bahá’u’lláh had to suffer. In her face one could easily read the history of the Cause from its earliest days to the present moment. </p>

<p> Notwithstanding all this she never grumbled nor lost her faith in the future. She kept cheerful and tried to give cheer to others. She was a real source of inspiration to every person that met her. </p>

<p> The only adequate way to show our love and devotion to her is to arise and serve the Cause for which she so earnestly laboured during all her mortal life. Her deeds and sacrifices should act as examples for us to follow. </p>

<p> “He hopes that these receptive souls you have succeeded to attract into the movement will through deep study and living the life become like firm rocks upon which the Cause can build its future spiritual temple-the temple of the hearts. In one of His very beautiful and stirring poems written in the early days of His Mission, Bahá’u’lláh bids us stay away and not become an encumbrance if we desire to live and have our well being. In case, however, we are ready to sacrifice our all in the path of God, then we should hasten to Him and follow His way. </p>

<p> What the Cause needs is such ardent and self-sacrificing servants and not lukewarm followers who are ready to reap the fruit but unwilling to take a part in winning that victory. Shoghi Effendi, therefore, hopes that you will endeavor to make your spiritual children of the type that Bahá’u’lláh sought to have and create not passive admirers, but active servants of the New World Order.” </p>

She was always such a source of courage and hope to those pilgrims that came from all parts of the world and had the pleasure of meeting her, that they left her presence with added hope and greater determination to serve the Cause and sacrifice their all in its path. This was especially true of them after the passing away of the Master when they felt that she was the only worthy remnant of Bahá’u’lláh’s immediate kin. </p>

<p> The Guardian has already sent you a large bottle of attar of roses. He could not find beautiful small bottles here in which he could pour it. You could there find better ones and divide the quantity as you deem best. As the attar is very volatile you should be very careful in choosing the bottles. </p>

<p> The Guardian would very much like to know how the Queen will receive Nabíl’s narrative; so in case she writes you anything to that effect please let Shoghi Effendi know about it. He sincerely hopes that the reading of that book and acquaintance with those heroic lives will deepen her faith and strengthen her bond with the Cause. It is surely impossible for a noble and altruistic soul to read those accounts of self-sacrifice and not become deeply stirred, or find a complete change in his outlook ... </p>

<p> I only wish to add a few words in person, immersed as I am in a sea of correspondence, and assure you of my ever-deepening admiration for the spirit and manner in which you are promoting the interests of our beloved Faith.

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section521'> 1932-12-13 tribute to Greatest Holy Leaf </h3>

<p> Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, compiled by the Research Department p52-8 </p>

<p> O ye who share my anguish and are my comforters in my distress and bereavement! In these past few months, from the day of the passing of that fairest fruit of the Undying Tree, of the setting of that wondrous Star in the heavens of endless glory, and of that bright Ray from the well spring of pre-existent light, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá], the Ancient Beauty, the Most Great Name-may the spirits of the Concourse on High be sacrificed for Him-has witnessed what has come upon me, whom she had surrounded at all times with her loving-kindness, her unceasing favours, and what a wound this loss has inflicted on my suffering heart. This parting from her has left my whole being in turmoil, burning with the fire of my love and longing for her. When, in the morning and the evening, I call her beloved face to mind, and let her smiles, that nourished the spirit, pass again before my eyes, and I think over all her bounty to me, all her unnumbered kindnesses, and remember that astonishing meekness she showed in her sufferings-then the flames of yearning love are kindled yet again, and sighs come out of my heart, and tears flow from my eyes, so that all control is lost and I sink into a sea of anguish without end. </p>

<p> Bearing witness to this, at this very moment, is her own pure and radiant soul, her bright and sacred spirit, that soars in the atmosphere of the invisible realm, and gazes, from beyond the throne of the Most High, upon me and upon those others on earth who are enamoured of her well-beloved name. </p>

<p> O thou Scion of Bahá! I weep over thee in the night season, as do the bereaved; and at break of day I cry out unto thee with the tongue of my heart, my limbs and members, and again and again I repeat thy well-loved name, and I groan over the loss of thee, over thy meekness and ordeals, and how thou didst love me, over the sufferings thou didst bear, and the terrible calamities, and the wretchedness and the griefs, and the abasement, and the rejection-and all this only and solely for the sake of thy Lord and because of thy burning love for those, out of all of creation, who shared in thine ardour. </p>

<p> Whensoever, in sleep, I call to mind and see thy smiling face, whensoever, by day or night, I circumambulate thine honoured tomb, then in the innermost depths of my being are rekindled the fires of yearning, and the cord of my patience is severed, and again the tears come and all the world grows dark before my eyes. And whensoever I remember what blows were rained upon thee at the close of thy days, the discomforts, trials and illnesses-and I picture thy surroundings now, in the Sanctuary on High, in the midmost heart of Heaven, beside the pavilions of grandeur and might; and I behold thy present glory, thy deliverance, the delights, the bounties, the bestowals, the majesty and dominion and power, the joy, thine exultation, and thy triumph-then the burden of my grieving is lightened, the cloud of sorrow is dispelled, the heat of my torment abates. Then is my tongue loosed to praise and thank thee, and thy Lord, Him Who did fashion thee and did prefer thee to all other handmaidens, and did give thee to drink from His sweet-scented lips, Who withdrew the veil of concealment from thy true being and made thee to be a true example for all thy kin to follow, and caused thee to be the fragrance of His garment for all of creation. </p>

<p> And at such times I strengthen my resolve to follow in thy footsteps, and to continue onward in the pathway of thy love; to take thee as my model, and to acquire the qualities, and to make manifest that which thou didst desire for the triumph of this exalted and exacting, this most resplendent, sacred, and wondrous Cause. </p>

<p> Then intercede thou for me before the throne of the Almighty, O thou who, within the Company on High, dost intercede for all of humankind. Deliver me from the throes of my mourning, and confer upon me and those who love thee in this nether world what will remove our afflictions, and bring assurance to our hearts, and quiet the winds of our sorrows, and console our eyes, and fulfil our hopes both in this world and the world to come-O thou whom God hast singled out from amongst all the countenances of the Abhá Paradise, and hast honoured in both His earth and His Kingdom on high, and of whom He has made mention in the Crimson Book, in words which wafted the scent of musk and scattered its fragrance over all the dwellers on earth! </p>

<p> O thou Greatest Holy Leaf! If I cry at every moment out of a hundred mouths, and from each of these mouths I speak with a hundred thousand tongues, yet I could never describe nor celebrate thy heavenly qualities, which are known to none save only the Lord God; nor could I befittingly tell of even the transient foam from out the ocean of thine endless favour and grace. </p>

<p> Except for a very few, whose habitation is in the highest retreats of holiness, and who circle, in the furthermost Sanctuary, by day and by night about the throne of God, and are fed at the hand of the Abhá Beauty on purest milk-except for these, no soul of this nether world has known or recognized thine immaculate, thy most sacred essence, nor has any befittingly perceived that ambergris fragrance of thy noble qualities, which richly anoints thy brow, and which issues from the divine wellspring of mystic musk; nor has any caught its sweetness. </p>

<p> To this bear witness the Company on High, and beyond them God Himself, the Supreme Lord of all the heavens and the earths: that during all thy days, from thine earliest years until the close of thy life, thou didst personify the attributes of thy Father, the Matchless, the Mighty. Thou wert the fruit of His Tree, thou wert the lamp of His love, thou wert the symbol of His serenity, and of His meekness, the pathway of His guidance, the channel of His blessings, the sweet scent of His robe, the refuge of His loved ones and His handmaidens, the mantle of His generosity and grace. </p>

<p> O thou Remnant of the divine light, O thou fruit of the Cause of our All-Compelling Lord! From the hour when thy days did set, on the horizon of this Snow-White, this unique and Sacred Spot, our days have turned to night, our joys to great consternation; our eyes have grown blind with sorrow at thy passing, for it has brought back that supreme affliction yet again, that direst convulsion, the departing of thy compassionate Brother, our Merciful Master. And there is no refuge for us anywhere except for the breathings of thy spirit, the spotless, the excellently bright; no shelter for us anywhere, but through thine intercession, that God may inspire us with His own patience, and ordain for us in the other life the reward of meeting thee again, of attaining thy presence, of gazing on thy countenance, and partaking of thy light. </p>

<p> O thou Maid of Bahá! The best and choicest of praises, and the most excellent and most glorious of salutations, rest upon thee, O thou solace of mine eyes, and beloved of my soul! Thy grace to me was plenteous, it can never be concealed; thy love for me was great, it can never be forgotten. Blessed, a thousand times blessed, is he who loves thee, and partakes of thy splendours, and sings the praises of thy qualities, and extols thy worth, and follows in thy footsteps; who testifies to the wrongs thou didst suffer, and visits thy resting-place, and circles around thine exalted tomb, by day and by night. Woe unto him, retribution be his, who disputes thy rank and station, and denies thine excellence, and turns himself aside from thy clear, thy luminous and straight path. </p>

<p> O ye distracted lovers of that winsome countenance! It is meet and fitting that in the gatherings of the loved ones of God and the handmaids of the Merciful in all the countries and lands of the East, these shining words and clear tokens from the Supreme Pen and His Interpreter’s wonder-working hand-verses which were revealed for that priceless treasure of the Kingdom-should be repeatedly recited, most movingly with devotion and lowliness, and great attention and care, so as to perpetuate her blessed memory, and extol her station, and out of love also for her incomparable beauty. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the honoured members of the Central Assembly of Írán circulate these Writings, immediately and with great care, to the countries of the East, through their Local Spiritual Assemblies; for this task is a great bounty especially set apart for the trustees of His devoted loved ones in that noble homeland. May God reward them with excellent rewards, in both this world of His, and in His Kingdom. </p>

<p> EXTRACTS PROM SHOGHI EFFENDI’S LETTERS </p>

<p> TO RUTH J. MOFFETT AND ROBERT LEE MOFFETT </p>

<p class='signature noid'> October 18, 1932, Haifa. </p>

<p> “...He sincerely hopes that every one of those individuals who expressed his desire to join the Movement will gradually become so confirmed that no amount of trials end tribulations will deter him from sharing in the work of spreading the Faith throughout the world. </p>

<p> Before undertaking such a task, however, it is accessary that they learn to study the words for themselves, and both grasp their significance and also become imbued with their spirit. The hopes of Shoghi Effendi are not only to increase the number of the friends but also to have true and more understanding Bahá’ís. The task of the teacher is to produce such efficient servants for our beloved Faith. </p>

<p> These nine months during which the Guardian has asked the friends to discard feast days, are meant to be months of mourning for the passing away of the Greatest Holy Leaf. The friends should also use it as a period of redoubled energy in serving the Cause in expression of our deep love for her as well as for the Cause she so much suffered for. </p>

<p> Concerning the future life, what Bahá’u’lláh says is that the soul will continue to ascend through many worlds. What those worlds are and what their nature is we cannot know. The same way that the child in the matrix cannot know this world, so we cannot know what the other world is going to be.” </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1933-01-11 activities of the Economics Committee </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #73 — May 1933 — page 7 </p>

<p> “As regards the activities of the economic committee of the National </p>

<p> Assembly; Shoghi Effendi fully sympathizes with the desire of some of the members </p>

<p> to see the committee find ways and means to put into practice the economic </p>

<p> teachings of the Cause, as explained in some of the recorded writings and sayings </p>

<p> of Bahá’u’lláh and the Master. But he believes that the time is not yet ripe for </p>

<p> such activities. First we have to study the economic teachings in the light of </p>

<p> modern problems more thoroughly so that we may advocate what the founders of the </p>

<p> Faith say and not what we conjecture from their writings. There is great </p>

<p> difference between sounding a great general principle and finding its application </p>

<p> to actual prevailing conditions. </p>

<p> “Secondly, the Cause is not financially in a position to launch itself in </p>

<p> such undertakings at present. Such plans need great financial backing to be worked </p>

<p> out in a permanent form. In time, Shoghi Effendi hopes all these things will come </p>

<p> to pass. For the present we have to consolidate our basic institutions and spread </p>

<p> the teachings and spirit of the Faith among the public. </p>

<p> “This is, in short, the attitude of the Guardian; but as you are a committee </p>

<p> of the National Assembly he wishes you to follow its directions. In creating your </p>

<p> committee the N.S.A. had undoubtedly some definite purpose in mind for which they </p>

<p> asked you to labor and it is your task to work for that purpose. </p>

<p> “In his moments of prayer at the Blessed Shrine the Guardian will think of </p>

<p> you as well as the members of the Committee and ask God to guide and assist you in </p>

<p> the service of His Faith.” </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p> .......... Your absence from Chicago, during the Exposition would, I feel certain, leave a gap that few could fill. Your experience, your exemplary devotion to whatever affects the interests of our beloved Faith, your high purpose and tenacity of faith eminently qualify you to introduce the Cause, explain its aim, reveal its spirit, and demonstrate the significance of its institutions, to the countless visitors who will throng that city this summer. Personally I would prefer to have you and your dear daughter entertained by me and the Master’s family in Haifa, but for the sake of the Cause, I feel the urge to address you this request. Your services are engraved upon my heart. I can never forget them or overestimate their value. </p>

<p> Bahíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, compiled by the Research Department p58-9 </p>

<p> Moved by an unalterable devotion to the memory of the Greatest Holy Leaf, I feel prompted to share with you, and through you with the concourse of her steadfast lovers throughout the West, these significant passages which I have gleaned from various Tablets revealed in her honour by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>

<p> Impregnated with that love after which the soul of a humanity in travail now hungers, these passages disclose, to the extent that our finite minds can comprehend, the nature of that mystic bond which, on one hand, united her with the Spirit of her almighty Father and, on the other, linked her so closely with her glorious Brother, the perfect Exemplar of that Spirit. </p>

<p> The memory of her who was a pattern of goodness, of a pure and holy life, who was the embodiment of such heavenly virtues as only the privileged inmates of the uppermost chambers in the Abhá Paradise can fully appreciate, will long live enshrined in these immortal words-a memory the ennobling influence of which will remain an inspiration and a solace amid the wreckage of a sadly shaken world. </p>

<p> Conscious of the predominating share assumed, in recent years, by the American believers in alleviating the burden which that most exalted Leaf bore so heroically in the evening of her life, I can do no better than entrust into their hands these prized testimonies of the Founder of our Faith and of the Centre of His Covenant. I feel confident that their elected representatives will take whatever measures are required for their prompt and wide circulation among their brethren throughout the West. They will, thereby, be contributing still further to the repayment of the great debt they owe her in the prosecution of a mighty and divinely-appointed task. </p>

<p> “The Guardian fully recognizes the authenticity and controlling influence of </p>

<p> this instruction from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá upon the question. He, however, feels under the </p>

<p> responsibility of stating that the attitude taken by the Master implies certain </p>

<p> following the Master’s instructions no Bahá’í vote for an officer (i.e., in a </p>

<p> “Anyhow, Shoghi Effendi feels that you should feel thankful to God for your situation, even as it is. As the Cause develops it will need more and more people who are really versed in their branch of learning and who can interpret the teachings to suit the facts. You will, therefore, be preparing yourself for a higher form of service if you use this forced leisure in going deeper in your branches of study. The Guardian feels it would be wonderful if, after obtaining your Master’s degree, you would continue and work for your doctorate. At the same time you will be in college circles, associated with students and therefore able to spread the teachings among them. It is very important that the movement should enter the colleges and start to acquire the support of student bodies. No one can attempt such a task better than Bahá’í students like you.” </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1933-02-26 All spiritual movements have some spark of truth </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #80 — January 1934 — pages 5 </p>

<p> All the spiritual and social movements existing in the world, and </p>

<p> undoubtedly there are many of them, have some spark of the divine truth. Their </p>

<p> very existence shows that they have something to offer to man and fulfil some </p>

<p> purpose. But what the world needs, at such a critical moment in its history, is </p>

<p> not a mere palliative. It needs a movement that goes deep into its social and </p>

<p> spiritual illness and brings about a complete, fundamental change — a change that </p>

<p> will include in its scope both the social and spiritual reform of man. But such a </p>

<p> movement cannot be inaugurated save by a messenger of God, revealed by Him for </p>

<p> that very object. In similar critical moments that have punctuated the history of </p>

<p> man in the past, a Zoroaster, a Moses, a Christ and a Muḥammad appeared, and in </p>

<p> this day, the Bahá’ís declare, Bahá’u’lláh has been revealed. </p>

<p> Just as in the past the Prophets have been persecuted and their Mission was </p>

<p> ridiculed, so has the message of Bahá’u’lláh been scoffed at as a mere impractical </p>

<p> idealism. From His earliest youth He was put in chains, expatriated and </p>

<p> persecuted. But what do we observe in this day? less than forty years after His </p>

<p> death, the principles He advocated are the only solution for practical politics, </p>

<p> the spiritual truths He voiced are the crying needs of man and the very thing he </p>

<p> requires for his moral and spiritual development. </p>

<p> He does not ask us to follow Him blindly; as He says in one of His Tablets, </p>

<p> God had endowed man with a mind to operate as a torchlight and guide him to truth. </p>

<p> Read His words, consider His teachings, and measure their value in the light of </p>

<p> contemporary problems and the truth of His mission, as well as the true spirit He </p>

<p> creates in whosoever follows His ways. — (To Mrs. Paxton, February 26, 1933.) </p>

<p> compiled by Research Department of the Universal House of Justice. </p>

<p> “At such a time when the political world is chaotic and society seems to be on the verge of death, as a result of the activities of societies that contain only half-truths, the friends of God should be united and act as one single organism. The greater their unity the surer they can be of winning the day. And this unity cannot be achieved save through obedience to the Assemblies. It is true that these are still immature and may at times act unwisely. But supporting them will help more their advance toward an administration that is truly representative of the Cause, than by criticizing them and ignoring their advice. Bahá’u’lláh has not only advocated certain principles, but has also provided a mechanism whereby that ideal can be established and perpetuated. Both of these phases are essential for the realization of His goal of world unity.” </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp23-24 </p>

<p> Louise Drake Wright, 11 March 1933 </p>

<p> Dear Miss Wright: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi was very glad to receive your two letters dated September 30th, 1932 and February 19th, 1933 together with the enclosed. </p>

<p> As regards the election of new members on the National Assembly, Shoghi Effendi finds no other practical method that is in conformity with the spirit of the Teachings, except through better acquaintance of the friends during the annual convention and summer schools. It is the duty of the individual friends to come to know one another and find out who are the persons best fitted to become members of that body. This is a slow process but surely the best one and gives the greatest amount of freedom of choice to the electors. It is the duty of the friends individually to become more intelligent voters and vote only after studying the situation conscientiously. </p>

<p> As regards the chart representing creation, we should always remember that no matter how useful such charts may be for beginners, the real authority lies in the Tablets of Bahá’u lláh and the Master. They have to say the last word. It is by them that we should be guided, rather then by charts that help the beginners. </p>

<p> The Guardian was very glad to hear that you are contemplating a second visit to Holland.13 According to the reports we have received from Mrs. Greeven, Captain Liebau14has completed the translation of Dr. Essle — monfs book. Should it go immediately to the printers, as Shoghi Effendi hopes it will, it will be a source of great assistance to you.15 </p>

<p> In Eastern Europe the Cause is making wonderful head-way. We earnestly hope Northern Europe will do the same. They are very enlightened and should appreciate the importance of peace and a spiritual regeneration of man. </p>

<p> In his moments of prayer at the blessed Shrines, the Guardian will think of you and Mrs. Nelson16 as well as the other friends in Boston and ask for you all divine guidance and help. </p>

<p> Yours ever sincerely, Rúḥí Afnán </p>

<p> Dear co-worker: </p>

<p> The problems which confront the believers at the present time, whether social, spiritual, economic or administrative will be gradually solved as the number and the resources of the friends multiply and their capacity for service and for the application of Bahá’í principles develops. They should be patient, confident and active in utilizing every possible opportunity that presents itself within the limits now necessarily imposed upon them. May the Almighty aid them to fulfil their highest hopes. Your true brother, Shoghi </p>

<p> Quoted in Never be Afraid to Dare, Jasion, p189 </p>

<p> Even though Shoghi Effendi would like you to stay in Bulgaria until the group is matured enough to take care of itself, yet he does not mind such short absence. It helps the friends to rely upon their own resources and to learn to become independent of someone to mother them. So there is no harm in prolonging your absence a little more. Shoghi Effendi believes that it would be very nice if you should go with Martha to Belgrade for the Esperanto Congress* and proceed to Adrianople for a stay of about two weeks in that city. There you could make some paintings of the Mosque of Sulṭán Selim that Bahá’u’iláh used to frequent, and also of some of the houses He occupied. It would also be nice to start a group there. In Adrianople you could separate: Martha would go to Greece and you to return to Sofia to your spiritual family. </p>

<p> [postscript by Shoghi Effendi] </p>

<p> Your historic work, so nobly initiated in Sofia and so strenuously followed in that capital and the neighbouring cities of Bulgaria, must, I feel, be further consolidated by the early resumption of your activities in that country. I would like you, however, to stay longer with our dearly — beloved Martha, and to visit with her Serbia and Adrianople. May this tour refresh and strengthen you, and enable you to extend still further the scope of y our valued activities and exemplary labours in the Divine Vineyard. </p>

<p> I am directed by the Guardian to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated March 20th, 1933. </p>

<p> He feels deeply thankful and gratified for your readiness to act promptly and print the book. As Miss Louise Drake Wright of Boston is shortly coming to Holland to resume the teaching work she started there last year, the sooner the book is ready for circulation the more it will help her in her work.

<p> When the book is out of the press please send one hundred copies to Haifa to the address of Shoghi Effendi, fifty to America to the address of the Publishing Committee, fifty to the National Assembly of Germany, fifty to the Bahá’í Bureau in Geneva18 and the remainder, please keep yourself for future demands.

Your name will thereby be forever associated with the birth and history of the Cause in Holland, a further evidence of the predominating share which the American believers are assuming in the international spread of the Cause.

<p> To the National Spiritual Assembly. </p>

<p> The Guardian is fully familiar with the difficult circumstances facing the </p>

<p> Assembly, especially in providing for the financial needs of the Cause and </p>

<p> completing the construction of the dome. Yet he is confident in God’s blessings </p>

<p> and assistance and the persistence and sacrifice of the friends in fulfilling </p>

<p> their sacred pledges. In his moments of prayer at the Blessed Shrines the Guardian </p>

<p> will think of you all and ask God to assist you and reinforce your efforts. </p>

<p> As regards the admittance of new members into the different groups as </p>

<p> declared Bahá’ís, and the expulsion of any from the community, Shoghi Effendi </p>

<p> believes that the Assemblies should not act hurriedly. They should be wise and </p>

<p> most considerate, otherwise they can do much harm to the body of the Cause. They </p>

<p> should see to it that the new-comer is truly conversant with the teachings, and </p>

<p> when he expresses his belief in the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, knows what he is </p>

<p> saying and what are the duties he undertakes. </p>

<p> On the other hand when any person is expelled, the Assembly should not act </p>

<p> hurriedly. There is a great spiritual responsibility attached to the act. The </p>

<p> Assemblies do not have only rights against the individuals, they have great duties </p>

<p> also. They should act like the good shepherd whom Christ mentions in His well — </p>

<p> known parable. We also have the example of the Master before us. The individual </p>

<p> Bahá’ís were organic parts of His spiritual being. What befell the least one of </p>

<p> the friends brought deep affliction and sorrow to him also. If by chance one of </p>

<p> them erred he counselled him and increased His love and affection, if the Master </p>

<p> saw that that friend is still stubbornly refusing to reform his ways, and that his </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp25-7 </p>

<p> Louise Drake Wright, 12 April 1933 </p>

<p> Dear Miss Wright: </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi was delighted to receive you letter of March 31st, 1933 and obtain the news of your safe arrival to Holland. He sincerely hopes that you will pick up the threads of the work you did there last year and gradually confirm in the teachings those you had interested. </p>

<p> You may be interested to know that Mr. and Mrs. Max Greeven will soon be in Rotterdam, if they are not there already, to attend to the publication of Dr. Esslemonťs book into Dutch.21 As they are expecting to get in touch with Captain Liebau who is now in Holland, you can therefore reach them through him. </p>

<p> There is also a young man by the name of Grosfeld, who is Dutch and has been living in the Dutch East Indies, who is coming back to reside in Holland.22 He is travelling through the United States to meet the friends there. </p>

<p> With all you people centered in Holland some really lasting and wonderful work should be accomplished. But, naturally, much will depend upon you, who will act as the teacher and will stay in the country for some time. They can be very helpful to create for you new contacts, and introduce you to circles where they are known, and in which you could not otherwise enter, or obtain access to. The introductions that you possess are also very valuable and helpful. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to assure you of his prayers and best wishes for a successful campaign. He trusts that God will guide you and enable you to create a strong and permanent center in that country. He will be eagerly awaiting the news of your activities and the progress of your work. </p>

<p> With best wishes, yours ever sincerely, Rúḥí Afinán </p>

<p> Dear and precious co-worker: </p>

<p> Your two letters dated April 6th and 7th have just arrived and I am delighted to learn of the splendid start you have made. I wish you could induce Mr. [...] to undertake and finish as soon as he can the translation of the Íqán* 23, which has already been published into four languages, the latest being the Chinese version. The book constitutes an essential preliminary to an intensive and intelligent campaign of teaching in Holland. I wish he could complete the translation before the end of the present year! If he cannot undertake it in person, I trust his collaborators may enable him to complete it. The uNew Era” is being translated into fifteen additional languages! May the Beloved bless richly your historic work. Rest assured, I will continue to pray for you. Your true brother, Shoghi </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp27-8 </p>

<p> Louise Drake Wright, 7 May 1933 </p>

<p> Dear Miss Wright: </p>

<p> The Guardian received your letter which you had left undated, and read it with a sense of deep pleasure and satisfaction. He sincerely hopes that God will reinforce your sacrificial efforts and enable you to sow some good seeds in that country, for it is sure that the land is ready and the people are far more restless to obtain something new, to help them out of their present troubles, than they were a few years ago. The Guardian will surely pray for you, while visiting the Blessed Shrines, and ask God to guide and assist you. </p>

<p> As regards the translation and publication of the Íqán, Shoghi Effendi believes that as long as Mr. [...] is going to translate it free of charge we should not let the chance be left to slip away. Encourage him to start that work and complete it as soon as possible. Meanwhile will you obtain some estimate as to how much its publication will cost and inform the Guardian? He is very eager to have this wonderful book translated well, for it is the best means of grounding those who become interested in the fundamental teachings of the Faith. The Íqán and Dr. Esslemont’s book will be sufficient to make any seeker a true believer in the divine nature of the Faith. </p>

<p> The Guardian is eagerly awaiting the news of the progress of your work. He hopes you will keep him informed as to any interesting developments especially regarding the translation of the Íqán. </p>

<p> Assuring you of his prayers and best wishes, yours ever sincerely, Rúḥí Afnán </p>

<p> Dear and precious co-worker: </p>

<p> I wonder whether it would be possible to induce the translator to print the Íqán at his own expense and obtain whatever profit he can make from the sale of the books, with a definite assurance that we would purchase from him a fixed percentage of the books immediately they are published. If this is not acceptable, I would appreciate an estimate of the cost of publication, and trust it will be possible, in the near future, to provide the sum that is required. I trust and pray that the Beloved may guide and sustain you in your arduous, your pioneer and highly meritorious endeavours for the spread of the Cause in Holland. Shoghi 24 </p>

<p> As regards the mind, the soul, and the spirit: In answering such a question, Bahá’u’lláh says, “You asked concerning the mind, the self and the soul (or spirit). Know that these three, and similar powers attributed to man, are manifestations of that reality which is the ground of his being ... the difference between these powers is due to the difference of organs through which that reality is manifested, otherwise that reality is the same ... .” This subject is explained thoroughly in the talks of the Master, especially “Some Answered Questions”.

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp29-30 </p>

<p> Louise Drake Wright, 29 May 1933 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister, </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi has directed me to address you these few lines, informing you of a letter he has recently received from Mr. [...] in which he has proposed to translate the Kitáb-i-Íqán into Dutch and to have it published partly on his own account. Mr. [...], who is a journalist, seems to be deeply interested in the Baháï teachings and, although himself not a Bahá’í, yet his genuine belief is that the Íqán is a highly-important and interesting book that can be of an invaluable help to every thoughtful person with some knowledge of religious literature. </p>

<p> His proposition for the publication of the book is as follows. The cost of the publication of 1000 copies he estimates to be 330 dollars and the price of each copy will not exceed 1,50 dollars. He is willing to translate the book free of any charge and he is ready to bring out the book provided Shoghi Effendi purchases from him 350 copies at a total price of 350 dollars, of which to be paid 175 dollars at once and 175 dollars at the date of publication. </p>

<p> The Guardian is very glad that Mr. [...] is ready to facilitate and expedite the publication of the Íqán, and he is ready to contribute his share for the immediate completion of this work. </p>

<p> Inasmuch, however, as he is not sufficiently acquainted with the man he would prefer not sending him the sum directly. He thinks it would be much wiser and safer to have the amount sent directly to you so as to prevent any possible difficulty or misunderstanding. </p>

<p> With the assurance of his best and loving greetings and of his continued prayers for the advancement and success of your work. </p>

<p> Yours in His Service, H. Rabbání </p>

<p> P.S. Shoghi Effendi would like you to find out whether Mr. [...] s proposition is wholly genuine and in case you confirm it, he is ready to send you half of the sum immediately.24 H.R. </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker; </p>

<p> Your deeply interesting letters of May 12 brought deep joy to my heart. I am so sorry to hear of the delay in the publication of the ‘New Era. Do please make every effort to expedite the work, and ensure its early publication. The services you are rendering in protecting the Cause, in defending its institutions, in explaining its principles, in diffusing its spirit and circulating its literature are indeed highly praiseworthy, most appropriate and meritorious in the sight of God. Your pioneer work will surely be richly blessed and enrich the annals of our immortal Faith, if you persevere in your high endeavours. Immediately you confirm and approve the proposition of Mr. [...] I will send you the sum of $175 as first instalment. Your true brother, Shoghi </p>

<p> Inez Greeven, 13 June 1933 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister, </p>

<p> Your letters dated Apr. 4 th and 14th, 1933 addressed to Shoghi Effendi were received and were read with great care and deepest appreciation. </p>

<p> He wishes me to extend to you his heartfelt thanks for your splendid efforts in connection with the translation of Dr. Esslemonťs book into Dutch.25 He hopes that through your perseverance and your zeal the whole work will be soon ready for distribution. </p>

<p> The Guardian is fully confident that the circulation of this book will greatly facilitate the teaching efforts of the friends and that through its reading many eager souls will be attracted to the Cause. </p>

<p> In closing may I assure you once more of his loving greetings and of his best wishes for your husband and for yourself. In his hours of meditation and prayer at the Blessed Shrines he will surely remember you and will ask the Lord to sustain your efforts, cheer your heart, and enable you to render His Faith yet more outstanding services. </p>

<p> Yours in His service, H. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p> I am eagerly awaiting the news of the publication of the book, and I trust that nothing unexpected has happened to delay the work in which you are so devotedly engaged. I wish to reaffirm my deep sense of thankfulness for all that you have done and for the efforts you are still exerting in this connection. The Beloved is, I feel certain, well pleased with your achievements. Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1933-06-17 association with the World Fellowship of Faiths </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #76 — August 1933 — page 3 </p>

<p> “Regarding association with the World Fellowship of Faiths and kindred </p>

<p> Societies, Shoghi Effendi wishes to reaffirm and elucidate the general principle </p>

<p> that Bahá’í elected representatives as well as individuals should refrain from any </p>

<p> act or word that would imply a departure from the principles, whether spiritual, </p>

<p> social or administrative, established by Bahá’u’lláh. Formal affiliation with and </p>

<p> acceptance of membership in organizations whose programs or policies are not </p>

<p> wholly reconcilable with the Teachings is of course out of the question. In the </p>

<p> case of the World Fellowship of Faiths, however, Shoghi Effendi sees no objection </p>

<p> if the American National Assembly decides to appoint one or two Bahá’í </p>

<p> representatives to address such gatherings on one or two occasions on a subject </p>

<p> which is in harmony with the spirit of the Teachings does not constitute </p>

<p> acceptance by the Bahá’í speaker of the entire program of the Fellowship. We </p>

<p> should welcome and seize every opportunity that presents itself, however modest it </p>

<p> may be, to give a wider publicity to the Cause, to demonstrate its all — </p>

<p> inclusiveness and liberal attitude, its independence and purity, without </p>

<p> committing ourselves, whether by word or by deed, to programs or policies that are </p>

<p> not in strict conformity with the tenets of the Faith. Shoghi Effendi hopes that </p>

<p> this principle will guide your distinguished Assembly in its dealings with various </p>

<p> associations which will increasingly seek, in the days to come, the support of </p>

<p> Bahá’í individuals and Assemblies for the attainment of their ends.” </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp31-2 </p>

<p> Louise Drake Wright, 27 June 1933 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister, </p>

<p> Your letters dated June 8th and 11th, 1933 were received and read with deep appreciation by the Guardian. </p>

<p> He is very sorry to learn that the publication of the Íqán has to be given up in view of the fact that the publisher is not a very reliable person and that his sympathies are not quite in harmony with the teachings of the Cause. But now that the publication of the Íqán has been temporarily abandoned, you should try to give a fuller publicity to the Dutch translation of Dr. Esslemont’s book and thus pave the way for a further and more intense campaign of teaching. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi, however, would not like you to undergo further sacrifices in case you feel that you have to go back to the States for reason of health. He is fully alive to the tremendous difficulties that have for so long stood in your way and he is firmly convinced that if you find that your leaving Holland is imperatively necessary, you should not hesitate to leave your work for some time and take all the rest you need. </p>

<p> In closing may I assure you once more of his best wishes and of his ardent prayers for the further advancement of your work. </p>

<p> Yours in His service, H. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear and precious co-worker: </p>

<p> It is sad and regrettable that the plan for the publication of so important a book had to be abandoned. I still cherish the hope that Bahá’u’lláh will guide you in your devoted and persistent efforts to prepare the way for the consummation of this great and notable service to the Cause. Do not, I pray you, lose courage or hope. I will continue to pray for you and for those you have been so devotedly striving to interest and attract to this Divine Revelation. Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi </p>

<p> The World Religion </p>

<p> A summary of Its Aims, Teachings and History </p>

<p> by </p>

<p class='signature noid'> SHOGHI EFFENDI </p>

<p> Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith </p>

<p> (From a letter written by Shoghi Effendi </p>

<p> to the High Commissioner for Palestine, June 1933) </p>

<p> THE Revelation proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh, His followers believe, is divine in origin, all-embracing in scope, broad in its outlook, scientific in its method, humanitarian in its principles and dynamic in the influence it exerts on the hearts and minds of men. The mission of the Founder of their Faith, they conceive it to be to proclaim that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is continuous and progressive, that the Founders of all past religions, though different in the non-essential aspects of their teachings, “abide in the same Tabernacle, soar in the same heaven, are seated upon the same throne, utter the same speech and proclaim the same Faith.” His Cause, they have already demonstrated, stands identified with, and revolves around, the principle of the organic unity of mankind as representing the consummation of the whole process of human evolution. This final stage in this stupendous evolution, they assert, is not only necessary but inevitable, that it is gradually approaching, and that nothing short of the celestial potency with which a divinely ordained Message can claim to be endowed can succeed in establishing it. </p>

<p> The Bahá’í Faith recognizes the unity of God and of His Prophets, upholds the principle of an unfettered search after truth, condemns all forms of superstition and prejudice, teaches that the fundamental purpose of religion is to promote concord and harmony, that it must go hand-in-hand with science, and that it constitutes the sole and ultimate basis of a peaceful, an ordered and progressive society. It inculcates the principle of equal opportunity, rights and privileges for both sexes, advocates compulsory education, abolishes extremes of poverty and wealth, exalts work performed in the spirit of service to the rank of worship, recommends the adoption of an auxiliary international language, and provides the necessary agencies for the establishment and safeguarding of a permanent and universal peace. </p>

<p> Born about the middle of the nineteenth century in darkest Persia, assailed from its infancy by the forces of religious fanaticism, the Faith has, notwithstanding the martyrdom of its Forerunner, the repeated banishments of its Founder, the almost life-long imprisonment of its chief Promoter and the cruel death of no less than twenty thousand of its devoted followers, succeeded in diffusing quietly and steadily its spirit throughout both the East and the West, has established itself in no fewer than forty countries of the world, and has recently obtained from the ecclesiastical and civil authorities in various lands written affirmations that recognize its independent religious status. </p>

<p> The Forerunner of the Faith was Mírzá ‘Alí-Muḥammad of <u>Sh</u>íráz, known as the Báb (The Gate) Who proclaimed on May 23, 1844, His twofold mission as an independent Manifestation of God and Herald of One greater than Himself, Who would inaugurate a new and unprecedented era in the religious history of mankind. On His early life, His sufferings, the heroism of His disciples, and the circumstances of His tragic martyrdom I need not dwell as the record of His saintly life is minutely set forth in The Dawn-Breakers: Nabíl’s Narrative of the Early Days of the Bahá’í Faith. Suffice it to say that at the early age of thirty-one the Báb was publicly martyred by a military firing squad at Tabriz, Írán, on July 9, 1850. On the evening of that same day His mangled body was removed from the courtyard of the barracks to the edge of the moat outside the gate of the city whence it was carried by His fervent disciples to Ṭihrán. There it remained concealed until such time as its transfer to the Holy Land was made possible. Faced by almost insuperable difficulties and facing the gravest dangers a band of His disciples, acting under the instructions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, succeeded in transporting overland the casket containing His remains to Haifa. In 1909, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with his own hands and in the presence of the assembled representatives of various Bahá’í communities deposited those remains within the vault of the Mausoleum he himself had erected for the Báb. Ever since that time countless followers of the Bahá’í Faith have made the pilgrimage to this sacred spot, a spot which ever since 1921 has been further sanctified by the burial of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in an adjoining vault. </p>

<p> The Founder of the Faith was Bahá’u’lláh (Glory of God), Whose advent the Báb had foretold. He declared His mission in 1863 while an exile in Ba<u>gh</u>dád. He subsequently formulated the principles of that new and divine civilization which by His advent He claimed to have inaugurated. He too was bitterly opposed, was stripped of His property and rights, was exiled to ‘Iráq, to Constantinople and Adrianople, and was eventually incarcerated in the penal colony of ‘Akká where He passed away in 1892 in His seventy-fifth year. His remains are laid to rest in the Shrine at Bahjí, North of ‘Akká. </p>

<p> The authorized Interpreter and Exemplar of Bahá’u’lláh’s Teachings was His eldest son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (Servant of Bahá) who was appointed by his Father as the Center to whom all Bahá’ís should turn for instruction and guidance. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ever since his childhood was the closest companion of his Father, and shared all His sorrows and sufferings. He remained a prisoner until 1908, when the old regime in Turkey was overthrown and all religious and political prisoners throughout the empire were liberated. After that he continued to make his home in Palestine but undertook extensive teaching tours in Egypt, Europe and America, being ceaselessly engaged in explaining and exemplifying the principles of his Father’s Faith and in inspiring and directing the activities of his friends and followers throughout the world. He passed away in 1921 in Haifa, Palestine, and, as already stated, was buried in a vault contiguous to that of the Báb on Mount Carmel. </p>

<p> According to the provisions of His Will, I, as His eldest grandson, have been appointed as First Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith and Head of the Universal House of Justice which must, in conjunction with me co-ordinate and direct the affairs of the various Bahá’í communities in East and West in accordance with the principles enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> The period since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing has been characterized by the formation and consolidation of the Local and National Assemblies, the bedrock on which the edifice of the Universal House of Justice is to be erected. There are, according to the latest reports from Ṭihrán, over five hundred Local Assemblies already constituted in Írán. Organized Bahá’í communities are to be found in every continent of the globe. National Assemblies have already been formed and are functioning in the United States and Canada, in India and Burma, in Great Britain, in Germany and Austria, in Írán, ‘Iráq, Egypt and Australasia. Such Assemblies are in the process of formation in Caucasus, Turkestan, and other countries. Local Assemblies and groups have been already established in France, Switzerland and Italy, In the Scandinavian countries, in the Balkans, in Turkey, Syria, Albania, Abyssinia, China, Japan, Brazil and South Africa. Christians of various denominations, Muslims of both the Sunní and <u>Sh</u>í‘ah sects of Islám, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, Zoroastrians and Buddhists, have eagerly embraced its truth, have recognized the divine origin and fundamental unity underlying the Teachings of all the Founders of past religions, and have unreservedly identified themselves with both the spirit and form of its evolving institutions. All these centers function as the component parts of a single organism, of an entity the spiritual and administrative center of which lies enshrined in the twin cities of ‘Akká and Haifa. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi was delighted to receive your letter of June 15th, 1933 together with the enclosed message addressed to him by Princesses Elizabeth and Marina of Greece and Prince Paul of Yugoslavia. </p>

<p> He was particularly glad to witness how effectively God is guiding your steps and is assisting you with His blessings all through your significant and wellnigh unique contacts with important Court personages and he feels confident that through your zeal, devotion and perseverance some of them will be increasingly confirmed in the Cause. The long and most interesting conversation you have had with their Royal Highnesses at the Royal Palace in Belgrade was fully indicative of their profound interest in the Teachings. They have most probably read the Queen’s eloquent and touching appreciation published in Volume IV of ‘The Bahá’í World’ and must have been inspired by it. It is hoped that their interest will be increasingly deepened and that it will lead them to pay a similar tribute to the beauty, power and uniqueness of the Bahá’í Revelation. You will find enclosed a letter addressed to them by Shoghi Effendi and written in his own handwriting. May Bahá’u’lláh open still further their eyes that they may fully realize the Divine Bounties bequeathed by Him to the world ... </p>

<p> http://www.9facets.org/9F/Arden_Lee_Collection_files/Guardian%20letters.pdf </p>

<p> Mr. Alfred E. Lunt </p>

<p> Boston, Mass. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> August 12th, 1933. </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother, </p>

<p> I am directed by the Guardian to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated June 24th, 1933, together with your enclosed communication of the same date addressed to the American National Assembly. </p>

<p> The issues you have raised in your letter are extremely important, as they vitally concern the Administrative principles of the Faith. In his message to the National Assembly Shoghi Effendi will, in an unequivocal language, make it clear that the N.S.A. is the supreme administrative body throughout the United States and Canada. This body alone has the right to lay down, amend and abrogate the Declaration of Trust and By-Laws governing the administration of the Faith in that land, subject to the Guardian’s approval. Frequent interferences with, and modifications of the provisions of the Declaration and By-Laws are, however, inadvisable as they lead to misunderstanding and confusion and require automatically a similar revision of the provisions of National Bahá’í Constitutions in other lands. </p>

<p> The Convention, though not supreme, is vested with definite rights and prerogatives, has special exclusive functions which are defined and safeguarded by the Declaration of Trust and By-Laws. It is a fundamental principle of the Administration not to restrict, under any circumstances, the freedom and privilege of the delegates to express freely and fully their ideas, feelings, grievances and recommendations, so long as they do hot encroach upon the established principles of the Administration. </p>

<p> The Guardian feels that non-delegates should be given indirectly the right to express their views through an accredited” delegate, for otherwise it will lead to confusion and make it impracticable if non-delegates are to intervene at the sessions of the Convention. The election of the Chairman of the Convention and of its secretary as well, constitute, however, in the opinion of the Guardian, the sole prerogative of the delegates, whose function and obligation is to express, untrammeled by any previous arrangements limiting their freedom, what they believe to be most conducive to the interests of the Faith. Nothing must be allowed to interfere with the liberty of the assembled delegates in the exercise of their sacred and twofold functions of electing, on the one hand, their national representatives and of submitting, on the other, their considered recommendations to the incoming Assembly. </p>

<p> Regarding the principle that the Cause must not be allowed to center around any Bahá’í personality, the Guardian wishes to make it clear that it was never intended that well-qualified individual teachers should not receive from local Assemblies every encouragement and facilities to address the public. What the Guardian meant was that the personality and the popularity of such a </p>

<p> — 2 — </p>

<p> speaker should never be allowed to eclipse the authority, or detract from the influence of the body of the elected representatives in every local community. Such an individual should not only seek the approval, advice and assistance of the body that represents the Cause in his locality, but should strive to attribute any credit he my obtain to the collective wisdom and capacity of the assembly under whose jurisdiction ho performs his services. Assemblies and not individuals constitute the bedrock on which the Administration is built. Everything else must be subordinated to, and be made to serve and advance the best interests of these elected custodians and promoters of the Law of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> Assuring you of his deepest Bahá’í love and his best wishes for your family and for yourself. </p>

<p> Yours in His Service </p>

<p> H. Rabbání. </p>

<p> Dear and precious Co-worker: </p>

<p> ............. I trust that the answers to your questions regarding these fundamental administrative issues will resolve the difficulties and problems which have caused you so much pain and anxiety, and will serve to reestablish the relationships existing between the two leading Bahá’í administrative Institutions in that land on a sound and enduring basis. My prayers for your welfare and success as well as for the members of your family will continue to be offered to Bahá’u’lláh, who I am sure will guide and sustain you in your devoted and exemplary services to His Cause. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1933-08-12 relationship of NSA &amp; National Conv </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #79 November  1933  p9010 </p>

<p> The Guardian wishes the N.S.A. to remind, and make it quite clear to, the believers in that land that the supreme body in the United States and Canada, whose privilege and function is to lay down, amend and abrogate the administrative principles of the Faith with the approval of the Guardian, is not the Convention, however representative it may be, but the N.S.A. On the other hand, it is the sacred obligation and the primary function of the National Assembly not to restrict under any circumstances, the freedom of the assembled delegates, whose twofold function is to elect their national representatives and to submit to them any recommendations they may feel inclined to make. The function of the Convention is purely advisory and though the advice it gives is not binding in its effect on those on whom rest the final decision in purely administrative matters, yet, the utmost caution and care should be exercised lest anything should hamper the delegates in the full and free exercise of their function. In discharging this sacred function no influence whatever, no pressure from any quarter, even though it be from the National Assembly, should under any circumstances affect their views or restrict their freedom. The delegates must be wholly independent of any administrative agency, must approach their task with absolute detachment and must concentrate their attention on the most important and pressing issues. </p>

<p> The Guardian believes that the right to elect the chairman and the secretary of the Convention should be vested in the assembled delegates, lest any objection be raised that the members of the outgoing National Assembly are seeking to direct the course of the discussion in a manner that would be conductive to their own personal interests. The National Assembly, however, must at all times vigilantly uphold, defend, justify and enforce the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and By-Laws which are binding on the Convention no less than on themselves. The N.S.A. has the right to lay down, enforce and interpret the National Constitution of the Bahá’ís in that land. It cannot, if it wishes to remain faithful to that Constitution, lay down any regulations, however secondary in character, that would in the least hamper the unrestricted liberty of the delegates to advise and elect those whom they feel best combine the necessary qualifications for membership of so exalted a body. </p>

<p> Non-delegates, however, according to the Guardian’s considered opinion, should not be given the right to intervene directly during the sessions of the Convention. Only through an accredited delegate they should be given indirectly the chance to voice their sentiments and to participate in the deliberations of the Convention. Much confusion and complications must inevitably result in the days to come, if such a restriction be not imposed on a gathering which is primarily intended for the accredited delegates of the Bahá’í communities. Bearing this restriction in mind, it is the duty of the N.S.A. to devise ways and means which would enable them to obtain valuable suggestions, not only from the total number of the elected delegates, but from as large a body of their fellow-workers as is humanly possible. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi has not departed from any established Administrative principle. He feels he has neither curtailed the legislative authority of the N.S.A. nor invested the Convention with undue powers enabling it to rival or supersede those whom it has to elect. What the Guardian is aiming at is to remind the friends, more fully than before, of the two cardinal principles of Bahá’í Administration, namely, the supreme and unchalleng[e]able authority of the N.S.A. in national affairs working within the limits imposed by the Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, and the untrammelled freedom of the Convention delegates to advise, deliberate on the actions, and appoint the successors of their National Assembly. The Guardian is confident that you will elucidate and give the widest publicity to these already established principles, upon which the progress, the unity and welfare of Bahá’í administrative institutions must ultimately depend. — </p>

<p> The utmost care and vigilance should be exercised lest any fresh misunderstandings arise regarding these fundamental issues. The root principle of Bahá’í Administration is unreservedly maintained. No departure from its established tenets is contemplated. The undisputed authority of America’s supreme Bahá’í administrative body has been reaffirmed, while on the other hand, the untrammelled freedom of individual believers and delegates to exercise their functions has been once again reaffirmed and strengthened. On the continuous and harmonious cooperation of the two leading Bahá’í institutions in America, the growth and success of the administration bequeathed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá must ultimately depend. May next year’s Convention witness the triumph of these basic principles. </p>

<p> Regarding the principle that the Cause must not be allowed to center around </p>

<p> Guardian meant was that the personality and popularity of such a speaker should </p>

<p> should not only seek the approval, advice and assistance of the body that </p>

<p> [Persian No. 77] </p>

<p> Concerning your second question, these two letters — the first and the second — refer to the blessed Name of the Ancient Beauty, namely B and H. What is intended by Bahá́’u’lláh is this: that which is latent and enshrined within the inmost reality of these three letters has not been revealed, inasmuch as the world of being still does not possess the capacity and receptiveness to reflect fully the glorious radiance of this divine Revelation. Thus whatever is hidden in the inmost essence of the third letter of His blessed Name will gradually be unfolded before the eyes of all men. </p>

<p> In another sense these letters bear reference to the incalculable sufferings borne by the Blessed Beauty, while the people of the world are acquainted with but a fragment thereof. </p>

<p> “To approach such well-known and important persons is always an extremely delicate matter, since it requires a good deal of wisdom, courage and ability. But those friends who really feel the urge to do so, and possess the necessary qualifications, should cultivate such friendships which, if properly done, can be of an immense benefit to the Cause. In any case, however, the assistance and help of either the local or the National Assembly is not only useful but necessary, if important contacts of this sort are to be fruitful and promising. The principle of consultation, which constitutes one of the basic laws of the Administration, should be applied to all Bahá’í activities which affect the collective interests of the Faith, for it is through cooperation and continued exchange of thoughts and views that the Cause can best safeguard and foster its interests. Individual initiative, personal ability and resourcefulness, through indispensable are, unless supported and enriched by the collective experiences and wisdom of the group, utterly incapable of achieving such a tremendous task.” </p>

<p> Recently the National Spiritual Assembly has received a copy of a letter written by the Guardian, through his secretary, to a believer who wrote him frankly to state certain views about some incidents at the recent Convention. “He has, however, grieved to learn that, despite his repeated references on the necessity of unity and concord among the friends, there have appeared some misunderstandings among them. Such negative forces have always hampered the progress of the Cause and have resulted in utter disappointment. The spirit of partisanship which is but the outcome of individual passion and selfishness is fundamentally opposed to the basic teachings of the Faith. It is for cooperation, motivated by self-sacrifice, that the Bahá’ís stand, and nothing short of the adequate realization of this ideal can redeem the world and insure its safe and speedy progress.” </p>

<p> “Regarding the practice of congregational prayer, the Guardian wishes you to </p>

<p> the excellent statement on their nature, function and purpose published in one of </p>

<p> presentation that he does not find it necessary to restate and enlarge upon the </p>

<p> This institution, established by Bahá’u’lláh, has been described by the Guardian as the foundation of the new World Order. The National Spiritual Assembly understands that it is incumbent upon every believer, unless ill or absent from the city, to attend each of these Feasts. </p>

<p> In a general letter issued to Local Spiritual Assemblies several years ago, it was pointed out that the Guardian instructs that the Nineteen Day Feast be held according to the following program: the first part, entirely spi ritual in character, is devoted to readings from Bahá’í Sacred Writings; the second part consists of general consultation on the affairs of the Cause, at which time the Local Spiritual Assembly reports its activities to the community, asks for suggestions and consultation, and also delivers messages received from the Guardian and the National Assembly. The third part is the material feast and social meeting of all the friends. Only voting — believers are invited to attend the Nineteen Day Feasts. but young people of less than twenty-one years of age. who are declared belie,·ers. especially when members of a Bahá’í family. can also be present. </p>

<p> These meetings may be regarded as the very heart of our Bahá’í comrnunity life. When properly conducted, and attended by a Bahá’í community which fully appreciates their importance. the Nineteen Day Feasts serve to renew and deepen our spirit of faith, increase our capacity for united action. remove misunderstandings and keep us fully informed of all important Bahá’í activities, local. national and international in scope. </p>

<p> *Note by Nancy Bowditch on the Czechoslovakian architects referred to in Shoghi EfFendťs Letters September 10, 1933 and 20 June 1932 </p>

<p> It was during our pilgrimage to the Bahá’í World Center at Haifa, Palestine in 1931, that we met Cestamir and Lubamír Slapéta. As described in the “Mediterranean Diary” (Chapter 8), Lubo and Mírek were twin brothers from Czecho-Slovakia who had been sent to America to study new methods in architecture. We enjoyed many hours together while visiting the various ports of call along the way, and on arriving in Haifa, I told Shoghi Effendi about the brothers. He advised us not to lose contact with them. </p>

<p> When we returned to America, Lubo sent me two designs for a Bahá’í Temple which could be erected in a tropical climate. Through a correspondence spanning 47 years, we have followed their lives-marriages, children, successes, and trials-as Czecho-Slovakia underwent two successive dictatorships! In time we heard from a friend in that country that the brothers had become famous architects, and professors at the University of Prague! </p>

<p> The correspondence continues to this day. They are grandparents, but still are very active and successful in their work. A few years ago, Mírek left his country, becoming a refugee in West Germany Lubo remains in Czechoslovakia. Under the present regime, the Šlapéta brothers cannot meet, but in the future, by the aid of God, Bahá’ís believe that the barriers dividing all people will melt away! </p>

<p> “He was particularly gratified to learn of the suggestions you made for the effective and wide spread of the Menage, and he has directed me to inform you that they all have met with his whole hearted approval. </p>

<p> “Your proposals center around the problem of indirect teaching and such a method of presenting the Message is on the whole more suitable than the direct method in view of the fact chat the masses today are not spiritually minded and resent anything which is presented to them in the name of religion. The tendency today is to disassociate morality from religion, to separate the human from the Divine as if the two were antagonistic and irreconcilable. Social reconstruction and peace are believed to be independent of any help which religion might offer. In other words, religion has been relegated to the background and everything is done in the name of humanity and of goodness. </p>

<p> “It is evident that under such circumstances it is not only difficult, but well nigh impossible, to present and teach the Cause in a direct manner. Religiously minded persons are the exception and not the rule, and it is only with these people that we can speak of the Cause as essentially a religious faith. The masses who are more interested in the social and humanitarian teachings of the Faith should, therefore, be given an opportunity to learn about them and in this way he gradually drawn to study the deeper spiritual principles of the Cause. To start a movement for social peace, like you have suggested is, therefore, very fruitful and may prove of an immense benefit to the Cause. Conversion is not a sudden process. It takes a long time and expresses itself under the pressure of different forces. It is hoped that by following this indirect method of teaching the friends will greatly add to the success. and effectiveness of their efforts. </p>

<p> “Concerning the problem of racial prejudice in the United States and that of class prejudice in England, the Guardian wishes you to know that upon the complete abolition of such prejudices must depend the future success of the Cause. There is nothing more non-Bahá’í than that. The friends should, therefore, exert themselves to the utmost that such evil conceptions may be totally eliminated from the minds of the people.” </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister: </p>

<p> The Guardian wishes me to acknowledge on his behalf the receipt of your welcome letter dated Sept. 9, 1933, as well as the enclosed circular letter you have specially written for distribution among the believers. He hopes that the National Spiritual Assembly will approve of its circulation among the friends and will thereby give you the opportunity of impressing them with the paramount importance of the racial problem in the States. </p>

<p> Your letter will, undoubtedly, touch every thoughtful and sincere reader, as it is not only convincing and powerful, but full of inspiration, of hope and of encouragement. The friends must realize that upon the complete abolition of racial prejudice, if not in the entire American Continent, at least among themselves, must depend the success of their efforts for the spread of the Message. Without total unity of consciousness, they can never be able to attain the goal which the Master and our beloved Guardian have so emphatically and so repeatedly summoned them to attain. May your letter awaken them to their manifold obligations and responsibilities to the Cause, and may it serve to create among them that unity of purpose and of means so essential to the safe and speedy development of the Faith. </p>

<p> with the assurance of his best wishes and of his fervent prayers on your behalf and on behalf of Mr. Oglesby, </p>

<p> “ Perhaps the reason why you have not accomplished so much in the field of teaching is the extent you have looked upon your own weaknesses and inabilities to spread the Message. Bahá’u’lláh and the Master have both urged us repeatedly to disregard our own handicaps and lay our whole reliance upon God. He will come to our aid if we only arise and become an active channel for God’s Grace. </p>

<p> “Do you think it is the teachers who make converts and change human hearts? No, surely not. They are only pure souls who take the first steps and then let the spirit of Bahá’u’lláh move and make use of them. If any one of them should even for a second think, or consider his achievements as due to his own capacities, his work is ended and his fall starts. This is the fact why so many competent souls have, after wonderful services, suddenly found themselves utterly impotent and perhaps thrown aside by the spirit of the Cause as useless souls. The criterion is the extent to which we are ready to have the will of God work through us.” </p>

<p> Mr. Roy C. Wilhelm, </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother: </p>

<p> I need not express his (the Guardian’s) great joy at the news of the continued progress of the Temple work. For you known only too well how much he is eager to see the entire Edifice brought to successful completion. His repeated emphasis of the imperative necessity of insuring, by every means, the speedy termination of this historic enterprise seems to have created a new spirit of self-sacrifice and of initiative in the entire body of the believers throughout the world. It is of the utmost importance that this spirit should be kept alive through continued encouragement. For any slackness in the energy and enthusiasm of the friends, at this critical and most decisive moment, will have severe repercussions on the Cause. The Guardian will fervently pray that during the next few months the ornamentation of the Temple dome may proceed quickly, so as to impress and stimulate the many visitors and strangers who come to attend the Chicago World Fair. He will also offer his special prayers to Bahá’u’lláh on account of all the members of the National Spiritual Assembly that they may be guided and inspired in all their historic endeavors for the consolidation and the progress of the Cause. </p>

<p> The Temple has, indeed, achieved one of its fundamental purposes in the Bahá’í community of today. For although its physical structure still remains to be completed yet, it has drawn to itself the attention of every believer throughout the world, and has become the focal centre of every important Bahá’í activity. In this way it has enabled the Faith to achieve the organic unity of its members, and to cement the bonds of co-operation and love between them. The spiritual significance of the Temple is thus made manifest to every fair-minded observer, and this alone is a sufficient proof of the divine potency with which it is endowed. What institution in our world of today has been able to weld together into one unit so many different communities, and has succeeded in concentrating their entire efforts on so noble and so unique an Edifice? Future historians of the Movement will undoubtedly consider such an event, which today seems to be of such slight significance, as one of the landmarks in the history of the world. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1933-11-03 Keith Ransom-Kehler’s passing </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #80 — January 1934 — pages 3-4 </p>

<p> Mr. Horace Holley </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother: </p>

<p> The Guardian was extremely pleased to receive the photograph of the members of the National Spiritual Assembly taken in one of the outer sections of the Temple, and showing very clearly the strikingly beautiful ornamentation work which, thanks to the generous and continued efforts of our American believers, is proceeding quickly and without any interruption. In a recent cablegram to your Assembly the Guardian has given the promise of one year’s respite, provided the dome ornamentation is successfully completed. It is for the distinguished National representatives of the American believers to exert their utmost, and to display the same enthusiasm and the same energetic and wise control which have thus far characterized both their national and their international services to the Faith, in order that this mighty Edifice may come nearer to its completion. </p>

<p> ... Mrs. Keith Ransom-Kehler’s passing is, indeed, an irretrievable loss which the Bahá’í world has come to suffer at a time when her presence in their midst was so greatly needed, not only because of her inspiring personality, but due to her intelligent, wise and energetic handling of the many and varied problems confronting the followers of the Faith in Persia. For more than one year she toiled and suffered, undismayed by the forces of darkness which so increasingly challenge the devotion and loyalty, and hamper the progress of the work, of our Persian brethren. Nothing was strong enough to sap the vitality of her faith and neither the opposition of the Government, nor the slackness and inefficiency of those with whom she had to work, could possibly discourage and dishearten her. Her faith was deep, her energy inexhaustible. And she was, indeed, fully repaid for all that she did, whether in connection with the teaching of the Message, or in regard to the consolidation of the nascent administrative institutions of the Cause in the very land of its birth. </p>

<p> The Guardian, fully aware of the noble gifts of her heart and mind, has given her not only the station of a martyr but that of a Hand of the Cause of God. In two telegrams addressed to the Ṭihrán and Iṣfahán Assemblies he has requested our Persian friends to fix her final resting place in the vicinity of Sulṭánu’sh — Shuhada’s grave in Iṣfahán. </p>

<p> He has also, through the following cablegram, informed your National Assembly of his intention to do so: “Instructed Iṣfahán Assembly inter Keith vicinity grave Sulṭánu’sh-Shuhada surnamed by Bahá’u’lláh ‘King of Martyrs.’” His instructions on this point have been immediately carried out by the Iṣfahán Assembly and it is, therefore, very encouraging to learn that our beloved Keith has been accorded such a befitting restingplace. For as you may know, Sulṭánu’sh — Shuhada, to whom Bahá’u’lláh gave the title of the “King of Martyrs” as a result of the glorious martyrdom he suffered for the Cause, was one of the most eminent and ardent followers of the Faith, not only in Iṣfahán but in the whole of Persia. His brother, surnamed by Bahá’u’lláh the “Beloved of Martyrs” was also a very distinguished and devoted Bahá’u’lláh, who gave up his life for the sake of the Cause. So, as you see, the interment of Keith in the vicinity of the grave of such an outstanding Persian believer is very befitting, and will pass down through the ages as the symbol of the unity of the East and West. </p>

<p> In another cablegram to your Assembly dated November 2, 1933, which runs as follows: “Holy Land’s growing and increasingly appreciative inhabitants long witness model, however small, majestic Temple,” he has requested you to send him, without any delay and in case it is not too expensive, a small model of the Temple to be placed either in the International Bahá’í Archives on Mt. Carmel, or in any other place, where the many and increasingly appreciative visitors who come to the Shrines can be given a chance to visualize the glory and grandeur of the Edifice which your untiring hands have so well raised. </p>

<p> In closing please extend our Guardian’s loving greetings and best wishes to all the members of the National Assembly. His prayers on their behalf will be continually offered to Bahá’u’lláh, that He may impart to them the wisdom, guidance and faith they need for the complete discharge of their manifold duties to the Cause. </p>

<p> The wide and deep interest which this glorious Edifice has created in all circles is, indeed, the full realization of the promises of our beloved Master concerning the future glory of the Temple. The latter, as a matter of fact, has become the most effective medium through which the friends can spread the Teachings. Its physical beauty, which combines majesty with grace, its slow, though continued and uninterrupted construction, despite the severe and unprecedented economic crisis in which the entire world is deeply plunged, and above all the spirit of fellowship, of goodwill and of co-operation between peoples of various races and cultural backgrounds which it has been able to create, all these combined cannot but impress the masses of visitors who daily throng its doors with the beauty, power and effectiveness of this mighty Cause of God. </p>

<p> Dear and Prized Co-worker: </p>

<p> The situation in Persia is growing more dangerous, more confused and perplexing every day. Bahá’í literature is banned, confiscated and burned. Bahá’í marriage certificates are denied recognition by the civil authorities and the status of those who are married among the believers is fraught with incalculable difficulties and dangers. The printing of Bahá’í news letters, magazines and calendars is tacitly forbidden and constantly interfered with. Intolerable restrictions are being increasingly imposed on Bahá’í gatherings, celebrations, teaching activities, and inter-assembly communications. With the passing of Keith, that indefatigable, brilliant and whole consecrated international champion of the Cause, the Persian believers may be entering upon a period of systematic persecution reminiscent of the sufferings of a by-gone day. I urge your Assembly to obtain the fullest and up-to-date information from the Ṭihrán Assembly and to exert the utmost pressure on the Persian Minister at Washington. </p>

<p> ... . Regarding the situation in Persia, Shoghi Effendi wishes the N.S.A. to </p>

<p> Corinne True: Faithful Handmaid of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Nathan Rutstein, p197 </p>

<p> .......... Concerning what Mr. Remey and other believers, whether Americans or otherwise, have told the friends about Melchizedek, and as to their references in regard to the leading religions of the world, and to the symbolism involved in the numerical number of the Temple doors, the Guardian wishes to restate and to reemphasize the general principle that in all such matters of a specific character the friends should be careful not to accept anything as valid and authentic unless it is based on, and corroborated by, a Tablet bearing the signature of the Master. Oral reports and statements cannot be relied upon, since they lead to the same confusions and difficulties into which the followers of former Dispensations have been and are still entangled. It is now, when the Faith is still in its infancy, that extreme caution should be exercised in the apparently unimportant matters. Otherwise, the purity of the Teachings will be beclouded, and the unity of the Cause greatly jeopardized. To protect the Faith from these forms of traditionalism is the duty of the responsible administrators of the Cause, and nothing short of their wisdom, caution and tact in their handling of such delicate matters, can insure the purity and the effectiveness of the Teachings. </p>

<p> The Guardian was greatly rejoiced to learn that your historic trip to Adrianople has come to a successful end, and that you are once more back in Sofia and are resuming with the help of Miss Root, your important teaching activities. Your message of Nov. 9th was, indeed, very inspiring and refreshing after a long period of silence during which you were slowly and carefully laying down the foundations for the future development of the Cause in that portion of the Balkans which the Almighty had chosen to be blessed by the presence of Bahá’u’iláh. Your services there will, no doubt bear their fruits in a not distant future, provided you maintain with those few souls you have been able to awaken, continued correspondence. Their interest in the Message, however deep it may have been, cannot last unless it is kept alive by means of direct contact if possible, and if not through writing. </p>

<p> [By Shoghi Effendi] </p>

<p> I wish to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the efforts you have exerted in the course of your splendid and historic visit to Adrianople, ‘The Land of Mystery’. Despite the increasing difficulties which beset you, notwithstanding ill-health and cares and anxieties which such pioneer work in strange surroundings entails, you have nobly persevered, loyally laboured, and splendidly achieved a work of which future generations will be justly proud. I am so glad to know that precious Martha will collaborate with you for one month in Sofia. I will continue to pray for you both. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1933-11-18 status, rights and prerogatives of Convention </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #81 — February 1934 — page 3 </p>

<p> Concerning the status, rights and prerogatives of the Annual Bahá’í </p>

<p> Convention, the Guardian wishes to make it quite clear to all the believers that </p>

<p> this annual meeting of the delegates is by no means a continuous consultative body </p>

<p> all through the year; that its twofold function of electing the body of the </p>

<p> National Spiritual Assembly, and of offering any constructive suggestions in </p>

<p> regard to the general administration of the Cause is limited to a definite period; </p>

<p> and that consequently the opinion current among some of the believers that the </p>

<p> delegates are to serve as a consultative body throughout the year is at variance </p>

<p> with the fundamental, though as yet unspecified, principles underlying the </p>

<p> Administration. Shoghi Effendi firmly believes that consultation must be </p>

<p> maintained between the N.S.A. and the entire body of the believers, and that such </p>

<p> consultation, while the Convention is not in session, can best be maintained </p>

<p> through the agency of the local Assemblies, one of whose essential functions is to </p>

<p> act as intermediaries between the local communities and their national </p>

<p> representatives. The main purpose of the Nineteen Day Feasts is to enable </p>

<p> individual believers to offer any suggestion to the local assembly which in its </p>

<p> turn will pass it to the N.S.A. The local Assembly is, therefore, the proper </p>

<p> medium through which local Bahá’í communities can communicate with the body of the </p>

<p> national representatives. The Convention should be regarded as a temporary </p>

<p> gathering, having certain specific functions to perform, during a limited period </p>

<p> of time. Its status is thus limited in time to the Convention sessions, the </p>

<p> function of consultation at all other times being vested in the entire body of the </p>

<p> believers through the local Spiritual Assemblies. — To the National Spiritual </p>

<p> Assembly, November 18, 1933. </p>

<p> Dear and precious co-workers: </p>

<p> I wish to affirm without the least hesitation or ambiguity, that the annual </p>

<p> convention is not to be regarded as a body entitled to exercise functions similar </p>

<p> to those which an ordinary parliament possesses under a democratic form of </p>

<p> government. The administrative order which lies embedded in the Teaching of </p>

<p> Bahá’u’lláh, and which the American believers have championed and are now </p>

<p> establishing, should, under no circumstances, be identified with the principles </p>

<p> underlying present-day democracies. Nor is it identical with any purely </p>

<p> aristocratic or autocratic form of government. The objectionable features inherent </p>

<p> in each of these political systems are entirely avoided. It blends, as no system </p>

<p> of human polity has as yet achieved, those salutary truths and beneficial elements </p>

<p> which constitute the valuable contributions which each of these forms of </p>

<p> government have made to society in the past. Consultation, frank and unfettered, </p>

<p> is the bedrock of this unique order. Authority is concentrated in the hands of the </p>

<p> elected members of the National Assembly. Power and initiative are primarily </p>

<p> vested in the entire body of the believers acting through their local </p>

<p> representatives. To generate those forces which must give birth to the body of </p>

<p> their national administrators, and to confer, freely and fully and at fixed </p>

<p> intervals, with both the incoming and outgoing national Assemblies are the twofold </p>

<p> functions, the supreme responsibility and sole prerogative of the delegates </p>

<p> assembled in Convention. Nothing short of close and constant interaction between </p>

<p> these various organs of Bahá’í administration can enable it to fulfill its high </p>

<p> destiny. — To the National Spiritual Assembly, November 18, 1933. (The Guardian’s </p>

<p> I need not tell you how grateful Shoghi Effendi is to the entire body of our American brethren, and particularly to those who, like yourself, have had such a notable share in maintaining the uninterrupted construction of the Bahá’í Temple at Wilmette. Their spirit of cooperation &amp; of self-sacrifice, and their strong &amp; broad vision of the imperative needs &amp; requirements of this struggling Faith of God in these days of unprecedented confusion in every department of life, have been responsible for the continued progress of the Temple work. Surely, in such a manifestation of exemplary loyalty &amp; devotion to the Cause must inevitably be found the main key to the success which has attended the many &amp; varied activities of our American believers. The laying of the corner-stone of this unique Edifice by the hands of the Master is itself full of significance, as it symbolizes the truth that the friends in America have been invested with that spiritual primacy which the early followers of the Faith in Persia did so fully possess. To faithfully keep this trust and to fully realize its special significance is the duty of every loyal &amp; responsible believer. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi was grieved beyond words to learn of the severe illness of our precious Bahá’í co-worker &amp; friend, Mr. Philip Sprague. His prayers on his behalf and on behalf of you all will continue to be offered to Bahá’u’lláh that He may remove all obstacles standing in your path, &amp; that He may impart to you the guidance, help &amp; blessing you need for the development &amp; success of your work for the Cause. </p>

<p> Quoted in Never be Afraid to Dare, Jasion, p191-2 </p>

<p> Your messages dated November 16th and 22nd, 1933, have filled our Guardian’s heart with inexpressible joy, and he wishes me to thank each one of your group for the remarkable devotion, zeal and enthusiasm with which you are spreading the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh in your country. It is the conviction that nothing short of the spread and the application of the divine and salutary teachings which lie embedded in the Bahá’í Message can effectively rescue your country and the world at large, which should spur you on to investigate and whole-heartedly embrace the truth of this Revelation, and to rally yourselves under its glorious banner. The Bahá’í Faith gives you not only a definite plan of world reconstruction, but provides you at the same time with the necessary impetus and means whereby you can carry it into full and fruitful action. In it you will find a goal which is definite, namely the unification of mankind in all its aspects and forms. It asserts that political and economic unity cannot be established on a sound basis without the necessary and indispensable unification in the field of religion. The blending of hearts is the foundation-stone of the Bahá’í social order. It is at once its stronghold and its inherent motivating force. Through it no obstacle can withstand the triumph of the constructive forces of the world. And by its means national and racial prejudices of all sorts melt away and make, thereby, the establishment of an international order not a dream but a living reality. </p>

<p> It is this fundamental truth, that the basis of world unity is essentially spiritual, that makes the strength of the Bahá’í Faith. And it is because our statesmen and leaders have failed to accept such a truth that they find themselves so helpless in the face of the dark forces that are so vehemently assailing the world. </p>

<p> It is Shoghi Effendi’s hope that through the pioneering efforts of Miss Root and of Miss Jack your group will develop both in number and in spiritual fervour, and that you will not merely content yourselves with the study of the Teachings but will arise to play your part in their quick and effective dissemination throughout your country. </p>

<p> [postscript by Shoghi Effendi] </p>

<p> Dear co-workers: </p>

<p> I was so pleased and gratified to learn that the work in which you are engaged is in full swing and that the prospects are bright and promising. A powerful and efficiently functioning Local Spiritual Assembly, permanently established and truly united, is imperative, and will no doubt act as a magnet that will draw the confirmations of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> “As to the important issue you have raised in this connection regarding the </p>

<p> “It would be wonderful, if the Cause should enter their rank, and give its members a new life and spirit. The Faith of Bahá’u’lláh is not only for the highly civilized people, even though the benefit these can obtain we cannot truly appreciatee at this early stage of its development. To the backward races the Cause should mean even more, for through it they shall obtain true social and intellectual equality with those who are at present their rulers and superiors-a thing they can obtain with difficulty through ordinary channels of legal enactments and ordinary intellectual training. It is only through the Messge of Bahá’u’llaah that the different races shall come to consider one another as true brethren and co-workers in the Faith of God. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #81 — February 1934 — page 2 </p>

<p> In a letter to the Chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly, dated </p>

<p class='signature noid'> January 17, 1934, the Guardian writes through his Secretary H. Rabbání: </p>

<p> “In reply to the N.S.A.’s telegram expressing the hope of the American </p>

<p> believers of proceeding with the ornamentation of the clerestory section of the </p>

<p> Temple, Shoghi Effendi has sent the following cable and has given his whole — </p>

<p> hearted approval to this new step which the friends have been prompted to take and </p>

<p> which fully testifies to their exemplary resourcefulness and indomitable will in </p>

<p> upholding the Cause of the Temple: (Cable as quoted above). </p>

<p> “The Guardian’s motive in giving the believers the promise of one year’s </p>

<p> complete respite was to alleviate the financial burden which had for so long been </p>

<p> weighing on their shoulders. His intention, however, was by no means to check the </p>

<p> Temple should they find it possible to do so. And it is really gratifying to </p>

<p> witness that the promise instead of retarding, however temporarily, the </p>

<p> The Guardian has directed me to inform you of the receipt of your much-appreciated letter of Dec. 29th, and to express his heartfelt thanks for your painstaking efforts in connection with the translation of Princess de Broglies article on the Cause. Your rendering is, indeed, very faithful and fully expressive of the beauty &amp; power of the original.

At his request one of our German believers is also writing an article, the German text of which will be published in the year book, gnd thus will give an opportunity to thenon-English-speaking Bahá’ís to better acquaint themselves with the contents of the Biennial. </p>

<p> Dear &amp; precious co-worker: </p>

<p> I was delighted to read Marys article for the forthcoming issue of the Bahá’í World — a welcome evidence of her initial international activities &amp; services for which I cherish the brightest hopes. I have not yet answered her letter to me preferring to wait until I receive a copy of her play the perusal of which will no doubt deeply interest me &amp; the early publication of which the Reviewing Committee I trust will sanction. I am praying ardently for the speedy &amp; complete realization of the Master’s hopes in, &amp; promises to you, &amp; wish you to take the utmost care of your precious health.

<p> Shoghi Effendi has just received your letter of January 30th and he is so happy to learn that you have safely arrived at the Hague, and that you are resuming your teaching activities with the same enthusiasm as that which signalized your first teaching trip to that country.26 </p>

<p> It will certainly encourage you to learn that Mr. Grosfeld, one of our active and capable Dutch Baháïs who lived formerly in Java is leaving very soon for Holland and is planning to settle there and to teach actively the Cause. He was converted to the Faith a few years ago through the care of one of our Egyptian Bahá’ís. He was on a visit to Cairo when he met that friend, and was so much impressed by the Teachings that he accepted them at once. Ever since he has been living in the East Indies and only a few months ago he left that country for a visit around the world. He has been to China, Japan, and has visited the friends in various parts of the States. He speaks many languages, and is eager to teach the Cause. On his way to Holland, the Guardian has requested him to visit the believers in Syria, Turkey, Bulgaria, Austria and Germany.28 May his presence and his close cooperation with you pave the way for the effective spread of the Teachings. With the assurance of his prayers on your behalf and on behalf of those to whom you have referred in your letter. </p>

<p> Letter to Mr. Ioas, chairman of the Teaching Committee </p>

<p> “Concerning the abolition of the institution of paid national teachers, the Guardian wishes to reaffirm his former statements on this matter, and to stress once more that great care be taken to avoid the difficulties and the misunderstandings which in former days had caused so much trouble among the friends. The main point to be emphasized in this connection is that of making the teachings of the Cause not the work of a limited group but the chief duty and responsibility of every Bahá’í. This is why no salaried teachers should any longer exist. But occasionally to defray the expenses of a teaching trip of a certain Bahá’í, particularly when it is done spontaneously, can cause no harm to the Cause. Such an action, provided it is done with care and only when circumstances make it necessary, constitutes no violation of the principle already referred to. The danger in all activities of this nature is to give the impression that the teaching of the Cause is an institution, depending on the support of paid teachers. Those who willingly and with utmost detachment arise to promote the Cause should, undoubtedly, be helped in every way. But they have no claim. whatever on the financial help which some friends may freely choose to extend to them.” </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi feels it to be inadvisable that the Temple Foundation Hall be </p>

<p> used for dramatic performances. He believes that only Bahá’í meetings, and </p>

<p> business sessions of the Convention, can be held in it until such time as the </p>

<p> erection of a special edifice for this purpose has been undertaken by the American </p>

<p> friends.... </p>

<p> Concerning the best method of presenting the Master’s Will to the newcomers, </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi is of the opinion that the N.S.A. should first make some suitable </p>

<p> extracts from the testament, and to send these to all the local Assemblies for </p>

<p> their use, so that there may be full unity in circulating the provisions of the </p>

<p> Will among the new believers. The problem of choosing such excerpts is left </p>

<p> entirely to the discretion of the N.S.A. The main thing, as it appears to the </p>

<p> Guardian, is that the full station of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá be </p>

<p> clearly explained, and that the origin, nature and working of the Administrative </p>

<p> Order of the Faith be clearly stated. The full implications of such a recognition </p>

<p> are evidently beyond the comprehension of any new believer. Such a knowledge can </p>

<p> be acquired gradually, and only when the essentials of the Faith have been clearly </p>

<p> recognized and adequately understood. </p>

<p> In regard to the activities of Aḥmad Sohrab, Shoghi Effendi has already </p>

<p> stated that such attacks, however perfidious, do not justify the friends replying </p>

<p> or taking any direct action against them. The attitude of the N.S.A. should be to </p>

<p> ignore them entirely. For any undue emphasis on attacks made upon the Cause by </p>

<p> Aḥmad and his supporters would make them feel that they constitute a real </p>

<p> challenge to the Cause and a menace to its institutions. Should these attacks </p>

<p> continue and acquire a serious importance the Guardian will surely advise the </p>

<p> N.S.A. to take definite and decisive action. </p>

<p> As regards the general conditions of the future in America, Shoghi Effendi </p>

<p> feels that the existing distress will not be rapidly alleviated. There is no </p>

<p> danger, however, of any great crisis in the immediate future. Conditions are </p>

<p> certainly bad, and dissatisfaction is undoubtedly universal, but the hour of </p>

<p> universal relief has not yet approached. The friends need not have any grave </p>

<p> anxiety as to the immediate developments of the present situation. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May I also draw your attention to the fact that the Báb’s photograph which </p>

<p> appeared in Nicola’s book “Siyyid ‘Alí Muḥammad di le Báb” many years ago is not </p>

<p> authentic, although it presents great similarity to the original drawings of the </p>

<p> Báb’s portrait. </p>

<p> In closing I must express the Guardian’s deep sense of admiration for the </p>

<p> stupendous sacrifices which the American followers of the Faith have gladly and </p>

<p> spontaneously and with such an unremitting zeal consented to undergo in order to </p>

<p> carry out the oft-repeated wishes of the Master concerning the erection of the </p>

<p> Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár in America. The early signs of that great spiritual renaissance </p>

<p> which the completion of this sacred edifice must inevitably usher in are already </p>

<p> manifesting themselves in the growing unity and solidarity with which the new-born </p>

<p> Administrative Order of the Cause is functioning and developing in no less than </p>

<p> forty countries of the world. Surely the credit for such a truly remarkable </p>

<p> development in the administrative field of the Cause must be primarily attributed </p>

<p> to the members of the American Bahá’í community and particularly to those who so </p>

<p> fittingly represent them in the National Assembly. May Bahá’u’lláh continue to </p>

<p> inspire you with His wisdom and guidance, that through your collective endeavors </p>

<p> the Cause may progress and its institutions may increase and its unity, both </p>

<p> doctrinal and administrative, be effectively safeguarded. (signed) H. Rabbání. </p>

<p> (Postscript to the foregoing letter.) </p>

<p> The completion of the Done, the mighty emblem of our invincible Faith, marks </p>

<p> a notable landmark in the rise and establishment of the World Order of </p>

<p> Bahá’u’lláh. The Bahá’í world feels greatly indebted to the American believers for </p>

<p> so striking a testimony of the unconquerable spirit of the Cause in these days of </p>

<p> unprecedented stress and turmoil. They who by their self-sacrifice have crowned </p>

<p> this noble and historic Edifice deserve the praise and are indeed the object of </p>

<p> in my communication (see article entitled “Explanation of Passages in ‘America and </p>

<p> of these teachers, since these were sent to the United States in order to remedy </p>

<p> the situation which <u>Kh</u>ayru’lláh himself had created through his treacherous </p>

<p> page 14 in “America and the Most Great Peace” makes that point indubitably clear. </p>

<p> As to the five teachers referred to in that epistle of the Guardian, there must have been a typographical error, and instead of five we should, therefore, read only four. (signed) H. Rabbání. </p>

It greatly encouraged me. Unfortunately there are strong and influential interests that are seeking to obstruct the plan.

More difficult and dangerous for our plan however are those who definitely seek to frustrate the efforts of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in anything that they may undertake. We believe that these people were back of the case brought against us by the Domets [Dumits], for example, and it was for that reason that we felt justified in our endeavour to have it withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the courts and submitted to Your Excellency’s personal consideration...With kind regards and renewed expression of my warm appreciation of Your Excellency’s sympathy and support... </p>

<p> Quoted in Never be Afraid to Dare, Jasion, p193 </p>

<p> Your letters of April 2nd, 24th and May 21st have been duly received, and their contents have been given careful consideration by the Guardian. The gratifying news of the projected formation of a spiritual assembly in Sofia pleased him particularly, and he trusts that under your guidance and attention this assembly will function with effectiveness and vigour. In view of this new and historic step you have moved to take, Shoghi Effendi feels that your stay in the capital is indispensable, although he approves of your leaving occasionally that centre for a teaching trip in the near surroundings. He does not think it necessary that you should start studying the language of the country, as this will take too much of your time and energy. You may, however, devote your spare time to that purpose, but never should you do so at the expense of your teaching work. </p>

<p> [Postscript by Shoghi Effendi] </p>

<p> Your patient and strenuous labours in the service of so great a cause and in circumstances that are truly most difficult and trying have endeared you to us all and deserve to rank as high as the great achievements that have signalized the establishment of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’iláh. You should be intensely happy, and profoundly grateful for having rendered such distinguished and never-to-be-forgotten services to the Sacred Threshold. </p>

<p> “ ... The Guardian wishes me to again affirm his view that the authority of the N. S.

<p> (In the Guardian’s hand) “I wish to reaffirm in clear and categorical </p>

<p> As to your question concerning reincarnation: The Bahá’í view of the life after death can in no way be reconciled with certain Indian and Sufi doctrines which teach that the human soul can pass from one body to another. This doctrine, known as metempsychosis, is not only too materialistic in its view, but is purely imaginary and fatalistic. Bahá’u’lláh teaches that after its separation from the body, the human soul begins to lead a new life, of which we can have no definite knowledge, in the same way as the child in the embryo cannot visualize the type of life it is destined to lead in this world. </p>

<p> Quoted in Never be Afraid to Dare, Jasion, p193-4 </p>

<p> The Guardian is deeply gratified to learn from your letter of September 5th of the happy news of the successful formation of the Sofia spiritual assembly. He wishes me to hasten in offering to you his heartfelt congratulations and his grateful thanks for this unique and never-to-be-forgotten service which you have been able to render the Faith in Bulgaria. Your pioneering and sustained endeavours for the establishment of the Cause in that country have, undoubtedly, been amply rewarded. You should, therefore, feel happy, and remain assured that the foundations your able hands have so carefully and so patiently laid down will be further consolidated through the united and combined efforts of our Bulgarian friends, and that upon them the edifice of the cause will be gradually raised and firmly established in their country. </p>

<p> As to your return to Sofia, the Guardian leaves it entirely to your discretion. If you feel that the believers in Sofia can conduct their own affairs, and that their assembly is sufficiently strong and united to manage its own work, you need not return, at least for the present, to Bulgaria, and may preferably travel for a few months in Austria where the believers will surely be glad to have you with them, and will, undoubtedly, extend to you every assistance they can for rendering your stay as successful as possible. In any case, the Guardian strongly urges you to keep in close and constant touch with Sofia, and to encourage and guide the believers in spreading the Message, and in extending the scope and in consolidating the foundations of their assembly. </p>

<p> [postscript by Shoghi Effendi] </p>

<p> I leave it entirely to your discretion as to whether you should extend your stay in Bulgaria or initiate a new chapter of your historic work in some other country in Europe. I have the utmost confidence in your judgement, your loyalty and disinterested service to the Cause of God. Wherever you labour, with whosoever you collaborate and whatever the nature of your activity my prayers will ever accompany you and my thoughts will continue to be with you. I feel truly proud of the constancy and courage that distinguish your pioneer service. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #89 January 1935 p1 </p>

<p> [To the Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly] </p>

<p> “With reference to the first of the two questions raised by the San Francisco Spiritual Assembly in connection with ‘The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh, he wishes me to explain that although ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s station is not that of a Manifestation of God, nevertheless supplications may be addressed to Him. It is essential, however, that every believer should realize that while doing so he is directing his thoughts towards the Master as an intermediary between him and the Manifestation, and not as the Source of Divine Revelation and spiritual guidance. Provided this distinction is clearly established there can be no harm or objection in addressing prayers to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>

<p> As to the meaning of the quotation, ‘My fears are for Him Who will be sent down unto you after Me’, this refers to the Manifestation Who is to come after a thousand or more years, Who like all previous Messengers of God will be subjected to persecutions, but will eventually triumph over them. For men of ill-will have been and will always continue to be in this world, unless mankind reaches a state of complete and absolute perfection-a condition which is not only improbable but actually impossible to attain. The fundamental difference, however, between this Dispensation and all previous ones is this, that in this Revelation the possibility of permanent schism between the followers of the Prophet has been prevented through the direct and explicit instructions providing for the necessary instruments designed to maintain the organic unity of the body of the faithful. </p>

<p> In regard to the use of ringstones and burial stones, the Guardian leaves this matter at present entirely to the discretion of the believers, and has no objection if your Assembly provides facilities for their purchase by the friends. When the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is published the necessary instructions will be given regarding this matter. </p>

<p> In this connection he wishes me to inform you that at his repeated directions the National Assemblies of Egypt, ‘Iráq and Persia are adopting the exact text of your Assembly’s Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, as well as the local By-Laws, and are taking the necessary steps for incorporating their Assemblies as duly recognized bodies empowered to administer the national and local affairs of the Faith in their respective countries. The Indian N. S. A., as well as the Bombay Spiritual Assembly, have already set the example in this respect, both in the matter of incorporation, and in the adoption of the text of the constitutions of the American Bahá’í Assemblies. </p>

<p> Concerning the union of the two Magazines (THE BAHÁ’i MAGAZINE and the WORLD UNITY MAGAZINE) the Guardian hopes that the N. S. A. will proceed quickly in this matter. He fully approves the action which you contemplate, and any details in this connection he leaves entirely to your discretion. </p>

<p> In regard to the question submitted to your Assembly by the Bahá’í group at Maui, Hawaii, concerning the passage on page 88 of the book ‘Bahá’í Administration,’ the Guardian wishes me to inform you that the festivals of the Declaration of the Báb and the birthday of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá referred to in that passage as having been celebrated on the twenty-second of November, 1925, by the Bahá’ís of the Orient, are based on the lunar calendar. For this reason the date of the celebration is not fixed, but shifts every year. Eventually, as the Master has explicitly stated, a uniform system will have to be established by the International House of Justice. </p>

<p> Concerning the West Englewood Memorial, Shoghi Effendi’s idea has always been that this memorial should be in the form of a monument and not of a building. </p>

<p> He also wishes me to express his approval of your statement in the November issue of the BAHÁ’i NEWS to the effect of creating within the Assemblies and individual believers a more posItIve and active attitude towards the Administration. The need for positive action seems, indeed, to be one of the most urgent needs of the Cause at present. </p>

<p> In closing may I convey to you and to the American community of the believers as well the Guardian’s abiding appreciation and gratitude for the striking manner in which the American friends, under the leadership of your Assembly, have each and all arisen to meet the emergency which the lack of sufficient funds had created in connection with the work of the Temple. This constitutes, indeed, an added victory in the series of triumphs which the American believers have, ever since the ascension of the Master, been winning in the field of service to the Faith. Their collective, united and sustained labors in this connection are surely bound to hasten the realization of the Master’s promises concerning the ultimate triumph of the Cause throughout the American continent. ~ray this sublime vision disclosed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá intensify their zeal and stimulate their ardor in bringing their sacred and mighty task to a speedy consummation. </p>

<p> The Guardian wishes me also to extend his heart-felt condolences and loving sympathy to you and to all the bereaved members of the community of the American friends for the new loss they have sustained in the passing away of their indefatigable and pioneer fellow-believer Dr. Susan Moody. The work she had so successfully initiated in Persia, particularly in connection with the founding and development of the Tarbíyát School in Ṭihrán is an abiding monument to her memory, and constitutes a fresh and indissoluble link which will unite forever the believers in East and West in their triumphs as well as sufferings in the path of service to our beloved Faith. </p>

<p> Dearly beloved co-workers: </p>

<p> It would be impossible for me to refrain from adding these words in person as a token of my increasing admiration for the recent, the marvelous accomplishments of the American believers. Despite the perils and uncertainties with which their country is now beset, and in the face of the financial reverses they have suffered and the unfortunate controversies that have perplexed and agitated them, they have forged ahead and are fast approaching the termination of the first stage in the ornamentation of their consecrate Edifice. Undaunted by the magnitude of this colossal enterprise, undismayed by the smallness of their numbers, the scantiness of their resources and the scorn of their enemies, they have carried triumphantly the banner of Bahá’u’lláh and brought to a successful issue the first stage in the formative period of His Faith. At this stage of their development they can neither halt nor hesitate. Whatever the future may have in store for them, they will, I feel more than ever confident, allow nothing whatsoever to dim their vision or to deflect them from their high purpose. </p>

<p> Dear Lady Blomfield, </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi has read your letter  ... . with reference to your question concerning capital punishment, Bahá’u’lláh in the “Kitáb-i-Aqdas” revealed the following (A rough rendering of the passage in question is being given) “If a man purposely kills a man, kill him. Hold to the laws of God with all your strength and forsake the laws of fools. But if you concemn such a man to perpetual imprisonment, this is permitted you according to the Book. Verily God gives judgment in whatever He desires.” Thus, according to the explicit tex of the Aqdas, capital punishment is permitted, but also an alternative has been definitely provided whereby the rigours of such a condemnation can be seriously mitigated. Bahá’u’lláh has given us choice, and has therefore left us free to use our own discretion with certain limitations imposed by his law. </p>

<p> “With reference to your question whether the figures of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh should be made to appear as characters in dramatic works written by the believers, Shoghi Effendi’s opinion is that such an· attempt to dramatize the Manifestations would be highly disrespectful, and hence should be avoided by the friends, even in the case of the Master. Besides it would be practically impossible to carry out such a plan faithfully, and in a dignified and befitting manner. </p>

<p> “In regard to your question concerning the nature and character of Bahá’í marriage. As you have rightly stated, such a marriage is conditioned upon the full approval of all four parents. Also your statement to the effect that the principle of the oneness of mankind prevents any true Bahá’í from regarding race itself as a bar to union is in complete accord with the Teachings of the Faith on this point. For both Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá never disapproved of the idea of inter-racial marriage, nor discouraged it. The Bahá’í Teachings, indeed, by their very nature transcend all limitations imposed by race, and as such can and should never be identified with any particular school of racial philosophy.” </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #93 July 1935 p1-2 </p>

<p> “Concerning membership in non-Bahá’í religious associations. The Guardian wishes to re-emphasize the general principle already laid down in his communications to your Assembly and also to the individual believers that no Bahá’í who wishes to be a wholehearted and sincere upholder of the distinguishing principles of the Cause can accept full membership in any non-Bahá’í ecclesiastical organization. For such an act would necessarily imply only a partial acceptance of the Teachings and laws of the Faith, and an incomplete recognition of its independent status, and would thus be tantamount to an act of disloyalty to the verities it enshrines. For it is only too obvious that in most of its fundamental assumptions the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh is completely at variance with outworn creeds, ceremonies and institutions. To be a Bahá’í and at the same time accept membership in another religious body is simply an act of contradiction that no sincere and logically-minded person can possibly accept. To follow Bahá’u’lláh does not mean accepting some of His teachings and rejecting the rest. Allegiance to His Cause must be uncompromising and whole-hearted. During the days of the Master the Cause was still in a stage that made such an open and sharp dissociation between it and other religious organizations, and particularly the Muslim Faith, not only inadvisable but practically impossible to establish. But since His passing events throughout the Bahá’í world, and particularly in Egypt where the Muslim religious courts have formally testified to the independent character of the Faith, have developed to a point that have made such an assertion of the independence of the Cause not only highly desirable but absolutely essential.” </p>

<p> There is one more point to which the Guardian wishes to draw again your Assembly’s attention. It is the question of teaching, and its paramount importance in these days of rapid administrative development of the Cause in America. He has already, through Miss Edna True, conveyed this same message to your Assembly, and is gratified to witness the wide and deep response it has awakened among the friends. He hopes and prays that whatever means the N. S. A. in collaboration with the National Teaching Committee may adopt for the furtherance of this most vital objective may meet with complete success. </p>

<p> Compiled by Research Department of the Universal House of Justice. </p>

<p> Published in Bahá’í Studies Review 4:1 </p>

<p> The Guardian has read with care and interest your views regarding conditions at the Esslingen Summer School. Miss...has already given him quite a realistic description of the Bahá’í Home. He is surely of the opinion that if the Summer School at Esslingen is to develop into an important and somewhat international Bahá’í centre in Europe it must be kept from reflecting too strongly some of the influences and tendencies that characterize the Germany of today. The atmosphere at the Bahá’í Home must be primarily Bahá’í, though it must retain some of its German character. The Cause does not wish to suppress national characteristics. It abhors too much uniformity, and stands for the principle of unity in diversity, which principle we believe can alone provide a solution for the unification of mankind. </p>

<p> Now with regard to the Bahá’í Home and to the alterations it calls for. The Guardian thinks that any suggestion in this connection should preferably be made by one of the German members of the National Spiritual Assembly so as to avoid giving the impression that there is any national or racial prejudice behind it. The situation, as you rightly suggest, may become serious if not carefully studied and remedied at once. But there is every hope of reaching a solution in this matter. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #95 October 1935 p2 </p>

<p> Regarding the statement made by the Guardian in his letter to Mr. Willard Hatch concerning the fact that believers can serve both as teachers and administrators. Shoghi Effendi would approve your Assembly making this fact known to all the friends. For although it is essential for the believers to maintain always a clear distinction between teaching and administrative duties and functions, yet they should be careful not to be led to think that these two types of Bahá’í activities are mutually exclusive in their nature, and as such cannot be exercised by one and the same person. As a matter of fact. the friends should be encouraged to serve in both the teaching and the administrative fields of Bahá’í service. But as there are always some who are more specially gifted along one of these two lines of activity it would seem more desirable that they should concentrate their efforts in acquiring the full training for that type of work for which they are best suited by nature. Such a specialization has the advantage of saving time, and of leading to greater efficiency, particularly at this early stage of our development. The great danger, however, lies in that by so doing the friends may tend to develop a sort of class consciousness which is fundamentally contrary to both the spirit and actual teaching’s of the Faith. It is precisely in order to overcome such a danger that the Guardian thinks it advisable that the friends should be encouraged to serve from time to time in both the teaching and the administrative spheres of Bahá’í work, but only whenever they feel fit to do so .” </p>

<p> Published in Bahá’í Studies Review 9 </p>

<p> With regard to your question concerning the meaning of the name “Hidden Words”: It is, indeed, one of the most suggestive titles of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh. These words are called “hidden” due to the fact that men have had neither the knowledge nor a true sense of appreciation of them before they were revealed by Bahá’u’lláh. It is through Him, Who is the sole Mouthpiece of God in this age, that spiritual realities and truths have been once more reinterpreted and revealed afresh to mankind. Bahá’u’lláh’s message is thus the only key to a true understanding of the mysteries that envelop man’s spiritual life. </p>

<p> “The Artist’s Daughter” , Nancy Douglas Bowditch, p230-1 </p>

<p> 28. From Shoghi Effendi (via H. Rabbání) to Daisy Smythe. Dated September 15th, 1935. </p>

<p> Beloved Bahá’í Sister, </p>

<p> The Guardian has just received your letter of August 19th, and has been much comforted and gratified to learn that your husband has been successfully operated, and that he is gradually recovering. Will you kindly extend to him his best wishes for his health which, he trusts, will be speedily and completely restored. </p>

<p> I wish also to assure you of the Guardians best wishes and prayers for the removal of your material difficulties and obstacles. He sincerely hopes that, under the guidance of Bahá’u’lláh and through your patient, wise and sustained efforts, your material conditions will improve very soon, and will thus leave you free to devote more of your time and energy to the service of our beloved Cause. </p>

<p> In closing please kindly extend Shoghi Effendi s hearty greetings to Miss Juliet Thompson and also to Mr. Romeyn Benjamin, both of whom he hopes are keeping well and are as ever active in their labors for the promotion of the Faith. </p>

<p> Yours in His Service, </p>

<p> H. Rabbání </p>

<p> Postscript in Shoghi Effendi s handwriting </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p> I wish to assure you again of my deep and abiding appreciation of your constant and manifold services to our beloved Cause. You have displayed such a remarkable spirit of faith, of devotion and loyalty to the Cause and its rising institutions, that future generations will ever remember it with pride and gratitude. Few, if any, have consecrated themselves so whole-heartedly and unreservedly to the interests of the Cause. The Beloved is well pleased, nay proud of the high standard you have already attained. I will pray that you may reach still greater heights of devotion and detachment in the days to come. </p>

<p> Affectionately, Shoghi. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1935-10-02 Closing of Tarbíyát Schools </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #97 January 1936 p1 </p>

<p> With regard to the closing of the Tarbíyát Schools: the school authorities have, in enforcing the observance of Bahá’í anniversaries, acted on the advice and direction of the Guardian. These Schools, being independent and official Bahá’í institutions, could not very well ignore, much less violate the express provisions and laws of the Aqdas. Had they any connection with government institutions, or had their ownership and control been shared by non-Bahá’ís, the situation would have been different. This distinction between institutions that are under full or partial Bahá’í control is of a fundamental importance. Institutions that are entirely managed by Bahá’ís are, for reasons that are only too obvious, under the obligation of enforcing all the laws and ordinances of the Faith, especially those whose observance constitutes a matter of conscience. There is no reason, no justification whatever, that they should act other-wise, and any restriction which the government may impose upon them in this connection would necessarily constitute a violation of the individual’s right to freedom in matters of religious belief. The situation is different when an institution is run partly by Bahá’ís, or is completely owned by the government. In this case the believers, while anxious to observe all prescribed Bahá’í Feasts and Anniversaries, should also take into consideration the rights and interests of their non-Bahá’í partners and associates, and not to force these to stop working when they are under no moral or religious obligation to do so. </p>

<p> On the first of Riḍván the believers had for a number of years observed officially the festival by closing their schools on that day. No objection had bees raised by the authorities. The action was precipitated when the Assembly decided, as advised by the Guardian, to observe in the same manner the Anniversary of the Báb’s Martyrdom, the observance of which is, in addition to eight other holidays, explicitly enjoined by ‘Abdu’1-Bahá in one of His Tablets’ </p>

<p> The point which should be always remembered is that the issue in question is essentially a matter of conscience, and as such is of a binding effect upon all believers. It has so been considered by the friends in Persia, not because of any specific instruction given to them by the Guardian, but solely in view of the fact that the celebration of the Anniversary of the Báb’s martyrdom has been explicitly enjoined by the Master.” </p>

<p> I wish also to express his thanks and appreciation for other enclosures and especially for the book ‘Modern Mystics’ by Sir Francis Younghusband, a copy of which you have been most kind in sending him. The author’s account of the early days of the Movement is very thrilling, indeed, and quite authoritative, being based on Nabíl’s Narrative.

<p> In this connection the Guardian wishes me to draw your attention to a recently published book on ‘Persia’ written by an English lady by the name of Merrit-Hawks, in which she makes a few, though very favorable and significant statements regarding the importance and position of the Cause in that country.

<p> Bahá’í Studies Bulletin Vol I #4 March 1983 pp82 </p>

<p> As to the problem of birth control, neither Bahá’u’lláh nor ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has revealed anything direct or explicit regarding this question. But the Bahá’í Teachings, when carefully studied imply that such current conceptions like birth control, if not necessarily wrong and immoral in principle, have nevertheless to be discarded as constituting a real danger to the very foundations of our social life. For Bahá’u’lláh explicitly reveals in His Book of Laws that the very purpose of marriage is the procreation of children who, when grown up, will be able to know God and to recognize and observe His Commandments and Laws as revealed through His Messengers. Marriage is thus, according to the Bahá’í Teachings, primarily a social and moral act. It has a purpose which transcends the immediate personal needs and interests of the parties. Birth control, except in certain exceptional cases, is therefore not permissible. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> The Maxwells of Montreal Vol II, Violette Nakhjavani, p217-8 </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi feels very much encouraged &amp; gratified to realize that you are developing great interest in the Cause in Germany. Your visit to Esslingen, Stuttgart &amp; various other Bahá’í centres seems to have left a strong impression upon you. Germany, indeed, stands to-day as the largest, most active &amp; promising Bahá’í community in Europe. And the Guardian cherishes the highest hopes for its future, and feels convinced that, as clearly promised by the Master, it will gradually develop into one, if not the most, of the leading Bahá’í countries throughout the world. </p>

<p> In view of that, he would certainly encourage you to study German &amp; to get in touch with the German believers, so that you may get well prepared for teaching the Cause in Germany in the near future. He would even advise you to make that country the main field of your teaching work in Europe. For although general conditions in Germany are, at present, not very favourable to the expansion of the Movement, yet the future of the Cause there seems to be very bright, &amp; rich in all sorts of possibilities. Now, the main task facing the German friends is the consolidation of the Administration. The era of intensive teaching has not yet dawned upon them. But once their communities are fully organized internally, it will then be easy for them to effectively teach the Cause to the outside public. </p>

<p> Dear &amp; valued co-worker: </p>

<p> I have, in my recent cable addressed to your dear &amp; distinguished mother, expressed my delight in learning of the progress you have made in learning German &amp; of the efforts you are exerting to teach the Cause in Germany. I have also expressed my full approval of the inclination you feel to work for our beloved Faith in that land, &amp; I cannot but feel that your collaboration with the German believers will reinforce the foundation of your future international services &amp; will serve to ennoble the work you are destined to achieve in the days to come. I will be soon writing to your mother, &amp; I trust that the cable, assuring her of my prayers for her brother’s family has reached her &amp; relieved her anxieties. </p>

<p> To Leroy loas, November 14, 1935, </p>

<p> Bahá’í News, No. 102, August 1936, pp. 2-3 </p>

<p> In connection with the problems facing the friends in their teaching work; these, the Guardian is well aware, are by no means easy to overcome, specially in view of the limited number and resources of the believers. But in the field of Bahá’í service, as the history of the Cause abundantly demonstrates, there is no obstacle that can be said to be unsurmountable. Every difficulty will, in due time, be solved. But continued and collective effort is also needed. The Bahá’í teacher should not get discouraged at the consciousness of the limitations within or without him. He should rather persevere, and be confident, that no matter how numerous and perplexing the difficulties that confront him may appear, he is continually assisted and guided through Divine Confirmations. He should consider himself as a mere instrument in the Hands of God, and should, therefore, cease looking at his own merits. The first and most important qualification of a Bahá’í Teacher is, indeed, unqualified loyalty and attachment to the Cause. Knowledge is, of course essential; but compared to devotion it is secondary in importance. </p>

<p> “What the Cause now requires is not so much a group of highly cultured and intellectual people who can adequately present its Teachings, but a number of devoted, sincere and loyal supporters, who, in utter disregard of their own weaknesses and limitations, and with hearts afire with the love of God, forsake their all for the sake of spreading and establishing His Faith. In other words, what is mostly needed nowadays is a Bahá’í pioneer and not so much a Bahá’í philosopher or scholar. For the Cause is not a system of philosophy; it is essentially a way of life, a religious faith that seeks to unite all people on a common basis of mutual understanding and love, and in a common devotion to God. </p>

<p> Bahá’í scholars and writers will, no doubt, gradually appear, and will as promised by Bahá’u’lláh lend a unique support to the Faith. But in the meantime, we should not tarry, or slacken in our efforts. </p>

<p> “Concerning your question relative to the duration of the Bahá’í Dispensation. There is no contradiction between Bahá’u’lláh’s statement in the Íqán about the renewal of the City of God once every 1000 years, and that of the Guardian in the ‘Dispensation’ to the effect that the Bahá’í cycle will extend over a period of at least 500,000 years. The apparent contradiction is due to the confusion of the terms cycle and dispensation. For while the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh will last for at least one thousand years, His cycle will extend still further to at least 500,000.” </p>

<p> The Bahá’í cycle is, indeed, incomparable in its greatness. It includes not only the Prophets that will appear after Bahá’u’lláh, but all those who have preceded Him ever since Adam. These should, indeed, be viewed as constituting but preliminary stages leading gradually to the appearance of this supreme Manifestation of God. </p>

<p> After Bahá’u’lláh many Prophets will, no doubt, appear but they will be under His Shadow. Although they may abrogate the laws of this Dispensation in accordance with the needs and requirements of the age in which they appear, they nevertheless draw their spiritual force from this mighty Revelation. The Faith of Bahá’u’lláh constitutes, indeed, the stage of maturity in the development of mankind. His appearance has released such spiritual forces which will continue to animate, for many long years to come, the world in its development. Whatever progress may be achieved, in later ages, after the unification of the whole human race is achieved, will be but improvement in the machinery of the world. For the machinery itself has been already created by Bahá’u’lláh. The task of continually improving and perfecting this machinery is one which later Prophets will be called upon to achieve. They will thus move and work within the orbit of the Bahá’í Cycle. </p>

<p> EXTRACTS PROM SHOGHI EFFENDI’S LETTERS </p>

<p> TO RUTH J. MOFFETT AND ROBERT LEE MOFFETT </p>

<p class='signature noid'> November 15, 1935, Haifa. </p>

<p> “... Regarding the holding of a Bahá’í Forum with outside speakers speaking on Bahá’í subjects and a Bahá’í chairman, Shoghi Effendi approves of the idea, but leaves it entirely to the N.S.A. to decide whether the holding of such a meeting is suitable at present or not. </p>

<p> With reference to your question regarding the qualifications of the members of the Spiritual Assembly: There is a distinction of fundamental importance which should be always remembered in this connection, and this is between the spiritual assembly as an institution and the persons who compose it. These are by no means supposed to be perfect, nor can they be considered as being inherently superior to the rest of their fellow-believers. It is precisely because they are subject to the same human limitations that characterize the other members of the community that they have to be selected each year. The existence of elections is a sufficient indication that assembly members, though forming part of an institution that is divine and perfect, are nevertheless themselves imperfect. But this does not necessarily imply that their judgment is imperfect or defective. </p>

<p> For as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has repeatedly emphasized, Bahá’í assemblies are under the guidance and protection of God. The elections, especially when annual, give the community a good opportunity to remedy any defect or imperfection from which the assembly may suffer as the result of the action of its members. Thus a safe method has been established whereby the quality of the membership in Bahá’í assemblies can be continually raised and improved. But, as already stated, the institution of the spiritual assemblies should under no circumstances be identified with or be estimated merely through, the personal qualifications of the members that compose it. </p>

<p> The meaning of the references to “Paran” and “Zamán” in the passage No. 71 of the Persian Hidden Words has been explained by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and you can find it in the appendix on page 60 of the old edition of Hidden Words, translated by Mdm. J. Stannard and published in Cairo in 1921. </p>

<p> As to the passage No. 13 of the Arabic Hidden Words; that which Bahá’u’lláh declares we can find abiding within us is the power of the Divine Spirit, the reflection of the light of His Revelation. This reflection of the Divine Spirit, however, can in no way be compared to the Revelation which God discloses to His Prophets and Messengers. The similarity in the terminology should not confuse this distinction which is most fundamental. </p>

<p> In connection with your teaching work; what the Guardian wishes you to particularly emphasize in all your talks is the supreme necessity for all individuals and nations in this day to adopt in its entirety the social program given by Bahá’u’lláh for the reconstruction of the religious, economic and political life of mankind. Ho wishes you to explain and analyze the elements that help in raising this Divine World Order in the light of the present-day events and conditions in the world. Special stress, he feels, should be laid on the impending necessity of establishing a Super-national and Sovereign World State,as the one described by Bahá’u’lláh, With the world becoming increasingly subject to tumults and convulsions never experienced before, the realisation of such a necessity is entering into the consciousness of not only the wise and learned but of the common people as well. The believers should, therefore, seize this opportunity to mako a supreme effort to present, in convincing and eloquent language, those social and humanitarian teachings of the Faith which we believe to constitute the sole panacea for the innumerable ills afflicting our present-day world. </p>

<p> Concerning the essential qualifications of a Bahá’í teacher; these have been repeatedly stated by the Guardian in both his general and private communications to the friends. Besides many others, there are two most essential qualifications; first is unqualified devotion and loyalty to everything the Cause stands for; next is thorough knowledge and comprehension of the Teachings. </p>

<p> In prayer the believers can turn their consciousness toward the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, provided that in so doing they have a clear and correct understanding of His Station as a Manifestation of God.” </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Friend, </p>

<p> The Guardian has deeply enjoyed reading your letter of October sixth and feels greatly appreciative of your immediate whole-hearted response to his instructions regarding non-membership by the believers in religious organizations and groups other than those instituted by the Cause. He particularly values the self-sacrifices you have undergone for the sake of upholding this vital principle the importance of which will be increasingly unveiled to all the friends. He feels certain that Bahá’u’Iláh will fully repay you for all the material losses you have incurred as a result of your dissociation from the Methodist Episcopal Church. For you have, indeed, set a beautiful example of courage, loyalty and devotion which every sincere upholder of the Cause cannot fail to admire. It is hoped that through it those among the believers who are as yet not sufficiently convinced of the necessity of dissociating themselves from their churches will be so deeply distressed as to sever official connection with them, and thus become whole-hearted and unqualified in their allegiance and loyalty to the Cause of Bahá’u’Iláh. </p>

<p> “With reference to the N. S. A.’s suggestion regarding the publication in BAha’i News of passages from the Guardian’s letters to individual believers, he wishes me to express his approval of the plan conceived by your Assembly in this matter.” </p>

<p> (Note: This plan is that when the National Spiritual Assembly receives a copy of a letter from the Guardian to an individual believer containing statements of general bearing and importance, the Assembly will refer these statements back to the Guardian, and when approved by him will publish them in Bahá’í News. This plan was brought to the Guardian’s attention in the light of his instruction, published a year or two ago, that his letters to individuals were not to be extensively published). </p>

<p> To Edris Rice-Wray Carson, December 8, 1935. </p>

<p> Bahá’í News, No. 102, August 1936, p3 </p>

<p> “The problem with which you are faced is one which concerns and seriously puzzles many of our present-day youth. How to attain spirituality is indeed a question to which every young man and woman must sooner or later try to find a satisfactory answer. It is precisely because no such satisfactory answer has been given or found, that the modern youth finds itself bewildered, and is being consequently carried away by the materialistic forces that are so powerfully undermining the foundations of man’s moral and spiritual life. </p>

<p> “Indeed the chief reason for the evils now rampant in society is the lack of spirituality. The materialistic civilization of our age has so much absorbed the energy and interest of mankind that people in general do no longer feel the necessity of raising themselves above the forces and conditions of their daily material existence. There is not sufficient demand for things that we call spiritual to differentiate them from the needs and requirements of our physical existence. </p>

<p> “The universal crisis affecting mankind is, therefore, essentially spiritual in its causes. The spirit of the age, taken on the whole, is irreligious. Man’s outlook on life is too crude and materialistic to enable him to elevate himself into the higher realms of the spirit. </p>

<p> “It is this condition, so sadly morbid, into which society has fallen, that religion seeks to improve and transform. For the core of religious faith is that mystic feeling which unites Man with God. This state of spiritual communion can be brought about and maintained by means of meditation and prayer. And this is the reason why Bahá’u’lláh has so much stressed the importance of worship. It is not sufficient for a believer merely to accept and observe the teachings. He should, in addition, cultivate the sense of spirituality which he can acquire chiefly by means of prayer. The Bahá’í Faith, like all other Divine Religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character. Its chief goal is the development of the individual and society, through the acquisition of spiritual virtues and powers. It is the soul of man which has first to be fed. And this spiritual nourishment prayer can best provide. </p>

<p> “Laws and institutions, as viewed by Bahá’u’lláh, can become really effective only when our inner spiritual life has been perfected and transformed. Otherwise religion will degenerate into a mere organization, and becomes a dead thing. The believers, particularly the young ones, should therefore fully realize the necessity of praying. For prayer is absolutely indispensable to their inner spiritual development, and this, as already stated, is the very foundation and purpose of the religion of God.” </p>

<p> Cited in Youth in the Vanguard, Marion Yazdí, pp198-9, USBNC archives </p>

<p> Not only the American friends, but also all the believers in the East who had the pleasure of knowing the doctor, mourn this heavy loss, and fully share your afflictions and sorrows. For they had found in him not only a valuable co-worker, but also a dear friend from whose association they could derive continued inspiration and encouragement. </p>

<p> What, indeed, contributed most to endear him to the friends were the remarkable qualities of his heart. He was to them a living example of utter selflessness, devotion and love. He was so gentle, so kind, so lovable, that everyone who met him could not but feel deeply attracted to him. </p>

<p> His attachment to the Cause was even more remarkable. His great, nay supreme consideration was to be of some service to the Faith, in whatever capacity, and no matter in which place or country. The friends in Persia can never forget the services he was able to render them during his stay in that land. Next to the late Mrs. Ransom-Kehler he may, indeed, be well considered as the foremost American believer who has, in the last few years, been assisted in rendering invaluable help to the Persian believers in their efforts for the establishment of the Administration in their country... . </p>

<p> In his own handwriting Shoghi Effendi added: </p>

<p> With a heart overflowing with love, tenderness, and sympathy I share your afflicting sorrows and am overwhelmed by the sense of loss and grief which earthly separation from so beloved a son must necessarily produce. To him I am attached by such ties that death can never sever. I had a profound admiration for the noble qualities which distinguished his Bahá’í life. I will pray for him with the utmost fervor. Feel not disconsolate, for the state in which he is now is such as none can describe. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section771'> 1935-12-26 various economic questions </h3>

<p> EXTRACTS PROM SHOGHI EFFENDI’S LETTERS </p>

<p> TO RUTH J. MOFFETT AND ROBERT LEE MOFFETT </p>

<p class='signature noid'> December 26, 1935, Haifa </p>

<p> ... Questions Nos. 1, 3 and 5 contain a number of points to which there is no reference in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh or the Master. There are practically no technical teachings on economics in the Cause, such as banking, the price system, and others. The Cause is not an economic system, nor should its founders be considered as having been technical economists. The contribution of the Faith to this subject is essentially indirect, as it consists in the application of spiritual principles to our present-day economic system. Bahá’u’lláh has given us a few basic principles which should guide future Bahá’í economists in establishing such institutions which will adjust the economic relationships of the world, </p>

<p> Question 2. The Master has definitely stated that wages should be unequal, simply “because that men are unequal in their ability and hence should receive wages that would correspond to their varying capacities and resources. This view seems to contradict the opinion of some modern economists. But the friends should have full confidence in the words of the Master, and should give preference to His statements over those voiced by our so-called modern thinkers. </p>

<p> Question 5. “Profit sharing” should be used, rather than “income sharing”, as the former is the term actually in the Bahá’í Writings. </p>

<p> Question 6. Whatever the progress of the machinery may be, man will always have to toil in order to earn his living. Effort is an inseparable part of man’s life. It may take different forms with the changing conditions of the world, but it will always be present as a necessary element in our earthly existence. Life is, after all, a struggle Progress is attained through struggle, and without such a struggle, life ceases to have a meaning; it becomes even extinct. The progress of machinery has not made effort unnecessary. It has given it a new form, a new outlet. </p>

<p> Question 7. By the statement, “The economic solution is divine in nature” is meant that religion alone can, in the last resort, bring in man’s nature such a fundamental change as to enable him to adjust the economic forces that threaten to disrupt the foundations of his existence, and thus assert his mastery over the forms of nature </p>

<p> Question 8. As already referred to in answer to Question 2, social inequality is the inevitable outcome of the natural inequality of man. Human beings are different in ability and should, therefore, be different in their social and economic standing. Extremes of wealth and poverty should, however, be totally abolished. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #249 November 1951 p3 </p>

<p> With regard to your question concerning contributions to the Temple fund: the friends should certainly be encouraged and even urged to support financially this, as well as other national institutions of the Cause. But they should, under no circumstances, be required to do so. As to the idea of “giving what one can afford”: this does by no means put a limit or even exclude the possibility of self-sacrifice. There can be no limit to one’s contributions to the national fund. The more one can give the better it is, especially when such offerings necessitate the sacrifice of other wants and desires on the part of the donor. The harder the sacrifice the more meritorious will it be, of course, in the sight of God. For after all it is not so much the quantity of one’s offerings that matters, but rather the measure of deprivation that such offerings entail. It is the spirit, not the mere fact of contributing, that we should always take into account when we stress the necessity for a universal and whole-hearted support of the various funds of the Cause. </p>

<p> Bahá’í Youth: A Compilation </p>

<p> Prepared By: National Spiritual Assembly Of The Bahá’ís Of The United States (1973) </p>

<p> “... the Guardian fully realizes the difficulties that stand in the way of cooperation between the young and old believers. This is a problem that confronts the Cause almost everywhere, specially in those communities where the number of young and old Bahá’ís is nearly the same. The solution, as in all such cases, is to be found through intelligent and mutual compromise. The old believers have to give up something of their old conceptions and ways of working in order to better adapt themselves to the changing social conditions and circumstances. The young too must learn to act with wisdom, tact and moderation, and to take advantage and benefit from the age-long experiences of their older fellow-believers. The old and the young have each something specific to contribute to the progress and welfare of the Bahá’í community. The energy of youth should be tempered and guided by the wisdom of old age.” </p>

<p> Notes On Obligatory Prayers And Ablutions </p>

<p> compiled by Research Department of the Universal House of Justice </p>

<p> in a letter to an individual fm the House of Justice 15 April 1987 </p>

<p> As Appeared In Bahá’í Studies Bulletin Vol. 4:3-4 2 January 1991 </p>

<p> The instructions that accompany these prayers, such as the washing of hands and face, of bowing down and of raising one’s hands, have been definitely ordained by Bahá’u’lláh, and as such should be entirely and confidently carried out by the believers, and particularly by the Bahá’í youth on whose shoulders has been laid the chief responsibility of vindicating the truth, and preserving the integrity of the laws and ordinances of the Faith. </p>

<p> The daily obligatory prayers are three in number. The shortest one consists of a single verse which has to be recited once every twenty-four hours and at mid-day. The medium which begins with the words “The Lord is witness that there is none other God but He” has to be recited three times a day, in the morning, at noon and in the evening. This prayer is accompanied by certain physical acts and gestures. The long prayer, which is the most elaborate of the three, has to be recited only once in every twenty-four hours, and at any time one feels inclined to do so. </p>

<p> The believer is entirely free to choose any one of these three prayers, but is under the obligation of reciting either one of them, and in accordance with any specific directions with which they may be accompanied. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section777'> 1936-01-10 obligatory prayers and fasting </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> 1936-01-10 obligatory prayers and fasting </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #98 March 1936 p1 </p>

<p> As regards fasting, it constitutes, together with the obligatory prayers, the two pillars that sustain the revealed Law of God. They act as stimulants to the soul, strengthen, revive and purify it, and thus insure its steady development. </p>

<p> The ordinance of fasting is, as is the case with these three prayers, a spiritual and vital obligation enjoined by Bahá’u’lláh upon every believer who has attained the age of fifteen. In the Aqdas He thus writes: “We have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity; this is ordained by God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers. He has exempted from this those who are weak from illness or age, as a bounty from His Presence, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous.” And in another passage He says: “We have enjoined upon you fasting during a brief period, and at its close have designated for you Naw-Rúz as a feast... . The traveler, the ailing, those who are with child or giving suck, are not bound by the fast ... . abstain from food and drink, from sunrise to sundown, and beware lest desire deprive you of this grace that is appointed in the Book.” </p>

<p> Also in the “Questions and Answers” that form an appendix to the Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh reveals the following: “Verily, I say that God has appointed a great station for fasting and prayer. But during good health its benefit is evident, and when one is ill, it is not to fulfill them.” Concerning the age of maturity, He reveals in the appendix of that same book: “The age of maturity is in the fifteenth year; women and men are alike in this respect.” </p>

<p> Regarding the vital character and importance of the Divine ordinances and laws, and the necessity of complete obedience to them by the believers, we thus read in the Gleanings, p. 175: “ Know verily that the essence of justice and the source thereof are both embodied in the ordinances prescribed by Him Who is the Manifestation of the Self of God amongst men, if ye be of them that recognize this truth. He doth verily incarnate the highest, the infallible standard of justice unto all creation. Were His law to be such as to strike terror into the hearts of all that are in heaven and on earth, that law is naught but manifest justice. The fears and agitation which the revelation of this law provokes in men’s hearts should indeed be likened to the cries of the suckling babe weaned from his mother’s milk, if ye be of them that perceive….” </p>

<p> The fasting period, which lasts nineteen days, starting as a rule from the second of March every year and ending on the twentieth of the same month, involves complete abstention from food and drink from sunrise till sunset. It is essentially a period of meditation and prayer, of spiritual recuperation, during which the believer must strive to make the necessary readjustments in his inner life, and to refresh and reinvigorate the spiritual forces latent in his soul. Its significance and purposes are, therefore, fundamentally spiritual in character. Fasting is symbolic, and a reminder of abstinence from selfish and carnal desires. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #98  March 1936 p8 </p>

<p> Regarding the Bahá’í funeral service: it is extremely simple, as it consists only of a congregational prayer to be read before burial. This prayer will be made available to the friends when the Aqdas is translated and published. In the meantime your N. S. A. should take great care lest any uniform procedure or ritual in this matter be adopted or imposed upon the friends. The danger in this, as in some other cases regarding Bahá’í worship, is that a definite system of rigid rituals and practices be developed among the believers. The utmost simplicity and flexibility should be observed, and a selection from the Bahá’í Sacred Writing would serve the purpose at the present time, provided this selection is not rigidly and uniformly adopted on all such occasions. </p>

<p> The letter of that spiritual friend dated 5 Shahru’l-Masail 92 was presented to His Highness, the Guardian of the Cause of God, and its contents attained his blessed glance. The sincerity and luminosity of that spiritual friend made him happy and caused him to express his loving kindness and compassion. </p>

<p> Your high praise of the sincerity, steadfastness, firmness and obedience of the Nayrízi friends in carrying out divine teachings and his own instructions, their frankness in fearlessly stating the truth, their valiance, as well as the integrity of those chargers in the field of understanding and certitude, particularly the Bahá’í youth, and most specially the actions of the Local Spiritual Assembly which have been the source of the glory of the Cause of God and exaltation of His Word, all of these have been hailed by the tongue of grandeur. </p>

<p> The Bahá’ís of Nayríz, ever since the rising of the Luminary of the world, have been self-sacrificing and self-effacing in the path of God, and are remembered for their valiance, bravery and high — mindedness. The activities of those ardent lovers are resplendent and brilliant like the morning star. </p>

<p> Praised be God! The spirit of His love still throbs in the veins and arteries of those believers standing firm in the Covenant and the glad-tidings of the Abhá Kingdom and outpourings of the Concourse on high keep them fresh, joyous and blithe. </p>

<p> The purpose is that Shoghi Effendi has not forgotten and will never forget the friends of that land. His loving glance and tender affections have been and will always be directed towards those true and faithful believers. At every moment he beseeches from the Kingdom of Splendours confirmations and success on their behalf. That spiritual friend has likewise been the recipient of his loving — kindness and favour. He was saddened by the news of the passing of your beloved young son, Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Ḥusayn. He expresses his condolences and sympathy to the survivors of the one who has soared to the Friend of the Most High. He will implore in the sacred Shrines pardon, forgiveness and an exalted station for him. </p>

<p> He acknowledges the contributions made towards the purchase of lands surrounding the Shrine of the Báb in your name and in the names of Amatu’lláh Túbá <u>Kh</u>ánum Rúḥáni and your mother Nuríján <u>Kh</u>ánum Rúḥáni which have been received in the holy presence and accepted. He has issued separate receipts in the name of each individual. </p>

<p> You have requested permission to come on pilgrimage. He grants you permission. Your intention to leave Nayríz and settle elsewhere for the purpose of providing for the education and training of your children has met with his approval. </p>

<p> Things were difficult for the Rúḥáni family in Nayríz, but due to their position in the community and the difficulty of moving, they lacked the confidence to make such a transition.

<p> [Found in a notebook that had belonged to Amelia Bowman] </p>

<p> Scientists hold the belief that God is the first principle or ultimate cause. We agree with the scientists but go onestep further and believe in a personal God who is conscious of His own creation. Man has self-consciousness so how can we surmise otherwise. Surely the Creator of man must be conscious as man himself, which science denies. In this dispensation we believe in a conception of God as the Unifier of all nations, not only as the Father but as the organizer, Unifier, Director, and Governor ... . . </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi has asked me to thank you for your very kind &amp; assuring message of the 22nd ins. just received. He is indeed glad to realize the wonderful work which you &amp; Miss Maxwell are accomplishing for the Faith in Europe. Mrs. Bolles and her daughter have given him most encouraging reports about your activities &amp; he sincerely hopes that as a result of all these strenuous efforts you have exerted during these months the Cause in Germany, &amp; particularly in France, will make a fresh start. The inspiration which your visit brought to the friends in these countries will no doubt stimulate them to greater &amp; more united effort, &amp; enable them to accomplish more for our beloved Faith. </p>

<p> Regarding your visit to the Holy Land; Shoghi Effendi would have very much liked to have you, &amp; also Mr. Maxwell &amp; Mary, come to Haifa &amp; meet you all before his departure. But as summer is drawing near, &amp; he feels so tired, &amp; almost exhausted, after seven months of uninterrupted &amp; strenuous work, he thinks it necessary to leave for his summer rest, &amp; not to delay his going any longer. </p>

<p> In the meantime he would advise you to stay in Europe &amp; continue your teaching work together with Mary. He thinks it would be better for her to be with you, preferably in Germany where you can be of immense service to the Cause. He hopes that Mr. Maxwell will join you later on, &amp; that you all three will lend all the help you can to the extension of teaching work not only in Germany but also in Central Europe. </p>

<p> The Guardian thinks that the best time for you to undertake the pilgrimage &amp; visit Haifa would be next fall. He hopes that you will arrange your program in such a way as to no longer delay your long-cherished pilgrimage to the Holy Land. </p>

<p> Dearest co-worker: </p>

<p> Were it not for the fact that I feel tired &amp; exhausted, as a result of my exceptionally heavy responsibilities, cares and preoccupations in recent months, I would have gladly postponed my departure in order to welcome you &amp; Mary. I am in urgent need of absolute rest, &amp; I am looking forward to the time I can extend to you a hearty welcome in recognition of your many &amp; notable services.

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #108 June 1937, p9-10 </p>

<p> From a letter dated May 30, 1936, the following passages are quoted: </p>

<p> “The Guardian hopes that as new centers are established in Central and South America, the Message of Bahá’u’lláh to the Presidents of the American Republics may be transmitted to them directly by believers already residing in their respective countries.” </p>

<p> “The Guardian does not advise your Assembly to sell the Malden property, as the Master has definitely stated in the Tablet which you have quoted, to ‘take care of that house because the light of the love of God, was lighted in it,’ By renting the house, the N. S. A. can for the present avoid the expenses entailed by its repairs and upkeep,” </p>

<p> “The set of administrative principles Bahá’í communities already possess, together with the text of By-Laws are sufficiently elaborate, at the present stage of the evolution of the Cause, and should not be over-developed by a mass of specific statements related to secondary and exceptional cases.” </p>

<p> “Regarding persons whose condition (i. e., mental condition) has not been defined by the civil authorities after medical diagnosis, the Assembly on the spot must investigate every case that arises and, after consultation with experts. deliver its verdict. Such a verdict, however, should, in important cases, be preceded by consultation with the N. S. A. No doubt, the power of prayer is very great, yet consultation, with experts is enjoined by Bahá’u’lláh. Should these experts believe that an abnormal case exists, the withholding of voting rights is justified.” </p>

<p> And this postscript, in the Guardian’s hand: — </p>

<p> “I fervently hope and pray that the year into which we have just entered may be signalized by fresh conquests and unprecedented triumphs in the teaching field within the United States and beyond its confines. A systematic, carefully conceived, and well-established plan should be devised, vigorously pursued and continuously extended. Initiated by the national representatives of the American believers, the vanguard and standard-bearers of the valiant army of Bahá’u’lláh, this plan should receive the whole-hearted, the sustained and ever-increasing support, both moral and financial, of the entire body of His followers in that continent. Its supreme immediate objective should be the permanent establishment of at least one center in every State of the American Republic and in every Republic of the American continent not yet enlisted under the banner of His Faith. Its ramifications should gradually be extended to the European continent, and its scope should be made to include those countries, such as the Baltic States, Poland, Greece, Spain and Portugal, where no avowed believer has established definite residence. The field is immense, the task gigantic, the privilege immeasurably precious. Time is short, and the obligation sacred, paramount and urgent. The American community must muster all its force, concentrate its resources, summon to its aid all the faith, the determination and energies of which it is capable, and set out, single-minded and undaunted, to attain still greater heights in its mighty exertions for the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh.” </p>

<p> To Mr. Alfred E. Lunt, June 26, 1936: </p>

<p> “The Convention’s unanimous and eager response to the Guardian’s call to intense teaching activity is highly encouraging, and constitutes another source of deep satisfaction to his heart. He is now awaiting to see what steps the N. S. A. will devise to carry out. vigorously and systematically, this new teaching campaign, and what cooperation it will receive from individual believers, groups and Assemblies in the fulfilment of its plans. </p>

<p> “As the Guardian’s telegram clearly reveals, this teaching plan has two chief objectives: first, to establish a center in every State within the U. S. A. and then in every State throughout the American continent. </p>

<p> “What the Guardian would strongly advise is, first, to concentrate, heart and soul, on the first part of this teaching program, namely, to have at least one center established in those States of the American Republic where there are as yet no believers. This task can best be accomplished by means of settlement in these States by at least one believer. Intensive teaching work, that is to say, concentration on a few spiritually minded and receptive people. is also a method of teaching which the Guardian would specially recommend to those who wish to fix their residence in such States. </p>

<p> “Regarding your question as to the meaning of Jin or Genii referred to in the Qur’án, these are not beings or creatures that are actually living, but are symbolic references to the power of men of evil and may be likened to evil spirits.

<p> If you can, and your health permits, concentrate as much as possible on your work in Lyon, which Shoghi Effendi feels more important than Paris, and make a special effort, if possible, to have a local assembly established. Also to keep in close touch with them after you leave, through your correspondence. </p>

<p> He also reminds you to not neglect your history of the Cause in France! And when completed to send him a copy for his consideration. Do not hurry; the gathering of the material must be very thorough. Mrs. French has written him suggesting that you write an article on Thomas Breakwell for ‘Bahá’í World’ vol.VII. Shoghi Effendi approves of this and asks you to send the article, when ready, to Mrs. French. </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp34-5 </p>

<p> Wim Grosfeld, 29 June 1936 </p>

<p> Dear Mr. Grosfeld, </p>

<p> The Guardian was deeply gratified to receive your very kind and assuring message of June 1st, and is indeed comforted to learn that you are keeping in good health, and are as ever deeply attached to the Cause. It was such a long time that he had no news from you, and was feeling really anxious, knowing well the difficult circumstances under which you were living in Holland. He is profoundly grieved to learn that you are still being faced with so many difficulties, and that you have not yet succeeded in securing a suitable position which would enable you to settle permanently in your country. He feels that in case you are sure to find some employment, or work privately in Java or in any other place you should not hesitate to do so. </p>

<p> As you have been already in the East, it would not be very difficult for you to return there and start once more your work. But before undertaking such a trip, the Guardian would advise you to make all the necessary enquiries, and to fully ascertain that once there you will be sure to find a proper job. </p>

<p> In his prayers and meditations, the Guardian will remember you and will specially entreat Bahá’u’lláh to protect, strengthen and guide you, and open before you the door of success. You should not feel discouraged at the sight of the obstacles that so severely confront you at present, but should feel confident that through your sustained and wise efforts and through Gods unfailing guidance you will succeed in overcoming them one by one. Also, you should bear in mind that sorrows and afflictions are a necessary part of life, and are often blessings in disguise, as they serve to open our eyes to the nobler spiritual aspects of life. Trials and sufferings are therefore very helpful to our spiritual growth, and as such should be accepted with the utmost resignation and submissiveness to the Divine Will. </p>

<p> With warmest Bahá’í greetings, and every good wish, yours in His Service, H. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dearly beloved co-worker: </p>

<p> It is such a joy and relief to hear from you after such a long silence. I do hope and pray from all my heart that your affairs may be speedily adjusted that you may be enabled to resume actively your work of service to our beloved Faith. Wherever you may settle and labour my prayers will ever be with you. I am eager to keep in close touch with you, and I hope you will continue to write to me about your plans and future decisions. Wishing you happiness and success from the depths of my heart, your true brother, Shoghi </p>

<p> “The Guardian has read with keenest interest the new statement adopted by the NSA concerning teaching and wishes me to assure you, and through you all your distinguished fellow-members, of his most genuine appreciation of the steps that your Assembly is taking for the expansion of the teaching work throughout America. He is praying for your success from the innermost depths of his heart... . </p>

<p> “Regarding the preservation of relics associated with ‘Abdu’1-Bahá, the general principle should be that any object used by Him in person should be preserved for posterity, whether in the local or the national archives. It is the duty and responsibility of the Bahá’í Assemblies to ascertain carefully whether such objects are genuine or not, and to exercise the utmost care and caution in this matter. </p>

<p> “In connection with the meeting of the N. S. A. at Nashville, the Guardian feels strongly that such a meeting should he held, as it would greatly encourage the believers in that center. The holding of public meetings in that city should be avoided only in case it would lead to grave and very serious results. Slight local criticisms and unpopularity should not act as deterrant. The issue should be met squarely and courageously, and an effort should be made to attract at first the most cultured element among the colored, and through them establish contact with the white and the masses. Such individuals and groups, whether white or colored, who are relatively tree from racial prejudice, should be approached, separately if necessary, and an endeavor should be made to bring them together eventually, not only on formal occasions and for specific purposes, but in intimate social gatherings, in private homes as well as in formally recognized Bahá’í centers. </p>

<p> “The summer schools provide a splendid setting and environment to which the best element among the colored race should be specially attracted. Through such association prejudice can be gradually eradicated, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ardent wish fully realized, </p>

<p> “The Guardian finds it impossible to overestimate the importance and urgency of this sacred duty that confronts both the local and the national Assemblies.”— </p>

<p> Then this statement ·in the Guardian’s hand: [USBN #108 June 1937, p11] </p>

<p> “I am eagerly awaiting the news of the progress of the activities initiated to promote the teaching work within, and beyond the confines of the American continent. The American believers, if they wish to carry out, in the spirit and the letter, the parting wishes of their beloved Master, must intensify their teaching work a thousandfold and extend its ramifications beyond the confines of their native land and as far as the most distant outposts of their far-flung Faith. The Tablets of the Divine Plan invest your Assembly with unique and grave responsibilities and confer upon it privileges which your sister Assemblies might well envy and admire. The present opportunity is unutterably precious. It may not recur again. Undaunted by the perils and the uncertainties of the present hour, the American believers must press on and prosecute in its entirety the task which now confronts them. I pray for their success from the depths.of my heart.” </p>

<p> To Mrs. Russell, July 28, 1936: </p>

<p> “The number nine, which in itself is the number of perfection, is considered by the Bahd’is as sacred, because it is symbolic of the perfection of the Bahá’í Revelation which constitutes the ninth in the line of existing religions, the latest and fullest Revelation which mankind has ever known. The eighth is the religion of the Báb and the remaining seven are: Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, Islám, and the religion of the Sabeans. These religions are not the only true religions that have appeared in the world but are the only ones still existing. There have always been divine Prophets and Messengers, to many of whom the Qur’án refers. But the only ones existing are those mentioned above. </p>

<p> “As regards your question concerning the membership of the Universal House of Justice, there is a Tablet from ‘Abdu’1-Bahá in which He definitely states that the membership of the Universal House is confined to men and that the wisdom of it will be fully revealed in the future. In the local, as well as the National Houses of Justice, however, women have the full right of membership. It is. therefore, only to the International House that they cannot be elected. The Bahá’ís should accept this statement of the Master in a spirit of deep faith, confident that there is a divine guidance and wisdom behind it, which will be gradually unfolded to the eyes of the world.” </p>

<p> Published in Bahá’í Studies Review 4:1 </p>

<p> The German Bahá’í community, which is certainly the most prosperous and promising of its kind in Europe, has by consolidating its internal unity and by extending the basis of its national Bahá’í institutions increasingly attracted the attention and excited the envy and admiration of its sister communities throughout Europe. Esslingen rightly deserves the attention and interest which it is now receiving from believers outside Germany. The Guardian’s hope is that this interest will be further deepened during the next few years, and that an increasing number of visitors will annually flow to that centre, not only to deepen their understanding of the Cause, but to acquire, through contact with the German believers, those essential qualities and attributes which constitute the key to the notable and in many ways unique success accomplished by the German Bahá’í community. </p>

In addition, he wishes you also to emphasize the fact that humanity, taken as a whole, has entered the most critical and momentous stage of its evolution, the stage of maturity.

<p> 21 November 1936 to Mrs. Helen Bishop </p>

<p> With reference to the absolute pacifists, or conscientious objectors to war; their attitude, judged from the Bahá’í standpoint, is quite anti-social and due to its exaltation of the individual conscience leads inevitably to disorder and chaos in society. Extreme pacifists are thus very close to the anarchists, in the sense that both these groups lay an undue emphasis on the rights and merits of the individual. The Bahá’í conception of social life is essentially based on the principle of the subordination of the individual will to that of society. It neither suppresses the individual nor does it exalt him to the point of making him an anti-social creature, a menace to society. As in everything it follows the ‘golden mean’. The only way that society can function is for the minority to follow the will of the majority. </p>

<p> The other main objection to the conscientious objectors is that their method of establishing peace is too negative. Non-co-operation is too passive a philosophy to become an effective way for social reconstruction. Their refusal to bear arms can never establish peace. There should be first a spiritual revitalisation which nothing, except the Cause of God, can effectively bring to every man’s heart. </p>

<p> Regarding the teaching of Esperanto: the Guardian thoroughly appreciates the efforts you are exerting for the spread of this language, and fully realizes that through them you can find many openings for teaching the Cause. He wishes me, however, to bring to your attention the fact that neither Bahá’u’lláh nor ‘Abdu’l-Bahá did specifically state that Esperanto would certainly become the international auxiliary language of the future. Neither did they enjoin its teaching upon the believers. What ‘Abdu’l-Bahá chiefly did was to highly praise it, and to reveal its possibilities. The teaching of Esperanto is, therefore, not a command or an obligation in the sense that praying is for instance. What is enjoined by Bahá’u’lláh is either the creation of a new language, or the adoption of one of the existing languages for use as an international medium of communication. Let us hope that Esperanto may some day develop into such a medium. </p>

<p> To Mr. Wilfrid Barton, during 1936: </p>

<p> “Regarding the solution of the racial problem; the believers should of course realize that the principle of the oneness of mankind which is the cornerstone of the message of Bahá’u’lláh is wholly incompatible with all forms of racial prejudice. Loyalty to this foundation principle of the Faith is the paramount duty of every believer and should be therefore whole-hearted and unqualified. For a Bahá’í, racial prejudice, in all its forms, is simply a negation of faith, an attitude wholly incompatible with the very spirit and actual teachings of the Cause. </p>

<p> “But while the friends should faithfully and courageously uphold this Bahá’í principle of the essential unity of all human races, yet in the methods they adopt for its application and further realization on the social plane they should act with tact, wisdom and moderation. These two attitudes are by no means exclusive. Bahá’ís do not believe that the spread of the Cause and its principles and teachings can be effected by means of radical and violent methods. While they are loyal to all those teachings, yet they believe in the necessity of resorting to peaceful and friendly means for the realization of their aims. </p>

<p> “As regards the meaning of the passage on page 188 of the ‘Gleanings’, it is an emphasis by Bahá’u’lláh on the importance of maintaining differences of station and classes in society and does not refer to the question of race.” </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #108 June 1937, p1 </p>

<p> With reference to Bahá’u’lláh’s command concerning the engagement of the believers in some sort of profession; the Teachings are most emphatic on this matter, particularly the statement in the ‘Aqdas to this effect which makes it quite clear that idle people who lack the desire to work can have no place in the new World Order. As a corollary of this principle, Bahá’u’lláh further states that mendicity should not only be discouraged but entirely wiped out from the face of society. It is the duty of those who are in charge of the organization of society to give every individual the opportunity of acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of profession, and also the means of utilizing such a talent, both for its own sake and for the sake of earning the means of his livelihood. Every individual, no matter how handicapped and limited he may be, is under the obligation of engaging in some work or profession, for work, specially when performed in the spirit of service, is according to Bahá’u’lláh a form of worship. It has not only a utilitarian purpose, but has a value in itself, because it draws us nearer to God, and enables us to better grasp His purpose for us in this world. It is obvious, therefore, that the inheritance of wealth cannot make anyone immune from daily work. </p>

<p> As to the question of retirement from work for individuals who have reached a certain age, this is a matter on which the International House of Justice will have to legislate as there are no provisions in the ‘Aqdas concerning it. </p>

<p> Regarding the problem of teaching in districts of mixed colored and white populations, the Guardian fully approves of the policy adopted by the N.S.A. to the effe<:t that the teaching work should be carried simultaneously with the two races in the south without the slightest discrimination. For the Teachings are obviously not intended for only one race or one class. Your Assembly’s suggestion that Bahá’í public meetings should henceforth be conducted separately for whites and colored and that study classes resulting from such meetings should likewise be conducted separately until individuals of both races are truly confirmed believers is splendid as it win undoubtedly help in removing the misunderstandings and obstacles that have thus far stood in the way of the expansion of the Faith in the Southern States. To alienate either the white or the colored race would he indeed un fair and unjustifiable. The solution proposed by your Assembly thus marks a step in advance over the methods which the friends have hitherto enforced in their teaching work in the Southern States. The Guardian therefore trusts that it will be brought fully to the attention of the friends, and that they will each and all arise to apply it in their future teaching activities, </p>

<p> In this connection, however, he wishes me to stress the fact that the two races should ultimately be brought together, and be urged to associate with the utmost unity and fellowship, and be given full and equal opportunity to participate in the conduct of the teachings as well as administrative activities of the Faith. Nothing short of such an ultimate fusion of the two races can insure the faithful application of that cornerstone principle of the Cause regarding the oneness of mankind. </p>

<p> The Guardian is in receipt of your letter of March 29th, and is delighted to hear that, at the National Spiritual Assembly’s suggestion, you are planning to undertake a teaching trip to Nashville. He wished me to assure you of his prayers at the Holy Shrines for the success of your visit, and to express the hope that through it you may receive a fresh and full opportunity to assist in the spread of the teachings in new fields. The mission with which you have been entrusted is certainly difficult and delicate, but you should be confident that with the assistance of Bahá’u’lláh you will be made fully equal to your task. Have courage and whole-heartedly perservere in your splendid efforts. </p>

<p> The Principle Of An International Auxiliary Language </p>

<p> Compiled by the Research Dept at the direction of the House of Justice, 1 Nov 79(?) </p>

<p> As to your question as to what constitutes indirect teaching: it essentially consists in presenting some of the humanitarian or social teachings of the Cause which are shared by those whom we are teaching, as a means of attracting them to those aspects of the Faith which are more challenging in character, and are specifically and solely Bahá’í. The teaching of Esperanto, for instance, has been a very useful way of presenting the Cause indirectly to many people. It has opened many doors of contact for the believers, and has lately proved to be of tremendous help in introducing the Teachings into important social and intellectual circles. </p>

I am keenly aware of the work you are so patiently and almost heroically performing and accomplishing for our beloved Faith.

Whereupon the Maid of Heaven hastened forth unveiled and resplendent from Her Mystic Mansion, and asked of their names, and all were told but one.

He is convinced that the expansion of the American Bahá’í Community, involving the increase in the number of its Assemblies and other administrative institutions, necessitates a similar increase in the size of the electoral body responsible for the election of the N.S. A. It is obviously unfair and mathematically impossible to apportion ninety-five delegates among the seventy or more Assemblies already instituted. The principle of proportional representation governing the election of Convention delegates therefore can no longer operate, and unless a definite increase in the number of representatives is made the election of the N. S. A. itself would cease to rest on a secure foundation. </p>

<p> The advantage which such an increase presents is to broaden the basis of the N. S. A. by making it a truly representative body, and thus heighten the confidence of the believers in its authority. The National Assembly, being the highest administrative body within a country, is in absolute need of the full trust of the believers, who have the right as well as the obligation to see that the body under whose jurisdiction they serve should be a truly representative body. </p>

<p> In view of these considerations the Guardian feels that the time has come to revise the basis of the present representation at the Convention, by raising the number of the delegates from 95 to 171, which number represents nine times nineteen. </p>

<p> The question of the added expense and strain which this increase in the number of delegates entails can be solved by having those delegates who cannot afford to pay the expenses of the trip send their votes by mail. Aside from that, no financial consideration is of any importance when compared to so vital an issue as that of Convention representation which admittedly affects the very welfare and future growth of the Cause ... </p>

<p> The Guardian wishes me to convey to your Assembly his deep appreciation of their gift of the Temple model which, he hopes, will reach him in good condition, and which he plans to fit in a place that would be accessible to both the Bahá’ís and non-Bahá’í visitors.— </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section860'> 1938-01-30 CERTAIN VITAL REQUIREMENTS and various </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #115 April 1938 p1 </p>

<p> [First paragraph printed in This Decisive Hour #36] </p>

<p> The Seven Year Plan, with which the immediate fortunes of the American Bahá’í community are so closely interwoven, demands, at this critical stage in its development, serious and prayerful consideration of certain vital requirements, without which such a stupendous task can never be brought to a successful completion. The evolution of the Plan imposes a three — fold obligation, which all individual believers, all local Assemblies, as well as the National Assembly itself, must respectively recognize and conscientiously fulfil. Each and every believer, undaunted by the uncertainties, the perils and the financial stringency afflicting the nation, must arise and insure, to the full measure of his or her capacity, that continuous and abundant flow of funds into the national Treasury, on which the successful prosecution of the Plan must chiefly depend. Upon the local Assemblies, whose special function and high privilege is to facilitate the admission of new believers into the community, and thereby stimulate the infusion of fresh blood into its organic institutions, a duty no less binding in character devolves. To them I wish particularly to appeal, at this present hour, when the call of God is being raised throughout the length and breadth of both continents in the New World, to desist from insisting too rigidly on the minor observances and beliefs, which might prove a stumbling block in the way of any sincere applicant, whose eager desire is to enlist under the banner of Bahá’u’lláh. While conscientiously adhering to the fundamental qualifications already laid down, the members of each and every Assembly should endeavor, by their patience, their love, their tact and wisdom to nurse, subsequent to his admission, the new-comer into Bahá’í maturity, and win him over gradually to the unreserved acceptance of whatever has been ordained in the teachings. As to the National Assembly, whose inescapable responsibility is to guard the integrity, coordinate the activities, and stimulate the life, of the entire community, its chief concern at the present moment should be to anxiously deliberate on how best to enable both individual believers and local Assemblies to fulfil their respective tasks. Through their repeated appeals, through their readiness to dispel all misunderstandings and remove all obstacles, through the example of their lives, and their unrelaxing vigilance, their high sense of justice, their humility, consecration and courage, they must demonstrate to those whom they represent their capacity to play their part in the progress of the Plan in which they, no less than the rest of the community, are involved. May the all-conquering Spirit of Bahá’u’lláh be so infused into each component part of this harmoniously functioning System as to enable it to contribute its proper share to the consummation of the plan. </p>

<p> From the same letter, in the portion written by the Guardian through his secretary, the following excerpts are published for the information of the believers </p>

<p> : — </p>

<p> “The Temple model prepared by Mr. Earley which you had shipped to Haifa has been received in good condition, and will be placed shortly in the International Bahá’í Archives on Mt. Carmel for the benefit of all the visitors.” </p>

<p> In reply to a question concerning the authority to approve a bust of ‘Abdu’I-Bahá: </p>

<p> “He feels that for the present neither he nor the National and local Assemblies should take any action by laying down any regulation in this matter. Individuals should be left free to exercise their discretion and to act as they deem best.” </p>

<p> “All those believers who are talented in music and desire to make some contributions along this line should be encouraged and advised to send their musical contributions to the Editorial Committee of The Bahá’í World for reproduction in that book.” </p>

<p> “In conclusion the Guardian wishes me to express his satisfaction at the progress which the Seven Year Plan is making as a result of the cooperation, energy, selflessness and perseverance displayed by the entire body of the American believers. He is continual1y praying that their efforts for the consummation of this two-fold task may be blessed and crowned with complete success.” </p>

<p> The Guardian was exceedingly pleased to receive your letter of January 26th with enclosures regarding the invitation extended to the Bahá’ís of Montreal by the Canadian Civil Liberties Union to join in making representations to the Canadian Prime Minister concerning the ‘Padlock Act’. </p>

<p> He has carefully read all the papers you have sent, and wishes me to assure you of his whole-hearted approval of the letter you have written in answer to the above Union’s communication addressed to Mr. Schopflocher. The tone of your reply, he thinks, is indeed splendid, and he has every reason to hope that it will be received in a good spirit by the persons concerned. </p>

<p> The attitude which the believers should adopt whenever such requests are made to them is to strictly uphold the Teachings, without however displeasing unnecessarily, through lack of wisdom and tact in their negotiations, their non-Bahá’í fellows. </p>

<p> The Guardian wishes you also to express to the Montreal Assembly the assurances of his appreciation of the action they have taken in this matter. He is well-pleased with the care and loyalty with which they have considered the whole issue, and is confident that the result of their deliberations will serve to considerably safeguard and strengthen the basis of their Assembly and work. </p>

<p> Before closing I wish to express to you in particular Shoghi Effendi’s gratitude for the share you are so ably contributing towards the progress of the Faith in Montreal. He is praying for you and for dear Mrs. Maxwell, that you may both be given increasing strength and capacity to fulfil your new duties and obligations, and thus attain your highest destiny in His service. </p>

<p> I wish to express to you and to your devoted fellow-members, my keen appreciation of your vigilance, your determination, your zeal and devotion to the Cause and its manifold interests.

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #118 August 1938 p1-2 </p>

<p> “The Guardian has read very carefully the letters your Assembly has received from the Spiritual Assemblies of Urbana and Chicago reporting the criticisms that have been advanced by Rev. John Elder, a missionary from Írán. While he is certain that such attacks from Church missionaries are destined to increase in number and force in the future, he feels that for the present they do not constitute a challenge so grave and widespread as to justify any strong action by your Assembly. Later on, when the very progress of the Cause on the one hand, and the corresponding decline in ecclesiastical organizations on the other, will inevitably incite Christian ecclesiactical leaders to vehemently oppose and undermine the Faith, the believers will then have a real chance to defend and vindicate the Cause. Under present conditions it would be inadvisable for the American Community to give such issues too much prominence. </p>

<p> “It would, however, be very helpful for the friends to know that the question which the above-mentioned missionary has raised in connection with the marriage of Bahá’u’lláh and the provisions in the ‘Aqdas’ regarding the institution of marriage have been explained by ‘ Abdu’1-Bahá in a Tablet which the Guardian hopes to have translated and published in conjunction </p>

<p> with the ‘Aqdas’. Moreover, as regards Bahá’u’lláh’s marriage, it should be noted that His three marriages were all contracted before He revealed His Book of Laws, and even before His declaration in Ba<u>gh</u>dád, at a time when Bahá’í marriage laws had not yet been made known, and the Revelation not yet disclosed.” </p>

<p> “As regards those Persian or Oriental non-believers who become genuinely interested in the Cause in America, they can be admitted to study classes, but every care should be taken by the Assemblies to fully test their sincerity and the genuineness of their desire to join the Community before they are given the necessary facilities that will enable them eventually to be regarded as voting members of the Faith.” </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN National Bahá’í Review #4 April 1968 p5 </p>

<p> The Bahá’í Teachings on this matter, which is of such vital concern and about which there is such a wide divergency of views, are very clear and emphatic. Briefly stated the Bahá’í conception of sex is based on the belief that chastity should be strictly practiced by both sexes, not only because it is in itself highly commendable ethically, but also due to its being the only way to a happy and successful marital life. Sex relationships of any form, outside marriage, are not permissible therefore, and whoso violates this rule will not only be responsible to God, but will incur the necessary punishment from society. </p>

<p> “The Bahá’í Faith recognizes the value of the sex impulse, but condemns its illegitimate and improper expressions such as free love, companionate marriage and others, all of which it considers positively harmful to man and to the society in which he lives. The proper use of the sex instinct is the natural right of every individual, and it is precisely for this very purpose that the institution of marriage has been established. The Bahá’ís do not believe in the suppression of the sex impulse but in its regulation and control. </p>

<p> “In the Aqdas and innumerable Tablets, most of which have not been yet translated, both Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá emphasize the above view and up-hold the principle of chastity. In The Gleanings there are some important references, more or less direct, to this question. You should carefully go over them, and ponder on their meanings and their far-reaching implications.” </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp38-40 </p>

<p> Max Greeven, 10 November 1938 </p>

<p> Dear Mr. Greeven, </p>

<p> I am directed by the Guardian to express his thanks for your letters dated August 9th and October 11th. </p>

<p> With reference to the situation of the Cause in Germany; Frau Mühlschlegel wrote sometime ago that the friends in Stuttgart had received a communication from the Berlin Secret Police to the effect that “for state-police reasons” the Faith had to remain prohibited, and that the objects confiscated would not be returned. </p>

<p> There is apparently nothing the friends in Stuttgart can do to induce the authorities to re-examine their rulings, or to rescind it, even in part. Further representation on their part not only seem to bring no results, but might have the effect of displeasing the authorities. And in view of this, the Guardian wrote in reply to Frau Mühlschlegel that under existing circumstances it would be wiser for the believers to keep entirely silent, and not to press any longer their case by addressing any appeal either to the authorities in Stuttgart or Berlin. </p>

<p> As regards your own efforts to approach the minister in charge of ecclesiastical affairs in the capital; the Guardian has noted your view that under the existing regime in Germany there is very little chance of your obtaining any definite results through representations to that department. Fie would suggest therefore that, in case you deem it feasible and opportune, you should endeavour to find new ways of approach, possibly by trying to contact some of the high officials in the “Gestapo” which, as you have written, reigns supreme in the Germany of today. This is, however, merely a suggestion, and he leaves it entirely to you to decide as to its practicability, particularly as events in Germany are all developing in the direction of greater centralization, and of a further suppression of all religious groups and denominations. </p>

<p> The general world condition is obviously growing more tense every day and clearly points to the inevitability of that world-wide conflagration foretold by the Master and explained by the Guardian in his “Goal of a New World Order”. Shoghi Effendi wishes the friends to be prepared for still far more serious developments than those which we have witnessed in the course of the last two months, but he wishes them also to feel assured and confident in the glorious promises for a brighter future so emphatically given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>

<p> With regard to the photographs of the Paris bust of the Master; Shoghi Effendi does not wish you to undergo the expense and trouble of ordering another fifty copies of the same dimensions as the original photos. Those of the post-card size you had sent, he feels, are quite good and sufficient. </p>

<p> With his most loving greetings, also to Mrs. Greeven, </p>

<p> yours in His Service, H. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dearest co-worker: </p>

<p> Just a word to assure you of my ever-deepening gratitude and admiration for the efforts you are ceaselessly exerting on behalf of our oppressed brethren. Bahá’u’lláh is no doubt watching over you, and the Beloved is well pleased with your historic endeavours. Whatever their outcome, you have won for yourself an abiding place in the affections of the believers. </p>

<p> Affectionately and gratefully Shoghi </p>

But there is surely no ground for any such doubt. Rather, there is every reason to believe that the American Bahá’í Community, the range and quality of whose achievements have raised it to so unique and enviable a position among its sister communities throughout the West, will, as in the past, endeavor with one accord to fulfill to the very last and with that self same spirit of abnegation and heroic resolve that have characterized its previous accomplishments, all its obligations and responsibilities under the Seven Year Plan. </p>

<p> EXTRACTS PROM SHOGHI EFFENDI’S LETTERS </p>

<p> circulated by RUTH J. MOFFETT </p>

<p> — Extracts from a letter from Shoghi Effendi to Kaukab H. A. MacCutcheon, dated January 26, 1939. </p>

<p> “In regard to the list of questions you had enclosed, the Guardian has directed me to answer them in the order in which they have been put: </p>

<p> 1. The Teachings do not contain any explanation of what </p>

<p> is meant by Guardian Angel. </p>

<p> 2. The holding of a memorial forty days after the passing of a person is a purely Islámic practice, and consequently should be discarded by the believers. </p>

<p> 3. There is no prophecy in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh regarding the Pyramids. </p>

<p> 4. On page 231 of the ‘Gleanings’ the passage beginning with the words, ‘Out of earth have We created you’ — - in this passage Bahá’u’lláh is refuting the argument of the Muslims who believe in bodily resurrection. </p>

<p> 5. There is no connection between the birth of Christ and His having practiced celibacy to permit one to infer that since He was born of the Holy Spirit He therefore refused to marry. Even if Christ had been, married, this would in no way have affected the manner of the appearance of Muḥammad or the Báb. </p>

<p> 6. Approximately six thousand years elapsed since the appearance of Adam. The ages of the Prophets as spécified in the Bible were based on a different calculation than the one used at present. The years mentioned in the Bible were different from ours. </p>

<p> 7. As to your question as to whether another letter will be added to our alphabet in order to have 27 letters; this tradition in which reference to 27 letters is made, has no relation to the Western alphabet. </p>

<p> 8. The fulfilment of the prophecy regarding the appearance of the Sun in the West refers to the Bahá’í Civilization and World Order, and has no relation to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to the West; </p>

<p> 9. The provision in the ‘Aqdas’ regarding the use of glass coffins will be explained when that Most Holy Book is published. This has no connection with the purification of the earth in the Day of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> 10. The words Spirit and Soul are interchangeable. You should refer to ‘Answered Questions’ for further clarification. </p>

<p> 11. The subconscious mind is one of the manifestations of the human soul. </p>

<p> 12. The Báb is the return of the 12th Immam only in a spiritual sense, just as Bahá’u’lláh is the return of the Spirit, the Christ. </p>

<p> 13. In the ‘Gleanings’, p. 154, the sentence beginning with ‘a sick person showeth Bahá’u’lláh means by this that the soul itself, in its reality, is not affected by any physical forces. </p>

<p> 14. There is no reference in the teachings of the real birthday of Jesus Christ. </p>

<p> 15. Also, the Teachings hear no reference to the names of the stars which are supposed to have preceded Moses, Christ and other Divine Prophets. </p>

<p> 16. The Jews are the descendants of Jacob. Both they and the Arabs are branches of the Semitic race.” </p>

Such exemplary response, truly reminiscent of the intrepid faith, fearless courage and irreproachable fidelity so characteristic of the immortal pioneers of the Heroic Age of the Cause, indeed befits the high spiritual rank which the American believers so deservedly and incontestably enjoy. It surely cannot but excite the envy and the admiration of all their sister communities. whether in the East or in the West, and, in particular, offer true and abiding solace to those of their co-religionists who, though harrassed and persecuted, turn their eager and confident hearts to their dear American brethren, whose inestimable privilege it is now to compensate, through their heroic exploits, what their disabled fellow-believers are prevented from accomplishing for the further spread and greater glory of their faith. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> April 21, 1939, Haifa. </p>

<p> “... With reference to your question as to the meaning of ‘Abhá Kingdom’; it is another term for the spiritual world beyond the grave. </p>

<p> What is meant by personal God, is a God who is conscious of His creation, who has a mind, a will, a purpose, and not, as many scientists and materialists believe, an unconscious and determined force operating in the universe. Such conception of the Divine Being, as the Supreme and over-present Reality in the world, is not anthropomorphic, for it transcends all human limitations and forms, and does by no means attempt to define the essence of Divinity which is obviously beyond any human comprehension. To say that God is a personal Reality doos not mean that He has a physical form, or does in any way resemble a human being. To entertain such belief would be sheer blasphemy. </p>

<p> When we say that man lives in a three dimensional plane of consciousness, we should not interpret such a statement in mathematical terms, though the basic idea of the thought is certainly correct. </p>

<p> The word Israel, used throughout the Bible, simply refers to the Jewish people, and not to the chosen ones of this day. </p>

<p> Redistribution of Wealth </p>

<p> Compiled By Research Department Of The Universal House Of Justice. </p>

<p> Now with regard to your questions concerning Bahá’í economic teachings: the writings of Bahá’u’lláh do not contain any technical teachings on the subject of economics, and on such specific financial questions as gold standardization, monetary standards and exchanges, etc. —what they provide however are certain general principles in the light of which future Bahá’í economists will have to evolve the Bahá’í Economic System of the future. These principles contribute the basis of all future economic schemes, but at present it would certainly be premature to foretell what definite economic system will be evolved and established by the Cause. The Bahá’ís, therefore, cannot claim to possess at present an economic order or system which they can officially associate with the Faith, nor should they now attempt to establish any such economic scheme, which would obviously be beyond their present-day capacity and resources. </p>

<p> As regards the objections raised against Bahá’u’lláh’s law of Inheritance: even though a Bahá’í is permitted in his will to dispose of his wealth in the way he wishes, yet he is morally and conscientiously bound to always bear in mind, while writing his will, the necessity of his upholding the principle of Bahá’u’lláh regarding the social function of wealth, and the consequent necessity of avoiding its over-accumulation and concentration in a few individuals or groups of individuals. It is his duty as a loyal and responsible believer to make such provision in his will as would make it fully conform to the spirit if not actually to the exact provisions of the Aqdas regarding the division and distribution of inheritance.... </p>

<p> No country can possibly solve its economic difficulties alone, for economic interdependence is an unescapable economic reality, a fact of economic life which can neither be ignored nor deliberately opposed. </p>

<p> The Teachings do not state what the exact relationship between Labour and Capital will be in the future. Neither do they indicate any directions regarding the payment of wages, or whether the wage system will be retained, modified or altogether abolished. They, however, explicitly uphold the institution of private ownership, but stress also the necessity of introducing certain fundamental changes in its methods and features. </p>

<p> The Principle Of An International Auxiliary Language </p>

<p> Compiled by the Research Dept at the direction of the House of Justice, 1 Nov 79(?) </p>

<p> One thing, however, the Guardian feels the believers should be very careful to avoid in all such contacts with the Esperantists: namely that of giving them the impression that they consider Esperanto as necessarily constituting that international auxiliary language of the future referred to by Bahá’u’lláh and stressed by Him as an indispensable element in the upbuilding of the coming New World Order. </p>

<p> To give them such a false conception of the true Bahá’í attitude regarding the choice of the future world international language would not only be an act of dishonesty and disloyalty towards the Cause, but would lead to serious misunderstandings and misapprehensions, and eventually result in counteracting the effect of any temporary gains or advantages which may accrue to the Faith through such association and contacts with the Esperantists. </p>

<p> It is not so much that language as the central idea it embodies and inculcates which the Bahá’ís endorse, and only through keeping firm to such an attitude can they hope to establish any fruitful and enduring contacts with various Esperanto groups and associations throughout the world. </p>

In closing. Shoghi Effendi wishes me to stress the all-importance of the teaching work in Central America. While the teaching campaign in South America should be continually and vigorously prosecuted, special attention, he feels, should be directed to Central America, aiming at the permanent establishment of at least one believer in each one of its republics, before the end of the present year.” </p>

<p> The supreme objective of the American believers in the year just entered is to insure the uninterrupted prosecution of the Temple construction work and to accomplish the present and perhaps the most difficult stage in the inter-American teaching campaign recently and officially inaugurated. The scope of the dual task ahead is now clear and defined. It is now for the newly elected Assembly to devise ways and means for its efficient, complete and speedy execution. </p>

<p> He was very sad to learn from your recent cablegram sent to me, that you have a diabetic condition. He hastens to assure you he will pray for your complete recovery and he wants you not only to continue treating this condition but to have complete rest of body and mind in order to entirely recover. He assures you that you have no need to worry on any score and that when the time comes you will return to him, and to my open arms, in Haifa. You must never have any doubt about this for a moment! </p>

<p> He wants you at present to devote yourself entirely to recovering from this condition and only after you are recovered, to go on with your teaching work ... </p>

<p> Also he feels whenever you need his prayers, or wish to, you should cable him directly at once. This will greatly help you and you should never hesitate, for any consideration, to do so. </p>

<p> In your last letter to me you asked me a question that I felt only our beloved could answer so I took the liberty of mentioning it to him, knowing his answer would be the true one. He says your illness has not the slightest connection with any spiritual state or failure. There is every reason for you to feel happy and proud because he is pleased with you and you are doing your duty in every way. This illness is purely a physical condition and he is praying you will overcome it. He wants you not to worry over anything or think any dark thoughts ... </p>

<p> You must always feel that he is not only happy to hear from you but eager to get your views as one so devoted to the Cause and so close to him! </p>

<p> It is a long time since I have written you but you have been often in my thoughts and prayers, particularly since I have heard about your illness which I trust will be soon completely cured. To be fully restored physically should be your first consideration. Everything for the present should be subordinated to it. Anytime you feel the urge to write me do not hesitate for one moment. Rest assured, and have no anxiety whatever either regarding Mary who is well, happy and protected, or in connection with the international situation &amp; its repercussions. You and your dear family have in the past &amp; under all circumstances been consistently &amp; sometimes miraculously preserved, guided &amp; blessed &amp; will in the coming days be vouchsafed similar if not still greater &amp; more abundant bounties &amp; blessings.

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #127 July 1939 p2 </p>

<p> In connection with the Bahá’í exhibition at the San Francisco Golden Gate Exposition, he feels deeply appreciative of the efforts exerted by the N. S. A. in conjunction with the San Francisco Assembly for the arrangement of such an attractive and impressive display. and has every reason to hope that the exhibit your Assembly is now holding at the World’s Fair in New York will prove equally successful. and result in giving the Faith a befitting and widespread publicity. He welcomes your offer to send him photographs of this last exhibit at New York. and would also appreciate your giving him a report on the public interest shown on both occasions. </p>

<p> He wishes me in conclusion to stress the paramount importance, now that the teaching campaign in the United States and Canada has been successfully extended to embrace every State and Province in these two countries, of insuring by all means available the systematic and vigorous penetration of the teaching force in the Latin Republics of Central America — the opening up of which he has, in his recent cabled message to the Annual Convention, set as the chief immediate teaching objective facing the Community of the American believers during this year. Since the nine hitherto unoccupied territories in the North American Continent have at last been definitely settled, and following the formation during this past year of the first local Spiritual Assembly in the heart of Mexico, this southward penetration of the teaching campaign is but a natural and logical step which should now be resolutely and unfailingly pursued. </p>

<p> That this new and crucial stage in the Inter-American teaching campaign is infinitely more difficult and challenging than any teaching attempt under taken so far collectively by the American believers, fraught as it is with problems which they have never had the opportunity to tackle before, and might for this reason appear at first quite beyond their present-day resources and strength, the Guardian himself has readily admitted in his “Advent of Divine Justice.” But though fully alive to the existence of such obstacles and difficulties. whether religious, political, racial. or otherwise, he feels absolutely confident that these harriers. no matter how insuperable they may prove to purely human attempts and endeavors, cannot in the long run offer any effective resistance to the onward march of the invincible arm of Bahá’u’lláh which, however significantly small and poorly equipped materially it may appear, is endowed nevertheless with such celestial strength as will undoubtedly enable it to break down one by one every barrier it may encounter in its spiritual conquest for the redemption and guidance of human souls. </p>

<p> It is the assurance of such divinely promised victory, stressed time and again and in language indeed unmistakable by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, coupled with the ever-growing evidence of the incomparably glorious teaching achievements accomplished by the American believers in recent years, and in particular during the last two decades following the ascension of ‘Abdu’l — Bahá, that fill the Guardian with confidence and courage, and impel him to set up such an admittedly high goal before the American Bahá’í Community, thus leading it, resolutely and infallibly, ever onward towards the high spiritual destiny which has been, irrevocably and yet so deservedly, chosen for it by God in this glorious age and dispensation. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May 30, 1939 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Friends, </p>

<p> The most welcome message you had jointly addressed to our beloved Guardian dated May 9th has duly reached him, and he was inexpressibly delighted to hear that you have written the Inter-America Committee offering your services for teaching work in Central America. He hopes that the N.S.A. &amp; the Inter-America Committee both will extend to you every support &amp; assistance in their power in order to facilitate your journey &amp; enable you to settle in a locality where you will have the best chance of establishing the Faith. You did well to write &amp; ask the Committee in charge of the teaching work in the Latin American countries for their advice as to what particular state you should settle in, as their recommendation would certainly be invaluable to you in your work. </p>

<p> Needless to assure you that this great teaching undertaking you have chosen with such spontaneous will and such heroic determination characteristic of the Bahá’í pioneer, the invisible, yet ever present hosts of the Kingdom will ever reinforce &amp; strengthen your labors, and lead you onward to the goal you have set yourselves to attain in service to Bahá’u’lláh in His Faith. </p>

<p> The Guardian’s good wishes &amp; prayers will accompany you all through your journey, &amp; it is his heart’s fervent hope that you may be fully confirmed &amp; successful in your efforts. </p>

<p> With the warmest expression of his grateful appreciation of your devoted services in the teaching field &amp; with his most loving greetings to you both. </p>

<p> Yours ever sincerely, </p>

<p> R. Rabbání </p>

<p> [At the close of this letter on behalf of the Guardian to the Blackwells, Shoghi Effendi, in his own hand, added these comments.] </p>

<p> Dear co-workers: </p>

<p> I am delighted to hear of your noble determination, and will specially pray for your success. I value and prize the spirit that animates you in His service. May the Beloved guide every step you take, resolve every problem that may confront you, cheer your hearts and fulfill your dearest wish in His service. </p>

<p> Dear Shoghi Effendi, </p>

<p> This is to inform you that we have submitted our names to the Inter-America Committee for pioneer work in Central America. We are entirely willing to carry the great message into any one of these countries, should The National Spiritual Assembly decide to accept our applications. </p>

<p> We would like to give you a few facts concerning our personal history. We became declared believers in the year 1934 within a few months of each other, and were later married in the year 1937. I am a member of the Negro race, and my wife is one of the Caucasian race, while I am from the southern states and she is from the northern states. </p>

<p> It was the summons contained within your cablegram that “white and Negro believers alike must arise…” which has created within us the desire to respond to the Call. </p>

<p> We are asking, then, for your prayers on our behalf so that we may always render the utmost service to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> Faithfully yours, </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #129 August 1939, p4-5 </p>

<p> The Guardian wishes me to express his approval of the budget of $150,000 fixed by the N. S. A. for teaching work and Temple construction during the current Bahá’í Year, and trusts that the individual believers as well as all the local Assemblies will cooperate in raising that sum, and thus make it possible for your Assembly to carry on, regularly and uninterruptedly, its twofold national tasks in this third year of the Seven Year Plan. </p>

<p> The Guardian also welcomes your Assembly’s decision to maintain the plan of holding public meetings and regional conferences in various parts of the country, and also views with approval your decision to include the city of Toronto in the schedule of the N. S. A. meetings for this year. </p>

<p> In closing I wish to express the Guardian’s unbounded satisfaction at the most gratifying news of the opening up of the three Central American Republics of Cuba, Panama and Honduras to the light of the Cause, and to urge your Assembly, on his behalf, to make a special, and indeed supreme effort for the settlement, in the course of this year, of the six remaining Republics of Central America. Whatever the cost and sacrifices which such admittedly difficult campaign would entail, and however tentative the efforts of those pioneers who offer themselves for service in these religiously conservative, politically unsettled, and climatically inhospitable countries, the one supreme and immediate objective is to insure laying down, ere the termination of the current year, and in each one of these Republics such foundations, rudimentary though they may be, as would provide future Bahá’í teachers working in these regions such means and openings as would considerably facilitate their task of further extending the scope and consolidating the foundations of the Cause in Central America. </p>

<p> Whoever feels the urge to volunteer for pioneer work in either one of these Central American States should be encouraged to do so and while the N. S. A. is conscientiously bound to facilitate his settlement it has also the right of exercising its own discretion whenever there are a number of similar applicants, through extending special financial support to all those pioneers whom it considers to be best qualified for the task. </p>

<p> This present phase of the inter-continental teaching campaign, coinciding as it does with the steadily rising tide of uncertainty and gloom throughout the world, acquires a special significance, and offers indeed a unique challenge to the community of the American believers, who, as the undisputed “vanguards of the Faith in the West” are now called upon to demonstrate, in fields hitherto unexplored and through exploits as yet unrivaled by any of their sister-communities throughout the West, the efficacy of this new saving grace of God revealed in this age through the person of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> The Guardian will continue to pray that the members of the American Bahá’í community may arise and meet the challenge of the present hour with such audacity, such self-sacrifice and such unflinching determination as truly befits their incontestably high spiritual position, and in a manner that would evoke the admiration and excite the envy not only of the entire body of their co-religionists, but of the whole unbelieving world outside. </p>

<p> On behalf of Shoghi Effendi I want to acknowledge your letters to him of June 9th and May 15th, 1939.

<p> He realizes how much the loss of your only and dear brother means to you, as well as to his family, and he has felt very badly that Uncle Randolph should have passed away so prematurely and under such tragic and sad circumstances, all the details of which he read in your long letter to me. </p>

<p> He wants me to assure you again of his prayers for my uncle’s eternal felicity, as conveyed to you in his cablegram, and he feels sure that the work that Unkie did for the Cause, in such a good spirit and so painstakingly, in translating the footnotes of Nabíl’s narrative, will have a powerful effect on the progress of his soul in the next world. </p>

<p> “The Pure Leaf, the illustrious teacher, the sign of detachment, the torch of love and affection, the example of courage and faithfulness, the consolation of the people of Bahá, Martha Root has ascended to the summit of eternal habitation. The Concourse on High received her with the shouts: ‘Welcome O Glory of Teachers (men and women)!

<p class='ref noid'> The Maxwells of Montreal Vol II, Violette Nakhjavani, p390-1 </p>

<p> Dearest Daddy: </p>

<p> I am writing you on behalf of the Guardian who has something he wants me to ask you to consider for him and make your plans for it as your idea might prove to either be just what he wants or give him something to work on. He is about to build the last terrace of the Shrine on Mt. Carmel and although in an unforeseen future it might need to be changed or added to, he expects it for the present to be the permanent entrance to the terraces. Enclosed are a photograph of the present state of the terraces, a plan of the ones built and where the projected one will come and the property limits, and a cross section map showing the inclination of the mountain and the terraces. </p>

<p> Now the whole thing is this: What should the entrance, marked by me in elegant red ink with the letters ‘XYZ’, look like? That is where your work comes in. As you perhaps remember you discussed it here with Shoghi Effendi and he showed you a model that had a huge flight of circular steps opening out of the smaller flight that led up through the wall of the terrace to the higher level? He does not like this design and leaves it to you to propose one or more different ways. Also he is not absolutely fixed in the idea of using the big wrought iron gate, the design of which you also saw, in that position. So that gives you carte blanche except for the rather narrow and unfavourable approach to this entrance and the incline of the mountain itself. Unfortunately, as you can see from the enclosed photo, the houses are just fronting the as yet unfinished road that leads up to the terrace end. That makes a wide view of it impossible, I mean nice flanking gardens, etc. Also the incline is very steep. The projected stairs could come as near the boundary of the Bahá’í property to the RIGHT of the XYZ line as you think would look nice. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi says that as mails are so slow and uncertain now and the distance so great he wants you to not make a detailed plan as that would take too long and be a waste of your time. Make two or three tentative plans in the form of sketches with rough dimensions attached. He has a fairly good engineer who can carry it out. And above all don’t try and ask me more details and wait for the answer as by that time probably summer will be here! At the present rate of mails! </p>

<p> “The very sad and indeed distressing news of the passing away of our beloved Martha was a great shock to the Guardian, who feels unutterably sorry at this heavy blow sustained by the Cause. Her departure constitutes the heaviest blow which the teaching force not only in America but throughout the entire Bahá’í world has sustained since the passing of our beloved Master. May the memory of the distinguished services it had been her unique privilege to render in so many fields and over such a long and uninterrupted period of years serve as source of continued inspiration to the present-day and future generations o[ Bahá’í teachers, to whom she will indeed ever be the very embodiment of those teaching qualities which only a few Bahá’í teachers, whether in the East or the \Vest, can claim to have attained. </p>

<p> “To you, and to all the dear American friends who are now so profoundly deploring beloved Martha’s passing, the Guardian feels moved to convey the assurances of his deepest and most loving sympathy in your great bereavement. May Bahá’u’lláh comfort your grief-stricken hearts, and cause this calamity to further cement the unity, deepen the devotion and increase the resourcefulness of the American believers, and in particular those dear pioneers who are so indefatigably laboring in foreign and distant fields.” </p>

<p> In the Guardian’s hand: </p>

<p> The very welcome message you had written the Guardian dated October 21st has just arrived, and he feels indeed most happy to know that you are keeping well in spite of the grave anxieties and uncertainties through which you mn|t have passed during the last two months. At the outbreak of hostilities in Europe which threatened to spread throughout all the Balkans he felt so deeply concerned about your safety that he decided to send you a wire advising you to leave for Switzerland, as he considered that country to be the safest and most suitable place where you could settle. But since the war seems to be localized, at least for the present, he thinks there would be no immediate necessity for you to leave Bulgaria, and has already advised you by wire to this effect. </p>

<p> [postscript by Shoghi Effendi] </p>

<p> I have already assured you and the friends by cable, and approved of your remaining at your post in these days of trial and stress. The spirit which you above all the rest so powerfully evince, the progress of the work in which you are so devotedly and determinedly engaged, are a source of extreme and constant joy and inspiration to me in my multitudinous labours and responsibilities. Will continue to pray for you all from the depths of my heart. Be confident and happy always. </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp40-1 </p>

<p> Max Greeven, 20 November 1939 </p>

<p> Dear Mr. Greeven, </p>

<p> Your very kind letter of October 28th was truly welcome, and it indeed greatly rejoiced the heart of our beloved Guardian to know that both Mrs.Greeven and yourself are keeping well, and that in spite of the storm and stress created by the outbreak of war in Europe you have been spared so far the sufferings and privations which millions of souls are now bitterly experiencing. He hopes, and indeed will earnestly pray that the protection and guidance of Bahá’u’lláh may continue to be vouchsafed unto you both, and unto each and everyone of the believers throughout the world. </p>

<p> In view of the gravity of the situation in Holland, and the possibility of war spreading gradually to that and other adjoining countries, he still feels that, in case your business conditions permit, you should move as soon as possible to Sweden, where you have certainly a greater chance of safety than in the Netherlands. He would leave, however, the final decision to you and to Mrs. Greeven that you may, in consultation with each other, decide upon the course that would be the best and most feasible for you to take under present circumstances. </p>

<p> Assuring you afresh of his warmest good wishes and his affectionate greetings, </p>

<p> yours in His Service, H. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p> I am so glad to learn that you and Mrs. Greeven are both safe and well despite the perils and dangers that surround you in that troubled continent. I trust and pray that when you transfer your residence to a safer country you may both be enabled to render outstanding services to the Faith, and thus continue to enrich, no matter how grave the hour, the record of your past accomplishments. With my best wishes for you both, your true brother, Shoghi </p>

<p> “He has noted with care what you had written him regarding the question of admittance of applicants into the Cause. This is certainly a matter which calls for the utmost tact, wisdom and consideration on the part of Bahá’í Assemblies. While, as he himself has repeatedly stressed, a uniform procedure should be adopted and followed whereby every applicant should be required to express his whole-hearted and unconditional acceptance of the essential verities of the Cause, great care should also be taken not to insist on matters of a secondary importance which the newcomer cannot, for obvious reasons, fully grasp and apprehend at the beginning. Once the applicant has been admitted in the Community with a clear understanding of the duties and responsibilities, and essential implications which such membership entails, there would be no difficulty for him in gradually adjusting his whole ideas according to the requirements set forth in the Teachings. The process of becoming a Bahá’í is necessarily slow and gradual. The essential is not that the beginner should have a full and detailed knowledge of the Cause, a thing which is obviously impossible in the vast majority of cases, but that he should, by an act of his own will be willing to uphold and follow the truth and guidance set forth in the Teachings, and thus open his heart and mind to the reality of the Manifestation.” — </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #133 February 1940, pp2-3 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í brother: </p>

<p> On behalf of the Guardian I gratefully acknowledge the receipt of your communications written at the direction of the N. S. A. and dated July 3, 11, 17, 18, August 3, 3, 11, 21, September 20 and November 16 (two letters ), together with their enclosures, and of various other materials sent under separate cover, all of which reached him safely, and for which he wishes me to heartily thank your Assembly. </p>

<p> Illness, and his pressing duties and preoccupations, have unfortunately delayed his acknowledgment of your welcome communications. The multitudinous duties that have pressed upon him have become so complex, urgent and vital that he finds it difficult, at times, to cope with his correspondence with the believers and the Assemblies. </p>

<p> He wishes me to specially convey to you and your fellow-members his deep sense of appreciation and gratitude for the message you had, in response to the suggestion made by the local Assembly of New York, been prompted to convey to him, expressing the earnest hope of the American believers that he would undertake a visit to the United States. He is profoundly touched at this fresh evidence of the close ties of loyalty and devotion that so inseparably unite the American Bahá’í community with him, and will pray that the passing of years may further strengthen this bond and increasingly deepen in the hearts of our dear American friends their sense of responsibility for the well-being and protection of the Faith at its world center in the Holy Land. </p>

<p> The Guardian particularly welcomes the appointment by your Assembly of a new Race Amity Committee, and fervently hopes that this will enable the friends to make the fullest possible response to his vital call for interracial amity and understanding, and specially to his instruction regarding the treatment of colored minorities within the Community. </p>

<p> It was also a matter of deep gratification to him to know that the number of recognized local Spiritual Assemblies throughout the United States and Canada had reached eighty-eight on the 21st of April of last year, and would urge that special effort be exerted by your Assembly to increase that number to one hundred by the next meeting of the Annual Convention. </p>

<p> With reference to the permission granted by the Marriage License Bureau of the City of Chicago to the Chicago Assembly to perform Bahá’í marriages, the Guardian considers this indeed as an historic achievement, and trusts that it will open the way for the accordance of a similar recognition to other local Bahá’í Assemblies throughout the States. He would certainly approve that all incorporated local Assemblies make similar representations to their respective civil Marriage Bureaus for the legal recognition of Bahá’í marriage ceremonies. In the performance of a Bahá’í marriage, the chairman and secretary of the local Assembly should act as its representatives. The ceremony itself must be very simple. The marriage certificate, copies of which in Arabic and Persian are published in the Bahá’í World, and which bears the signatures of both parties and of their parents, should be translated and adopted by the American friends. This is indeed a tremendous step forward in the ultimate adoption and enforcement of the laws of Bahá’u’lláh in the West. </p>

<p> With regard to Munírih <u>Kh</u>ánum’s account of her life, concerning which certain questions have been raised by one of the believers; what has been written by Munírih <u>Kh</u>ánum herself in that account, and also the references to the subject made by Nabíl in his Narrative should be taken as the accurate standard and not what has been reported in Dr. Esslemont’s book. </p>

<p> Regarding the time for the holding of the Nineteen Day Feasts and elections; the Guardian would advise your Assembly to urge the friends to hold such gatherings on the prescribed day before sunset. If impossible, then it is permissible to hold them on the preceding day. In connection with the nine holy days, however, the friends should consider it obligatory to celebrate them on the prescribed day before sunset. </p>

<p> The Guardian wishes your Assembly to abandon the practice of appointing associate members to some of the committees, as reported in the July news letter. Such a practice, he feels, tends to create confusion and misunderstanding. Those already associate members, however, may at the discretion of the N.S.A. be added to the full membership of the committees. </p>

<p> In connection with the request received by your Assembly from a Chicago believer for permission to be married in the Temple, Shoghi Effendi wishes your Assembly to abide by his directions on the subject as contained in his letter of January 29, 1939. </p>

<p> The news of the donation of two hundred copies of the last issue of the Bahá’í World made by our very clear Mr. Schopflocher to various national and local Assemblies outside of the United States was received with deepest appreciation by the Guardian, who feels confident that this action will create widespread enthusiasm throughout the Bahá’í world, and will also considerably help in giving due publicity to this invaluable international record of the Faith. </p>

<p> He also wishes me to express his deepfelt appreciation of the increase recently made by the N.S.A. in its monthly contribution to the International Fund. He will pray that your Assembly may be richly rewarded for this truly generous assistance you are extending towards the promotion and safeguarding of the interests of the Cause at its world-center in the Holy Land. </p>

<p> Regarding the construction of a memorial dedicated to the late Miss Martha Root at the cemetery in Honolulu: Shoghi Effendi highly approves of your Assembly’s proposal, and hopes that the contribution of one hundred pounds he has already cabled through Mr. Wilhelm for that purpose will serve to stimulate the friends to send in further donations that would enable the N.S.A. to erect a befitting monument in honor of our departed sister. He wishes you to impress upon the friends the necessity of their acting promptly and generously in this matter. He is eagerly awaiting for a copy of the design of the proposed monument. As to the design itself he prefers to leave it to the discretion of the N.S.A. </p>

<p> With reference to the matter of the consent of the parents to a Bahá’í marriage: as this is a vital binding obligation, it is the duty of the Assemblies to ascertain, before giving their sanction, that the consent obtained has been given freely by the parents themselves. </p>

<p> The Guardian approves of the recommendation made by the editors of World Order to publish in that magazine hitherto unpublished material from the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and hopes that in response to your request he will also be able to send you, from time to time, any such material he can gather from the Sacred Writings. </p>

<p> Laws of Aqdas </p>

<p> Bahá’í Procedure (1937), sheet 1 </p>

<p> In view of the importance of such a statement he feels it his duty to explain that the Laws revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in the Aqdas are, whenever practicable and not in direct conflict with the Civil Laws of the land, absolutely binding On every believer or Bahá’í institution whether in the East or in the West. Certain laws, such as fasting, obligatory prayers, the consent of the parents h&fwA, msxriR^c, “jrci^^ii^e o~f alcoholic drinks, monogamy, should be regarded by all believers as universally and vitally applicable at the present time. Others have been formulated in anticipation of a state of so — ciety destined to emerge from the chaotic conditions that prevail today. When the Aqdas is published this matter will be further explained and elucidated. What has not been formulated in the Aqdas, in addition to matters of detail and of secondary importance arising out of the application of the laws already formulated by Bahá’u’lláh, will have to be enacted by the Universal House of Justice. This body can supplement but never invalidate or modify in the least degree what has already been formulated by Bahá’u’lláh. Nor has the Guardian any right whatsoever to lessen the binding effect much less to abrogate the provisions of so fundamental and sacred a Book. </p>

<p> Already in Egypt, Persia, India and ‘Iráq, Assemblies, both local and national, are availing themselves of the opportunity which the autonomy granted to Eastern religious communities in matters of personal status has offered them, to press for the recognition by the civil authorities of such Laws of the Aqdas which they conscientiously feel they must uphold and enforce. They have even, under certain circumstances, preferred to suspend their activities and dissolve their institutions rather than follow the dictates of those officials who have tried to induce them to violate what has been expressly ordained by the Author of their Faith. </p>

<p> “With regard to the Memorial which the N.S.A. is proposing to erect in honor of our beloved Martha, the Guardian is hopeful that the fund which is now being raised for that purpose will receive the full support of the believers, and that the donations which will be sent in will be sufficient to enable your Assembly to erect a befitting monument in memory of our departed sister. The friends should be impressed with the importance and significance of this undertaking, and should seize this opportunity of paying their last tribute to so outstanding and indeed matchless a pioneer and servant of the Cause in the West.” </p>

<p> He wants me to tell you how very happy and pleased he is over your trip to South America. I remember one day about a year ago in speaking of the teaching work the Bahá’ís were doing there, the Guardian said it would be very good for you to do work there — and now of your own accord you are doing this! He wants me to tell you not to stay too long away from home. He has no desire that you should make a prolonged visit there, but feels that during the winter the climate there is better for your health and at the same time you are rendering the Cause a wonderful service. Above all Shoghi Effendi wants you to be careful of your health and have that as your first consideration. </p>

<p> Another thing Shoghi Effendi wants me to tell you is that you should concentrate your teaching work in one spot and devote your effort to consolidating it, not dissipate your time and energies over different places. Also when you leave for home you are to go straight home to America and not stop off at different places! ... </p>

<p> Your spontaneous response to the call of teaching in distant fields, despite the condition of your health, is indeed a further &amp; still more striking evidence of your marvelous devotion to the Cause &amp; your unquenchable enthusiasm for whatever may promote its truest &amp; best interests. My special prayers will accompany &amp; surround you &amp; Jeanne in your highly meritorious enterprise. For your success, your good health &amp; protection, as well as for the welfare of Mr. Maxwell I will supplicate our beloved Master while you are rendering Him such splendid services. Mary is so happy &amp; proud of the spirit you are so powerfully manifesting. She is progressing in every way &amp; speaking Persian fluently. You should be happy, thankful &amp; assured.

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section933'> 1940-02-27 to Townshend to write tribute to Marie for BW with suggestions </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> Her Eternal Crown: Queen Marie of Romania and the Bahá’í Faith, Della L Marcus, pp277-9 </p>

<p> The Guardian wishes me now to request you to kindly prepare a detailed article concerning the late Queen Marie of Romania, which he wishes to reproduce, together with some other material regarding her, in the next issue of ‘The Bahá’í World’. He would like you to send him the article in about a month’s time, and if not he can wait a month more. As you have already contributed articles to the previous volumes of the Biennial (Volumes II, III, IV, V, VI and VII), and these have been widely appreciated by the friends, he thinks you would be encouraged to undertake writing the article in question. </p>

<p> As material for your study he would suggest the following: </p>

<p> 1.		The Queen’s own statements published in Volume VII of ‘The Bahá’í World’, pages 498-501. </p>

<p> 2.		Tribute paid to Her Majesty by the Guardian and reproduced in Volume II of The Bahá’í World, pages 173-174. </p>

<p> 3.		Article by Miss Martha Root in ‘Bahá’í World’ Volume VI, pages 580-583. </p>

<p> 4.		Enclosed article by Mrs McNeill, a childhood friend of the Queen, published in ‘World Order’ magazine. </p>

<p> 5.		Enclosed letter addressed to the Guardian by Her Majesty, dated August 27, 1926. Special reference should be made to that letter in view of the far-reaching significance of its references to the Faith. </p>

<p> The Guardian would further recommend that the following facts and data should be incorporated into your article: </p>

<p> 1.		The late Queen Marie was the granddaughter of both Queen Victoria and Czar Alexander II of Russia, to both of whom Bahá’u’lláh revealed Tablets in which He appreciatively referred to them, unlike His Tablets to Napoleon III, and His references to the King of Prussia, and the Emperor of Austria in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. The illuminated copy of Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet to Queen Victoria was presented to her by Lady Blomfield in London. </p>

<p> 2.		The Queen and her daughter intended to visit the Bahá’í Shrines in Bahjí and on Mount Carmel, and they reached Haifa with that intention, but were deterred from doing so, as testified by the Queen herself in the following passage of a letter she wrote Miss Martha Rootron June 28, 1931: ‘Both Ileana and I were cruelly disappointed at having been prevented going to the holy Shrines and of meeting Shoghi Effendi, but at that time we were going through a cruel crisis and every movement I made was being turned against me, and being politically exploited in an unkind way. It caused me a good deal of suffering and curtailed my liberty most unkindly ... But the beauty of truth remains and I cling to it through all the vicissitudes of a life become rather sad. </p>

<p> 3.		In July 1938, in connection with the Queen’s death, the Guardian on behalf of all the Bahá’ís sent a message of condolences to her daughter, the Queen of Yugoslavia, to which Her Majesty replied expressing ‘sincere thanks to all Bahá’í followers. </p>

<p> 4.		Bahá’ís in various countries held memorial gatherings in her honour. In the U.S.A. flowers were sent for the memorial service in Washington. The letter sent on behalf of the American National Spiritual Assembly to the Romanian Minister in Washington is enclosed for your information. </p>

<p> 5.		The Queen has made unequivocal assertion in one of her seven statements of her faith of the divine authority of both Bahá’u’lláh and the Prophet Muḥammad, as a result of her study of the Bahá’í Writings. The Guardian wishes you to quote the passage in one of the seven statements referring to Prophet Muḥammad. </p>

<p> 6.		The following passage from another letter addressed by the Queen to Miss Martha Root, dated June 8, 1926, should be incorporated in toto in your article: ‘The beautiful truth of Bahá’u’lláh is with me always, a help and inspiration. What I wrote was because my heart overflowed with gratitude for the revelation you brought me. I am happy if you think I helped. I thought it might bring truth nearer because my words are read by so many.’ </p>

<p> With renewed thanks from the Guardian for your invaluable help, and with his warmest love and greetings ... </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #136 June 1940, p3 </p>

<p> While the National Office in Wilmette, designated by the Guardian as Ḥaẓíratu’lQuds, is primarily an administrative center, its use should by no means be confined to purely administrative work, but should include such activities of a social and intellectual character, both local and national, as can best establish its character as the foremost teaching and administrative center of the Faith throughout the States. </p>

<p> In the conduct of any social activity at the National Office, however, great care should be taken to maintain strictly the dignity of the place, particularly in view of its proximity to the House of Worship, which makes it doubly essential for all the believers to conform to the standards of conduct, and of social intercourse set up in the Bahá’í Teachings. </p>

<p> As a teaching center, where Bahá’í lectures, conferences and meetings, whether local, regional or national, could be held, the Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds can also prove of invaluable help, and the .S.A. should indeed see to it that the necessary facilities are provided in the building for that purpose. </p>

<p> By thus combining these three features, namely teaching, administrative and social, the Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds can best fulfil its mission, as the visible symbol of the steadily-growing national Bahá’í Community in Northern America, and as the chief rallying center for all its activities and plans throughout that Continent. </p>

<p> Max and Inez Greeven, 6 April 1940 </p>

<p> Dear Mr. and Mrs. Greeven, </p>

<p> Your joint and eagerly-awaited message dated March 25th was indeed most welcome, and the Guardian was truly heartened by its perusal, and rejoiced to know that you are both keeping well, and are continually exerting your utmost for the spread of the Cause in Holland. You should rest assured that your painstaking efforts will in time bear fruit, and should not feel discouraged therefore if you have not so far succeeded in accomplishing any tangible results. Now is the time of seed sowing, and consequently one of slow and painful progress. But the harvest which the future shall reap will be incalculably rich, and great will also be your reward for having so unremittingly toiled in bringing it about.... </p>

<p> Renewing to you both his prayers for your protection and safety in these trying times, and with the seasons warmest greetings. </p>

<p> Yours ever sincerely, H. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-workers: </p>

<p> I wish to assure you in person of my special prayers for your protection in these days of increasing stress and peril. I hope and pray that, despite the prevailing gloom, you may be graciously assisted by the spirit of our Beloved to win over to the Faith a few souls who, however small their number; may be able to lay a firm foundation for the glorious work destined to be accomplished in the days to come. May He inspire you and sustain you always. Your true and grateful brother; Shoghi </p>

<p> 59. Letter from The Guardian via H. Rabbání to Nancy Bowditch. Dated April 7th, 1940. </p>

<p> Dear Mrs. Bowditch, </p>

<p> Your loving message of the 25th March has duly arrived, and kind words of sympathy you had expressed on the occasion of the death of our beloved and distinguished sister Mrs. May Maxwell have imparted deep comfort to the grief-stricken heart of our beloved Guardian. </p>

<p> He truly appreciates your thoughtfulness in thus expressing to him your sorrow over the passing of such a devoted, loyal and spiritually outstanding handmaid of the Cause, and feels profoundly grateful to you, and to those dear and faithful friends who too have joined in conveying to him their utter grief in this very sad bereavement </p>

<p> Mrs. Maxwells departure, so sudden and unexpected, is indeed most significant in the circumstances that have attended it. That she should, in spite of her advanced age and her ill-health, have embarked on so long and tiring a journey to so remote a center as Buenos-Aires, and should have left this world away from her friends and relatives is in itself sufficient proof of the tenacity of her faith, and of her selfless and utter consecration to the service of our beloved Cause. Her death has been indeed that of a martyr, comparable only to that which in recent years Mrs. Keith Ransom-Kehler so courageously met while working for the Faith in Is[f]páhán. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the memory of so glorious a life ever live in the consciousness of the believers, and serve also to inspire future generations of believers to faithfully follow its truly noble example. </p>

<p> The Guardian was pleased to note the very appreciative references you had felt prompted to make regarding our dear sisters Miss Louise Drake Wright and Mrs. Nelson her sister, and wishes you to assure them both how he too appreciates the services which they are jointly engaged in rendering the Cause in Boston. His continued prayer is that they may ever be strengthened in their selfless and loving exertions in its path. </p>

<p> Assuring you also of his prayers, and with the warmest Bahá’í love and greetings, </p>

<p> The first part of Shoghi Effendi’s translation of Epistle To the Son of the Wolf was received in a letter dated May 7, 1940, with the following comment: </p>

<p> “A careful comparison of this new translation of the Guardian with that of Mrs. Chanler’s clearly reveals how inadequate and misleading the latter is both from the point of view of accuracy and of faithfulness. It further shows how unconscientious Aḥmad Sohrab has been in comparing that old translation with the original Persian and Arabic text of the Tablet. His description in the preface of the book of Mrs. Chanler’s rendering as ‘accurate’ and ‘faithful’ is altogether untrue, as not only her translation abounds with mistakes, but also reveals many important omissions. The term ‘Fear of God’ has apparently been deliberately changed in some cases into ‘Love of God’ towards the end of the book, as the French version which she translated proves (it).” </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section944'> 1940-05-15 various to USNSA </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #138 Sept 1940, p1 </p>

<p> In connection with the selection of particular photographs of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for circulation among the friends, the Guardian strongly feels that no definite ruling should be laid down establishing the superiority or distinction of any particular photograph. The friends should be left quite free to use their individual independent judgment in this matter. </p>

<p> The Guardian does not advise your Assembly to authorize for the present the use of Bahá’í historical material in the radio program ... ; nor does he think the time is ripe to translate and publish Bahá’í certificates of marriage and divorce. He prefers to wait until a sufficient number of Assemblies have been empowered to conduct legally these Bahá’í rites. When the time comes he will formulate the proper form of certificate for universal adoption by the American believers. </p>

<p> In connection with the formation of new Assemblies and the maintenance of their Assembly status, the Guardian wishes to reaffirm the general principle that only those who reside within the city limits of any given locality have the right to either vote or be elected as member of the Assembly, even though this may involve frequent dissolution of the Assembly owing to insufficient number of members. It will, on the other hand, serve as a stimulus to those outside these limits to establish a group and eventually an Assembly of their own. This principle should be closely adhered to, otherwise it will lead to confusion and overlapping. </p>

<p> Regarding the age of fifteen fixed by Bahá’u’lláh: this relates only to purely spiritual functions and obligations and is not related to the degree of administrative capacity and fitness which is a totally different thing, and is, for the present, fixed at twenty-one. </p>

<p> Regarding Naw-Rúz: if the vernal equinox falls on the 21st of March before sunset, it is celebrated on that day. If at any time after sunset, Naw-Rúz will then, as stated by Bahá’u’lláh, fall on the 22nd. As to which spot should be regarded as the standard, this is a matter which the Universal House of Justice will have to decide. The American N.S.A. need not therefore take any action in this matter at present. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1940-11-03 to Raymond Rouse on becoming a Bahá’í  </p>

<p> (Written on behalf of the Guardian to Mr. Raymond C. Rouse) November 3rd, 1940 Dear Bahá’í Brother; </p>

<p> I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to gratefully acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated July 17th conveying to him the welcome news of your confirmation in the Bahá’í Faith. </p>

<p> It indeed rejoices his heart to know that through contact with our dear &amp; devoted sister Mrs. Baker you have been introduced to the Bahá’í Teachings, &amp; after careful study &amp; investigation have taken the decision to fully and unreservedly identify yourself with the Cause. He wishes me to heartily congratulate you upon the success of your efforts, &amp; also to express his admiration and gratitude to both Mr. &amp; Mrs. Clarence E. Baker for having been instrumental in bringing you so close to the Faith. His earnest hope &amp; prayer is that through continued association with these devoted souls you will deepen spiritually &amp; get better grounded in the Teachings, &amp; thereby become in turn a pure &amp; effective channel for the propagation of the Message. </p>

<p> The Guardian will specially pray that the opportunity you have had recently presenting the Message to the Bible Class may afford you the full chance you need to bring the Cause to the attention of many individuals of true spiritual capacity, &amp; that you may also thereby acquire the full training necessary for wider &amp; effective service to the teaching field in the future. </p>

<p> Assuring you again of his loving appreciation of your very heartening message, with greetings, </p>

<p> Yours in His service, </p>

<p> R. Rabbání </p>

<p> (and in the Guardians own handwriting) </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the Beloved bless richly your efforts, deepen your understanding of the essentials ofHis Faith, aid you to promote effectively its vital interests. </p>

<p> The concern you have expressed for the Guardian following recent air raids on Haifa. has deeply touched and moved him, and he wishes me to assure you that no casualties whatever have been suffered by any of the believers here, and that all Bahá’í properties and institutions, including the Holy Shrines, have been spared. No doubt, Bahá’u’lláh will continue to vouchsafe His unfailing protection to the believers in every land, how much more to those who are directly and more particularly associated with the administration of the affairs of His Faith, whether at its world-center in the Holy Land or abroad. </p>

<p> With the Guardian’s consent, the National Assembly publishes an excerpt from the letter written by him to Miss Juliet Thompson on November 21, 1940. In giving permission, the Guardian informed the Assembly that “it should be published only for the information of the friends, and does not imply any collective action to be taken by them.” </p>

<p> “With regard to your question concerning the future position of America in the coming world war: it would be certainly premature to make any definite forecast at the present time, and the impression* that the Guardian meant that America would be necessarily drawn into the field of hostilities is also not correct. One thing, however, is absolutely certain, and which the Guardian himself has more than once emphasized, namely that nothing short of a full assumption by America of the grievous burdens, responsibilities and duties that naturally fall upon her as one </p>

<p> of the leading nations of the world can enable her to fulfil the high political mission which she has been called upon to play in the future political and social reconstruction of mankind. The destiny of America is inseparably bound up with that of the rest of the world, and it would be impossible therefore to conceive of her taking, in the long run, a purely passive attitude in regard to political and social developments that transpire in and agitate the remaining four continents of the globe.” </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #143 May 1941 pp2 </p>

<p> Dear and Valued Co-Worker: </p>

<p> The successive communications, whether letters or cables, that have lately been received from the States, whether from the National Assembly or individual believers, eloquently proclaim the magnificent spirit and the remarkable achievements of the American believers. I rejoice and feel deeply thankful for these blessings of Bahá’u’lláh vouchsafed to them in these days of ever-increasing stress and turmoil. </p>

<p> The Guardian’s postcript to letter below. </p>

<p> He has been again most pleased to note that the Temple work is making steady and speedy progress, and that the Trustees hope that the nine faces of the main story ornamentation will be completed by the latter part of next year. </p>

<p> The news of the completion of the reinforced concrete walls, of the entrance ways and areaways, has also been most encouraging to him, and he too hopes that this will now make it possible to go ahead with the grading of the grounds, and also with their seeding, so that by next spring the Temple grounds will look as attractive as possible, especially in view of the great flow of delegates and visitors which the Temple would attract at that time of the year. </p>

<p> As regards the construction of the accessory building, adjacent to the caretaker’s house in the Temple area, the Guardian would urge that every effort should be made to have the building ready as soon as possible for use as headquarters of both the Treasurer and of the Publishing Committee. The transfer of these committees to the vicinity of the Temple and of the Ḥaẓírat’sul-Quds is indeed a step of historic significance and one which is bound to increasing the efficiency and heighten the prestige of the national administrative institutions of the Faith in America. </p>

<p> The photographs you had kindly sent showing the progress of the various construction activities were indeed excellent, and the Guardian has distributed some of them to various pilgrims from Írán who, upon their return home, will no doubt share them with the rest of the believers. They will all derive much needed comfort and encouragement from these pictures, and will surely be further strengthened in their resolve to courageously face and patiently endure the many trials and tribulations to which they are being increasingly subjected. </p>

<p> The N. S. A.’s final jurisdiction over both the National Teaching Committee and the Regional Teaching Committees is certainly indisputable, and is of the same nature and character as the authority to which it is entitled over all other national committees. </p>

<p> The Regional Teaching Committees should henceforth be asked to send their reports directly to the National Teaching Committee, and to ask for their directions as to the most effective way they can carry on their respective teaching tasks.

<p> Regarding the state of the National Fund, which you have reported as suffering from a general slackness in contributions from both individual believers and the local Assemblies and groups. It is only evident that unless the flow of donations is regularly maintained by means of generous and continual support by all the believers, individually and collectively, the National Fund will never be able to meet the needs and requirements of the Cause. particularly in these days when the national activities of the American believers are assuming such wide and increasing proportions. </p>

<p> In the matter of teaching, as repeatedly and emphatically stated, particularly in his ‘Advent of Divine Justice’, the Guardian does not wish the believers to make the slightest discrimination, even though this may result in provoking opposition or criticism from any individual, class or institution. The call of Bahá’u’lláh, being universal, should be addressed with equal force to all the peoples, classes and nations of the world, irrespective of any religious, racial, political or class distinction or difference. </p>

<p> “In America, where racial prejudice is still so widely prevalent, it is the responsibility of the believers to combat and uproot it with all their force, first by endeavoring to introduce into the Cause as many racial and minority groups as they can approach and teach, and second by stimulating close fellowship and intercourse between them and the rest of the community. </p>

<p> “It should be the paramount concern of your committee to foster this aim through every means available. Not only the colored people, who because of the increasing receptivity they are evincing to the Message truly deserve special attention, but all other minorities, whether racial or religious, such as Jews or Red Indians, all alike should be contacted and confirmed. The greater the receptivity of a particular class or group, the stronger should work the desire and determination of the believers to attract and teach its members. In a time when the whole world is steeped in prejudices of race, class and nation, the Bahá’ís, by upholding firmly and loyally this cardinal principle of their Faith, can best hope to vindicate its truth, and establish its right to bring order and peace out of the chaos and strife of this war-torn world.” </p>

<p> The letter put forward by that spiritual and dear friend dated 9 Bahman 1319 has come to the attention of the Guardian of the Cause of God, may our spirits be his sacrifice. The four questions concerning which you asked the favor of a reply from the most holy court were accepted and honored with a response. </p>

<p>    With regard to the crimson scroll mentioned in the unapproachable Tablets,[2] he said, “Write that ‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ said that the original intent of the ‘Crimson Scroll’ is the Tablet of the Covenant, that is, the Book of the Covenant.”[3] </p>

<p>    As for the Sacred Night, the recitation of blessed prayers and Tablets revealed for that night every year, and the inclusion of that night in the Bahá’í calendar, he said: “Write that it is permitted, but including it on the Bahá’í calendar is not required at the present time.” </p>

<p>    As concerns the blessed Tablet of the Bell, and the story of how it was revealed, he said: “Write that this Tablet was revealed in Istanbul at the request of Áqá Muḥammad-‘Alí Iṣfahání as conveyed by ‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá’. This Tablet was written out by the Blessed Beauty[4] in His Own hand on the night of 5 Jumada al-Ulá, the night the Báb received His mission. Reciting this Tablet on that very blessed night is beloved and acceptable.” </p>

<p>    With regard to the last question, about a situation in which the means of consultation is absent and one has trouble making up one’s mind about an important matter, you asked, “How should one consult the Most Holy Book for the purpose of soothsaying?” </p>

<p>    He said, “In such a situation it is necessary and requisite that one turn with complete attention, in the spirit of seeking help, to the source of grace and inspiration, and to no one else. If it is possible to delay a bit in making one’s decision until such time as consultation can be undertaken, this is better and more appropriate.” </p>

<p> Written at his blessed behest. </p>

<p> It is in view of this constant expansion and increasing complexity of the inter-continental activities of the Faith, for which your Assembly has assumed a primary responsibility, that the Guardian has lately re-emphasized the necessity of avoiding over-centralization in the conduct of the affairs of the Cause, thereby relieving your Assembly of an unmanageable amount of detail and routine work, which would interfere with its clear and paramount duty of maintaining a thorough and vigilant supervision over the work of the Cause as a whole. Excessive decentralization, on the other hand, would tend to nullify the principle which places ultimate authority and responsibility in the hands of the National Spiritual Assembly. His recent instruction regarding the relationship of the Regional Teaching Committees to the National Teaching Committee safeguards this principle which lies at the very basis of the Administrative Order. The Regional Committees, although appointed by the N.S.A. should, unlike all other committees, be viewed as special adjuncts created specifically for the purpose of helping directly the National Teaching Committee in its all-important task of stimulating the teaching activities of the Faith in North America. In a sense they are subcommittees of the National Teaching Committee, to whom their reports and all details of the national teaching activity should be constantly and directly referred. </p>

<p> At the present time, in view of the emphasis placed by the Guardian on the teaching phase of the Seven Year Plan, the National Teaching and Inter-America committees acquire great importance and assume added responsibility, and should be supported and encouraged by both the N.S.A. as well as the rank and file of the believers. The resources of the entire community and of the National Fund should be consecrated to this supreme and sacred purpose. The importance acquired by these two committees, however, does not make of them independent bodies, or give them the right to disregard the advice and the general directions of the N.S.A. Otherwise a conflict of authority would ensue within the administration, introducing an evil as pernicious as the tendency to over-centralize the affairs of the Cause in the hands of an over-burdened N.S.A. , depriving it thereby of the vision and the necessary leisure required to ponder the policies, the problems and enterprises which the growth of the Administrative Order engenders. </p>

<p> The Guardian is very pleased to learn of the success that has attended the sessions at Atlanta and the removal of the disagreement within the community of that city and the work achieved by the regional conference and the public meeting open to both races. A special effort, he feels. should now be made to lay a foundation of unity between the white and colored Bahá’ís and weld the groups into communities capable of forming Assemblies representative of both races. </p>

<p> The action taken by your Assembly in connection with rural areas, such as township and county, as different from towns and cities, meets with his approval. He hopes that a special effort will be made to increase the number of Assemblies in these rural areas. This, he believes, is one of the major functions and duties of the National Teaching Committee this year. </p>

<p> The fifty photographs showing the recent progress in Temple construction have been safely received and he has already distributed them among the many pilgrims that came this year from Persia, ‘Iráq, Syria and Egypt. He would appreciate another fifty copies of the Temple photograph as soon as sufficient faces are completed to represent a finished and unobstructed view of the entire edifice. </p>

<p> The material sent to him regarding the legal action taken against the New History Society, as well as copies of their monthly publication, have been received and the Guardian feels that Aḥmad Sohrab is increasingly revealing his latent opposition to the spirit as well as the letter of the Master’s Will and Testament. His references to excommunication flatly contradict the Master’s own actions and attitude, of which he is personally fully aware, and are irreconcilable with some of the most emphatic and unmistakable injunctions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and Testament. His increasingly bold criticisms of the action taken by the Guardian amounts to a repudiation of the authority of the Guardianship, and is thus an open and flagrant violation of the Will establishing that authority. In fact the more he writes and the more he gives vent to his true feelings, and discloses his real attitude to what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has regarded as absolutely essential to the unity, the integrity and protection of the Faith, the more will he clearly demonstrate his disloyalty to the Master whom he professes to uphold and defend. He is no doubt the most subtle, resourceful and indefatigable enemy the Faith has had in America, and the retribution he will in the end suffer will be correspondingly grievous and devastating. Every effort should be made by your Assembly to protect the new believers from the poison which he is trying to instill into their minds and souls, and to reinforce their confidence in his ultimate downfall and complete obliteration. </p>

<p> Regarding the Master’s public talks, copies of which you have sent under separate cover, the Guardian approves of their being made available to the friends as excerpts in “ World Order” magazine. </p>

<p> Will you kindly assure Miss Kruka that the Guardian has received a few copies of the Finnish version of “ Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era,” and wishes her to arrange to have more sent to him for distribution. He would appreciate it if Mrs. Lynch could arrange to send through you a few copies of the Polish version recently published, that the Guardian may place them in the various libraries he has established in the Holy Land. </p>

<p> Regarding the design for the door of the Temple, the Guardian approves your decision not to proceed with any plan for these doors before the exterior ornamentation is completed. Nor should the question of metal grilles for some of the windows be considered at present. Care should be exercised lest the Trustees be led to enter into any new subsidiary contracts in the course of this year, as this would entail a diminution of the funds that should now be devoted to the vital teaching work to be carried out throughout the Americas. </p>

<p> Every endeavor should be made in the course of the year by the National Assembly, the National Teaching and Inter-America committees, as well as the pioneers in various fields, and indeed by each and every individual believer, to extend the scope and consolidate the basis of the teaching campaigns initiated throughout the WesternHemisphere. Any progress achieved in this most vital field at so critical a stage in the secular affairs of the American nations, will vitally affect the spiritual destinies of these republics, though the inter-action of the forces at work in both fields, spiritual and temporal, may not be apparent at the present time. Bahá’u’lláh, the Guardian firmly believes, is releasing through this inter-continental campaign, at a time when decisions vital to the interests of the Western Hemisphere are being taken, forces which, as they reveal their potentialities, will increasingly assist in shaping that World Order which the American peoples of the New World are being called upon to proclaim and establish. </p>

<p> With the assurance of the Guardian’s continued prayers for the success of your historic services. </p>

<p> The paramount and urgent importance of the teaching work both in the North American continent and throughout Latin America cannot be over-emphasized.

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #148 Nov 1941 p2 </p>

<p> Regarding the question whether it is necessary to obtain the consent of the parents of a non-Bahá’í participant in a marriage with a Bahá’í; as Bahá’u’lláh has stated that the consent of the parents of both parties is required in order to promote unity and avoid friction, and as the Aqdas does not specify any exceptions to this rule, the Guardian feels that under all circumstances the consent of the parents of both parties is required. </p>

<p> The Guardian approves the use of the form of report to be filled in by all Latin-American Assemblies. This form, however, should be closely considered by your Assembly, and need not be forwarded to him. as the final action in such matters rests with the N. S. A. This body should exercise the utmost patience, good will, care and vigilance in such delicate and vital matters, should stress the importance of the institution of the local Spiritual Assembly, should take into special consideration the Latin temperament and character, should exercise a general, though not too rigid, supervision over newly formed groups and Assemblies, and should, by every means in its power, maintain, nay, increase, the flow of pioneers and financial assistance to these countries, that constitute, in these critical years, the greatest trust delivered into the hands of the champions of the Bahá’í Faith in North America. He is delighted to learn that there is a possibility of one or more Spiritual Assemblies being formed in South America, besides those of Buenos Aires, Costa Rica and Bahia. There is no doubt that in this particular field the North American believers are exceeding the expectations of the Guardian when he conceived and formulated the Seven Year Plan. What he would urge at the present stage is to insure that an anchorage for the Faith be firmly laid in every Latin Republic. This need not involve the formation of an Assembly, but presupposes the formation of a group of resident believers, who will safeguard permanently and definitely the interests of the Faith during the critical years which lie ahead of the Continent of America. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1941-08-14 to Mr. and Mrs. Raymond C. Rouse on their marriage </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í friends: </p>

<p> The Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters to him of April 13th. </p>

<p> He was very happy to hear that you are both so united in your devotion to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh, as this will greatly bless your marriage itself and give you true and abiding happiness. </p>

<p> A Catholic background is an excellent introduction to the Faith, and one that Mrs. Rouse should feel grateful for having had. Though the doctrines of the church today are no longer needed-as the Father Himself has come, and thus fulfilled the Mission of Christ the son-yet the foundation they lay of spiritual discipline, and their emphasis on spiritual values and adherence to moral laws, is very important and very close to our own beliefs. </p>

<p> The Guardian will pray that you may both grow to become gifted and capable teachers, and thus attract many souls to the Cause. He is very happy to hear that you have set yourselves the goal of bringing more young people into it. The youth today not only greatly need the teachings but are capable of both grasping and living up to them, and it is of the utmost importance to teach them and inspire them with this divine Message. </p>

<p> He is also very pleased to hear that Mr. Rouse is going to study Spanish. This, he hopes, will prepare the way for you to both at some future date aid in the all important inter-America work. </p>

<p> Assuring you of his most loving prayers for you both, </p>

<p> “He has recently cabled the National Assembly that he considers it of the utmost importance that the faces of the Temple be completed and placed in position on the main story with as much expedition as possible. This matter has aroused his grave concern, as the Guardian believes that in view of the relation of the U.S.A. to the international situation, the rising costs, labor shortage, etc.. it may be both increasingly difficult and expensive to complete this work with every month that goes by. He, therefore, would urge you to impress on Mr. Earley — who, he realizes is always eager to cooperate in such matters — the necessity of completing whatever ornamentation of the main story remains, during the winter months, so that at the earliest moment next spring, when the weather permits the work at the Temple itself to be resumed, the last faces may be placed in final position. </p>

<p> “Next to this in consideration should be the teaching work. Nothing must be permitted to hamper or slow down this apostolic campaign which the believers have undertaken. It represents the discharge of their moral duty towards their fellow men. that of permitting them. in these cataclysmic times. to hear the Message their Lord has sent to them and the ways He has prescribed for them to solve their problems and heal their ills. </p>

<p> In the Guardian’s hand: </p>

<p> “Now that the construction of the steps of the Temple has had to be postponed and in view of the increasing gravity of the international situation, a special and pressing responsibility rests on the National Assembly to insure, with the aid of the contractor and through every other possible means, the completion of the nine faces of the edifice before the end of next spring. During the coming winter months the work at the studio should be (so) conducted that no delay whatever will be incurred when the time for the placing of the remaining faces arrives. During these same months, while the teaching work is being strenuously pursued, the most effective measures for the construction of the steps should be carefully considered, and thus insure the uninterrupted progress of this vital aspect of the Seven Year Plan.” </p>

Will you kindly convey to your fellow-National Assembly members both the expression of his deep gratitude for this latest contribution, and his wish that it be the last from them until the Plan is completed in triumph? </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #152 April 1942 p2 </p>

<p> Regarding the efforts that have been made by Mr. Remey in connection with the Tablet supposed to have been revealed by Bahá’u’lláh to the Americas: · the Guardian has already written Mr. Remey that no such Tablet was revealed. In the Aqdas, however, Bahá’u’lláh addresses the rulers and presidents of the American Republics. This has given rise to the misapprehension that He addressed a Tablet to them similar to His Epistles to some of the rulers in Europe. </p>

<p> Concerning the question of refusal by certain believers to accept election to an administrative post: the Guardian strongly feels that criticism, opposition, or confusion do not provide sufficient grounds for either refusal or resignation. Only cases of physical or mental incapacity, which, by their very nature, are extremely rare, constitute valid reasons for such an act. The difficulties and tests involved in the acceptance of administrative posts, far from inducing the believers to dissociate themselves from the work of the Cause, should spur them on to greater exertions and to a more active participation in the privileged task of resolving the problems that confront the Bahá’í commUnity. Only in cases where individual believers, without any valid reason, deliberately refuse the repeated exhortations, pleas, and warnings addressed to them by their Assemblies, should action be taken in removing them from the voting list. This is a measure designed to sustain the institutions of the Faith at the present time, and to insure that the abilities and talents of its, as yet, limited number of supporters are properly consecrated to its service. The believers, for the sake of the Cause, now in the period of its infancy, should accept their duties in a spirit of self-sacrifice, and should be animated by the desire to uphold the verdict of the electorate, and to lend their share of assistance, however difficult the circumstances, to the effective administration of the affairs of the Faith. </p>

<p> The same sanction should apply to those who persistently refuse to dissociate themselves from political and ecclesiastical activities. This is a general principle which is being maintained throughout the Bahá’í world, and the believers throughout the East are already aware of the absolute necessity of refusing any political or Moslem ecclesiastical office. </p>

<p> The Guardian approves the action taken by your Assembly recognizing villages as civil units suitable for the formation of local Assemblies in States where there are no townships, and the county unit is too large for united action by a Bahá’í community. </p>

<p> Regarding the non-appointment of Assembly members to membership on national committees, the Guardian firmly believes that no such principle should be recognized. Those who are best fitted for the specific work assigned to the committees should be elected, irrespective of their membership on either national or local Assemblies. The greater the pressure on those who shoulder both committee and Assembly responsibilities, the greater the reward and the richer the blessings vouchsafed to those who willingly and gratefully sustain this double burden. </p>

<p> In conclusion, the Guardian wishes to re-emphasize the necessity of concentrating during the remaining two years, and in spite of America’s entry into the war, all the resources of the Community on the final aspect of the Seven Year Plan, which can alone bring it to a successful consummation. The difficulties that have arisen should stimulate the friends to greater and still more heroic exertions on behalf of a Cause which they have served and are still serving with such exemplary tenacity, fidelity, vigor, courage and devotion. </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í friends: </p>

<p> The Guardian was very happy to receive your loving letter of Nov. 9th, which just came, and which he has instructed me to answer on his behalf </p>

<p> He is sorry to hear Mr. Baker has not been in good health. He assures you he will pray for you both in the Holy Shrines, that God may strengthen you to go on rendering the Cause such devoted service. </p>

<p> The good news of the many new souls you have been teaching pleased him very much. God has blessed you both with the ability to inspire faith in the hearts of others, a truly great gift. </p>

<p> Regarding your request for a name for the expected baby of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Rouse: the Guardian is very sorry to refuse your request, but from the very beginning he has invariably refused all such requests on the part of the believers, as he felt that this practice of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s, of giving believers names, should be kept sacred to His memory, and not be instated by the Guardian. Please explain this to these dear Bahá’ís, and assure them that the Guardian will pray for their child, that it may become a noble and exemplary believer. </p>

<p> The photographs you enclosed were of interest to the Guardian. His is happy to see that you are able to reach the colored as well as the white, and that you uphold with such devotion the principle of complete lack of prejudice. </p>

<p> For all those whom you mention in your letter; the Guardian will pray; please assure them of this, and he will often remember you both in his loving prayers, that you may render the Cause even greater services. </p>

<p> With Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> Yours in His service to our beloved Faith, </p>

<p> “His thoughts are increasingly turned to the American believers as the end of the First Bahá’í Century approaches, as he feels so strongly the tremendous, worldwide importance which their success involves. They are not merely struggling for the furtherance of the Cause in their native land, but for the achievement of parts of a Divine plan which involves the progress and happiness of all men.

<p> He is well aware that the conditions within the ranks of the believers in respect to race prejudice is [sic] far from being as it should be. However, he feels very strongly that it presents a challenge to both white and coloured believers. </p>

<p> As we neither feel nor acknowledge any distinction between the duties and privileges of a Bahá’í, whoever he may be, it is incumbent upon the Negro believers to rise above this great test which the attitude of some of their White brethren may present. They must accept the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh for the sake of the Cause, love it, and cling to it, and teach it, and fight for it as their own Cause, forgetful of the shortcomings of others. Any other attitude is unworthy of their faith. </p>

<p> Proud and happy in the praises which even Bahá’u’lláh Himself has bestowed upon them, they must feel He revealed Himself for them and every other downtrodden race, loves them, and will help them to attain their destiny. </p>

<p> “The whole race question in America is a national one and of great importance. But the Negro friends must not waste their precious opportunity to serve the Faith, in these momentous days, by dwelling on the admitted shortcomings of the white friends. They must arise to serve and teach, confident of the future in which we know these barriers will have once and for all been overcome. </p>

<p> “… The more Negroes who become Bahá’ís, the greater the leaven will be within their own race working for harmony and friendship between these two bodies of American citizens: the white and the colored. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the Beloved of our hearts guide and sustain you in your constant activities, enable you to increase the number of the coloured believers, whose interests are close to my heart, and for whom I continually and ardently beseech the guidance and the blessings of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> It does indeed seem strange that people who have seen literally prophecy after prophecy fulfilled, and all that the Bahá’ís were led to anticipate, come to pass, still remain veiled from the reality of the Faith and spiritually lethargic. How deeply they will rue their lost opportunity when once their eyes become open! </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi hopes that the N. S. A. and Teaching Committee are meeting with a wider response to the call for pioneers and teachers. The American believers have carried on with such enthusiasm and devotion, and established such a record, that now all the Bahá’ís the world over have the impression that they can do almost anything! They must exceed their own past records for speed and accomplishment in order to triumph in the Seven Year Plan. </p>

<p> The Guardian has already acknowledged the receipt, by cable, of the 100 photographs of the Temple, some of which were sent him air mail, and he has distributed a considerable number already amongst the believers of the Near East, and he feels sure so impressive a photograph of the exterior ornamentation will greatly stimulate the friends in their various activities in the service of the Cause. </p>

<p> He has been informed by the Bahá’ís in Egypt of the receipt of the sum cabled by your Assembly to them for its Memorial to Mírzá ‘Abu’l-Faḍl, and he deeply appreciates your prompt response to his request in this connection. The remains of that illustrious teacher have already been ceremoniously transferred to the new Bahá’í cemetery allocated by the Egyptian government to the Cairo Bahá’ís. The believers in other centers in Egypt are now negotiating with the authorities concerned for similar cemeteries to be established in their respective localities. The Guardian is sending you under separate cover a photograph of the ceremony in connection with the reinterment of Mírzá ‘Abu’l-Faḍl’s remains, for publication in Bahá’í News. </p>

<p> Regarding the question of inserting the names of the translators of Bahá’í sacred writings: the Guardian feels there is no objection to this. As to the manner in which the names of the translators should appear in a book such as “Bahá’í Scriptures” he prefers to leave this matter to the discretion of your Assembly. </p>

<p> The Guardian is cabling you today acknowledging the receipt of 96 copies of The Bahá’í World to date. He has already started distributing them to eminent sympathizers and friends of the Cause in various countries, who, he feels, cannot but be deeply impressed by the steady expansion of the institutions of the Faith in both the East and the West, as witnessed by this book. For such a publication to be brought out and distributed far and wide in time of war is in itself a remarkable testimony to the irresistible march of the Faith and the vitality of its indomitable spirit. He would suggest that three copies of this valuable biennial be sent to every National Spiritual Assembly. The copies for Persia should be sent through the N.S.A. of ‘Iráq. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi has been greatly heartened and cheered by the news of the splendid Convention held this year and its complete consecration to the unfinished tasks of the Seven Year Plan. The character of its sessions, the expansion of its subsidiary activities, the spirit which animated its deliberations and the number of delegates and friends that participated in its proceedings, are a befitting commencement for a year that must witness unprecedented victories in the national and intercontinental teaching fields, as well as the consummation of the thirty year enterprise of the Temple of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> The newly elected National Assembly must, in the course of this crucial year, keep in the closest possible touch with the two major teaching committees on whom the prosecution of the twin teaching enterprises of the American believers directly devolves. In conjunction with them, the National representatives of the American Bahá’í community must, by every means in their power, insure an unprecedented increase in the number of pioneers and visiting teachers, both at home and in foreign fields, for this constitutes the bedrock on which the structure of these enterprises can alone rise and be firmly established. The Guardian’s contribution of five thousand dollars to finance five pioneers, is designed to provide an incentive to those who are in a position to either provide the material means or to arise themselves in person for the furtherance of pioneer activity in virgin territories. </p>

<p> In large rural areas such as exist in the State of Washington, recognized voting districts may be considered as units for the formation of Spiritual Assemblies. The National Assembly, the Guardian feels, may follow in such cases the election district divisions. The application of this principle he leaves to your Assembly. </p>

<p> “To Move the World”, Gayle Morrison, p291 </p>

<p> Regarding the whole manner of teaching the Faith in the South: the Guardian feels that, although the greatest consideration should be shown the feelings of white people in the South whom we are teaching, under no circumstances should we discriminate in their favor, consider them more valuable to the Cause than their Negro fellow-southerners, or single them out to be taught the Message first. To pursue such a policy, however necessary and even desirable it may superficially seem, would be to compromise the true spirit of our Faith, which permits us to make no such distinctions in offering its tenets to the world. The Negro and white races should be offered, simultaneously, on a basis of equality, the Message of Bahá’u’lláh. Rich or poor, known or unknown, should be permitted to hear of this Holy Faith in this, humanity’s greatest hour of need. </p>

<p> This does not mean that we should go against the laws of the state, pursue a radical course which will stir up trouble, and cause misunderstanding. On the contrary, the Guardian feels that, where no other course is open, the two races should be taught separately until they are fully conscious of the implications of being a Bahá’í, and then be confirmed and admitted to voting membership. Once, however, this has happened, they cannot shun each other’s company, and feel the Cause to be like other Faiths in the South, with separate white and black compartments... . </p>

<p> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself set the perfect example to the American believers in this matter-as in every other. He was tactful, but the essence of courage, and showed no favoritism to the white people as opposed to their dark-skinned compatriots. No matter how sincere and devoted the white believers in the South may be, there is no reason why they should be the ones to decide when and how the Negro Southerner shall hear of the Cause of God; both must be taught by whoever rises to spread the Message in those parts. </p>

No matter how sincere and devoted the white believers of the South may be, there is no reason why they should be the ones to decide when and how the Negro Southerner shall hear of the Cause of God; both must be taught by who ever rises to spread the Message in those parts.” — To Mrs. Mabel Ives, July 5, 1942. </p>

<p> Haifa, July 8th, 1942 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother; </p>

<p> Your letter of May 5th has been received, the two pictures of your little son arrived safely with it. the Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> He is pleased to hear that you are serving on the Washington assembly this year; and hopes that you will do all in your power to stimulate the growth of your local community and find new ways and means of teaching the Faith in the Capital. </p>

<p> The greater the love, harmony, and spirit of complete and selfless dedication which animates the members of a spiritual assembly, the greater will be the degree of Divine inspiration and assistance vouchsafed to them. Pioneer service in these epoch-making days need not be confined to going out in foreign fields. The friends can pioneer on their assemblies in helping to bring about a keener vision of what their duties are; they can pioneer in developing new local teaching methods, new contacts with new classes of people; indeed they can even be said to pioneer inwardly in finding new depths in their own souls and new ways in which their own God-given capacities can be put to use in serving the Faith. </p>

<p> The Guardian was very pleased to hear of your teaching activities with Mrs. Baker; and hopes they will meet with ever-increasing success. To teach at present is the paramount duty and privilege of every Bahá’í, who knows full well that the solution to the terrible problems facing the world today lies in Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings. </p>

<p> The Guardian will pray for you and your wife, that you may render the Cause ever greater services. He will also pray for your son Raymond, that God may richly endow him and he may grow up a wonderful Bahá’í. </p>

<p> With Bahá’í greetings, </p>

<p> Yours in His service, </p>

<p> R. Rabbání </p>

<p> (and in the Guardians own handwriting) </p>

<p> Divine Springtime — Louise Coswell Recalls, p59-61 </p>

<p> The progress which the Bahá’ís of Costa Rica have made during the past year is little short of astounding, and shows the deep receptivity the people of that country have to the New Message of God which Bahá’u’lláh has proclaimed to the world. You must all indeed be both proud and grateful that you live in a land so tolerant of progress and which enables you to establish the blessed institutions ordained by our Faith. </p>

<p> The establishment of the new Spiritual Assembly of Puntarenas is a great step forward, and the legal registration of the Cause and approval of the government marks a milestone in the progress of the Cause not only in Costa Rica, but in Latin America. </p>

<p> The more the Guardian receives news from the Central and South American Republics, the more firmly he becomes convinced of the great capacity possessed by the peoples of Latin America. They are proving themselves to be both deeply spiritual and intellectual, and he cherishes great hopes for their future development and their contributions to this glorious Faith of ours. </p>

<p> How wonderful that in less than a hundred years the message that originated in the heart of Persia should have spread to the heart of Central America, and kindled such love and devotion and hope as now burns in the he arts of new believers in that distant continent! </p>

<p> The Guardian hopes that you will not only succeed in establishing further centers in your own native land, but that the activities of the Costa Rican Bahá’ís will spread to neighboring countries and aid in the establishment of the Faith there. </p>

<p> He considers that at present pioneer activity is of the utmost importance and that the NSA should do everything in their power to insure that those who have gone to Central and South America, as well as those who are going there, remain there and consolidate their work-otherwise all the efforts and all the money, sacrificed by the believers for this effort, will have been spent practically in vain. The same applies to a lesser degree to the work in the United States and Canada. Whereas in these parts the difficulties of pioneer settlement for the purpose of teaching the Faith are not so great, the work still remaining to be done is tremendous. The Guardian feels that the paramount need is to get the people to settle in these virgin territories as quickly as possible, and that if too much emphasis is laid on the highest possible requirements for pioneers, the work may risk remaining unaccomplished. The believers have future years in which to improve on the groundwork done at present, but they only have about two years left to do this all-important groundwork in. Speed should be your motto.— </p>

<p> He is fervently praying that the new pioneers, who have volunteered to teach in Colombia, Venezuela, Chile and Nicaragua, will be able to complete the necessary arrangements for their voyage to South America, and will be enabled, without interruption or delay, to consolidate and extend the range of the activities inaugurated in those countries. Every effort should be made to increase the number of such pioneers, to facilitate their departure, to insure their settlement in virgin territories, to keep in close and constant touch with them, and to reinforce their activities through visiting teachers, adequate financial assistance, and constant moral encouragement. The Guardian wishes to urge them, and those who have preceded them, to retain their posts at all costs, to face the obstacles in their path with courage, faith and confidence in the future outcome of their work. The National Assembly, on the other hand, must do everything in their power to enable these self-sacrificing workers to continue their pioneer services, and to discourage their return until the results of their labors are so substantial as to insure the continuity of the Bahá’í Community after their departure. This is their greatest responsibility, their immediate task, and the most meritorious service they can render the Cause, at this juncture, in the American Continent. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Oct. 24th, 1942 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister: </p>

<p> Your welcome letter of July 24th arrived recently with the snapshots you enclosed, and the Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> He was delighted with all the good news you conveyed to him, and most happy to hear that you believe the friends are now fully roused to service in the teaching field in order to accomplish the Seven Year Plan. </p>

<p> He very strongly feels that you must not be at all discouraged by not being put on committees where in the past you have served with such devotion. On the contrary you should regard it as an opportunity to launch out more actively than ever in the teaching field through speaking, writing, and personal contact. We should never for a moment consider our election or non-election to Bahá’í bodies as indicative of the good pleasure or otherwise of God, as it may be due to any number of different reasons, all of them purely human. </p>

<p> He was happy to see that the friends are associating with love and complete lack of prejudice with their fellow-Bahá’ís of negro and Japanese origin. The believers cannot be too careful, at a time when the whole world is consumed with hatred, to keep their hearts untainted and their passions uninvolved. </p>

<p> He wants you to know that he will certainly pray for the way to open for you and your husband to render the Cause many wonderful services in these last years of the Plan. His loving thoughts are with you, and he is always pleased to hear from you. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> R. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p> Your many and valuable services, past and present, should encourage you in your efforts for the promotion of our beloved Faith. The friends, far and near, appreciate the value of these services, and you should not feel depressed or discouraged. I will continue to pray for you from all my heart. Persevere, be happy and confident. </p>

On that occasion they should also celebrate the completion of the exterior ornamentation of their Temple. This meeting, so historic in nature, will thus be both a dedication ceremony of the House of Worship, as well as a celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Faith. While gathered in the auditorium no addresses should be delivered, but appropriate selections from the revealed writings should be read, whether prayers, meditations, Tablets, the addresses of the Master or selections from the Bible or the Qur’án. Passages from the writings of the Báb should be a special feature of the readings selected for this occasion. Singing, whether by soloists or choirs, should form part of the program. The utmost care should be taken to insure that the standard of the vocal music should befit that solemn occasion. The Guardian approves the selection of some of the psalms of David as an evidence of the universality of the Faith which should be amply demonstrated on that occasion. In order to consummate that historic celebration on that day the Guardian suggests that a meeting should be held in the Foundation Hall immediately following the dedication ceremony in the auditorium. at which addresses should be delivered, and non-Bahá’ís be invited to take part. The program for such a meeting should be elaborate and carefully prepared, and every effort should be made to have men of capacity and eminence as well as well-known Bahá’í speakers participate. The agenda of this meeting is left to the discretion of your Assembly, but the Guardian advises you. in view of its importance, to seek the suggestions of the believers before making your final decision. Any new features the friends or the Assembly may wish to add would be most welcomed by the Guardian. who feels that the significance of the Faith, its universality, its world-wide influence. its indestructible unity. its moving history, its world order. its first House of Worship. m the Western World. and its attitude to other Faiths should be clearly and eloquently set forth and explained. </p>

<p> In honor of this unique occasion the Guardian hopes to send a copy of the portrait of the Báb and some of His relics to be displayed for the first time to the assembled believers in the auditorium of the Temple on that memorable evening, after which they should be placed in a safe spot within the Temple together with the Hair of Bahá’u’lláh previously presented to the American believers. Under no circumstances should the portrait of the Báb be left exposed or hung on the wall of the Temple, nor should any copy of it be made. Only on very rare occasions should it be displayed, and whenever shown should be in no other place except the Foundation Hall of the Temple. Its display in the auditorium is permitted only for this occasion. No such portrait is to be found anywhere in the Bahá’í world — with the exception of Haifa-nor is the Guardian contemplating sending any copy at present to any other Bahá’í community. This indicates the importance he attaches to the Temple in America, which he feels is a befitting edifice to enshrine it. The utmost vigilance should be exercised that no copy be made of it in the future, or any attempts be made to reproduce it in any way. </p>

<p> This celebration, on the 22nd of May, 1944, is one feature of the festivities commemorating that historic event. The Convention period, during which these festivities are to be held, should be extended to at least a full week. during which the greatest publicity should be given to the events that are being commemorated. A banquet, at which distinguished friends, sympathizers and admirers of the Cause should be invited to be present, should be held in a befitting setting in the city of Chicago where the Cause was first established in America. In this connection, the Guardian would like to point out that that first center was, as affirmed by Dr. <u>Kh</u>ayru’lláh himself. established by him in 1894. Hence. it is justifiable to consider the establishment of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the continent of America to have begun in 1894. The American believers will, therefore, be celebrating in May, 1944, at once the hundredth anniversary of the establishment of the Faith. the completion of the exterior ornamentation of the Temple, and the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Bahá’í Faith in the Western hemisphere and, indeed, in the entire Western world. To this marvelous coincidence adequate recognition should be given during the dedication ceremony in the form of thanksgiving prayers, in the meetings held in the Foundation Hall of the Temple, at the sessions of the Convention, through the press, and over the radio. </p>

<p> As to this particular Convention itself, the Guardian feels that the Bahá’ís in Central and South America should be invited to participate and to send, if possible, one representative from each country. These representatives would have the right to deliberate and participate in all the discussions of the Convention, only, naturally, for that year. They would not, however, exercise the right to elect the National Assembly which will be restricted to the delegates from the United States and Canada. In a sense the Convention will represent the entire community of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh throughout the Americas, gathered to celebrate, in the newly completed Temple, the centenary of their Faith, and commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of its inception in the Western Hemisphere. </p>

<p> As the number of local Spiritual Assemblies in North America is steadily increasing, and will soon reach a point when it will be impracticable to apportion the 171 delegates among them, and as the number of delegates should not at present be further increased. the Guardian considers it advisable to introduce a new basis for election on the occasion of this historic Convention. This new principle will enable all Bahá’ís. whether belonging to communities that have an Assembly or to groups, and even all isolated believers, to participate in the election of delegates for the national Convention. Such a step has become necessary in view of the fact that the number of the Bahá’ís in localities where there are only groups or isolated believers has increased to such an extent as to constitute more than half of the total number of believers living in localities where there is a Spiritual Assembly. All the Bahá’ís will participate, through this new method, in the election of the national delegates — a step that will greatly increase the electorate, and broaden the basis of Bahá’í representation. The unit will, henceforth. have to be regarded as the State or Province, rather than the locality in which the believers reside. In other words, the hundred and seventy-one delegates will have to be apportioned among the States oi the U.S.A. and the Provinces of Canada, in direct proportion to the number of believers residing in each one of them. The Bahá’ís in each State and Province must either through correspondence or, preferably, by coming together whenever feasible, elect from among all the believers in that State or Province, the number of delegates allocated to them by the National Spiritual Assembly. In those States where there are numerous local Bahá’í communities it may be found advisable to divide each one of them into districts. allocating to each district a portion of the delegates assigned to that State, and in direct proportion to the number of believers Jiving within the specified district. It is for the National Assembly to consider the most efficient methods whereby all the American believers will henceforth be able to participate in the election of their delegates. This method will promote Bahá’í solidarity in every State and Province, and, by bringing together the believers. enable them to function more efficiently and harmoniously, and promote the work of the Cause that lies ahead. No more befitting occasion could be found on which to initiate this measure than when the Bahá’í representatives of North, Central and South America are gathered to celebrate such historic events in the annals of the Cause. </p>

<p> In connection with these celebrations the Guardian would advise your Assembly to consider the following suggestions: </p>

<p> 1. Bahá’ís unable to participate inthe festivities in Chicago and Wilmette should be urged to observe befittingly these anniversaries in their respective localities. Articles in the press, radio broadcasts. invitations to well-known friends and admirers of the Cause. the showing of the Master’s film, the playing of the record of His voice, banquets, exhibitions of the Temple models, etc.. should characterize these festivities. </p>

<p> 2. The special attention of the friends and visitors, during this celebration should be directed to the fact that the event marks also the hundredth anniversary of the birth of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This should be emphasized in the addresses delivered in the special anniversary publication, the souvenir pamphlets, the articles for the press and the radio broadcasts. </p>

<p> 3. A special anniversary publication should be issued under the supervision of the National Spiritual Assembly and following the general lines indicated in the memorandum submitted by them to the Guardian. </p>

<p> 4. The preparation of a smaller souvenir pamphlet, adorned by the Paris photograph of the Master and an artistic reproduction of the Temple, containing a brief outline of the salient events of the first Bahá’í century, and prefaced by a short statement of the aims and purposes of the Faith, attractively bound and to be presented to the distinguished guests participating in these celebrations. </p>

<p> 5 Special instructions to the Bahá’ís of Central and South America to celebrate the occasion and to gather at the exact time of the Báb’s Declaration, and to give as wide a publicity to the event as their resources permit. </p>

<p> 6 The appointment of a special committee as soon as possible to insure the carrying out of the necessary measures. under the close supervision of the National Assembly, for the proper execution of these plans. </p>

<p> 7. An effort should be made to give publicity to this event and its celebration through national radio broadcasts, and, if feasible, to broadcast the ceremony from the auditorium of the Temple. </p>

<p> The Guardian hopes to send a color film of the Holy Shrines and gardens in ‘Akká and Haifa to be shown to the friends at the Convention and circulated amongst the various centers. </p>

<p> In conclusion, he wishes to assure you, one and all, of his special prayers for the success of the mighty efforts which he is sure you will exert to insure the triumph of the Seven Year Plan, as well as the glorious celebrations which must consummate the first Bahá’í century. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #163 June 1943 p2 </p>

<p> Concerning the teaching work in North, Central and South America, the Guardian has already advised your Assembly that the reconstitution of the disbanded Assemblies in the States and Provinces where a Spiritual Assembly already exists does not form an objective of the Seven Year Plan. The friends should concentrate on their goal which is to have at least one Assembly in every State and Province before May of 1944, and at least one permanent resident believer in every Republic in Central and South America. In view of this, special attention should be paid to those Latin Republics where the situation, from the Bahá’í viewpoint of establishing the Faith, is precarious. Every encouragement should be given to those volunteers who express a wish to settle in virgin areas. Nor should there be any delay in arranging for their settlement — whatever their qualifications they should, during these crucial remaining months of the first Bahá’í century, be sent out to the places most urgently requiring attention. Through further urgent appeals for pioneers, through a series of area conferences, through special teaching circuits for the key cities; through constant reminders that the time is getting short; that all volunteers will be acceptable, and will be speedily dispatched to the centers in most need, the success of the Seven Year Plan must be assured and the magnificent undertaking launched by the American Bahá’ís carried to a glorious consummation. </p>

Through further appeals for more pioneers at this eleventh hour; through further self-sacrifice aiming at the provision of ampler funds for the dispatch of these pioneers and other teaching purposes, the few unfinished tasks of the Plan must be speedily accomplished in order to insure the total success of the for thc coming Centenary Celebrations.

<p> We know from His Teachings that reincarnation does not exist. We come on to this planet once only. Our life here is like the baby in the womb of its mother, which develops in that state what is necessary for its entire life after it is born. The same is true of us. Spiritually we must develop here what we will require for the life after death. In that future life, God, through His mercy, can help us to evolve characteristics which we neglected to develop while we were on this earthly plane. It is not necessary for us to come back and be born into another body in order to advance spiritually and grow closer to God. </p>

<p> This is the Bahá’í Teaching, and this is what the followers of Bahá’u’lláh must accept, regardless of what experiences other people may feel they have. You yourself must surely know that modern psychology has taught that the capacity of the human mind for believing what it imagines is almost infinite. Because people think they have a certain type of experience, think they remember something of a previous life, does not mean they actually had the experience, or existed previously. The power of their mind would be quite sufficient to make them believe firmly such a thing had happened. </p>

<p> We must use the Writings of the Prophets as our measurement. If Bahá’u’lláh had attached the slightest importance to occult experiences, to the seeing of auras, to the hearing of mystic voices; if He had believed that reincarnation was a fact, He, Himself, would have mentioned all of these things in His Teachings. The fact that He passed over them in silence shows that to Him, they had either no importance or no reality, and were consequently not worthy to take up His time as the Divine Educator of the human race. </p>

<p> We must turn our faces away from these things, and toward the actual practice of His Teachings in our everyday life through our Bahá’í Administration, and in our contact with other people and the examples we give. </p>

<p> The world that lies ahead of us after this war is going to be in a terrible condition, and if the believers are going to accomplish their duty and present the Divine Solution to mankind, they must prepare themselves for the great tasks that lie ahead. This particularly applies to Bahá’í youth. Young men and womer in the Faith must be deep and thoughtful scholars of its teachings, so that they can teach in a way that will convince people that all the problems facing them have a remedy. ‘They must grasp the Administration. so that they can wisely and efficiently administer the ever-growing affairs of the Cause: and they must exemplify the Bahá’í way of living. All this is not easy-but the Guardian is always greatly encouraged to see the spirit animating such young believers as yourself. He has high hopes of what your generation \vill accomplish. </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í sister: </p>

<p> Your welcome letter of April 23rd reached the Guardian; and the news you convey in it of the spread of the beloved Faith brought him great joy. The formation of an assembly in Peru was indeed a great victory, and added to the chain of Central and South American Bahá’í another precious link. </p>

<p> He is so happy over the work accomplished by the valiant pioneers — and so proud of the record of the American believers achievements: an assembly in every province and state of N. America and a center in every Latin Republic — and so many spiritual assemblies! </p>

<p> He will especially pray for you in the Shrines, and he is deeply appreciative of all you have done for the Cause these last few years in Peru. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> R. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p> Your steadfastness, your devotion, your historic services are assets that I greatly value. I will fervently pray that the Beloved may bless your efforts, guide your steps, cheer your heart and fulfil your dearest wish in His service. </p>

<p> Persevere in your high endeavours and rest assured and be happy. </p>

<p> Your loving message, dated July 23rd, has been received and the Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> He hopes that you will develop into Bahá’ís in character as well as in belief. The whole purpose of Bahá’u’lláh is that we should become a new kind of people, people who are upright, kind, intelligent, truthful, and honest and who live according to His great laws laid down for this new epoch in man’s development. To call ourselves Bahá’ís is not enough, our inmost being must become ennobled and enlightened through living a Bahá’í life. </p>

<p> Regarding the whole question of an international language and its relation to the Faith: We, as Bahá’ís, are very anxious to see a universal auxiliary tongue adopted as soon as possible; we are not the protagonists of any one language to fill this post. If the governments of the world agree on an existing language, or a constructed, new tongue, to be used internationally, we would heartily support it because we desire to see this step in the unification of the human race take place as soon as possible. </p>

<p> Esperanto has been in wide use, more so than any similar language, all over the world, and the Bahá’ís have been encouraged by both the Master and the Guardian to learn it and to translate Bahá’í literature into it. We cannot be sure it will be the chosen language of the future; but as it is the one which has spread most, both East and West, we should certainly continue to co-operate with its members, learn to speak it, and translate Bahá’í literature into it. </p>

When we realize that all marriages, divorces, disposal of inheritance, etc., are now handled in Egypt and Persia solely through the Assemblies and that the believers abide by their decisions, we see that in Western countries the friends still have a long way to go — the sooner they start the better for themselves and for the Faith. </p>

<p> The infallibility of the Guardian is confined to matters which are related strictly to the Cause and interpretation of the teachings: he is not an infallible authority on other subjects, such as economics, science, etc. When he feels that a certain thing is essential for the protection of the Cause. even if it is something that affects a person personally, he must be obeyed, but when he gives advice, such as that he gave you in a previous letter about your future, it is not binding: you are free to follow it or not as you please. • </p>

<p> The question of guidance is a very subtle one. We cannot be positive that an impulse or a dream is guidance. We can seek, through earnest prayer and longing. sincerely to do God’s Will, His guidance. We can try. as you say, to emulate the Master and at all times live up to tho teachings, but we cannot be sure that doing these things we are still making no mistakes and are perfectly guided. These things help us not to make so many mistakes and to receive more directly the guidance God seeks to give us. </p>

<p> Regarding consultation: Any person can refer a matter to the Assembly for consultation whether the other person wishes to or not. In matters which affect the Cause the Assembly should, if it deems it necessary, intervene even if both sides don’t want it to. because the whole purpose of the Assemblies is to protect the Faith, the Communities and the individual Bahá’ís as well. </p>

<p> There is no special physical significance in the remains of the Prophets or relics of Their Persons. But there is a profound spiritual significance in the sense that Their dust was the physical mirror of the greatness of God. In other words we know God through His Prophets, Who have bodies; these bodies — Their very dust — are precious through association. It is natural for people to be touched by a lock of hair or some token of one they loved; how much more should we treasure and feel moved by a relic· of the Beloved of God? </p>

<p> The Báb has told us to bury the dead in silk (if possible) in coffins of crystal. Why? Because the body, though now dust, was once exalted by the immortal soul of man!

<p> As you know, from his various cabled messages, he has been greatly rejoiced over the complete triumph of the arduous Seven Year Plan undertaken by the American believers during a difficult period in world events and carried forward to a glorious conclusion in the very teeth of the tempest of war which has been raging for almost five of the seven years of their heroic endeavor. To complete such a Plan during times of peace and security would in itself have been a great achievement; but to have succeeded during the darkest days of humanity’s abasement and trial, is truly little short of miraculous and nfust forever attest the calibre of the faith and loyalty which fills the hearts of the members of the blessed American Bahá’í community. </p>

<p> His hope and belief is that they will not rest on their oars, but will, their appetites whetted by their successes, carry on their great and noble tasks allotted to them by the Center of the Covenant Himself. </p>

<p> The work that lies ahead of them in the immediate future is clearly defined: The great advantages won for the Faith in the eyes of the public by the remarkable success of the Centenary in Wilmette; the large attendance of believers, the presence of gifted and devoted Central and South American representatives of newly established outposts of the Faith, should be followed up by teaching campaigns, wide publicity and as many radio broadcasts as can be secured. A contact with the masses has, for the first time, to all intents and purposes, since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit, been made, and should be vigorously maintained. Inside the Bahá’í Fold every effort must be exerted to safeguard the newly established Assemblies and prevent them from falling back into group status again. In Latin America the Assemblies must not only be maintained but new ones established in the Republics which have not yet a Bahá’í administrative nucleus. Literature in Spanish and Portuguese should be made available as speedily as possible and disseminated far and wide. Latin American and native Bahá’ís should, whenever qualified, be urged and assisted to pioneer, to travel and to teach in Central and South America, thereby encouraging them to gradually shoulder their own responsibilities. </p>

<p> With such a triumph behind you the Guardian feels confident you will face these many tasks that lie ahead with joy and his prayers will constantly be offered on your behalf and for your inspiration and guidance. </p>

<p> Looking back in Wonder, Phillip Hainsworth, p26-7 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother, </p>

<p> Your welcome letter of November 15, so full of encouraging news, has been received, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer on his behalf. </p>

<p> He was both surprised and delighted to see how much you have been able to do in Norwich, and that the first ‘native’ believer has entered the Faith and is actively assisting you.The work in England has, indeed, progressed slowly from the standpoint of enlarging the Faith’s membership and establishing new centres and assemblies. On the other hand, however, the British Bahá’ís have consolidated the administration and thus prepared the way for intensified teaching activities. They have also built up a very helpful institution in the Publishing Trust, one calculated to impress the public and aid greatly in their own and other countries’ teaching programmes. The Faith there needs more active, devoted young believers like yourself. </p>

<p> Regarding your question concerning your future plans; the Guardian strongly advises you to devote yourself to teaching the Faith in the British Isles. The need is very great for the people, emerging from so much suffering into a still deeply troubled immediate future, to hear of the Cause. Also the recently undertaken Six Year teaching Plan requires a great effort on the part of the English Bahá’ís, and your services are very much needed in this field. </p>

<p> Please convey his loving greetings to Mr Tellerman and Miss Bird. He will pray for them, and particularly for you, that you may render the Cause many services. </p>

<p> With Bahá’í Greetings, R. Rabbání </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #179 January 1946 p1 </p>

<p> Regarding Mr. Smeskal’s question about the Covenant-breakers: Bahá’u’lláh and the Master in many places and very emphatically have told us to shun entirely all Covenant — breakers as they are afflicted with what we might try and define as a contagious spiritual disease; they have also told us, however, to pray for them. These souls are not lost forever. In the Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh says that God will forgive Mírzá Yaḥyá if he repents. It follows, therefore, that God will forgive any soul if he repents. Most of them don’t want to repent, unfortunately. If the leaders can be forgiven it goes without saying that their followers can also be forgiven... . </p>

<p> Also, it has nothing to do with unity in the Cause: if a man cuts a cancer out of his body to preserve his health and very life, no one would suggest that for the sake of “unity” it should be reintroduced into the otherwise healthy organism! On the contrary, what was once a part of him has so radically changed as to have become a poison. </p>

The believers, no,w more sure of their own powers and of the Divine help that has so unfailingly :reached them than at any previous period in their fifty-year history, must continue to put forth a mature, dedicated and sustained effort so that these new Assemblies whether in North or South America may be preserved and reinforced and, where necessary, re-instated. Groups, though of secondary importance, should likewise be enlarged and built up to Assembly status so that the truly remarkable victory achieved by the American and Canadian Bahá’ís may not shrink in dimension as the months go by, but rather flower into still greater victories in the days to come. </p>

<p> He also wishes to call your Assembly’s attention to the great importance of Magallanes as a center, and of the necessity of extending it every assistance, so that this Bahá’í year an Assembly may be firmly established there. It, together with that of Alaska, may be likened to the extremity of the Bahá’í arms stretched out and waiting to embrace the whole world in the order of peace and love which Bahá’u’lláh has established for the children of men in this day. </p>

<p> In closing the beloved Guardian wishes me to assure you and your fellow-members of his most loving prayers on your behalf and for the success of the many tasks of importance which you are, in collaboration with the mass of the believers, seeking to carry to a successful conclusion. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í greetings, </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1079'> 1944-xx-xx formation and dissolution of Spiritual Assemblies </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #269 July 1944 p4 </p>

<p> In connection with your Assembly’s two actions regarding the formation and dissolution of Spiritual Assemblies: The Guardian approves of your first action, which he understands is only for this last year of the first Bahá’í Century, as, of course, in the future Assemblies will be formed only during the month of April. As to the second action, however, any Assembly which is dissolved must immediately report to the national secretary, who must always keep an up to date list of Assemblies. Any dissolved Assembly cannot be reconstituted until the time of election in April. This is the general principle which must be followed in the future. In this last year of the Century, however, naturally any Assembly that is dissolved may be reconstituted as soon as the number of believers reverts to nine again. </p>

<p> Regarding your question as to the changing of pronouns in Bahá’í prayers: The Guardian does not approve of such changes, either in the specific prayers or in any others. They should be read as printed without changing a single word. </p>

<p> The question of young Bahá’í’s being permitted to serve on committees other than the Youth Committee has been raised in a number of letters recently, and in considering the matter he felt that Bahá’í young people under twenty-one should not be denied the privilege of committee work. Though they cannot be voting members of Bahá’í communities (or exercise the electoral vote at all until they reach that age), and though they cannot, likewise, be elected to Assemblies, there is no reason why they should not serve the Cause on various committees as all committees, national or local, are subordinate to Assemblies and their members not elected but appointed, and appointed by Assemblies. We have many devoted and talented young believers who can be of great assistance to the Cause even though not yet legally of age. </p>

<p> If it seemed to the believers that their pioneer activities were of vital importance during the closing decade of our first Bahá’í Century and in the midst of a most tragic world war, they must now grasp the fact that the maintenance of the goals they have won and the winning of new ones is of even more crucial importance as the war draws towards an end and the people turn their bewildered minds to thoughts of peace. We face a most challenging period iq the days to come, and the friends must gird themselves for action with a calm faith. a united and self-sacrificing devotion to their tasks, and a consciousness that if they struggle hard to accomplish them they will witness even greater triumphs than those of the last seven or eight years which so gloriously rewarded their untiring labors. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #174 April-May 1945 p2 </p>

<p> He fully approves of the concept of uniting the believers’ labors through focussing them on nation-wide teaching campaigns and so on. But he feels that the friends should constantly be encouraged to bear in mind certain salient facts: Bahá’u’lláh has brought a new system and new laws and standards of personal as well as racial conduct into the world. Although outside agencies have been to a certain extent illumined by the radiance of His Message and doctrines, and are exerting efforts to bring the world into that orbit of universal peace and harmony He has set for it, these outside forces cannot achieve what only the followers of His Faith can. The believers must not take their eyes off their own immediate tasks of patiently consolidating their administrative institutions, building up new Assemblies in North, Central and South America, and laboring to perfect the Bahá’í pattern of life. for these are things that no other group of people in the world can do or will do. and they alone are able to provide the spiritual foundation and example on which the larger world schemes must ultimately rest. At the same time every effort should be made to broadcast the Teachings at this time, and correlate them to the plight of humanity and the plans for its future. Both tasks should go forward simultaneously — internal consolidation and expansion. and a wider contact with the masses, maintained through public meetings, radio, publicity, etc. </p>

<p> The Guardian has already laid down the principle that any one claiming to be a Bahá’í from Persia must have his properly issued credentials from the N. S. A. of Persia before he can be accepted by any other Bahá’í community ... . Now that the doors are opening increasingly for students and travelers to go to America, the National Assembly can not be too careful and vigilant in this matter. The Master, as you know, was very strict, and the Guardian feels it his duty at this time to be equally strict and observant of the measures introduced by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself. </p>

A glance at the pressing problems facing the world is enough to convince any Bahá’í that there is no ultimate solution for its ills except that provided by Bahá’u’lláh. It is therefore of the greatest conceivable importance the manner in which the teachings are presented to a nation with such a leading role in international affairs at the present time as that of the United States.

<p> Regarding your reference to Dr. Aguilar, who seems to be a very enlightened and sincere man, the Guardian feels that you might point out to him that if he, as a Bahá’í, should insist on the right to support a certain political party whose platform he considers highly meritorious, he cannot very well deny the same degree of freedom to other believers; which would mean that within the ranks of a Faith whose primary objective is to unite all men as one great family under God, there would be Bahá’ís opposed to each other, and because of the very nature of politics, in violent disagreement with each other. Where then would lie the example of harmony and unity for which the world is seeking? </p>

<p> The Guardian will pray that Dr. Aguilar may feel moved to sacrifice his political associations in order to fully support the Divine system which is the remedy for all the ills of all the people in the world. He will also pray that your friend Irene Silva de Santolalla will feel moved to courageously espouse the Faith which she so admires. </p>

<p> Your long and patient service in Peru has yielded a fruitful harvest, and the Guardian is very pleased over the reports you have given him. He feels you are the best to decide whether you should at present go home for a rest or not, as you can better judge if your temporary absence will seriously affect the work there or not. Meantime you may be sure he will pray for your continuous success, guidance, and health. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> R. Rabbání </p>

<p> P.S.: He thinks it would be an excellent idea to translate some of the teachings into the native Indian languages. </p>

<p> With the assurance of my lively and abiding appreciation of your truly remarkable efforts and services, and of my continued and fervent prayers for the extension of your valued activities, and the full realization of your dearest hopes in the service of our beloved Faith, </p>

<p> Your true and grateful brother, </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #210 August 1948 p3 </p>

<p> People are so markedly lacking in spirituality these days that the Bahá’ís should consciously guard themselves against being caught in what one might call the undertow of materialism and atheism, sweeping the world these days. Skepticism, cynicism, disbelief, immorality and hard-heartedness are rife, and as the friends are those who stand for the antithesis of all these things they should beware lest the atmosphere of the present world affects without their being conscious of it. The Guardian agrees with you that a higher standard would be required before World Order could attract people of marked intellectual capacity; but he feels that the friends should make a greater effort to see that it gets supplied with better material; they should raise the standard of the present publication. </p>

<p> 1. &amp; 2, The supreme Tribunal is an aspect of a world Superstate; the exact nature of its relationship to that state we cannot at present fore-see. </p>

<p> 3. Supreme Tribunal is the correct translation; it will be a contributing factor in establishing, the Lesser peace. </p>

<p> 4. There is no statement in the teachings indicating that the Lesser Peace will definitely be established by 1957 or 1963. </p>

<p> 5. The Most Great Covenant is different from the Everlasting Covenant. </p>

<p> 6. No, Bahá’u’lláh did not bring a complete system of economics to the world. </p>

<p> 7. Profit~sharing is recommended as a solution to one form of economic problems. </p>

<p> 8. There is nothing in the teachings against some kind of capitalism; its present form, though, would require adjustments to be made. </p>

<p> 9. Islám attained a very high spiritual state, but western scholars are prone to judging it by Christian standards One cannot call one world Faith superior to another, as they all come from God; they are progressive, each suited to certain needs of the times. </p>

<p> 10. Of course, Man divides; only the Power which comes from God can unite. </p>

<p> 11 &amp; 12. The Seven Lights of Unity will not necessarily come in the 3 order given. A product of the second may well be universal culture. </p>

<p> l3_ “Insaf” should be thought of as fairness. </p>

<p> 14. Through meditation doors of deeper knowledge and inspiration may be opened_ Naturally, if one meditates as a Bahá’í he is connected with the Source; if a man believing in God meditates he is tuning in to the power and mercy of God; but we cannot say that any inspiration which a person not knowing Bahá’u’lláh, or not believing in God, receives is merely from his own ego. Meditation is very important, and the Guardian sees no reason why the friends should not be taught to meditate, but they should guard against superstitions or foolish ideas creeping into it. </p>

<p> 15. In quoting prayers any part may be used, but should be quoted as it is, however short_  </p>

<p> 16. The Manifestations no doubt had some consciousness of Their station, but what the nature of that consciousness was we do not know_  </p>

<p> 17. Those who have never had any opportunity of hearing of the Faith but who lived good lives will no doubt be treated with the greatest love and mercy in the next world, and reap their full reward. </p>

<p> 18. There is no objection. to using Rúḥí’s book on mysticism. </p>

<p> 19. We believe that Christ only was conceived immaculately. His brothers and sisters would have been born in the natural way and conceived naturally. </p>

<p> 20. Both Caliphate and Imámate mean successorship. Either term could be used, </p>

<p> 21. Shoghi Effendi has always made it quite clear that, in the future, the teachings may be retranslated, if the need arises. </p>

<p> 22. There is nothing in the teachings against swimming and dancing; mankind will become nobler, this we know; if that will include or eliminate such pastimes we do not know at present. </p>

<p> Regarding your suggestion to the N.S.A. about a People’s Peace Conference. The idea and the aims are excellent, but the Guardian does not feel that the believers are as yet in a position to undertake such a major step; if the friends seek to carry out a thing of such importance and find that they cannot-through lack of members, prestige, funds, or any other reason,—see the thing through to a successful conclusion, they will have done the Cause a serious injury by making it seem just one more ripple on the surface of a disturbed and turbulent society. They must first build the fabric of their community life so solidly that it can bear the strain which such an undertaking would place upon it, and which, by its very nature, would focus the eyes of the press upon the Bahá’ís everywhere in the world. </p>

<p> In view of all the German and Austrian Bahá’ís have passed through, and the naturally disorganized state of their affairs, after so long a period of supression and suffering, he feels that your Assembly should by all means do all in its power to help them and protect them. If you feel that the suggestion of Mr. Eichanauer is feasible, he advises you to carry it out. Although he has stated that the Bahá’í mission in Central and South America must be completed before the American believers can start teaching campaigns in other countries, this does not mean that those friends whom duty or business takes abroad are not to serve the Cause all they possibly can. Likewise it does not mean that help should not be given to Bahá’í brothers and sisters in desperate need-such as is the case at present in Burma, the Philippines. Austria and Germany. </p>

<p> In view of the terrible conditions prevailing in Europe today, and the tremendous suffering which the German and Austrian Bahá’ís have passed through, both spiritually and physically, the Guardian wishes you to please make every effort to send, during the rest of this Bahá’í year and the coming one. the contribution of the American and Canadian Bahá’ís to the International Fund, to these believers, for their relief and succor. He urges your Assembly to also make every effort to supply them with Bahá’í books in German, either published in the United States or Switzerland-whichever is most speedy, economical and practical. </p>

<p> “He was very pleased to see the excellent publicity the Cause received in The Chicago Sunday Tribune, and hopes that more will be forthcoming, of a similar nature, all over the country. In this connection. he sees no objection to using the advice and services of non-Bahá’í experts, or agencies, as long as the purity of the Teachings and the dignity of the Faith are maintained </p>

There is also no reason why work should not be done among and in cooperation with the Mexicans, the Chinese and so on. </p>

<p> “The Negroes, likewise, are, one might say, a key problem and epitomize the feelings of color prejudice so rife in the United States. That is why he has so constantly emphasized the importance of the Bahá’ís actively and continuously demonstrating that in the Faith this cruel and horrible taint of discrimination against, and contempt for, them does not exist but on the contrary is supplanted by a feeling of esteem for their great gifts and a complete lack of prejudice in every field of life. </p>

<p> “The work of the Race Unity Committee should include, as far as is possible, contacts with all minority groups, and wherever there is a particularly stout prejudice against a special group-such as the feelings against the Japanese in the Western States and the Negroes in the Southern (states), etc., efforts should be made to counteract it by showing publicly the Bahá’í example of loving tolerance and brotherly association.” </p>

But there is no doubt that spirit and soul seem to have been interchanged in meaning sometimes; soul and mind have, likewise, been interchanged in meaning, no doubt due to difficulties arising from different translations. What the Bahá’ís do believe though is that we have three aspects of our humanness, so to speak, a body, a mind and an immortal identity — soul or spirit. We believe the mind forms a link between the soul and the body, and the two interact on each other. </p>

<p> Historians cannot be sure Socrates did not visit the Holy Land. But believing as we do that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had an intuitive knowledge quite different from our own, we accept His authority on the matter. </p>

<p> We cannot prove man was always man for this is a fundamental doctrine, but it is based on the assertion that nothing can exceed its own potentialities, that everything, a stone, a tree, an animal and a human being existed in plan, potentially, from the very “beginning” of creation. We-don’t believe man has always had the form of man, but rather that from the outset he was going to evolve into the human form and species and not be a haphazard branch of the ape family. </p>

<p> You see our whole approach to each matter is based on the belief that God sends us divinely inspired Educators; what they tell us is fundamentally true. What science tells us to-day is true; to-morrow may be entirely changed to better explain a new set of facts. </p>

<p> When ‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá says man breaks the laws of nature, He means we shape nature to meet our own ends, as no animal does. Animals adapt themselves to better fit in with and benefit from their environment. But men both surmount and change environment. Likewise when He says nature is devoid of memory he means memory as we have it, not the strange memory of inherited habits which animals so strikingly possess. </p>

<p> These various statements must be taken in conjunction with all the Bahá’í teachings; we cannot get a correct picture by concentrating on just one phrase. </p>

<p> The Guardian hopes this will better enable you to understand our wonderful Faith — for a living religion it is, and not merely a philosophy. </p>

<p> He wishes you every success in your labors to promote the unity and enlightenment of mankind, so sorely needed these days, and he will pray for your happiness and spiritual advancement. </p>

<p> With cordial greetings,	 </p>

<p> The use of “Alláh–u–Abhá” in the East is, generally speaking, confined to a greeting. It is not said at the end of prayers and the Guardian feels that the less it is used freely in public by the Bahá’ís in the West (before strangers) the better, as it gives a very peculiar impression of us, and makes us seem like some strange Oriental sect. </p>

<p> As obligatory prayers require either genuflection or ablution and orienting toward Bahjí, they cannot truly be said by one person for a group of people without it being in effect a form of congregational prayer, so he thinks it better to avoid it. </p>

<p> It is far too early to make any predictions about peace of any sort, judging by the ebullitions of the world’s affairs these days! ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in His Tablets, connects the prophecy of Daniel (1957) with the proclamation and spread of the Cause. Other references regarding this date must be considered as hearsay.” </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1130'> 1946-07-20 various to USNSA </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #188 October 1946 pp2-3 </p>

<p> You can well imagine that much of his thoughts are now centered on the work of the new Seven Year Plan. Its tremendous importance cannot be over emphasized, for on its success hangs the success or failure of the future work which ‘Abdu’l — Bahá in His wisdom apportioned to the Bahá’ís of North America. The Guardian, however, having had now for 25 years the experience of working with the American believers, no longer has any doubts as to their capacity for work, their devotion, their loyalty and their determination to never fail their Faith! It is therefore with a mind at rest and a confident heart that he has entrusted to them the great tasks of the next seven years. </p>

<p> As regards the whole question of the Temple and services held in it: </p>

<p> He wishes to emphasize that he is very anxious, now that this first and greatest Temple of the West has been built, and will, within a few years, be used for worship and regular services by the Bahá’ís, that no forms, no rituals, no set customs be introduced over and above the bare minimum outlined in the teachings. The nature of these gatherings is for prayer, meditation and the reading of writings from the Sacred Scriptures of our Faith and other Faiths; there can be one or a number of readers; any Báhá’í chosen, or even, non-Bahá’í, may read. The gatherings should be simple, dignified, and designed to uplift the soul and educate it through hearing the creative word. No speeches may be made, no extraneous matter introduced. </p>

<p> The use Of pulpits is forbidden by Bahá’u’lláh; if, in order to be more clearly heard, the person reading stands on a low platform, there is no objection, but this should not be incorporated as an architectural feature of the building. </p>

<p> As he already informed you by cable, he thinks that the best seating arrangement from every standpoint is that the section of the audience in the center of the auditorium, beneath the dome, should face towards ‘Akká, and all the other seats around this central space should be placed in the form of a circle so that the seats face inwards towards the center of the Temple. In other words a central mass facing ‘Akká-wards, surrounded by circular rows of seats facing inwards. </p>

<p> The reader should stand where he or she will be best seen and heard by all. All minor details regarding this matter are left to the discretion of your Assembly to decide after receiving the advice of experts. As he already informed you, he suggests using fixed rather than movable seats. </p>

<p> Vocal music alone may be used and the position of the singers or singer is also a matter for your Assembly to decide; but again, there should be no fixed point, no architectural details marking a special spot. Acoustics should certainly be the main consideration in placing the singers. </p>

<p> The Guardian feels that the Temple, if divided into an auditorium and eight or nine small rooms, would have a far too circumscribed seating capacity for a National House of Worship and that also the small rooms would serve no useful purpose whatever. In view of this he instructed you to do away entirely with these superfluous rooms; the whole main floor of the building should form one vast auditorium with no dividing walls at all. What provision for keeping the cold out, and what entrances you wish to make constant use of, are matters for your Assembly to decide after receiving expert advice. </p>

<p> Color may be used in the interior— and, indeed, it was Mr. Bourgeois’ intention to use it, as the original cross-section showing the interior, which now hangs here in the archives, shows: (The photographic plate and reproduction of this drawing you already received.) The Guardian feels very strongly that you should adhere as much as possible to the architect’s own design for the interior-otherwise the homogeneity of the building will be destroyed, which would be a fatal mistake. Any modifications should be in the nature of eliminating or simplifying-and only when absolutely necessary— Bourgeois’s designs, and such changes should only be made by an experienced architect and decorator, and not be left to the discrimination of mere laymen. </p>

<p> He approves of lighting being employed as part of the decorative scheme, but suggests you avoid anything in the nature of producing a gloomy or bizarre effect. </p>

<p> As he cabled you, he approves of opaque white glass being used wherever recommended on the ground floor in order to provide the interior with the necessary privacy. </p>

<p> Very careful consideration should be given to the acoustics of the auditorium, and wood or any other material may be used in the interior in order to facilitate this. </p>

<p> The use of all nine or only a certain number of entrances is left to you to decide in consultation with your advisers. </p>

<p> He need not tell you how very important the decisions are which you will now be called upon to make in connection with completing the Temple interior. He urges you, at all times, to receive the very best technical advice, and to bear in mind that the main thing is that the meetings in the Temple should be conducted in a beautiful and peaceful setting, in comfort and with dignity and simplicity, and that the audience should be able to hear perfectly and the tone values be pleasant to the ear. </p>

<p> Music, as one of the arts, is a natural cultural development, and the Guardian does not feel that there should be any cultivation of “Bahá’í Music” any more than we are trying to develop a Bahá’í school of painting or writing. The believers are free to paint, write and compose as their talents guide them. If music is written, incorporating’ the sacred writings, the friends are free to make use of it, but it should never be considered a requirement at Bahá’í meetings to have such music. The further away the friends keep from any set forms, the better, for they must realize that the Cause is ‘ absolutely universal, and what might seem a beautiful addition to their mode of celebrating a Feast, etc., would perhaps fall on the ears of people of another country as unpleasant sounds-and vice versa. As long as they have music for its own sake it is all right, but they should not consider it Bahá’í music. </p>

<p> Any blatant acts of immorality on the part of the Bahá’ís should be strongly censored; the friends should be urged to abandon such relationships immediately, straighten out their affairs, and conduct themselves as Bahá’ís; if they refuse to do this, in spite of the warnings of the Assembly, they should be punished through being deprived of their voting rights. The N.S.A. is empowered to settle such cases of flagrant immorality without referring them to the Guardian. </p>

<p> As he already informed you by cable, the West Indies, Mexico and Panama are considered part of Central America, and will be under the jurisdiction of the Central American N. S. A. The Canal Zone and Puerto Rico also are part of this area and under its jurisdiction. Two N. S. A.’s will be formed; one for Central and one for South America. They will adopt their own constitutions after election, which should follow as closely as possible that of your own body. This new constitution — for obviously these two new N. S. A.’s will not seek for Latin America to have two different ones — will be in Spanish, and will be published in the Bahá’í World, there to join its sister constitutions in English, German, Arabic and Persian. The Canadian constitution should, likewise, be patterned on and closely follow your own. </p>

<p> Your Assembly must determine the number of delegates, and call the first Conventions of these three new national bodies, and they must receive a certain amount of supervision and guidance from you until the end of the present Seven Year Plan, when they will pass directly under the supervision of the Guardian. Your Assembly is, so to speak, their sponsor, and they will become independent at the end of this present plan. </p>

<p> There is no objection whatsoever to non-Bahá’ís being present when the long prayer for the dead is read, as long as they respect our manner of reading it by rising and standing as the Bahá’ís do on this occasion. Nor, indeed, is there any objection to non-Bahá’ís being present during the reading of any Bahá’í prayer for the departed. </p>

<p> An official Bahá’í funeral service should only be given for a believer, but there is no objection to the reading of Bahá’í prayers, or indeed to a Bahá’í conducting the funeral service of a non-Bahá’í, if this has been requested. </p>

<p> In reporting Bahá’í marriages it is much better to mention that the ceremony was performed by the Assembly, as this is the proper thing to do, and an individual only acts for the Assembly on this occasion. As a funeral is not a legal ceremony more latitude can be allowed, especially as the family of the deceased may want some particular Bahá’í friend to officiate. </p>

<p> Concerning the question of the Philippines, they are not under your Assembly’s jurisdiction, but you can. being such a sturdy and prosperous community, lend them a helping hand and advise them. The Guardian urges great caution, however, in handling the situation there; this is a new community which has never had any close contact with Bahá’ís from other countries, and well organized and recognized administrative bodies — such as existed in Germany, Austria and Burma before the war. You should ascertain if the people requesting help really need it, and are really Bahá’ís. He would not recommend that anything more than food parcels, clothes, and Bahá’í literature be sent them at present, and he hopes the way will open for a competent Bahá’í teacher to visit them, and help them organize their affairs on a true Bahá’í basis. </p>

<p> He feels that sufficient relief funds have now been accumulated in Ṭihrán, and that, except for any parcels of food and gifts individual believers may still wish to send, any sums on hand for this purpose should be directed into the European teaching and publishing work. </p>

<p> The Guardian approves in principle of a radio station, and sees no objection to its being in the Temple; but he considers the cost you quote too much of a burden at the present time for the Fund to bear, in view of the multiple expenses of the new — Seven Year Plan. If there is any way it can be done for a price you feel the Fund could pay, and which would be more reasonable, he approves of your doing it. </p>

<p> HOLOCAUST AND THE GREATER PLAN OF GOD (Revised 1998) </p>

<p> A compilation by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice </p>

<p> Our Bahá’í attitude towards the Jewish question and Palestine is not difficult to define: first we have the prophecy of the Master in “Some Answered Questions”; how much that entails we cannot be sure of; all we can say is that God has forgiven the Jews in this Dispensation and that they will return to their homeland. We must not go further than this. </p>

<p> Second, we must discuss their problem with sympathy, but dispassionately; we are not concerned with, and must-for the protection of the Faith-keep out of, political controversies; all we can say is that the Jews, like every other minority in the world, are entitled to help, consideration, and justice. We must be broad in our approach to all such extremely heated controversies, and while giving our Bahá’í point of view, not take sides. </p>

<p> Needless to say we profoundly sympathize with the Jews, and deplore with all our hearts the cruel treatment they have received. </p>

<p> Looking back in Wonder, Phillip Hainsworth, p55-6 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother, </p>

<p> Your letter of June 17th was received, and the beloved Guardian was delighted to receive your good news; both of the state of the Cause in England and the acceptance of the Faith by three new people in Egypt. </p>

<p> He hopes that the way will open for you to both enter the pioneer field and also provide for your dear parents. He was very sorry to hear of your father’s condition, and assures you he wifi supplicate for him in the holy shrines, that Bahá’u’lláh may assist him and bless him, and that God’s will for him may be done. </p>

<p> What the Guardian meant by appealing more directly to the masses is that the British Bahá’ís must try to acquaint the public with the teachings through public meetings and disseminating literature; this still does not mean they are in a position to launch activities on a scale comparable with what is being done in America: as he told you, their primary consideration at the present time must be to bring people into the Faith, in order to speedily achieve the goals of the Six Year Plan. This has precedence over everything else. </p>

<p> He hopes the Summer School will be a great success, and wishes you well in your devoted efforts to stimulate the friends to take immediate action! You may be sure he will pray for you and your family. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi wants to particularly emphasize the need for more pioneers and travelling teachers, most particularly in the European field. The present very unsettled state of the world, the confusion and suspicion which seems to be growing rather than dissipating, necessitates immediate action; no postponement to future years of an increase of workers abroad can be permitted, if the goals of this second Seven Year Plan are to be successfully achieved. Indeed a time may come when the friends will look back and regret every hour of delay as a priceless opportunity irrevocably lost! Rapid as has been the work in Latin America, the work in Europe must go forward at a much more urgent pace. Although he feels the European Teaching Committee has already done wonderfully well, he urges you to appeal to the believers to arise in far greater numbers, and go abroad at once, heedless of the sacrifices involved. He himself, through his personal correspondence is constantly pressing the Bahá’ís to volunteer for this service, and hopes during the coming months many more people will place themselves at your disposal for this all important service. </p>

<p> Arnold van Ogtrop, 20 November 1946 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother, </p>

<p> Your welcome letter, dated August 19th, has been received, and our beloved Guardian was very pleased to hear from you, as he had already received news of your attachment to the Faith from the English believers. He has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> He has great hopes for the rapid development of an assembly in Holland; the Dutch people are a fine race, tolerant, intelligent and kindly, and a center in Holland would greatly reinforce the Cause in Europe. Now that the new Dutch Bahá’ís are going to be active there in spreading the teachings, you will have the benefit of their help, and through your united labours should soon be able to establish a group of interested people. </p>

<p> He was also very pleased to hear of your visit to the Swiss Bahá’ís; they are devoted and persevering, but need outside help and stimulation. Your experience at the Summer School in England will also be of great help to you, for when the friends gather for study and consultation they really feel the depths of the bonds which unite us in the Faith of God for this day. </p>

<p> You may be sure his ardent prayers will be offered for the success of your Bahá’í work, and he will also pray for your father and for the soul of your dear mother, that in the worlds beyond she may have the joy of recognizing Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> He would welcome news of your activities and of the progress of the work there. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í greetings, R. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p> I was so glad to hear from you and to be assured of your noble sentiments and determination to serve our beloved Faith. I assure you of my loving and fervent prayers on your behalf and of my eagerness to hear of the progress of your work to which I attach the utmost importance. Persevere in your noble task, and be assured and happy. Your true brother, Shoghi </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp49-50 </p>

<p> Rita van Bleyswijk Sombeek, 2 February 1947 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister: </p>

<p> Your letter of November 9th was received, together with that of your dear sister, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. </p>

<p> He was so happy to see that your sister has embraced the Faith and arisen to serve it with you with so much devotion and enthusiasm. He was also very pleased to see you were able to attend, together, both the Convention and the Summer School at Greenacre. These experiences have no doubt deepened your knowledge of the Faith and your attachment to it. </p>

<p> The work in Holland is very promising, and he feels sure you both, with Mr. van Ogtrop, will soon see tangible results of your devoted labours. </p>

<p> The translation work is of the utmost importance and as soon as you have at least the Esslemont in printed form you will be able to start your teaching work on a large scale. You should keep in close touch with Mrs. Graeffe in Geneva and, as far as practicable, with your co-workers in nearby countries. This will both help and inspire you and cement the bonds of the love of Bahá’u’lláh which is spreading over Europe through the efforts of His consecrated servants. </p>

<p> You may be sure your work will be remembered in his prayers, and that he will pray for you both, your happiness and your success. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í love, R. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p> The work on which you and you dear sister have embarked is historic, meritorious, and rich in possibilities. Future generations will extol your labours and derive inspiration from the example you have set. I am deeply grateful to you both, admire your spirit, will pray for your success, and am eager to receive the report of your activities. Never lose heart, be assured, happy and grateful. Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #210 August 1948 p2 </p>

<p> The friends must, at all times, bear in mind that they are, in a way, like soldiers under attack. The world is at present in an exceedingly dark condition spiritually; hatred and prejudice of every sort are literally tearing it to pieces. We, on the other hand, are the custodians of the opposite forces, the forces of love, of unity, of peace and integration, and we must continually be on our guard, whether as individuals or as an Assembly or Community, lest through us these destructive, negative forces enter into our midst. In other words, we must beware lest the darkness of society become reflected in our acts and attitudes, perhaps all unconsciously. Love for each other, the deep sense that we are a new organism, the dawn-breakers of a New World· Order, must constantly animate our Bahá’í lives, and we must pray to be protected from the contamination of society which is so diseased with prejudice. </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother: </p>

<p> Your letter dated Oct. 14th was received by our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. </p>

<p> News of the wonderful success of the Buenos Aires Conference has already reached him, and he feels that it truly marks a turning point in the development of the work in South America. It also has demonstrated that the believers of Latin America are going to be able to not only elect their two national assemblies, when the time comes, but will be capable of managing the affairs of the Cause in these republics of the New World with dignity, efficiency and success. </p>

<p> The news you gave him of the teaching work being carried on by your Assembly in Callao gave him great satisfaction. This work is of the utmost importance, and he assures he will pray that it may be very successful, and that a flourishing Bahá’í Community may soon exist there. </p>

<p> Your donation to, and love for, our glorious Cause touches him deeply and he will pray that your services may be richly blessed by Bahá’u’Iláh. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> Looking back in Wonder, Philip Hainsworth, p65-6 </p>

<p> He wishes he more often got such glad news in one letter! It seems that at last the Cause in England is really getting into its stride, and that the British Community of believers are beginning to show forth the fruits of the many blessings showered on them — for England was one of the first countries of the West to hear the Divine Message, and was blessed by two visits from the Centre of the Covenant! Surely the older Bahá’ís must be astonished to see new centres springing up in a matter of months after years of an almost static condition! It shows that wherever and whenever the friends arise to serve, the mysterious power latent in this Divine Cause rushes in to bless and reinforce their labours far beyond their fondest hopes.... </p>

<p> He is very happy to hear you are established as a pioneer, with a business of your own, and you may be sure he will pray for your material as well as spiritual success in this goal town. </p>

<p> As to the bulletin: he suggests you try and make it as universal in appeal as possible, with news included of outstanding work being done by the Bahá’ís in other lands, in the form of well-written articles. </p>

<p> Your dear father’s death, though for him a blessed release, must have been very hard for your Mother and for you as well, to bear. You may be sure the Guardian will pray for his great happiness and progress in the next world. </p>

<p> He feels her presence there is an important opportunity to serve the Faith. Please assure her of this and encourage her constantly in your letters. </p>

<p> Dear and Valued Co-worker, </p>

<p> I was deeply touched by your letter, and I truly admire your services and the spirit which animates you. You are often in my thoughts and prayers, and I will continue to pray, from the depths of my heart, for your success, your happiness and continual spiritual advancement. Persevere in your noble endeavours. </p>

<p> Rita van Bleyswijk Sombeek, 5 April 1947 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá i Sister: </p>

<p> Your letters dated January 4th and February 13th have been received by our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer them on his behalf. </p>

<p> Regarding your question about the Esperantists: for many years they have been one of our closest contacts in Europe, and many of them have become believers. They are working for one of our greatest principles, and we certainly should associate with them. In Germany the Bahá’ís published an Esperanto magazine, and Martha Root represented the Cause at Esperanto Congresses. We cannot say we are sure this language will be the International one, but we are anxious to see it spread as it fosters unity and understanding. By all means foster your contact with them. Whether Esperanto will be chosen as the International language or not we cannot say; but we can say we hope it will spread because it nearly fulfils such a noble purpose. </p>

<p> By all means speak to gatherings, when the opportunity arises, about the Faith. There is no objection to broadcasting the Message over the radio — but your first consideration and main objective is to confirm sufficient souls to establish a spiritual assembly, and also to build up your literature in the Dutch language. </p>

<p> He is very encouraged to hear you and your dear sister and Mr. van Ogtrop are working in close harmony, and that your spirits are high and you are facing the work with so much joy! </p>

<p> You may be sure his loving prayers for your spiritual advancement and understanding will be offered in the Holy Shrines. </p>

<p> With Bahá’í love, R. Rabbání </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the Spirit of Bahá’u’lláh ever sustain you, cheer your heart, illumine your path, remove every obstacle that impedes the progress of your historic work, aid you to attract capable souls to the Faith, and establish a firm and unassailable foundation for its institutions. </p>

<p> It is wonderful to see, at last, the intellectuals turning to the problems of the world and seeking to solve them.

<p> He has already informed the American N.S.A. that he feels Mr Townshend’s services to the Faith can best be rendered by his writing about it, as he obviously has an outstanding ability in this direction, combined with knowledge and zeal, and can render a very valuable service this way; also he feels that Mr Townshend, now that his church association seems about to be broken, could be used as part of the pioneer force in Eire. It is his own land, he knows his own people, and the need for workers there is very particularly great this year. Naturally, if Mr and Mrs Townshend have received a personal invitation to go to America and care to accept it, they are quite free to do so. </p>

<p> If Mr Townshend has not as yet been registered as a voting believer he certainly should be immediately. Every one knows he has been a most devoted Bahá’í for many years and his contributions should certainly be considered those of a voting Bahá’í. </p>

<p> The way the European teaching work is forging ahead and the number of pioneers being sent (and already settled abroad) greatly encourages him. It now remains for your Assembly to forge ahead with equal speed in carrying out the initial steps required before work on the Temple in situ can be begun. As all kinds of unforeseen complications may arise before the interior is completed, the sooner the first contracts are placed and work actually started, the better. As you know, he is very anxious to have work actually begun on the site this year, and he urges you to press the matter as much as possible. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #196 June 1947 p6-7 </p>

<p> As to your question as to what races should be regarded as coming under the heading of “Orientals” in connection with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s warnings: there is no doubt He was primarily thinking of the Near Eastern races of Islámic extraction, who have every reason to look upon the Faith either with contempt as a mere heresy within, or sect of Islám, or with hatred as a potential threat to the supremacy of their religion. Likewise, it is these Near Eastern races, particularly the Persian, who have been most persistently exposed to the propaganda and bad example of the Covenant-breakers, old and new, and from whose ranks these very Covenant-breakers have sprung. These circumstances, combined with the fact that, like his Prophetic Forebears, Bahá’u’lláh appeared amongst the people most in need of enlightenment-and hence at their lowest ebb morally-are the reasons for not only ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s and his own (i.e.. the Guardian’s) repeated warnings concerning Orientals, but also for the conduct, so often demonstrated, unfortunately, by these same Orientals, and which amply justifies our attitude of great precaution and wariness concerning receiving them in our midst and believing their declarations to be sincere. Shoghi Effendi also feels that the Moslems of India should likewise be included in this category, owing to their respective religious and racial background. </p>

<p> If any credentials your Assembly receives, issued by other National Assemblies, are ambiguous in tone, you should write the body in question and request them to clarify the matter, and be more specific in the future. At present the Guardian does not want to introduce any set international form of credentials. </p>

<p> He cannot urge upon you all sufficiently. and through you the American believers, the importance of Bahá’ís realizing that direct, concentrated and efficiently carried out Bahá’í work is not only their supreme duty but the best way they can serve the interests of humanity and hasten the day when at least the Lesser Peace will become a reality. We must always bear in mind that Bahá’u’lláh’s Order is the sovereign remedy, and all other measures. inaugurated by the United Nations or various governments, are in the nature of palliatives, however sound and progressive they may be. We must concentrate on perfecting our characters as individual Bahá’ís and on maturing our still embryonic, and as yet imperfectly understood World Order; on spreading the Message, according to the provisions of the Divine Plan: and on building a tightly-knit, world-wide Bahá’í community. We are relatively few in numbers, and have such a precious, unique and responsible task to carry out we must concentrate our full forces upon it. </p>

<p> He feels the friends should bear in mind that the primary reason that he is encouraging Bahá’í association with the United Nations is to give the Cause due publicity as an agency working for and firmly believing in the unification of the human family and permanent peace, and not because he believes that we are at present in a position to shape or influence directly the course of human affairs! Also, he feels this association will afford the believers an opportunity of contacting prominent and progressive-minded people from different countries and calling the Faith and its principles to their attention. We should associate ourselves in every way with all movements of UN which are in accordance with our principles and objectives; but we should not seek to take the initiative or ... focus a glare of publicity and public attention on a very wide scale, upon ourselves which might prove very detrimental to our own interests. He considered, for instance, the “Bahá’í Declaration of Human Obligations and Rights” appropriate and believes this type of action to be wise and suitable. </p>

<p> Scholarship (BSB) </p>

<p> Compiled by Research Department of the Universal House of Justice. </p>

<p> Published in Bahá’í Studies Bulletin Vol 1-1 </p>

<p> It is very easy indeed for him to understand how you, with your training, are often tested and irritated by your contact with some of the believers. But then you must remember that your advantages of a reasonable mind and a scientific education, have not been given to all, and you cannot expect acceptance of Bahá’u’lláh’s Teachings to endow people with these things automatically! But think of the kind of human beings, if brought up in the society He envisages, and taught in homes, schools and universities which were the mirror and product of His teachings, which would be produced! There you would really have a new race of men. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi has for years urged the Bahá’ís (who asked his advice, and in general also), to study history, economics, sociology, etc., in order to be au courant with all the progressive movements and thoughts being put forth today, and so that they could correlate these to the Bahá’í teachings. What he wants the Bahá’ís to do is to study more, not to study less. The more general knowledge, scientific and otherwise, they possess, the better. Likewise he is constantly urging them to really study the Bahá’í teachings more deeply. One might liken Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings to a sphere; there are points poles apart, and in between the thoughts and doctrines that unite them. We believe in balance in all things; we believe in moderation in all things — we must not be too emotional, nor cut and dried and lacking in feeling, we must not be so liberal as to cease to preserve the character and unity of our Bahá’í system, nor fanatical and dogmatic. Very few people, as you as a psychologist know, have attained perfect equilibrium in their minds or their lives — their acts — the same is certainly true of the Bahá’ís, for anyone who believes in our teachings can become a Bahá’í and they represent all elements of the population. </p>

<p> He can see quite clearly both your point of view and that express’ by those dear and devoted Bahá’ís whom you quoted in your letter. Both Mr. Remey and Mr. Holley are men of much experience and considerable learning in their way; what they no doubt meant was that the solution given to the world’s problems by Bahá’u’lláh is the only solution — being Divine in origin — and most desperately needed; therefore we, the few who have caught the vision, should not waste our energies beating up and down the paths pursued by humanity,and which are not solving its ghastly present-day problems. We should concentrate on the Cause, because it is what is needed to cure the world. This is a sound attitude, for if we don’t devote ourselves to the Bahá’í work and teaching who will? </p>

<p> On the other hand there is a big difference between this and learning. If the Bahá’ís want to be really effective in teaching the Cause they need to be much better informed and able to discuss intelligently, intellectually, the present condition of the world and its problems. We need Bahá’í scholars,not only people far, far more deeply aware of what our teaching really are, but also well read and educated people, capable of correlating our teachings to the current thoughts of the leaders of society. </p>

<p> We Bahá’ís should, in other words, arm our minds with knowledge in order to better demonstrate to, especially the educated classes, the truths enshrined in our Faith. What the Guardian, however, does not advise the friends to do is to dissipate their time and energies in serving movements that are akin to our principles but not, we believe, capable of solving the present spiritual crisis the world finds Itself in. We can cooperate with such movements and their promoters to good effect,while at the same time openly standing forth as Bahá’ís with a specific program to offer society. </p>

<p> He does not endorse, however, the circulation of the statement on communism, and considers that if such a document fell into the hands of the wrong people it could cause a great deal of harm, especially in those countries where the believers are living under Soviet rule or in states strongly influenced by communism. The issues touched upon are too vital and too interwoven with present — day politics for us to make any written comment upon them. However he feels that orally pioneers could be apprised of these things and warned to be extremely discreet in communicating our viewpoints to those they teach in Europe, and elsewhere. The word communism cannot be dissociated from the Soviet Political Regime, and great wisdom is required to make our viewpoint clear without giving the impression we are for or against any existing government. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1179'> 1947-07-14 Cover letter </h3>

<p> On 9 July 47, Shoghi Effendi received a letter from the chairman of United Nations Special Committee on Palestine requesting a statement on the relationship which the Bahá’í Faith had to Palestine and the Bahá’í attitude towards any future changes in the status of the country.  His reply was written 14 July 47 and sent the next day. A portion of the cover letter were published in BW vol X and not made part of the statement published as a pamphlet.   </p>

<p> That letter is as follows as published in Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum’s 1988 book, “The Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith” [which is similar but not identical to “The Priceless Pearl.] </p>

<p> Mr. Justice Emil Sandstrom, Chairman,  </p>

<p> United Nations Special Committee on Palestine. </p>

<p> Sir: </p>

<p> Your kind letter of July 9th reached me and I wish to thank you for affording me the opportunity of presenting to you and your esteemed colleagues a statement of the relationship which the Bahá’í Faith has to Palestine and our attitude towards any future changes in the status of this sacred and much disputed land. </p>

<p> I am enclosing with this letter, for your information, a brief sketch of the history, aims and significance of the Bahá’í Faith, as well as a small pamphlet setting forth its views towards the present state of the world and the lines on which we hope and believe it must and will develop. </p>

<p> The position of the Bahá’ís in this country is in a certain measure unique: whereas Jerusalem is the spiritual center of Christendom it is not the administrative center of either the Church of Rome or any other Christian denomination. Likewise although it is regarded by Moslems as the spot where one of its most sacred shrines is situated, the Holy Sites of the Muḥammadan Faith, and the center of its pilgrimages, are to be found in Arabia, not in Palestine. The Jews alone offer somewhat of a parallel to the attachment which the Bahá’ís have for this country inasmuch as Jerusalem holds the remains of their Holy Temple and was the seat of both the religious and political institutions associated with their past history. But even their case differs in one respect from that of the Bahá’ís, for it is in the soil of Palestine that the three central Figures of our religion are buried, and it is not only the center of Bahá’í pilgrimages from all over the world but also the permanent seat of our Administrative Order, of which I have the honor to be the Head. </p>

<p> The Bahá’í Faith is entirely non-political and we neither take sides in the present tragic dispute going on over the future of the Holy Land and its peoples nor have we any statement to make or advice to give as to what the nature of the political future of this country should be. Our aim is the establishment of universal peace in this world and our desire to see justice prevail in every domain of human society, including the domain of politics. As many of the adherents of our Faith are of Jewish and Moslem extraction we have no prejudice towards either of these groups and are most anxious to reconcile them for their mutual benefit and for the good of the country. </p>

<p> What does concern us, however, in any decisions made affecting the future of Palestine, is that the fact be recognized by whoever exercises sovereignty over Haifa and Acre, that within this area exists the spiritual and administrative center of a world Faith, and that the independence of that Faith, its right to manage its international affairs from this source, the right of Bahá’ís from any and every country of the globe to visit it as pilgrims (enjoying the same privilege in this respect as Jews, Moslems and Christians do in regard to visiting Jerusalem), be acknowledged and permanently safeguarded. </p>

<p> The Sepulchre of the Báb on Mt. Carmel, the Tomb of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in that same spot, the Pilgrim Hostel for oriental Bahá’ís in its vicinity, the large gardens and terraces which surround these places (all of which are open to visits by the public of all denominations), the Pilgrim Hostel for western Bahá’í s at the foot of Mt Carmel, the residence of the Head of the Community various houses and gardens in Acre and its vicinity associated with Bahá’u’lláh’s incarceration in that city, His Holy Tomb at Bahjí, near Acre, with His Mansion which is now preserved as a historic site and a museum (both likewise accessible to the public of all denominations), as well as holdings in the plain of Acre — all these comprise the bulk of Bahá’í properties in the Holy Land. It should also be noted that practically all of these properties have been exempted from both Government and Municipal taxes owing to their religious nature. Some of these extensive holdings are the property of the Palestine Branch of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, incorporated as a religious society according to the laws of the country. In future various other Bahá’í National Assemblies will hold, through their Palestine Branches, part of the International Endowments of the Faith in the Holy Land. </p>

<p> In view of the above information I would request you and the members of your Committee to take into consideration the safeguarding of Bahá’í rights in any recommendation which you may make to the United Nations concerning the future of Palestine. May I take this opportunity of assuring you of my deep appreciation of the spirit in which you and your colleagues have conducted your investigations into the troubled conditions of this Sacred Land. I trust and pray that the outcome of your deliberations will produce an equitable and speedy solution of the very thorny problems which have arisen in Palestine. </p>

<p> Yours faithfully, </p>

<p> The Faith of Bahá’u’lláh: </p>

<p> A World Religion </p>

<p> by Shoghi Effendi </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1947-07 </p>

<p> Palestine, Palestine </p>

<p class='signature noid'> July, 1947 </p>

<p> The Faith established by Bahá’u’lláh was born in Persia about the middle of the nineteenth century and has, as a result of the successive banishments of its Founder, culminating in His exile to the Turkish penal colony of ‘Akká, and His subsequent death and burial in its vicinity, fixed its permanent spiritual center in the Holy Land, and is now in the process of laying the foundations of its world administrative center in the city of Haifa. </p>

<p> Alíke in the claims unequivocally asserted by its Author and the general character of the growth of the Bahá’í community in every continent of the globe, it can be regarded in no other light than a world religion, destined to evolve in the course of time into a world-embracing commonwealth, whose advent must signalize the Golden Age of mankind, the age in which the unity of the human race will have been unassailably established, its maturity attained, and its glorious destiny unfolded through the birth and efflorescence of a world-encompassing civilization. </p>

<p> Restatement of Eternal Verities </p>

<p> Though sprung from Shi’íh Islám, and regarded, in the early stages of its development, by the followers of both the Muslim and Christian Faiths, as an obscure sect, an Asiatic cult or an offshoot of the Muḥammadan religion, this Faith is now increasingly demonstrating its right to be recognized, not as one more religious system superimposed on the conflicting creeds which for so many generations have divided mankind and darkened its fortunes, but rather as a restatement of the eternal verities underlying all the religions of the past, as a unifying force instilling into the adherents of these religions a new spiritual vigor, infusing them with a new hope and love for mankind, firing them with a new vision of the fundamental unity of their religious doctrines, and unfolding to their eyes the glorious destiny that awaits the human race. </p>

<p> The fundamental principle enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh, the followers of His Faith firmly believe, is that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process, that all the great religions of the world are divine in origin, that their basic principles are in complete harmony, that their aims and purposes are one and the same, that their teachings are but facets of one truth, that their functions are complementary, that they differ only in the non-essential aspects of their doctrines, and that their missions represent successive stages in the spiritual evolution of human society. </p>

<p> To Reconcile Conflicting Creeds </p>

<p> The aim of Bahá’u’lláh, the Prophet of this new and great age which humanity has entered upon — He whose advent fulfils the prophecies of the Old and New Testaments as well as those of the Qur’án regarding the coming of the Promised One in the end of time, on the Day of Judgment — is not to destroy but to fulfill the Revelations of the past, to reconcile rather than accentuate the divergencies of the conflicting creeds which disrupt present-day society. </p>

<p> His purpose, far from belittling the station of the Prophets gone before Him or of whittling down their teachings, is to restate the basic truths which these teachings enshrine in a manner that would conform to the needs, and be in consonance with the capacity, and be applicable to the problems, the ills and perplexities, of the age in which we live. His mission is to proclaim that the ages of the infancy and of the childhood of the human race are past, that the convulsions associated with the present stage of its adolescence are slowly and painfully preparing it to attain the stage of manhood, and are heralding the approach of that Age of Ages when swords will be beaten into plowshares, when the Kingdom promised by Jesus Christ will have been established, and the peace of the planet definitely and permanently ensured. Nor does Bahá’u’lláh claim finality for His own Revelation, but rather stipulates that a fuller measure of the truth He has been commissioned by the Almighty to vouchsafe to humanity, at so critical a juncture in its fortunes, must needs be disclosed at future stages in the constant and limitless evolution of mankind. </p>

<p> Oneness of the Human Race </p>

<p> The Bahá’í Faith upholds the unity of God, recognizes the unity of His Prophets, and inculcates the principle of the oneness and wholeness of the entire human race. It proclaims the necessity and the inevitability of the unification of mankind, asserts that it is gradually approaching, and claims that nothing short of the transmuting spirit of God, working through His chosen Mouthpiece in this day, can ultimately succeed in bringing it about. It, moreover, enjoins upon its followers the primary duty of an unfettered search alter truth, condemns all manner of prejudice and superstition, declares the purpose of religion to be the promotion of amity and concord, proclaims its essential harmony with science, and recognizes it as the foremost agency for the pacification and the orderly progress of human society. It unequivocally maintains the principle of equal rights, opportunities and privileges for men and women, insists on compulsory education, eliminates extremes of poverty and wealth, abolishes the institution of priesthood, prohibits slavery, asceticism, mendicancy and monasticism, prescribes monogamy, discourages divorce, emphasizes the necessity of strict obedience to one’s government, exalts any work performed in the spirit of service to the level of worship, urges either the creation or the selection of an auxiliary international language, and delineates the outlines of those institutions that must establish and perpetuate the general peace of mankind. </p>

<p> The Herald </p>

<p> The Bahá’í Faith revolves around three central Figures, the first of whom was a youth, a native of <u>Sh</u>íráz, named Mírzá ‘Alí-Muḥammad, known as the Báb (Gate), who in May, 1844, at the age of twenty-five, advanced the claim of being the Herald Who, according to the sacred Scriptures of previous Dispensations, must needs announce and prepare the way for the advent of One greater than Himself, Whose mission would be according to those same Scriptures, to inaugurate an era of righteousness and peace, an era that would be hailed as the consummation of all previous Dispensations, and initiate a new cycle in the religious history of mankind. Swift and severe persecution, launched by the organized forces of Church and State in His native land, precipitated successively His arrest, His exile to the mountains of A<u>dh</u>irbáyján, His imprisonment in the fortresses of Máh-Kú and Chihríq, and His execution, in July, 1850, by a firing squad in the public square of Tabríz. No less than twenty thousand of his followers were put to death with such barbarous cruelty as to evoke the warm sympathy and the unqualified admiration of a number of Western writers, diplomats, travelers and scholars, some of whom were witnesses of these abominable outrages, and were moved to record them in their books and diaries. </p>

<p> Bahá’u’lláh </p>

<p> Mírzá Ḥusayn-‘Alí, surnamed Bahá’u’lláh (the Glory of God), a native of Mázindarán, Whose advent the Báb had foretold, was assailed by those same forces of ignorance and fanaticism, was imprisoned in Ṭihrán, was banished, in 1852, from His native land to Ba<u>gh</u>dád, and thence to Constantinople and Adrianople, and finally to the prison city of ‘Akká, where He remained incarcerated for no less than twenty-four years, and in whose neighborhood He passed away in 1892. In the course of His banishment, and particularly in Adrianople and ‘Akká, He formulated the laws and ordinances of His Dispensation, expounded, in over a hundred volumes, the principles of His Faith, proclaimed His Message to the kings and rulers of both the East and the West, both Christian and Muslim, addressed the Pope, the Caliph of Islám, the Chief Magistrates of the Republics of the American continent, the entire Christian sacerdotal order, the leaders of <u>Sh</u>í‘ah and Sunní Islám, and the high priests of the Zoroastrian religion. In these writings He proclaimed His Revelation, summoned those whom He addressed to heed His call and espouse His Faith, warned them of the consequences of their refusal, and denounced, in some cases, their arrogance and tyranny. </p>

<p> ‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá </p>

<p> His eldest son, ‘Abbás Effendi, known as ‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá (the Servant of Bahá), appointed by Him as His lawful successor and the authorized interpreter of His teachings, Who since early childhood had been closely associated with His Father, and shared His exile and tribulations, remained a prisoner until 1908, when, as a result of the Young Turk Revolution, He was released from His confinement. Establishing His residence in Haifa, He embarked soon after on His three-year journey to Egypt, Europe and North America, in the course of which He expounded before vast audiences, the teachings of His Father and predicted the approach of that catastrophe that was soon to befall mankind. He returned to His home on the eve of the first World War, in the course of which He was exposed to constant danger, until the liberation of Palestine by the forces under the command of General Allenby, who extended the utmost consideration to Him and to the small band of His fellow-exiles in ‘Akká and Haifa. In 1921 He passed away, and was buried in a vault in the mausoleum erected on Mount Carmel, at the express instruction of Bahá’u’lláh, for the remains of the Báb, which had previously been transferred from Tabríz to the Holy Land after having been preserved and concealed for no less than sixty years. </p>

<p> Administrative Order </p>

<p> The passing of ‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá marked the termination of the first and Heroic Age of the Bahá’í Faith and signalized the opening of the Formative Age destined to witness the gradual emergence of its Administrative Order, whose establishment had been foretold by the Báb, whose laws were revealed by Bahá’u’lláh, whose outlines were delineated by ‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and Testament, and whose foundations are now being laid by the national and local councils which are elected by the professed adherents of the Faith, and which are paving the way for the constitution of the World Council, to be designated as the Universal House of Justice, which, in conjunction with me, as its appointed Head and the authorized interpreter of the Bahá’í teachings, must coordinate and direct the affairs of the Bahá’í community, and whose seat will be permanently established in the Holy Land, in close proximity to its world spiritual center, the resting-places of its Founders. </p>

<p> The Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, which is destined to evolve into the Bahá’í World Commonwealth, and has already survived the assaults launched against its institutions by such formidable foes as the kings of the Qájár dynasty, the Caliphs of Islám, the ecclesiastical leaders of Egypt, and the Nazi regime in Germany, has already extended its ramifications to every continent of the globe, stretching from Iceland to the extremity of Chile, has been established in no less than eighty-eight countries of the world, has gathered within its pale representatives of no less than thirty-one races, numbers among its supporters Christians of various denominations, Muslims of both Sunní and <u>Sh</u>í‘ah sects, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, Zoroastrians and Buddhists. It has published and disseminated, through its appointed agencies, Bahá’í literature in forty-eight languages; has already consolidated its structure through the incorporation of five National Assemblies and seventy-seven local Assemblies, in lands as far apart as South America, India and the Antipodes-incorporations that legally empower its elected representatives to hold property as trustees of the Bahá’í community. It disposes of international, national and local endowments, estimated at several million pounds, and spread over every continent of the globe, enjoys in several countries the privilege of official recognition by the civil authorities, enabling it to secure exemption from taxation for its endowments and to solemnize Bahá’í marriage, and numbers among its stately edifices, two temples, the one erected in Russian Turkistan and the other on the shore of Lake Michigan at Wilmette, on the outskirts of Chicago. </p>

<p> This Administrative Order, unlike the systems evolved after the death of the Founders of the various religions, is divine in origin, rests securely on the laws, the precepts, the ordinances and institutions which the Founder of the Faith has Himself specifically laid down and unequivocally established, and functions in strict accordance with the interpretations of the authorized Interpreters of its holy scriptures. Though fiercely assailed, ever since its inception, it has, by virtue of its character, unique in the annals of the world’s religious history, succeeded in maintaining the unity of the diversified and far-flung body of its supporters, and enabled them to launch, unitedly and systematically, enterprises in both Hemispheres, designed to extend its limits and consolidate its administrative institutions. The Faith which this order serves, safeguards and promotes, is, it should be noted in this connection, essentially supernatural, supranational, entirely non-political, non-partisan, and diametrically opposed to any policy or school of thought that seeks to exalt any particular race, class or nation. It is free from any form of ecclesiasticism, has neither priesthood nor rituals, and is supported exclusively by voluntary contributions made by its avowed adherents. Though loyal to their respective governments, though imbued with the love of their own country, and anxious to promote, at all times, its best interests, the followers of the Bahá’í Faith, nevertheless, viewing mankind as one entity, and profoundly attached to its vital interests, will not hesitate to subordinate every particular interest, be it personal, regional or national, to the over-riding interests of the generality of mankind, knowing full well that in a world of interdependent peoples and nations the advantage of the part is best to be reached by the advantage of the whole, and that no lasting result can be achieved by any of the component parts if the general interests of the entity itself are neglected. </p>

<p> Nor should the fact be overlooked that the Faith has already asserted and demonstrated its independent religious character, has been emancipated from the fetters of orthodoxy in certain Islámic countries, has obtained in one of them an unsolicited testimony to its independent religious status, and succeeded in winning the allegiance of royalty to its cause. </p>

<p> Tributes by Leaders </p>

<p> “It is like a wide embrace,” is Queen Marie of Rumania’s own tribute, “gathering together all those who have searched for words of hope. It accepts all great Prophets gone before, ‘ it destroys no other creeds and leaves all doors open.... The Bahá’í teaching brings peace to the soul and hope to the heart. To those in search of assurance, the words of the Father are as a fountain in the desert after long wandering.... It is a wondrous message that Bahá’u’lláh and His son ‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá have given us. They have not set it up aggressively, knowing that the germ of eternal truth which lies at its core cannot but take root and spread.... It is Christ’s Message taken up anew, in the same words almost, but adapted to the thousand years and more difference that lies between the year one and today... If ever the name of Bahá’u’lláh or ‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá comes to your attention, do not put their writings from you. Search out their books, and let their glorious, peace — bringing, love — creating words and lessons sink into your hearts as they have into mine.” </p>

<p> “The teachings of the Bábís,” wrote Leo Tolstoy, “... have a great future before them ... I therefore sympathize with Bábism with all my heart, inasmuch as it teaches people brotherhood and equality and sacrifice of material life for service to God ... The teachings of the Bábís which come to us out of Islám have through Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings been gradually developed, and now present us with the highest and purest form of religious teaching.” </p>

<p> “Take these principles to the diplomats,” is the late President Masaryk’s advice, “to the universities and colleges and other schools, and also write about them. It is the people who will bring the universal peace.” “The Bahá’í teaching,” is President Eduard Benes’ testimony, “is one of the great instruments for the final victory of the spirit and of humanity ... The Bahá’í Cause is one of the great moral and social forces in all the world today. I am more convinced than ever, with the increasing moral and political crises in the world, we must have greater international coordination. Such a movement as the Bahá’í Cause which paves the way for universal organization of peace is necessary.” </p>

<p> “If there has been any Prophet in recent times,” asserts the Rev. T. K. Cheyne in his ‘The Reconciliation of Races and Religions’, “it is to Bahá’u’lláh that we must go. Character is the final judge. Bahá’u’lláh was a man of the highest class-that of Prophets.” “It is possible indeed,” declares Viscount Samuel of Carmel, “to pick out points of fundamental agreement among all creeds. That is the essential purpose of the Bahá’í religion, the foundation and growth of which is one of the most striking movements that have proceeded from the East in recent generations.” </p>

<p> “Palestine,” is Professor Norman Bentwich’s written testimony, “may indeed be now regarded as the land not of three but of four faiths, because the Bahá’í creed, which has its center of faith and pilgrimage in ‘Akká and Haifa, is attaining to the character of a world religion. So far as its influence goes in the land, it is a factor making for international and inter-religious understanding.” </p>

<p> And, finally, is the judgment passed by no less outstanding a figure than the late Master of Balliol, Professor Benjamin Jowett: “The Bábí movement may not impossibly turn out to have the promise of the future.” Professor Lewis Campbell, an eminent pupil of Dr. Jowett, has confirmed this statement by quoting him as saying: “This Bahá’í Movement is the greatest light that has come into the world since the time of Jesus Christ. You must watch it and never let it out of your sight. It is too great and too near for this generation to comprehend. The future alone can reveal its import.” </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #202 December 1947 p3 </p>

<p> Regarding your questions: There are only two institutions which are infallible, one is the guardianship, the other the International House of Justice. What the Master desired to protect the friends against was continual bickering and opinionatedness. A believer can ask the Assembly why they made a certain decision and politely request them to reconsider. But then he must leave it at that, and not go on disrupting local affairs through insisting on his own views. This applies to an Assembly member as well. We all have a right to our opinions, we are bound to think differently; but a Bahá’í must accept the majority decision of his Assembly, realizing that acceptance and harmony-even if a mistake has been made-are the really important things, and when we serve the Cause properly, in the Bahá’í way, God will right any wrongs done in the end. </p>

<p> Bahá’ís are not required to vote on an Assembly against their consciences. It is better if they submit to the majority view and make it unanimous. But they are not forced to. What they must do, however, is to abide by the majority decision, as this is what becomes effective. They must not go around undermining the Assembly by saying they disagreed with the majority. In other words, they must put the Cause first and not their own opinions. </p>

<p> He, (an S. A. member) can ask the Assembly to reconsider a matter, but he has no right to force them or create inharmony because they won’t change. Unanimous votes are preferable, but certainly cannot be forced upon Assembly members by artificial methods such as are used by other societies. </p>

<p> What Bahá’u’lláh means by chastity certainly does not include the kissing that goes on in modern society. It is detrimental to the morals of young people, and often leads them to go too far, or arouses appetites which they cannot perhaps at the time satisfy legitimately through marriage, and the suppression of which is a strain on them. </p>

<p> The Bahá’í standard is very high, more particularly when compared with the thoroughly rotten morals of the present world. But this standard of ours will produce healthier, happier, nobler people, and induce stabler marriages. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1186'> 1947-10-25 Marriage ceremony &amp; prayer </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #202 December 1947 p2 </p>

<p> There is no objection to performing a Bahá’í marriage for two non-Bahá’ís, if they desire to have our simple ceremony. This, on the contrary, is yet another way of demonstrating our liberality. </p>

<p> Bahá’u’lláh has clearly stated the consent of all living parents is required for a Bahá’í marriage. This applies whether the. parents are Bahá’ís or non-Bahá’ís, divorced for years, or not. This great law He has laid down to strengthen the social fabric, to knit closer the ties of the home, to place a certain gratitude and respect in the hearts of children for those who have given them life and sent their souls out on the eternal journey towards their Creator. We Bahá’ís must realize that in present — day society the exact opposite process is taking place: young people care less and less for their parents’ wishes, divorce is considered a natural right, and obtained on the flimsiest and most unwarrantable and shabby pretexts. People separated from each other, especially if one of them has had full custody of the children, are only too willing to belittle the importance of the partner in marriage also responsible as a parent for bringing those children into this world. The Bahá’ís must, through rigid adherence to theBahá’í laws and teachings, combat those corrosive forces which are so rapidly destroying home life and the beauty of family relationships, and tearing down the moral structure of society. </p>

<p> The point the Indian NSA called to your attention about the Marriage Tablet is correct; part of it is Bahá’u’lláh’s, part of it ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> October 25, 1947 </p>

<p> [See page 7 Bahá’í News for February, 1947. The Marriage Prayer as reprinted is attributed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, whereas in reality the text consists of two separate Tablets. The text up to “the Lord of the worlds!” is by Bahá’u’Hah, and the remaining text is a Tablet by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. — USBN editor] </p>

<p> Here is the text as printed in the February 1947 USBN. It is now found in the U.S. Prayer Book as two separate Marriage Prayers, but the section — - — - </p>

<p> “And we greet and salute those of the Bayán who became the people of Bahá, those who expended their efforts for the upraising of this luminous Faith, and whom the blame of the blamer did not withhold from God. </p>

<p> The 1906 pilgrim notes of ‘Alí-Kuli <u>Kh</u>án refers to the Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh as a homily to read during the wedding ceremony and is a slightly different translation. </p>

<p> The version below from the Feb 1947 USBN is by Marzieh Gail from the Marriage Certificate used by the Assemblies in Persia. </p>

<p> He is the Bestower, the Bounteous! </p>

<p> “Praise be to God, the Ancient, the Ever-Abiding, the Changeless, the Eternal! He Who hath testified in His Own Being that verily He is the One, the Single, the Untrammeled, the Exalted. We bear witness that verily there is no God but Him; acknowledging His oneness, confessing His singleness. He hath ever dwelt in unapproachable heights, in the summits of His loftiness, sanctified from the mention of aught save Himself, free from the description of aught but Him. </p>

<p> “And when He desired to manifest grace and beneficence to men, and to set the world in order, He revealed observances and created laws; among them He established the law of marriage, made it as a fortress for well-being and salvation, and enjoined it upon us in that which was sent down out of the heaven of sanctity in His Most Holy Book. He saith, great is His glory: ‘Marry, 0 people, that from you may appear he who will remember Me amongst My servants; this is one of My commandments unto you; Obey it as an assistance to yourselves.’ </p>

<p> “And we greet and salute those of the Bayán who became the people of Bahá, those who expended their efforts for the upraising of this luminous Faith, and whom the blame of the blamer did not withhold from God. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds! </p>

<p> “He is God! O peerless Lord! In Thine almighty wisdom Thou hast enjoined marriage upon the peoples, that the generations of men may succeed one another in this contingent world, and that ever, so long as the world shall last, they may busy themselves at the Threshold of Thy oneness with servitude and worship, with salutation, adoration and praise. ‘I have not created spirits and men, but that they should worship Me.’1 Wherefore, wed Thou in the heaven of Thy mercy these two birds of the nest of Thy love, and make them the means of attracting perpetual grace; that from the union of these two seas of love a wave of tenderness may surge and cast the pearls of pure and goodly issue on the shore of life. ‘He hath let loose the two seas, that they meet each other: Between them is a barrier which they overpass not. Which then of the bounties of your Lord will ye deny? From each He bringeth up greater and lesser pearls:’2 </p>

<p> 0 Thou kind Lord! Make Thou this marriage to bring forth coral and pearls. Thou are verily the AllPowerful, the Most Great, the Ever-Forgiving!” </p>

<p> In the August issue of Bahá’í News there is a statement about the year 1335 and a reference to “God Passes ~ By” in which it gives the impression that in that book the Guardian associates the fulfilment of Daniel’s prophecy with one hundred years after Bahá’u ‘llah’s mystic experience. He wishes me to point out that this is inaccurate as on page 151 of “ God Passes By,” in the reference to His Declaration, the Guardian clearly states that with this declaration the “ hundred lunar years” had commenced. The mystic experience of Bahá’u’lláh was in the Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál and has nothing to do with Daniel’s prophecy. </p>

<p> Rita van Bleyswijk Sombeek, 23 November 1947 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister: </p>

<p> Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated November 16th, has been received, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> He is delighted to hear you are now fully recovered and again active in your important work for the Cause. However, you should not neglect your health but consider it the means which enables you to serve. It — the body — is like a horse which carries the personality and spirit, and as such should be well cared for so it can do its work! You should certainly safeguard your nerves, and force yourself to take time, and not only for prayer and meditation, but for real rest and relaxation. We don’t have to pray and meditate for hours in order to be spiritual. </p>

<p> The meetings you are so successfully holding, and the interest in our Bahá’í books shown by Mr. Buys, are very encouraging signs of progress. If a non-Baháï publishing firm should bring out a Bahá’í book it would add greatly to the prestige of the Cause in the eyes of the public. As long as the original text is preserved in its entirety and the translation good, we can certainly have no objection to such a constructive effort. </p>

<p> He will pray for the success of all you and the other dear believers there are doing, and for the speedy establishment of an assembly in Amsterdam. </p>

<p> With loving greetings, R. Rabbání </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the Almighty aid you to recover fully and speedily your strength, promote actively the teaching activities you have so nobly and energetically initiated, win to the Faith additional souls of great capacity and hasten the advent of the day when the first historic Bahá’í assembly will have been established in Holland.65 Your true and grateful brother; Shoghi </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1194'> 1947-12-07 to Haifa Planning Commission re Shrine of the Báb </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> The Priceless Pearl, Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, p240-1 </p>

<p> Haifa Dec. 7th, 1947. </p>

<p> Haifa Local Building and Town Planning Commission. To the Chairman </p>

<p> Dear Sir: </p>

<p> In connection with the accompanying drawings and application for permission to build, I wish to add a word of explanation. </p>

<p> The Tomb of the Báb, and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, so well known to the people of Haifa as ‘Abbás Effendi, is already in existence on Mt. Carmel in an incomplete form. In its present state, in spite of the extensive gardens surrounding it, it is a homely building with a fortress-like appearance. </p>

<p> It is my intention to now begin the completion of this building by preserving the original structure and at the same time embellishing it with a monumental building of great beauty, thus adding to the general improvement in the appearance of the slopes of Mt. Carmel. </p>

<p> The purpose of this building will, when completed remain the same as at present. In other words it will be used exclusively as a Shrine entombing the remains of the Báb. </p>

<p> As you will see from the accompanying drawings the completed structure will comprise an arcade of twenty four marble or other monolith columns surmounted by an ornamental balustrade, on the first floor or ground floor of the building. It is this part of the building that we wish to begin work on at once, leaving the intermediary section  </p>

<p> [page 241] and the dome, which will surmount the whole edifice when completed, to be carried on in the future, if possible at an early date after the completion of the ground floor arcade. </p>

<p> The Architect of this monument building is Mr. W.S. Maxwell, F.R.I.B.A., F.R.A.I.C., R.C.A., the well-known Canadian architect, whose firm built the Chateau Frontenac Hotel in Quebec, the House of Parliament in Regina, the Art Gallery, Church of the Messiah, various Bank buildings, etc., in Montreal.

<p> Dear Shoghi Effendi, </p>

<p> I am enclosing for your consideration a newspaper clipping and photo from one of the Chicago newspapers. </p>

<p> As you can see, it concerns a protest meeting by the student body against racial discrimination at the University of Chicago. </p>

<p> At the present time there is an official Bahá’í study group at this institution. Examination of the photograph will show that this Bahá’í group participated in this protest rally along with other University groups by the display of a placard or poster with the name Bahá’í thereon. </p>

<p> My question, then, is this: Is there anything wrong in the protesting of Bahá’í student groups against racial prejudice along with other student groups or organizations? </p>

<p> I would also like to know if the following quotation from The Advent of Divine Justice, (page 20), would in any way justify such action by these students: </p>

<p> “Freedom from racial prejudice in any of all its forms should …be adopted as the watchword of the entire body of American believers, in whichever state they reside, in whatever circles they move, whatever their age, traditions, tastes and habits. It should be consistently demonstrated in every phase of their activity and life, whether in the Bahá’í community or outside of it, in public or in private, formally as well as informally, individually as well as in their official capacity as organized groups, committees and Assemblies. It should be deliberately cultivated through the various and everyday opportunities…… at their schools and colleges, their social parties and recreation grounds, their Bahá’í meetings, conferences, conventions, summer schools and Assemblies.” </p>

<p> My wife joins me in Bahá’í love and greetings to you and all the Holy Household. </p>

<p> Faithfully in His service. </p>

<p> Unfortunately it would seem that the knowledge “which could largely eliminate fear” has not been disclosed or identified by Bahá’u’lláh, so we do not know what it is.

<p> “In connection with the subject matter of Mr. Blackwell’s letter and your reference to it, the Guardian feels that, as he said in his letter to Mr. Blackwell, there was no objection at all to the students taking part in something so obviously akin to the spirit of our teachings as a campus demonstration against race prejudice. The Bahá’ís did not inaugurate this protest, they merely were proud to have a voice as Bahá’ís in such a protest, took part, and he thinks they did quite right and violated no administrative principle.” </p>

<p> (From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, November 18, 1948) </p>

<p> comments by Richard Hollinger </p>

<p> These articles are about a December 1947 protest against racial discrimination at the University of Chicago that Bahá’í students participated in. I believe this is the protest that Ellsworth Blackwell wrote to Shoghi Effendi about, which brought the well-known response affirming that their participation was appropriate. If you look closely in the photos you can see a sign saying “Bahá’í University Fellowship Fights Bigotry.” </p>

<p> I’m writing about the role of Bahá’ís in the civil rights movement. I went looking for this demonstration to place that letter in some context, but also to see if it linked to CORE, which began at the U of C a few years earlier and which Bahá’ís were active in around this time. </p>

<p> Committee on Racial Equality was a big thing in Chicago, with linkages to the later Freedom rides against Jim Crow in the south. If you want me to look through archival materials, let me know...can’t do it just now, but eventually. I have looked at Beecher Hall’s student director committee records from when Martha Root lived there (it was a dorm then, it houses faculty offices mostly now. She briefly held an office — treasurer I think it was. </p>

<p> at some point i would to figure out the role that Ellsworth Blackwell in the Development of CORE’s protest strategies. He was chair of their public accommodations committee in 1944, when he planned some creative protests to integrate an ice rink. I’ll be looking at the national CORE records shortly, which may document this, but they are mainly from the 1960s onward. </p>

<p> I am guessing that he sent the article from the Chicago Defender about the protest, which includes the smaller photo, which is likely what raised the issue in the Chicago community. </p>

<p> Above clipping was fairly widespread, originated w/ Chicago Defender. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1204'> 1948-03-04 to Philip Hainsworth re state of the world etc </h3>

<p> Looking back in Wonder, Philip Hainsworth, p76-7 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother, </p>

<p> Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated February 23rd, has been received, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. Regarding the various matters you asked his advice and opinion about. </p>

<p> It is not surprising, in view of the gloom overhanging the entire world, and in conjunction with their run-down, exhausted state due to war conditions and present circumstances of life in England, that the British Bahá’ís should sometimes reflect the state of their countrymen! It is a pity; and they should certainly try, as believers, to be cheerful and radiant; but he feels the greatest sympathy for them, and considers that when their present achievements are assessed in future, people will give them a double measure of praise for having done so much when they were least fit to do it. The spirit of determination, and their perseverance, are truly outstanding. </p>

<p> Just because some people have lost their vision of the Cause, or never had a proper grasp of its implications before entering it, and leave the fold, should not cause undue discouragement. There are bound to be such cases, and although every moral support should be given them if they still wish to withdraw, they fall off — as you said — like withered leaves from the Tree of the Faith, and do it no real harm. </p>

<p> He likes to be provided with facts by the friends, when they ask his advice, for although his decisions are guided by God, he is not, like the Prophet, Omniscient at will, in spite of the fact that he often senses a situation or condition without having any detailed knowledge of it. </p>

<p> As to your own plans, he feels that you should not leave Nottingham at present, where you are not only needed by the local Community, but where you have a store. He suggests you make a serious effort, through devoting more time to your business, to getting it on its feet, and at least in a condition to dispose of, if you don’t think it worth continuing. </p>

<p> He is very anxious to have the pamphlets in African languages gotten out — both the one Mrs Preston was to see to, and the one you mention you can get done, at least the translation, by an African. He suggests you write Mrs. Preston, and urge her to get the Swahili one done quickly (he himself has heard nothing from her at all), and you make suitable selections for a small pamphlet to be sent to your African acquaintance and translated into Chinyanza. He is delighted at the prospect of having this done, as our publications are now translated and printed in 50 languages, two are being translated into 12 additional languages. One of these 50 is Tegrinia, an African tongue. </p>

<p> He urges you to never feel discouraged, or that you have in any way failed in your services; on the contrary you have done a tremendous lot of work for the Cause since your return to England, and he is very happy over your accomplishments, and assures you he will pray in the Shrines for the solution of your problems and the fulfilment of your heart’s desire. </p>

<p> With Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> R. Rabbání. </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker, </p>

<p> I wish to assure you in person of my everlasting gratitude for the historic and magnificent work you have achieved in recent years — a work of which I feel truly proud. You should be happy, grateful and confident, and persevere in your great task, which the Beloved, f feel sure, will continue to bless and guide. The spirit you have imparted to the friends afíer your return from the Holy Land has been responsible for the success you achieved. May the Beloved sustain you in your high endeavours. </p>

<p> Share the joy and elation of the attendants at the first historic Bahá’í Teaching Conference on the European Continent, regarded as the fairest fruit of the momentous enterprise signalizing the second stage in the evolution of the Divine Plan. Overjoyed at the manifold signs of the rapid progress evidenced by the formation of eight Assemblies in seven goal countries, in the notable increase in the number of new believers, in the remarkable activity displayed by itinerant teachers and the meritorious endeavor systematically exerted by the organizers and participators of the newly launched European campaign in the opening years of the Second Seven Year Plan. Appeal to the newly constituted Assemblies to preserve, at whatever cost, the integrity of the prizes gloriously won, to consolidate the institutions recently established, to simultaneously initiate extension work designed to form nuclei destined to reinforce the administrative structure o{ the Faith in the respective countries. Urge the groups in the three remaining goal countries to ensure Assembly status ere the termination of the current year. Entreat every individual and all agencies associated in the conduct of the divinely sustained, majestically unfolding, tremendously challenging crusade, whether administrators at home or abroad, visitors or settlers, itinerant teachers, newly enrolled believers to intensify their concerted efforts to win wider fields, to give added momentum to still more conspicuous victories. Undaunted by the aggravation of the crisis in the tragically disturbed continent, undeterred by the obstacles and pitfalls encountered in a thorny path, sensible to the growing hunger of disillusioned, fearstricken, spiritually famished multitudes, constantly aware of the sublimity of the mission entr,usted, in this critical propitious hour, to their care, inspired by the example of the Author of the Divine Plan Who, in no less a critical hour in the fortunes of the European continent, notwithstanding His age and illness, twice visited its shores and laboffd tirelessly for the illumination of its peoples, let them hold aloft, amidst the tumult of the disorders of a tottering civilization, the torch of divine guidance, tramp resolutely ahead to the appointed goals until the initial stage of so colossal an enterprise has been gloriously consummated. </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister: </p>

<p> Your letter of March 2nd, written on behalf of Miss Van Sombeek, and enclosing a translation of the Dutch pamphlet, has been received by our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> The excellent progress being made in Holland, the formation of the first historic assembly there, the translation work being done — all are great sources of comfort and pride to our Guardians heart. Please assure dear Miss Van Sombeek of this, as she and her sister have devoted so much care and love to the work there. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #237 November 1950 p2 </p>

<p> “ The Guardian knows nothing about your kind of healing, nor would he care to go into the question in detail, as he has no time for such matters. But he can lay down for your guidance certain broad principles: there is no such thing as Bahá’í healers or a Bahá’í type of healing. In His Most Holy Book (the Aqdas) Bahá’u’lláh says to consult the best physicians. in other words, doctors who have studied a scientific system of medicine; he never gave us to believe He Himself would heal us through “healers.” but rather through prayer and the assistance of medicine and approved treatments. </p>

<p> Now, as long as your healing is in no opposition to these principles, as long as you do not try and take the place of a regular doctor in trying to heal others, but only give them your kind of help through constructive suggestion–or whatever it may be–and do not associate this help with being a channel of the direct grace of Bahá’u’lláh, the Guardian sees no harm in your continuing your assistance to others. But you must conscientiously decide whether, in view of the above, you are really justified in continuing. He will pray for your guidance and happiness. </p>

<p> Peace </p>

<p> P .S. I might add that he does not believe any radiations of thought or healing, from any group, is going to bring peace. Prayer, no doubt, will help the world, but what it needs is to accept Bahá’u’lláh’s system so as to build up the World Order on a new foundation, a divine foundation! ...” </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother, </p>

<p> Our beloved Guardian was overjoyed to receive your letter of Sept. 2nd, and is happy to extend to you a sincere and warm welcome into the service of our glorious Faith. </p>

<p> Over and over again ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentioned the great importance of teaching the red Indians, “the original inhabitants of America”, and now that various tribes of the Indians of the Western Hemisphere are gradually coming to be represented in the Bahá’í Faith, through some of their members accepting Bahá’u’lláh, His hopes are being fulfilled. This marks an important step forward not only in the evolution of our Faith itself, but also in the history of the Indian peoples, for, through the universal teachings of our Faith, they will come to not only be loved as brothers by their compatriots of European origin, but also develop the potentialities God has endowed them with, and thus contribute their share to world progress and world unity. </p>

<p> He would greatly welcome your returning to your own tribe, and giving them this great Message you and your dear wife have accepted. He advises you to consult with the Canadian National Bahá’í Assembly, as part of their teaching Plan is to carry our Faith to the Indians in Canada, and they can help and advise you. </p>

<p> Reincarnation And The Nature And Progress Of The Soul #16 </p>

<p> Compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice </p>

<p> Regarding your question about reincarnation: we Bahá’ís do not believe that one individual soul keeps returning to this earthly life in different bodies. This is a very ancient belief, and based on a great truth-namely that the soul does go on developing and unfolding and returning towards its Creator. But the concept of its returning to this physical world is erroneous, and an outgrowth of man-made doctrines which have grown up about the fundamental concept of the progress of the soul. It would be like putting the child over and over again back into the world of the womb. It is unnecessary; but from state to state spiritually, after death, the soul does go on and go higher, so to speak. </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp64 </p>

<p> Etty Graeffe, Suzette Hipp and Lea Nys, 26 December 1948 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Friends, </p>

<p> Your letter to our beloved Guardian of December 5th has been received and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> He is delighted to see your committee is so active and planning to get underway in this all-important work of teaching, through proper translations. </p>

<p> He would suggest you work in close cooperation with the Paris believers, in particular, in order to avoid any duplication of effort, and obtain the maximum results in the shortest time. In the past, on more than one occasion, there has been duplication of translations and of work, which is an awful waste of our limited resources. If the French Bahá’ís already have any translations made, he suggests, you review them and use them, rather than make new ones, — unless of course, they should not be considered usable. </p>

<p> You may be sure his loving prayers are being offered for the success of your work and your other devoted Bahá’í activities. </p>

<p> With warmest greetings, R. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear co-workers, </p>

<p> I wish to assure you of my deep and abiding appreciation of your high endeavours and of my ardent prayers for your success. The Beloved will surely bless your work and reward you for your services, which I greatly value. May He remove all obstacles from your path and aid you to achieve your goal. Your true brother, Shoghi </p>

<p> I strongly feel that you should concentrate in the years to come, on writing for the Cause, whose literature you can, more than anyone else throughout the Bahá’í world, enrich. You should also, I feel, lend your valuable assistance in both the teaching and administrative fields, but only as subsidiary activities. I will pray for the success of your historic pamphlet, and fervently hope it will arouse the public and achieve a brilliant victory for the Faith, which you serve so well and love so dearly. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #220 June 1949 p2 </p>

<p> “The Guardian, like the Master before him, has not considered it advisable to as yet permit any person or Assembly to put another person out of the Cause of God. There is a sharp distinction between depriving a believer of his voting rights, which is a severe disciplinary measure and not a spiritual sanction, and pronouncing a former believer to be a truly spiritually diseased soul, a soul in the condition the Master referred to when, in His last cable to America before His ascension, He said: ‘he who sitteth with a leper catcheth leprosy’. The Guardian has, within the last few years, considered the National Assemblies strong enough to wield the instrument of sanction in the sense of depriving a Bahá’í of his voting rights. But no one but himself can pronounce a person to be in that diseased condition we call ‘Covenant-breaking’ , and no one but he can reinstate a Covenant-breaker. No National Assembly has been given this right and cannot, therefore, review the question or reinstate any one. All any National Assembly can do is to report to the Guardian if they are approached by a .Covenant-breaker, and then the Guardian will take action. It is a pity that some of the Western friends, with remarkable naivete, do not grasp the fact that there is absolutely nothing keeping those who have broken the Covenant, whether Bahá’u’lláh’s or the Master’s, out of the Cause of God except their own inner spiritually sick condition. If they were sound, instead of diseased, and wanted to enter the service of the Faith, they would apply direct to the Guardian and he would be able to adjudge of their sincerity and, if sincere, would welcome them into the ranks of the faithful as he did with Sydney Sprague. Unfortunately, a man who is ill is not made well just by asserting there is nothing wrong with him! Facts, actual states, are what count. Probably no group of people in the world have softer tongues, or proclaim more loudly their innocence, than those who in their heart of hearts, and by their every act, are enemies of the Center of the Covenant. The Master well knew this and that is why He said we must shun their company, but pray for them. If you put a leper in a room with healthy people, he cannot catch their health; on the contrary they are very likely to catch his horrible ailment.” </p>

<p> “He also wishes that it could be brought home to the believers that not only they, with the exigencies of their Temple and their foreign teaching work, are really being hard put to it to stand up to the time of test which is at hand, but all their brothers the world over! In fact in most other countries the difficulties to be overcome, though not spread over such a wide range, are more stubborn. In the East, for example, the friends have to surmount violent religious prejudices, prejudices which debar them from so much as obtaining visas for the countries their Plans embrace, and which, when they do get there, sometimes endanger their lives. The British Bahá’ís, a mere handful, extremely limited financially, find themselves called upon to carry out their courageous Plan and forced to find ways and means of making one pound do the work of ten and one pioneer the work of at least three! And yet they are wholly absorbed in winning their goals, and are bringing all the traditional British grit into play! </p>

<p> “The Guardian himself, already tired out with the work of the last twenty-seven years-which has been steadily growing with the growth of the Cause the world over — now finds himself simply engulfed in a sea of new problems, responsibilities and worries in connection with the work on the Báb’s Shrine. Much as this glorious enterprise is dear to his heart, much as he sees the necessity for carrying it on, and foresees the tremendous advantages to the Faith which will accrue from its unfoldment, he cannot be blind to the fact that it has doubled his load and will be, for some years to come, a back-breaking task for him and all concerned here with it. </p>

<p> “So, as the American believers survey with some trepidation and dismay the gigantic work before them, and the tremendous sums that must be raised, let them remember that for them, even as for their Guardian and their spiritual brothers and sisters all over the globe, there can be no turning back, no escape from duty, no easy way out! Indeed, seeing the plight of all the peoples of the world, they should realize that this whole Planet is in the throes of an unmistakable ordeal, a time of bitter transition and profound testing. If the spiritually dead are in this condition, how can the spiritually alive not be expected to be summoned to active duty, to be called upon to bear heavy burdens and to sacrifice deeply for the future.” </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Friends: </p>

<p> Your letter of April 7, with the book you forwarded, was received, and the Guardian was very pleased to see all you have done this past year. </p>

<p> He regrets that much of the work so enthusiastically undertaken, and carefully built up by the various committees, must now be sacrificed for some time to come. But there is no choice, and the friends must, as the Master said, give up the important for the most important of all — which is certainly the Temple’s completion and the far-flung teaching work being carried on. Indeed, such is the preoccupation of man-kind with purely material evidences of power that the solid accomplishment of a House of Worship at last ready to fulfill its function, and the constant addition of new countries and assemblies to the family of Bahá’í communities, are more likely to attract the attention of the public than meetings or publicity. </p>

<p> Far from awakening from its slumber mankind seems to be plunging deeper into the nightmare of present-day society. We Bahá’ís see only too clearly where this is leading, but this must not paralyze u s, but rather stir us to new spiritual consciousness and force us to take a firmer grip on the Rope of our Faith, determined not to be pulled into the undertow and to do all we can to pull others out of it. </p>

<p> He urges you all to exert your utmost in helping the believers to mature spiritually., and to unitedly work to consolidate the community in the laws of the Faith and the administration of its institutions. </p>

<p> He will pray for all of you, and he deeply values your devoted services. </p>

<p> Rita van Bleyswijk Sombeek, 4 July 1949 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister, </p>

<p> Your letter to our beloved Guardian of June 7, was received, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. </p>

<p> He was most happy to see the truly remarkable way in which your passport-difficulties have been straightened out, and feels that this in itself has been a way of serving the Cause, for it has called to the attention — and evidently won the sympathy of the American authorities for your uprightness, and devotion to this Faith of ours. </p>

<p> Your struggles have been richly blessed and must serve as an example to other pioneers and a sure proof that God will assist all those who arise to serve Him. </p>

<p> It is part of the preciousness of this great work being done in the teaching field that it should be done through real sacrifices and not without heartaches attending it. There is a tendency in the American outlook on life at present to believe that suffering is produced by clumsiness and is not only avoidable but not a good thing, and not essential. While there is some truth in this attitude, we as Bahá’ís cannot but believe that suffering is often an essential part of our service. The Prophets suffered bitterly, so did all the saints and martyrs and often “fed on the fragments of those broken hearts”, as Bahá’u’lláh says in one of His beautiful prayers. </p>

<p> He is very happy to hear the Cause is now so firmly established there, and also that you are going to be able to attend the European Teaching Conference before your return to America. </p>

<p> He hopes your plan to travel and teach in America will be realized and that in the future you will again return to teach and serve in Holland. Your devoted labours have been very deeply appreciated, and he feels proud of you. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í love, R. Rabbání </p>

<p> Assuring you of my great and increasing admiration for the work you are achieving, of my deep gratitude for your incessant endeavour and of my constant prayers for you and your dear co-workers who are laying such a solid foundation for the institutions of our beloved Faith in that promising country Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi </p>

<p> Published in Bahá’í Studies Bulletin Vol 1-1 </p>

<p> He can see quite clearly both your point of view and that expressed by those dear and devoted Bahá’ís whom you quoted in your letter. Both Mr. ... and Mr. ... are men of much experience and considerable learning in their way; what they no doubt meant was that the solution given to the world’s problems by Bahá’u’lláh is the only solution — being Divine in origin — and most desperately needed; therefore we, the few who have caught the vision, should not waste our energies beating up and down the paths pursued by humanity, and which are not solving its ghastly present-day problems. We should concentrate on the Cause, because it is what is needed to cure the world. This is a sound attitude, for if we don’t devote ourselves to the Bahá’í work and teaching, who will? </p>

<p> On the other hand there is a big difference between this and learning. If the Bahá’ís want to be really effective in teaching the Cause they need to be much better informed and able to discuss intelligently, intellectually, the present condition of the world and its problems. We need Bahá’í scholars, not only people far, far more deeply aware of what our teachings really are, but also well-read and well-educated people, capable of correlating our teachings to the current thoughts of the leaders of society. </p>

<p> We Bahá’ís should, in other words, arm our minds with knowledge in order to better demonstrate to, especially, the educated classes, the truths enshrined in our Faith. What the Guardian, however, does not advise the friends to do is to dissipate their time and energies in serving movements that are akin to our principles but not, we believe, capable of solving the present spiritual crisis the world finds itself in. We can cooperate with such movements and their promoters to good effect, while at the same time openly standing forth as Bahá’ís with a specific program to offer society. </p>

<p> Prepared by the The International Teaching Centre — 28 November 1999 </p>

<p> The friends are sometimes surprisingly naive and superficial in their approach to the subject of Covenant-breakers. They do not seem to understand that the descendants of Azal, with their mother’s milk, drank hatred of Bahá’u’lláh, just as the descendants of Muḥammad-‘Alí and his relatives have imbibed from babyhood a false concept of the Master. It takes practically a miracle to overcome this lifelong habit of wrong thought. Now, however, he has told the German believers to shun her. </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp70-71 </p>

<p> Henk Buys, 25 October 1949 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother: </p>

<p> Our beloved Guardian was very happy to receive your letter of October 2, and also to hear you are going out to Indonesia. </p>

<p> You can do an immense lot of good for the Faith there by teaching people whom you find open-minded and receptive to the wonderful message of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> He urges you to get in touch with: </p>

<p> Mr. Rustam Sabet, P.O. Box 19, New Delhi, India, who is the secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháïs of India, Pakistan and Burma. There is already one pioneer from India in Indonesia, and if you can see him, or write to him, after obtaining from Mr. Sabet his address, your cooperation would be very useful, as of course this believer is of oriental background. </p>

<p> It would be a wonderful service to the Faith if you can find some way of having the book Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era translated into Malay. </p>

<p> It is wonderful to think that whereas a few months ago there were no Bahá’ís in Indonesia, there will now be three, two from Holland and one from India. God truly moves in mysterious ways to carry His Faith to suffering humanity! </p>

<p> It is just possible that Mr. Charles Mason Reméy may be able to visit, on his world tour, Indonesia. Mr. Sabet can inform you of this. As Mr. Remey is a very charming and cultivated man he could be introduced to your circle of friends and give them lectures on the Cause in a way that would not savour of any propaganda, but rather seem a privilege to those who met him. </p>

<p> The Guardian assures you of his prayers for the success of your work out there, and also for dear Mrs. Buys. </p>

<p> With warmest greetings, R. Rabbání </p>

<p> P.S. In view of the great importance of having some literature in Malay the Guardian urges you, and the other two pioneers out there, to make every effort to have at least a small pamphlet translated and printed as soon as possible. He would like to receive some copies of this for the Bahá’í libraries in Haifa and Bahjí as soon as they are available. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the Almighty bless richly your efforts in the new Held opening before you, remove all obstacles from your path, and aid you to lay a strong and unassailable foundation for the institutions of His Faith, your true brother, Shoghi </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister: </p>

<p> The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer your letter of October 2, enclosing that of Mr. E. Remacle, as well as the post card relevant to it. </p>

<p> I am sending you herewith his answer, which no doubt Mr. Remacle will share with you, and which explains his attitude towards the questions raised. </p>

<p> No pressure should be brought to bear on these kind and loving friends, to join the faith. This is a matter of conscience, and whatever their future attitude may be, the Baháïs should continue to cooperate with them and show them great cordiality and friendship. </p>

<p> The Guardian is praying for their spiritual enlightenment, and also for the steady progress of your Assembly’s work in Brussels. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #228 February 1950 p4 </p>

<p> “Regarding your various questions: We must avoid giving the impression of being all tied up with peculiar religious theories; on the other hand, the 9 sides of the Temple, and the 9-pointed star require an explanation, and he feels the best one is this: </p>

<p> “Nine is the highest digit, hence symbolizes comprehensiveness, culmination; also, the reason it is used in the Temple’s form is because 9 has the exact numerical value of “Bahá” (in the numerology connected with the Arabic alphabet) and “Bahá” is the name of the Revealer of our Faith, Bahá’u’lláh. The 9-pointed star is not a part of the teachings of our Faith, but only used as an emblem representing “9”. In telling people of the 9 religions of the world, that is, existing religions, we should not give this as the reason the Temple has 9 sides. This may have been an idea of the architect, and a very pleasing idea, which can be mentioned in passing, but the Temple has 9 sides because of the association of 9 with perfection, unity and “Bahá.” </p>

<p> “The Guardian feels that with intellectuals and students of religion the question of exactly which are the 9 existing religions is controversial, and it would be better to avoid it. He does not want the friends to be rigid in these matters, but use their judgment and tact, sometimes one statement is exactly the right thing for one type of mind and the wrong thing for another. </p>

<p> “Strictly speaking the 5-pointed star is the symbol of our Faith, as used by the Báb and explained by Him. But the Guardian does not feel it is wise or necessary to complicate our explanations of the Temple by adding this. </p>

<p> “Shoghi Effendi himself uses the King James version of the Bible, both because it is an authoritative one and in beautiful English. </p>

<p> “The statement in ‘Seven Days of Creation’ certainly cannot be considered authoritative or correct. The Ark and the Flood we believe are symbolical. </p>

<p> “He feels that it is not necessary to present, prematurely, to every new Bahá’í the teachings regarding the use of the Greatest Name. Some souls need and are ready for this: others are not. Judgment must be used in such matters. It is more essential to stress the importance of prayer and to urge the use of one of the obligatory prayers.” </p>

<p> Looking back in Wonder, Philip Hainsworth, p84-5 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother, </p>

<p> Your letters of January 4 and August 22, were received, and the beloved Guardian has been anticipating answering them for some time, but the pressure of his work has held up a lot of letters of late. He regrets the delay — the material you enclosed in them was also received and he thanks you for sending it. </p>

<p> Mrs Preston wrote the Guardian three letters about herself and her work — or contemplated work. She seems to be now ready to take hold and do some teaching, and the Guardian advised her about this, and also that she need not send any pamphlet to him for correction, but should consider the British National Spiritual Assembly the natural source of advice and help in these matters. He urged her, however, to keep in close contact with him. </p>

<p> The thing he is anxious to see is a pamphlet in Swahili (and as many other African languages as possible!). He was, therefore, very pleased over your action and leaves it to you to push the matter further. You should perhaps send a copy of your material to Mrs Preston for consultation. It seems her husband is helpful and speaks Swahili himself, so he could judge of any translation you get back. </p>

<p> It pleased the Guardian very much to hear your dear mother is so much better. You were blessed in your parents and he will pray she may be spared to you f6r many years to come. Give her his love. </p>

<p> As regards your own future plans: in view of the precarious state of the Plan in Britain he does not think you can at present decide what you will do when it is over. He advises you to wait until it is over and the needs of the immediate future take shape. The best general plan for you to make would be to contemplate getting work for the next year or so in the British Isles, to go on with your services for the Cause there, and keep in mind the desirability of going at a later date to some place in Africa to establish the Cause. </p>

<p> All that you have done and are doing he most deeply appreciates. You have been of invaluable assistance to the work there since you went back, and he envisages for you many future distinguished services. </p>

<p> With warmest Bahá’í love and greetings, R. Rabbání. </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-worker, </p>

<p> Your strenuous, valiant and persistent efforts, exerted with such zeal and devotion, to ensure the success of the Plan are, indeed, worthy of the highest praise. I increasingly admire your accomplishment and feel deeply thankful for the exemplary spirit you demonstrate. My fervent and loving prayers surround you in all your activities, and I feel confident that the Beloved is well pleased with the standard of your achievements. Persevere in your high and meritorious endeavours and be happy and confident always. </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp93-4 </p>

<p> Josephine Diebold, 30 November 1949 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister: </p>

<p> Your letter dated November 23 has reached our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> He fully realizes how very distressing it is to see any inharmony in a Bahd’i Community. However, a great deal of inharmony — if not all of it — is due to the fact that the Bahá’ís do not properly understand the administration. They know that the Spiritual Assembly is the body to decide the affairs of the Community, but they do not let it do so! This is usually due not to lack of a desire to see the assembly function, but rather to over-anxiety to see it do what one or two people think is the proper thing. </p>

<p> It is very hard for people to learn to function the way ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says we should: the friends on the assembly must consult freely, all of them; then whatever the majority decides must be accepted wholeheartedly, for the sake of God. Personal opinions are important, but once the majority has voted, they must be given up and not clung to. </p>

<p> The Guardian appreciates very much your devotion to the Faith, and your loving and helpful attitude towards your fellow Bahá’ís. He urges you to go on encouraging them, and pointing out to them that these are small problems — growing pains — and will and can be overcome. </p>

<p> He will certainly pray for the unity of the friends there. </p>

<p> With Bahá’í love, R. Rabbání </p>

<p> Assuring you of my loving prayers for your success in the service of our beloved Faith and for the realization of every hope you cherish for the promotion of the interests of its institutions, your true brother, Shoghi </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #208 June 1948 p7 </p>

<p> “ ... it is establishing a dangerous precedent to allow Assemblies to put a time limit on non-attendance of their members at meetings of the S. A., beyond which that person is automatically dropped from the Assembly and a vacancy declared ... There should be no time limit fixed by Assemblies beyond which a person is dropped. Every case of prolonged absence from the sessions of the Assembly should be considered separately by that Assembly, and if the person is seen to not want to attend meetings, or to be held away from them indefinitely because of illness or travel, then a vacancy could legitimately be declared and a new member be elected .” </p>

<p> “Regarding your question concerning the Fast: Travelers are exempt from fasting, but if they want to fast while they are traveling, they are free to do so. You are exempt the whole period of your travel, not just the hours you are in a train or car, etc. If one eats unconsciously during the fasting hours, this is not breaking the Fast as it is an accident. The age limit is seventy years, but if one desires to fast after the age limit is passed, and is strong enough to, one is free to do so. If during the Fast period a person falls ill and is unable to fast, but recovers before the fast period is over, he can start to fast again and continue until the end. Of course the Fast, as you know, can only be kept during the month set aside for that purpose.” </p>

<p> Now that the war is blazing in all its fury, the only service the Bahá’ís can render, as a body, of a concrete nature is to try and perfect themselves and their institutions in the Faith, and do all in their power to spread its knowledge, and holdup the light of its example, among as many people as possible.

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp95-6 </p>

<p> Local Spiritual Assembly of Luxembourg, 15 February 1950 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Friends: </p>

<p> Your letter of recent date, with the photograph of your assembly enclosed has been received by our beloved Guardian, and he thanks you for it. </p>

<p> He is proud of the achievements of the friends in Luxembourg and delighted to hear that many of them are natives of the Duchy. In a small and conservative country such as that to gain a foothold is perforce a very slow process. So far you have done very well indeed, and he will certainly assist you all he can with his prayers. </p>

<p> He urges you to be confident and courageous, united and loving amongst yourselves — then the blessings of Bahá’u’lláh cannot but be showered upon you all. </p>

<p> With warmest greetings, R. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear co-workers: </p>

<p> I was so pleased to receive your letter, and wish to assure you of my deep appreciation of the spirit that animates you in the service of His Faith, and of my ardent prayers for your success in its service. Persevere in your noble efforts, and rest assured that the Beloved will bless your high endeavours. Your true brother; Shoghi </p>

<p> Mr. Ellsworth Blackwell, </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother: </p>

<p> As our beloved Guardian is very busy these days, I will answer briefly your letter of December 1, 1949. </p>

<p> It is certainly permissible for a believer to write the N.S.A. </p>

<p> There are no dissenting votes in the Cause. When the majority of an assembly decides a matter, the minority, we are told by the Master, should accept this. To insist on having one’s dissenting vote recorded is not good, and achieves no constructive end. We must learn to look upon the laws of the Cause and administrative principles and not the short comings of the individual members of an assembly. He urges you not to distress yourself over these details, but pursue serenely your teaching of the Faith which is the most important work of all. </p>

<p> With Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> R. Rabbání </p>

<p> Looking back in Wonder, Philip Hainsworth, p84-5 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother, </p>

<p> Your letters, dated October 16 and December 7 and 12, 1949, and March 12 1950, have been received, as well as St Barbe Baker’s letter to you. </p>

<p> The beloved Guardian, having been in touch with you by cable, and being more over-worked this year than ever, delayed answering. You know, from what you saw here, how inefficient — to understate the matter — his servants are. The work at the shrines has vastly increased and of necessity, for as the first part of the building will soon be finished, the grounds around it have been entirely remodelled to fit it better and show it off. All this he has been forced to superintend and plan personally. The attacks and status of the enemies you know about. So that in all he is very tired. </p>

<p> He was, however, cheered and pleased to hear about the new African language pamphlets. This is really a most valuable service you have rendered. As he cabled you, he does not feel an English pamphlet is essential now, and only adds to expenses. He thinks you should consult the NSA (after Plan’s end!) about points 1, 2, 3, regarding the type and printing extra material. Generally speaking, he feels some cards with the basic principles would be an advantage. He leaves all details about the appearance of these pamphlets to your judgement and any advice the NSA gives. </p>

<p> He was very happy to see St Barbe Baker and Mrs Preston had cooperated with you, and he would like you to particularly thank Mr Backwell Senior for his contribution in making the Hausa translation. </p>

<p> Although these three translations may not be perfect, they are an important beginning and give us a lever in hand, so to speak. </p>

<p> He admires your mother very much, and is delighted her operation was a success, and that she is back at your side. Regarding her home: he does not see why see feels compelled to part with it at this stage. Can she not derive an income from renting it temporarily until you both see clearly what your future plans are? Your loyalty and devotion are deeply appreciated, you may be sure. </p>

<p> With Bahá’í love, R. Rabbání. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the Almighty bless, sustain, and guide you in your constant, and deeply appreciated labours, remove every obstacle in your path, and enable you to win still greater victories for His Faith and its nascent institutions. </p>

<p> Your letters, and those signed by other members of the Assembly, of September 29, 30; October 3, 4, 7; November 1 (three); December 15, 1949, and January 2, 11, 13; February 1, 2, 15; March 2, 3, 6; April 21 (two) ; May 8, (two), 24 (two), 25, 26; June 2, 4, 17 (three), 18 of 1950, as well as their enclosures, and material sent under separate cover, have been received, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer them on his behalf. </p>

<p> He is very sorry that so much important correspondence has had to wait so long for an answer. It is only the last two weeks that he has been able to take up the question of his mail, due to the fact that the very serious illness of my father, since April 5, has kept us all in a condition of confusion and suspense for months. As it was seemingly a hopeless condition, and one most agonizing for us all to have to watch, it was impossible to concentrate for the time being on anything else. Thanks, however, to the mercy of Bahá’u’lláh, and the iron determination of the Guardian not to allow the builder of the Shrine to pass away at this time, Mr. Maxwell is now recovering, and our lives are getting back to normal. </p>

<p> During the winter, as you know, the Shrine work has 1been steadily going forward. This necessitated not only constant supervision on the part of the Guardian but also involved extensive excavations behind the original building in order to permit the arcade to fit around it. Shoghi Effendi himself, in order to economize and ensure the work was carried on in such a way as not to endanger the Shrine, spent many hours daily up in the gardens, superintending this work personally, which was very exhausting for him; and took up, with other problems, all his time last winter. On the 29th of last month the last stone of the arcade was set in. position, and the effect of the first story, now entirely finished, is truly glorious. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> The Guardian feels believers desiring to declare themselves are entitled to read the full text of the Master’s Will beforehand, and indeed, they should do so. </p>

<p> The increasing publicity the Temple is receiving, especially in the Chicago area, is very encouraging. Now that the arcade of the Shrine is finished, the believers should seek to get as much publicity as possible for this beautiful and interesting building, as it will serve to call the Faith to the attention of many people, especially those visiting or interested in Israel. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> The Guardian regrets very much that he is not able to supply the friends with any new translations at present. The rapid expansion of the Cause, and the consequent tremendous increase in his correspondence, the building of the Shrine and all it entails, the upkeep and consolidation of the international Center, all not only keep him constantly occupied, but are sapping his strength and taking up all his time. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> The Guardian considers it immaterial whether you use the term “ Persia” or “Írán”. </p>

<p> Regarding Mr. — - — ‘s bequest to the Temple: your Assembly should inform his widow that, because he was not a Bahá’í, we cannot use his money for our purposes, as we consider our Faith and its institutions our free gift to humanity. You can, however, and indeed should, accept it for charity and expend it in his name. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> Regarding holding the Latin America Conventions: all Bahá’í conventions must meet within the Riḍván period. He suggests the Central and South American conventions be convened for April 21st, or a day or two later, in order to permit North Americans to get back in time for their own Convention, if they desire to attend it. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> He does not feel the By-Laws should be changed: what could be done is to insert a foot-note. explaining that, as the Bahá’í day begins and ends at sunset, the evening of March 20th would be considered as a legal date by us. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> The purpose of the By-Laws is to clarify and strengthen the administrative legal functions of a Bahá’í community. As a believer of 15 cannot vote he sees no reason for including a statement regarding the age of 15 in the By-Laws. A baby can be considered a Bahá’í; 15 is merely the age of maturity for fasting, marriage, etc., and in the case of America, a declaration at that age is invited from the youth in order to protect them, at a future date, from being forced to do active military service. </p>

<p> In this connection he would like to point out that if the believers gather before sundown on a certain date it does not matter if the meeting continues after sunset; it may still be considered as being held on the day they gathered. </p>

<p> The Naw-Rúz Feast should be held on March 21 before sunset and has nothing to do with the 19 Day Feast. The 19 Day Feast is administrative in function whereas the Naw-Rúz is our New Year, a Feast of hospitality and rejoicing. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> The Esslemont book is now printed in about 60 languages, and the Guardian does not want any revision made of it at present. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> He sees no objection to Bahá’ís in various universities holding organized Bahá’í student groups, as long as they do this on each campus according to the rules, and no general statement is made regarding such procedure by your Assembly. The tendency of the Bahá’ís all over the world is to constantly try to lay down new rules and regulations, and pour the Faith into molds, whereas the Guardian insists on the greatest elasticity in details and only the fundamentals, laid down by him already, should be universal and rigidly adhered to. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> The Guardian has no objection to the suggestion of the Temple architect to go to the additional expense at present of $32,136 in using cast stone for the outside walls of the Temple interior, as long as this will be included in the top figure estimated originally and accepted, or not exceed it excessively. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> The Guardian has not felt he wished to make any voice recordings for the various Conventions as yet. But he thanks you for your offer to send the necessary machine for this purpose. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> The Bahá’í marriage ceremony should be carried out because we are Bahá’ís, regardless of whether it is legal or not. All details regarding this matter are left to the discretion of your Assembly. </p>

<p> In closing let me assure you that our beloved Guardian has watched with interest and approval the achievements of your body during the last year. The Temple is now assured, the European work going ahead wonderfully. It is Latin America that requires the greatest care at this time in order to launch the two new NSA’s on their careers successfully. </p>

<p> His loving thoughts and prayers are with you, and he shares your cares and burdens in spirit. · </p>

<p> The illnesses of dear Mr. Holley and Mr. Sprague have been most unfortunate, and he admires not only their own patience and devoted spirit but also the way in which their coworkers took on added burdens. </p>

<p> With Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> — R. RABBÁNÍ </p>

<p> P .S. The Convention record has been received; also the photograph of the Phoenix, all-Negro Assembly, sent by the RTC of the Central States: he was delighted to see this picture and note the progress in the Faith which it represents. </p>

<p> to the NSA dated July 5, 1950: </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1291'> 1950-07-12 gen letter to Regional Assemblies of Latin America </h3>

<p> Divine Springtime — Louise Coswell Recalls, pp79-83 </p>

<p> to the National Spiritual Assemblies of the Bahá’ís of Meso-America and the Antilles and South America. </p>

<p> Dearly Beloved Friends, </p>

<p> The formation of the first National Spiritual Assemblies of the Bahá’ís of Central and South America — an event hailed by the entire Bahá’í world — constitutes a landmark of the utmost significance not only in the history of the evolution of the Faith in Latin America, but in the annals of the Formative age of the Bahá’í Dispensation as well. It signifies the termination of the first Epoch in the rise and establishment of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in Central and South America — an Epoch that was ushered in on the morrow of the revelation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan through the pioneer services rendered by individual believers, among whom ranks as foremost that immortal and heroic soul, Martha Root, and which culminated with the successful prosecution of two successive historic campaigns initiated by the North American Bahá’í Community in pursuance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan. </p>

<p> “This second and momentous Epoch in the unfoldment of the Faith, now being entered upon, is signalized by the emergence of two newly established, independent, firmly-knit regional communities, embracing all the Republics of Central and South America, stretching from the borders of Mexico as far as the southern extremity of Chile, comprising no less than forty organized local assemblies, many of them already incorporated, every one of them animated by the spiritual verities of one common Faith, and all of them functioning in accordance with the principles of a vigorously operating, divinely appointed Administrative Order. </p>

<p> This new phase in the development of an irresistably advancing Faith presages, moreover,the formal association of these twin newly-emerged communities with their parent community in the North American continent in the prosecution of the Plan conceived by the Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, among the Latin American races now awakening to the clarion call sounded by Him in His immortal Tablets. Though not enjoying the status and privileges conferred in that same Plan by ‘ Abdu’1-Bahá on the North American Bahá’í Community, yet, in view of the momentous and stirring summons issued by the Author of the Revelation in His Most Holy Book, addressed to the Rulers of all the Republics the Western Hemisphere, both of these communities may be said to have been invested with rights and duties which no community in any continent of the Eastern Hemisphere can claim to possess. </p>

<p> This association, which will be formally inaugurated with the termination of the Second Seven Year Plan, and which is destined to reveal its potentialities in the course of the unfolding of the Formative Age of the Faith, and particularly as a consequence of the formation of separate National Spiritual Assemblies in each of the Republics of Latin America, is a distinction which every adherent of the Faith, whether a native believer or a North American pioneer labouring in Central or South America, must constantly bear in mind. Its importance cannot be overestimated, nor can its full significance be assessed at the present hour. </p>

<p> “The consolidation of the existing assemblies, the multiplication of groups; the steady development of the process of Bahá’í incorporation; the expansion of the all-important task of translating, publishing and disseminating Bahá’í literature in Spanish and Portuguese; the consolidation of the recently inaugurated national and local funds; the strengthening of such institutions as Bahá’í National Committees, Summer Schools, Conventions and Regional Teaching Conferences; the acceleration of the highly meritorious work already commenced amongst the Indians in both Central and South America; the progressive proclamation of the verities of the Faith to all sections of the population of Latin America; above all, the triple task of constantly deepening the spiritual life of the individual believer, of enriching his understanding of the spiritual and administrative principles of his Faith, and of cementing the unity of each local community — these stand out as the foremost responsibilities to be assumed during these two concluding years of the Second Seven Year Plan by the two newly formed National Spiritual Assemblies of Central and South America, in preparation of the launching of specially conceived, clearly defined plans, the initiation of which must mark the formal association of the Bahá’í communities of Latin America with the National Bahá’í communities in the United States and Canada, for the furtherance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s world-embracing Master Plan, now still in the embryonic stage of its development. </p>

<p> A fire with the vision now unfolding itself before their eyes; conscious of the sacred responsibility which, as implied in the ringing words recorded in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, they must increasingly shoulder; fortified by the contemplation of the manner and rapidly with which their beloved Faith has struck its roots into the soil of their homelands; confident that the same mysterious and unconquerable Power that has watched over the operation, and ensured the consummation, of the specific Plan undertaken by various National Bahá’í Communities in recent years in both the East and the West, will, as they prepare to launch their own collective enterprises in the years immediately ahead, vouchsafe to them Its sustaining grace and unfailing guidance; the members of these newly emerged communities and above all, their recently elected national representatives, must display, during this period of transition, a spirit of dedication, a tenacity of purpose, willingness for self-sacrifice, that will surpass anything as yet exhibited in their past history, which will at once excite the envy and admiration of their older sister communities in all the continents of the globe, and enable them to acquire the spiritual potentialities that will assist them to take their honoured place in the ranks of those same communities which, in various regions of the world, are collectively and energetically carrying out their own national campaigns in the service and for the glory of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> That they may prove themselves worthy of the missions with which they will soon be formally invested; that they may never allow anything to interfere with the successful conclusion of this present preparatory phase of their historic task; that they may, through the quality of their devotion and the solidity of their achievements, rejoice the souls of the Concourse on high and, above all, the Spirits of the Holy Báb, of Bahá’u’lláh, and of His beloved Son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, so that they may contribute their share, as independent pillars, in sustaining the House, whose erection must mark the culmination of the establishment of the Administrative Order of their Faith, is the dearest wish of my heart, my constant hope and my ardent prayer. </p>

<p> He is delighted over the success you have met with in your teaching efforts there, and very deeply appreciates the sacrifices you and your dear wife have made in order to render our Faith, and your people, this valuable service. He does not feel it is right for you and your family to impoverish yourselves further in order to remain on the Reservation; on the other hand your being there and living amongst the people is undoubtedly the best way to teach them. He, therefore, suggests you present your problem and your own suggestions to the N.S.A. of Canada, and seek their advice and help. </p>

<p> Dear Co-worker: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the Benelux countries, pp96-7 </p>

<p> Jeanne Boekhoudt, 2 November 1950 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister: </p>

<p> Your letter of October 6 was received by our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> He was very pleased to see you are working now and that you have also a dear Bahá’í sister there to assist you and labour with you to establish eventually a Spiritual Assembly there in the Hague. </p>

<p> The Guardian feels that the question of the Clarks remaining in Holland or leaving is a matter which the European Teaching Committee must decide. You must always remember that this Committee is responsible for 10 countries, and they are often forced to take away the strongest pioneers they have and transfer them to a weak place which is not progressing satisfactorily or is in danger. </p>

<p> All Bahá’í Communities suffer setbacks and growing pains, have problems to meet and tests. This is inevitable; but the remedy is to do ones best, with love and patience, and seek to adjust our problems in the frame-work of the administration. He realizes this is not always easy! But it is required of us, and will lead to great things in the future. </p>

<p> He urges you to continue your teaching of the Faith there, with a peaceful heart, confident Bahá’u’lláh will help you and bless you. </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Sister:90 Your letter of October 6 has been received, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. </p>

<p> He is very happy to see you are working to spread the Faith in the Hague, and are so active and devoted in serving it. </p>

<p> Regarding the Clarks leaving Holland: he feels this is a matter which must be decided by the European Teaching Committee as they have all the goal countries to consider, and know where the need is greatest, which, of course, is more than the individual Bahá’ís in different countries do. Often they are forced to transfer capable pioneers from a relatively strong community to a weaker one in danger. </p>

<p> He feels you should have confidence in the E.T.C. and while appreciating the fact that the Bahá’ís are all just human and like other people, realize that this Committee has acted with great wisdom, courage and integrity, otherwise it never could have accomplished what it has. </p>

<p> He urges you to follow the example of Mr. and Mrs. Clark, whose spirit so strongly influenced you, and if they are transferred, do all you can to accomplish their work and assist any future pioneers who may take their place. </p>

It is surprising to see how the confirmations of Bahá’u’lláh flow out to the friends, and enable them to do ever more for His Cause. Truly, the work, on not only a spiritual plane, but on the physical plane too, is fed from unseen springs.” </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother: </p>

<p> Your letter of May 2nd was received by our beloved Guardian and brought him great joy. </p>

<p> The decision you have taken to go to Africa and teach the Cause is momentous and is worthy of the great race you belong to. The Guardian has been eagerly awaiting a Negro pioneer, and feels that Bahá’u’lláh will surely bless your enterprise and assist you in this work y”ou are planning for His Faith. </p>

<p> You are fortunate to have a wife by your side kindled with the same enthusiasm and determination, and your joint labours will be a tremendous asset to the new campaign in Africa. </p>

<p> The Guardian has recently called upon India and Persia to open up further territories, and he feels that this pioneer effort-the first in Bahá’í history linking five NSA’s in an international undertaking-is truly historic and of the greatest importance. </p>

<p> He will ardently pray that the way may speedily open for you to go to a goal country in Africa, and he urges you to persevere in your efforts. We all have weak points, but when we arise to serve Bahá’u’lláh He helps us overcome them in a truly miraculous way! </p>

<p> Divine Springtime — Louise Coswell Recalls, pp83-86 </p>

<p> National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Meso-America and the Antilles. </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Friends: </p>

<p> Your letter of May 5, 1951, as well as the r e port of the convention and minutes of your first Assembly meeting, and the photographs you sent, have reached our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> It gives him very great happiness to address this first litter to your Assembly, newly come into the field of international service to the Faith, and so ready and eager to embark upon its truly historic tasks. </p>

<p> The believers of Central and South America are embarking upon their services at a most important time, not only in the history of this great Cause, but also in the history of mankind. Never has the outlook in this physical world been darker — wi|h the shadow of perhaps another devastating conflict lengthening on the horizon — never the spiritual promise greater, for we see the Message of Bahá’u’lláh at last spreading all over the globe and planting its banner in the most distant countries. </p>

<p> The opportunities for this new National Assembly to distinguish itself are therefore unique and its privileges priceless. He feels sure that the Latin American believers are going to demonstrate their readiness and capacity in such a way as to rejoice their fellow-Bahá’ís and the heart of the beloved Master. </p>

<p> Like the United States and Canada, Latin America is the New World; it has the freshness of youth, and far from such ancient civilizations as those of Europe and Asia, with their interminable problems and grievances, it can undertake service to Bahá’u’lláh under more auspicious circumstances. </p>

<p> He feels that your Assembly must, now at the very beginning of its work, devote its energy primarily to laying a sound and abiding foundation for the future. What does this imply? </p>

<p> First and foremost establishing harmony, love and understanding amongst the Bahá’ís under its jurisdiction. When the friends are united in the love of God all problems can be solved and all work carried out with success. Personal problems, differences 84 of race, nationality, origin, are dissolved in the crucible of Bahá’í brotherhood. </p>

<p> Second, the teaching work: The local assemblies must be maintained and strengthened and the groups encouraged and protected, so that they may attain assembly status as soon as possible; extension teaching work must also be undertaken and news of the existence of this Faith broadcasted as much as possible </p>

<p> Third: The National Fund must be supported. The friends are for the most part, not well-to-do, but they must realize that to give to the Fund, even in a small way, is the important thing, for it is a visible sign of their unity, their devotion, their desire to support the institutions which now represent them and belong to them. </p>

<p> Fourth: Your Assembly, in conjunction with that of South America, should devote particular attention to Bahá’í literature, as in the past the publication of really adequate translations and their dissemination have been often delayed and the books inferior in style. The Spanish speaking Bahá’ís, becoming more numerous all the time, have a right to possess the literature of the Faith, so infinitely rich and inspiring, in their own tongue and well translated. </p>

<p> The Guardian feels that during the coming few years, your Assembly should not hesitate to lean on and consult the American Assembly. This in no way implies any weakness or inadequacy on your part but is logical and organic. The American National Spiritual Assembly is one of the oldest in the Bahá’í world, it has gone through a lot, and consequently acquired an experience which cannot be obtained over-night. It also looks upon with pride, affection, and concern this beautiful daughter, so>to speak, that it has brought into being. So your tie vs a deep and natural one. </p>

<p> Shoghi Effendi is also most anxious for the Message to reach the aboriginal inhabitants of the Americas. These people, for the most part down-trodden and ignorant, should receive from the Bahá’ís a special measure of love, and every effort be made to teach them. Their enrollment in the Faith will enrich them and us, and demonstrate our principle of the Oneness of Man far better than words or the wide conversion of the ruling races ever can. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> “The most important thing for the believers is, of course, to be united and to really love each other for the sake of God, (Otherwise it is not possible to love everyone). However, if communities wait until love and complete harmony are established before teaching, the teaching work will come to a standstill. Both sides must be cultivated; whilst actively teaching the friends must themselves be taught and deepened in the spirit of the Faith, which brings love and unity.” </p>

<p> Looking back in Wonder, Philip Hainsworth, p127-8 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Friends, </p>

<p> Your letter made our beloved Guardian very happy. His thoughts — and hopes — are constantly focused these days on the wonderful work opening up in Africa, and he rejoiced to see so many of you united there in Tanganyika. </p>

<p> Truly this Cause moves forward propelled by forces more than we can see or grasp; God has surely raised you up and given you this blessed privilege, this unique privilege, of kindling the Light of His Faith there and writing your name in history. </p>

<p> How significant that the first group to be formed in the heart of Africa is composed of believers from the East and the West, united, working side by side to bring the Message of the Blessed Beauty to one of the great waiting races of the world, hitherto oppressed and disregarded, but now being offered the waters of life and a wonderful future. </p>

<p> You may be sure your activities will be supported by his special and fervent prayers, and that he awaits with keen interest news of every new development in your work. </p>

<p> While being wise and tactful you should, however, never lose sight of the fact that it is to the African peoples, primarily, that your mission is addressed. To bring them into our world-wide brotherhood is your duty and privilege. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> R. Rabbání. </p>

<p> Dear and valued co-workers, </p>

<p> I was so pleased to receive your letter and am greatly encouraged by your exemplary and magnificent response. You have indeed set a noble example, and the record of your services will, 1 trust, enrich the annals of the Faith. Persevere in your labours, and rest assured that the Beloved will watch over you and sustain and guide you your historic and highly meritorious activities. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1328'> 1951-08-30 to Philip Hainsworth re teaching in Africa </h3>

<p> Looking back in Wonder, Philip Hainsworth, p124-5 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother, </p>

<p> Your letters dated June 8 and 28, July 5 and 17, with enclosures, have been received, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. I am also enclosing two receipts. </p>

<p> He was very sorry to hear of the sudden death of Mr Preston — a great blow for his poor wife. She will need the love and help of the friends in Africa very much at present. </p>

<p> Regarding the question you asked about funds for the Shrine being sent from Egypt: the friends must not do anything illegal; if they can remit via England legally, they can do so, otherwise they should let it accumulate in Egypt for the present. </p>

<p> You may mail him the reports from Egypt. </p>

<p> He feels you and Mr Nakhjavání should encourage the Persian boys in Geneva. All he ever asks of the friends is to be true Bahá’ís, and if the Persian students would thoughtfully grasp his instructions regarding the administrative relation of believers in the goal countries to the ETC and the American NS A the trouble would no doubt not have arisen. These students have a high responsibility; the western Bahá’ís look to the Persians and they should, instead of being proud and often disputatious, show a spirit of loving consideration and a submission to the proper administrative authority. Needless to say they should exemplify the BaháT life — which, alas, many of them did not. </p>

<p> He was very sorry tq hear your dear mother is ill. She has truly shown an exemplary BaháT spirit in every way and it is easy to see a lot of your own characteristics of faith and courage come from this fine woman. You have every reason to be proud of her! He trusts, and is praying, she may recover and later join you. But whatever happens, her reward at the hands of the true Beloved is certainly assured. He wishes more of the BaháTs would arise to such heights of devotion and sacrifice. </p>

<p> The progress being made in Africa is truly miraculous, as if a special benediction from on High is being extended to this work. Please give his love to the devoted Banánís and tell them the services they are rendering are imperishable and deeply appreciated by him. </p>

<p> He feels sure that the work in Uganda will now go forward rapidly. </p>

<p> The news from Dar is wonderful, too. </p>

<p> Your eager spirit has led you back to Africa and he cherishes the hope that you may prove to be a spiritual Stanley of Africa. </p>

<p> His loving prayers are with you, </p>

<p> With Bahá’í love. </p>

<p> P.S. The racial question all over Africa is very acute, but, while being wise and tactful, the believers must realise that their standard is far from that of the white colonials. They have not gone there to uphold the white man’s supremacy, but to give the Cause of God to, primarily, the black man whose home is Africa. </p>

<p> Dear and prized co-worker, </p>

<p> The work you have achieved since your departure from the Holy Land, in the service of our beloved Faith, evokes, through its range and quality, my profound admiration and heartfelt gratitude. The services you are now rendering in Africa, ennoble and enrich this record of notable achievements. You are often in my thoughts and prayers, and I cherish the brightest hopes for your future activities, and will continue to pray from the depths of my heart for your dear self as well as for your dear mother. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1337'> 1951-11-23 The Year Nine </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #252 February 1952 p2 </p>

<p> Regarding your question about the Centenary, the Guardian wishes you to share the following information with the Persian and other National Assemblies; the “Year Nine” is an abbreviation of 1269 A.H. This term has been used by the Báb in His Writings, foreshadowing the Birth of the Revelation of Bahá’u ‘llah. The friends should refer, in “God Passes By”, to the passages mentioning the year Nine in order to appreciate its significance as well as the great importance attached to it by the Báb. In that same book the Guardian has explained that the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh was progressive: It commenced with the first intimation He received, of His Prophetic Mission while in the Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál of Ṭihrán. The beginning of the year Nine occurred about two months after His imprisonment in that dungeon. We do not know the exact time He received this first intimation, nor have either the Báb, or Bahá’u’lláh, made mention of any specific date in this connection. We therefore regard the entire year Nine as a Holy Year, and the emphasis should be placed, in accordance with the Báb’s Writings, on the entire Year which started in October, 1852. This means our Centenary Year of Celebration will be from October, 1952 to October, 1953. All celebrations must be held within these two dates. As the Riḍván period is associated with Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation it should be regarded as the most important time of that year and therefore the most suitable period for the celebrations. </p>

<p> The second stage in that progressive Revelation was when Bahá’u’lláh declared His Mission to His companions in Ba<u>gh</u>dád; this is considered the most momentous stage in His Revelation, hence it is called the “Most Great Festival”, the One Hundredth Anniversary of which will be celebrated in Riḍván 1963 and will constitute the Most Great Jubilee, the third of its kind, the first Jubilee having been the Centenary of the Báb’s Declaration; and the second the one we will be celebrating all over the world in 1952-1953. </p>

<p> The third and last stage in Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation was when He proclaimed His Mission to the rulers and religious leaders of the world in Adrianople. The first was an intimation, the second a declaration and the third a proclamation-the intimation was from God to Him, which He kept a secret within His own spirit, the declaration was to His faithful companions, and the proclamation was to the entire body of the religious and political leaders of mankind. </p>

<p> He was very pleased to have the first pioneer from America go forth under this organized African campaign; he was doubly happy that it should have been an American Negro who went. This is highly appropriate and surely has delighted the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who watched over that race with particular love, tenderness and understanding. The ever-increasing part the colored friends are taking in the work of the Cause, and especially of late years in the pioneer work, gratifies the Guardian immensely. And now, to add further to the record of their services, they can count a member of their race a Hand of the Cause. When we read in the Will and Testament how great is the function of the Hands, we appreciate to what an exalted station our dear brother Louis Gregory has attained. </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Friends: </p>

<p> Your letter of December 11th has reached our beloved Guardian; and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. He was most happy to see that you are now a united, dedicated and firm group, endeavoring to promote the Faith in that city, which is truly of historic importance; and he hopes that, through your energetic labors, it will soon be possible for you to have an Assembly. </p>

<p> The European Teaching Conference no doubt lent a great impetus to the work in Holland. The Cause is spreading at a very increasing rate, and its glory mounting rapidly above the horizon, so to speak. We are, it seems, entering the period the Master foretold, when the masses of the people would become aware of this Cause, and attracted to it. We must work energetically to hasten that happy hour. </p>

You can see before you the vast territories to be won over to the Faith in the coming decade, and, if you set your mind to it, can choose a place where you want to pioneer and prepare yourself for this thrilling service! </p>

<p> “From Tibet to the South Seas, Africa to far off points in Asia and Europe-there are lands waiting to be opened to the Faith. He will pray that some of you may be the ones to render this form of service.” </p>

<p> Looking back in Wonder, Philip Hainsworth, p161 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Friends, </p>

<p> Your letter of 24 June has reached our beloved Guardian, as well as the postscript of Mr Philip Hainsworth, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> He is delighted over the progress being made there, and was very relieved to hear from the Africa Committee, that the Conference plans can now go ahead smoothly. Also the reports of the work being done in outlying districts (which dear Mrs Banání has sent to Luṭfu’lláh, and which he shares with the Guardian) have caused much joy. </p>

<p> It is wonderful to see that the African friends, having, as is their right and privilege, taken the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh to their hearts on their own, are arising to carry it to their fellow-countrymen, and are meeting with such notable success. How clearly we see that when prejudice and suspicion give way to love and confidence, the Power of God flows through and brings unexpected confirmation! </p>

<p> He was very pleased to see you have initiated a plan of your own, but feels that any plans for translation should be worked out in close consultation with the Africa Committee. This does not mean he is averse to a new translation. </p>

<p> Wonderful work lies ahead of your Assembly, and you may be sure he follows your activities with close interest and supports them with his loving prayers. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> Reply: Yes. </p>

<p> 6. Question:-The present plan is to hold a meeting of dedication for Bahá’ís only, followed by a public dedication on the same day. Is this plan approved? </p>

<p> He was also pleased that a number of the German friends could attend. </p>

<p> The Guardian assures you all of his loving prayers for you in the fulfilment of your noble tasks, that all your labours may be abundantly blessed. </p>

<p> Looking back in Wonder, Philip Hainsworth, p173-4 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Brother, </p>

<p> Youř letters dated July 7th, August 26th, November 21st, 1952 and January 23rd (2), and April 9th, 1953 have been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. He has not written to you before, because he was very busy, and also because he felt he would be able to offer you most hearty congratulations if he delayed! Now, after the formation of not only the Jinja Assembly, but also eleven others throughout Uganda, he compliments you on the wonderful work you have achieved there, in collaboration with the other believers. It has brought great joy to his heart, and indeed to the hearts of all the Bahá’ís. </p>

<p> He hopes that» during this coming year, you and ‘Alí Nakhjavání will devote yourselves as much as you can to consolidating the new assemblies, and assisting the new believers to gradually understand better the Administration, and its application in Bahá’í Community Life. Tact, love and patience will no doubt be needed, and one cannot expect these new believers to do everything in the same way that the old and tried Communities do. Indeed individuality of expression, within the framework of the Administrative Order, is preferable to too great a uniformity. </p>

<p> The Guardian feels sure that your dear mother and father, who shared in and were part of the sacrifice you made in going to Africa, rejoice from on high at that which has been accomplished. He assures you of his loving prayers. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í greetings, R Rabbání </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the Almighty bless your splendid Services to His Faith, guide and sustain you always, and enable you to extend continually the range of your historic and deeply valued accomplishments. </p>

<p> ‘’The beloved Guardian has been greatly enthused over the reports he has received of the Convention, Dedication of the Temple. and the Intercontinental Teaching Conference. </p>

<p> He was very happy to get your word of the 128 who volunteered for pioneer service. </p>

<p> “In connection with this word, he cabled you May 19, strongly urging the intending pioneers to scatter as widely as possible, and to settle even territories and islands not specifically assigned to the United States. </p>

<p> “The Guardian feels, now that the Ten Year Crusade has been so auspiciously launched, no time should be lost nor any stone left unturned, to hurry the completion of the first stage of the Plan. The impact with which the friends meet this great challenge, and the example which the American Bahá’ís show in actual deeds in carrying forward the Plan, will have a world effect. </p>

<p> “The Guardian feels that as the chief administrators of the Master’s Divine Plan for the propagation of the Faith. the American Bahá’ís have great responsibility in the entire project, even though certain areas have been assigned to other National Assemblies. Thus the American National Assembly can and should send pioneers to other virgin areas, even though assigned to another National Assembly. This they can do, because of the mission the Master gave them. In fact. the Guardian would welcome most heartily, word of the placing of some pioneers in territories assigned other National Assemblies. </p>

<p> “This is the period of the scattering of the faithful, and the sooner they scatter, the better. particularly in virgin areas, all over the world. This is a sure way to bring to early completion the opening phase of the ten year Crusade. </p>

<p> “The Guardian would welcome early settlement in the South Pacific Islands, Africa (and he has mentioned especially Belgian Congo, French Somaliland, Ruanda Urundi, French Congo, Madagascar). (He feels there is no need for more pioneers at this time in South Africa, other than those already arranged.) He likewise has mentioned the Cameroons, Togoland. and areas where new National Assemblies are to be created. </p>

<p> “Now is the time for the American Bahá’ís to show their spiritual primacy — they should spread over the face of the earth, not only concentrating on the areas assigned to them, but sending pioneers wherever they can, and the sooner the better, and the wider the extent, the better. </p>

<p> “You may be sure the beloved Guardian will pray ardently for the success of your efforts, and those of all the American Bahá’ís.” </p>

<p> “ Our beloved Guardian has been greatly encouraged by reports reaching him from all parts of the Bahá’í world. especially from America, of the victories already gained, and the plans being laid for the prosecution of the Ten Year Crusade. </p>

<p> ‘’They have evoked his awe-inspiring, and soul-stirring cablegram of May 28th, calling for the immediate settlement of all the 131 virgin areas of the Plan, just as quickly as possible. He is convinced that the friends will arise and translate their enthusiasm into action, because the keynote of the Crusade must be action, action, action! </p>

<p> “The settlement of these virgin areas is of such an emergency nature that he feels pioneering in one of them takes precedence over every other type of Bahá’í service — whether it be in the teaching or administrative fields of the Faith. So important is it that the National Assembly may delay initiation of steps to fulfill other phases of the plan, until all these areas are conquered for the Faith. Nothing. absolutely nothing, must be allowed to interfere with the placing of pioneers in each of the 131 goal countries. </p>

<p> “By virtue of being the Chief Executor of the Divine Plan. the American Bahá’ís may settle in any territory of the world. In fact. the Guardian would welcome word of American pioneers being settled in areas assigned other National Assemblies. At the Guardian’s direction I have written all other Assemblies of this fact. and asking them to assist in the settlement of American pioneers in their areas. </p>

<p> “As his dramatic cable indicates. the Guardian will have prepared an illuminated ‘Roll of Honor’ on which will be inscribed the names of the ‘Knights of Bahá’u’lláh.’ who first enter these 131 virgin areas. This ·Roll of Honor’ \vill be placed inside the entrance door of the Inner Sanctuary of the Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> “From time to time, the Guardian will announce to the Bahá’í world the names of those holy souls who arise under the conditions outlined in his message, and settle these areas and conquer them for Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> “Now is the hour for America to demonstrate its spiritual primacy. There is no time after this moment! All the promises of the Master to America in the Tablets of the Divine Plan must be won now. The divine graces must be spread by the American Bahá’ís over the face of the globe. The Guardian is sure that the glory of America and its spiritual mission will be carried through to a resounding victory. which will affect the entire globe. </p>

<p> Published in Bahá’í Studies Review 4:1 </p>

<p> The convocation of the epoch-making Convention in the city of Florence, coinciding with the climax of the festivities commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission, is an event which posterity will recognize as a landmark of the utmost significance in the second Epoch of the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation. This historic gathering culminated in the erection of yet another pillar designed to contribute its share to the establishment of the Supreme Legislative Body of the Administrative Order of the Faith. It may be rightly acclaimed as the fairest fruit of the great European enterprise launched in pursuance of the second Seven Year Plan formulated by the American Bahá’í community for the purpose of carrying a stage further the provisions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan for the systematic propagation of His Father’s Faith. It has set in motion forces which, in the course of a few years, will hasten the emergence of two independent National Spiritual Assemblies, one in the capital city of the peace-loving, high — minded, firmly-knit Swiss nation, and the other within the heart and stronghold of the leading, the most ancient and powerful Church of Christendom, and the seat of the government of a country whose people, by virtue of their qualities of mind and heart, may well rank as one of the most distinguished on the European continent. It has provided, through the formation of the twelfth National Assembly in the Bahá’í world, yet another instrument that will, no doubt, lend a great impetus, despite its having been so recently fashioned, to the progress of a world Crusade, destined to exert so great an influence on the immediate destinies of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1411'> 1953-07-21 letter To The Third Intercontinental Teaching Conference — Stockholm </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #271 September 1953 p2-5 </p>

<p> To the Hands of the Cause, the members of the National Spiritual Assemblies, the pioneers, the resident believers and visitors attending the European Intercontinental Teaching Conference in Stockholm, Sweden: </p>

<p> Well-beloved friends: </p>

<p> With a glad and grateful heart I welcome the convocation, in the capital-city of Sweden, of the third of a series of Intercontinental Teaching Conferences associated with the world-wide festivities commemorating the centenary of the Mission of Bahá’u’lláh and destined to exert a profound and lasting influence on the immediate fortunes of His Faith in all continents of the globe. </p>

<p> I look back, with feelings of wonder, thankfulness and joy, upon the chain of memorable circumstances which, a little over a century ago, accompanied the introduction of the Faith into, and marked the inception of its nascent institutions within, a continent which, in the course of the last two thousand years, has exercised on the destiny of the human race a pervasive influence unequalled by that of any other continent of the globe. </p>

<p> I feel impelled, on this historic occasion, when the members of the American, the British, the German and the newly formed Italo-Swiss National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as representatives of the Bahá’ís of the United Kingdom, of Eire, of Germany, of Austria, of the Scandinavian and Benelux countries, of the Iberian Peninsula, of Italy, of Switzerland, of France, and of Finland are assembled, to pay a warm tribute to the valiant labours of the early British and French Bahá’í pioneers, who at the very dawn of the Faith in Europe, strove with such diligence, consecration and resolution, to fan into flame that holy Fire which the hand of the appointed Center of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant had kindled in the north-west extremity of that continent on the morrow of His Father’s ascension. I recall the slow eastward spread of that infant Light which led to the gradual emergence of the German and Austrian Bahá’í Communities, during the darkest period of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s incarceration in the prison-fortress of ‘Akká. I am reminded of His subsequent epoch-making visit, soon after His providential release from His forty year confinement in the Most Great Prison, to these newly-fledged struggling Communities, of His patient seed-sowing destined to yield at a later age its first fruits, and constituting a landmark of the utmost significance in the rise and establishment of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in that continent. </p>

<p> I, moreover, call to mind, on this occasion, the successive episodes which, on the morrow of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension, in the course of the initial Epoch of the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation, signalized the emergence of those administrative institutions, both local and national, which proclaimed the germination of those potent seeds which had lain dormant for more than a decade in these newly-opened European territories, and which culminated in the construction of the framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh and the erection of the first two pillars destined to sustain in that continent the weight of the final unit of that Order. </p>

<p> Nor can I fail to acclaim, as a further milestone in the irresistible evolution of that Faith, the launching, following the creation of the administrative agencies designed to provide the effectual instruments for its propagation, of the Six Year Plan of the British Bahá’í Community followed successively by the European Teaching Campaign, inaugurated in accordance with the provisions of the second Seven-Year Plan of the American Bahá’í Community, the Five-Year Plan conceived by the German and Austrian Bahá’í Communities and the Two-Year Plan later initiated by the British Bahá’í Community — Plans which, within less than a decade, succeeded in laying the structural basis of the Administrative Order of the Faith in Wales, in Scotland, in Northern Ireland and in Eire, in multiplying and consolidating Bahá’í institutions throughout the British Isles, in broadening and strengthening the foundations of that same Order in Germany and Austria, in erecting the National Administrative Headquarters of the Faith in the city of Frankfurt, in establishing Spiritual Assemblies in the capital cities of no less than ten sovereign states in Europe, in reenforcing the administrative foundations of that Faith in those territories, in providing the means for the convocation of five European, and a series of regional, Teaching Conferences, and above all, in the convocation of the historic Convention in Florence culminating in the emergence of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Italy and Switzerland, the third in a series of institutions destined to play their part in the eventual establishment of the Supreme Legislative Body of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> The hour is now ripe for these Communities whether new or old, local or national, already functioning on the Northern, the Western and the Southern fringes of that continent, as well as those situated in its very heart, to initiate befittingly and prosecute energetically the European Campaign of a global Crusade which will not only contribute, to an unprecedented degree, to the broadening and the consolidation of the foundations of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh on the continent of Europe, but will also diffuse its light over the neighboring islands, and will, God willing, carry its radiance to the Eastern territories of that continent, and beyond them as far as the heart of Asia. </p>

<p> The privileged prosecutors of so revolutionizing, so gigantic, so sacred and beneficent a campaign, are, on the morrow of its launching, and, at such a crucial hour in the destinies of the European continent, summoned to undertake: First, the formation, under the aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States, of one National Spiritual Assembly in each one of the Scandinavian and Benelux Countries, and those of the Iberian Peninsula, and one in Finland, as well as the establishment, in collaboration with the Paris Spiritual Assembly, of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of France, the establishment, under the aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Germany and Austria, of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Austria, and the establishment, under the aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States, and in association with the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Italy and Switzerland, of independent National Spiritual Assemblies in Italy and Switzerland. Second, the construction of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of Europe in the city of Frankfurt, the heart of Germany, which occupies such a central position in the continent of Europe. Third, the purchase of land for the future construction of two Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kárs, one in the North in the city of Stockholm, and one in the South in the city of Rome, the seat and stronghold of the most powerful church in Christendom. Fourth, the opening of the following thirty virgin territories and islands: Albania, Crete, Estonia, Finno-Karelia, Frisian Islands, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldavia, Rumania, White Russia, assigned to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Germany and Austria; Channel Islands, Cyprus, Faroe Islands, Hebrides Islands, Malta, Orkney Islands. Shetland Islands, assigned to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the British Isles; Andorra, Azores, Balearic Islands, Lofoten Islands, Spitzbergen, Ukraine, assigned to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States of America; Liechtenstein, Monaco, Rhodes, San Marino, Sardinia, Sicily, assigned to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Italy and Switzerland. Fifth, the translation and publication of Bahá’í literature in the following ten languages to be undertaken by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States of America, through its European Teaching Committee: Basque, Estonian, Flemish. Lapp, Maltese, Piedmontese, Romani, Romansch, Yiddish, Ziryen. Sixth, the consolidation of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Holland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, allocated to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States of America; of Austria, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Russian S.F.S., Yugoslavia, allocated to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Germany and Austria; of Eire allocated to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the British Isles; of Iceland allocated to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Canada; and of Corsica allocated to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Italy and Switzerland. Seventh, the incorporation of the thirteen above-mentioned National Spiritual Assemblies. Eighth, the establishment by these same National Spiritual Assemblies of national Bahá’í endowments. Ninth, the establishment of a national Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds in the capital city of each of the countries where National Spiritual Assemblies are to be established, as well as one in London and one in Paris. Tenth, the formation of a National Bahá’í Publishing Trust in Frankfurt, Germany. Eleventh, the formation of Israel Branches of the National Spiritual Assemblies of the Bahá’ís of the British Isles and of Germany and Austria, authorized to hold, on behalf of their parent institutions, property dedicated to the holy Shrines at the World Centre of the Faith in the State of Israel. Twelfth, the conversion to the Faith of representatives of the Basque and Gypsy races. Thirteenth, the appointmnet, during Riḍván 1954, by the Hands of the Cause in Europe, of an auxiliary Board of nine members who will, in conjunction with the four National Spiritual Assemblies participating in the European campaign, assist, through periodic and systematic visits to Bahá’í centres, in the efficient and prompt execution of the Plans formulated for the prosecution of the teaching campaign in the European continent. </p>

<p> A continent, occupying such a central and strategic position on the entire planet; so rich and eventful in its history, so diversified in its culture; from whose soil sprang both the Hellenic and Roman civilizations; the mainspring of a civilization to some of whose features Bahá’u’lláh Himself paid tribute; on whose southern shores Christendom first established its home; along whose eastern marches the mighty forces of the Cross and the Crescent so frequently clashed; on whose southwestern extremity a fast evolving Islámic culture yielded its fairest fruit; in whose heart the light of the Reformation shone so brightly, shedding its rays as far as the outlying regions of the globe; the well-spring of American culture; whose northern and western fringes were first warmed and illuminated, less than a century ago, by the dawning light of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh; in whose heart a Community, so rich in promise, was subsequently established; whose soil was later sanctified by the twice — repeated visit of the appointed Center of His Covenant; which witnessed, in consequence of the rise and establishment of the Administrative Order of His Faith, the erection of two of the foremost pillars of the future Universal House of Justice; which, in recent years, sustained the dynamic impact of a series of national Plans preparatory to the launching of a world spiritual crusade-such a continent has at last at this critical hour-this great turning-point in its fortunes — entered upon what may well be regarded as the opening phase of a great spiritual revival that bids fair to eclipse any period in its spiritual history. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the elected representatives of the National Bahá’í Communities entrusted with the conduct of this momentous undertaking launched on the soil of this continent, aided by the Hands of the Cause and their auxiliary Board, reinforced by the local communities, the groups and isolated believers sharing in this massive and collective enterprise, and supported by the subsidiary agencies to be appointed for its efficient prosecution, be graciously assisted by the Lord of Hosts to contribute, in the years immediately ahead, through their concerted efforts and collective achievements, in both the teaching and administrative spheres of Bahá’í activity, to the success of this glorious Crusade, and lend a tremendous impetus to the conversion, the reconciliation and the ultimate unification of the divers and conflicting peoples, races, and classes dwelling within the borders of a travailing, a sorely-agitated, and spiritually-famished continent. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May all the privileged participators, enlisting under the banner of Bahá’u’lláh for the promotion of so preeminent and meritorious a Cause, be they from the Eastern or Western Hemisphere, of either sex, white or coloured, young or old, neophyte or veteran, whether serving in their capacity as expounders of the teachings, or administrators, of His Faith, as settlers or itinerant teachers, distinguish themselves by such deeds of heroism as will rival, nay outshine, the feats accomplished nineteen hundred years ago, by that little band of God-intoxicated disciples who, fearlessly preaching the Gospel of a newly-arisen Messiah, contributed so decisively to the illumination, the regeneration and the advancement of the entire European continent. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1416'> 1953-10-07 Message To The New Delhi Intercontinental Conference </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #273 November 1953 p5-8 </p>

<p> To the Hands of the Cause, the members of the National Spiritual Assemblies, the pioneers, the resident believers and visitors attending the Asian Intercontinental Teaching Conference in New Delhi. India. </p>

<p> Well-beloved friends: </p>

<p> With high hopes and a joyful heart I acclaim the convocation, in the leading city of the Indian sub-continent, of the fourth and last of the Intercontinental Teaching Conferences of a memorable Holy Year commemorating the centenary of the birth of the prophetic Mission of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> On this historic occasion, when the members of the National Spiritual Assemblies of the Bahá’ís of the United States of America, of the Dominion of Canada, of Central and South America, of Persia, of the Indian sub-continent and of Burma, of ‘Iráq and of Australasia, as well as representatives of the sovereign states and dependencies of the Asiatic continent, of the Republics of North, Central and South America, and of Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania are assembled, and are to deliberate on the needs and requirements of the recently launched triple Campaign embracing the Asiatic mainland, the Australian continent and the islands of the Pacific Ocean —a campaign which may well be regarded as the most extensive, the most arduous and the most momentous of all the campaigns of a world-girdling Crusade, and which, in its scope, is unparalleled in the history of the Faith in the entire Eastern Hemisphere-my thoughts, on such an occasion, go back to the early dawn of our Faith, to those unforgettable scenes of matchless heroism. of dark tragedy, of imperishable glory which heralded its birth, and accompanied the spread, of its infant Light in the heart of the Asiatic continent. </p>

<p> I vividly recall the meteoric rise of the Faith of the Báb in the provinces of Persia and the stirring episodes associated with His cruel incarceration in the mountain-fastnesses of A<u>dh</u>irbáyján. with the revelation of the laws of His Dispensation. with the proclamation of the independence of His Faith, with the peerless heroism of His disciples, with the fiendish cruelly of His foes —the Chief Magistrate, the civil authorises. the ecclesiastical dignitaries and the masses of the people, of His native land-with the humiliation. the spoliation, the dispersal, the eventual massacre of a vast number of His followers, and, above all, with His own execution in the City of Tabriz. </p>

<p> With a throb of wonder I call to mind the early and sudden fruition of His Dispensation in the capital city of that land, and the dramatic circumstances attending the birth of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation culminating in His precipitate banishment to ‘Iráq. </p>

<p> I am reminded, moreover, of the initial spread of the light of this Revelation, in consequence of the banishment of Bahá’u’lláh, to the adjoining territories of ‘Iráq, and, as far as the western fringes of that continent, to Turkey and the neighboring territories of Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, and. at a later stage to the Indian sub-continent and China, situated on the southern and eastern extremities of that continent as well as to the Caucasus and Russian Turkistán. </p>

<p> Nor can I fail to remember the series of alternating crises and victories each constituting a landmark in the evolution of the Faith-which it has experienced in some of these territories, associated with the distressful withdrawal of its Author to the mountains of Sulaymáníyyih: with the glorious Declaration of His Mission in Ba<u>gh</u>dád: with His second and third banishments to Constantinople and Adrianople: with the grievous rebellion of His half — brother; with the proclamation of His own Mission; with His fourth banishment to the desolate and far — off penal colony of ‘Akká in Syria: with the revelation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, His Most Holy Book; with His ascension in the Holy Land: with the establishment of His Covenant and the inauguration of the Ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, His son and the Exemplar and authorized Interpreter of His teachings. </p>

<p> These opening stages in the evolution of His Faith in the Asiatic continent were followed, while the frst and Apostolic Age of His Dispensation was drawing to a close, by the opening of the Islands situated in the Pacific Ocean, Japan in the north, and the Australian continent in the South. To these memorable chapters of Asian Bahá’í history another was soon added, on the morrow of the ascension of the Center of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, and during the initial epoch of the Formative Age of the Faith, distinguished by the rise of the Administrative Order and the erection of its pillars in the cradle of that Faith, in ‘Iráq. in India. Pákistán and Burma and in the Antipodes. This memorable episode in its development in that vast continent was succeeded by the initiation, during the second epoch of that same Age, of a series of Plans in those same territories in support of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan and as a prelude to the opening of the recently launched world-embracing Spiritual Crusade. </p>

<p> The hour has now struck for this continent, on whose soil, more than a century ago, so much sacred blood was shed, in whose very heart deeds of such tragic heroism were performed, and in many of whose territories such brilliant victories have been won, to contribute, in association with its sister continents, to the progress and ultimate triumph of this global Crusade, in a manner befitting its unrivalled position in the entire Bahá’í world. </p>

<p> The various Bahá’í Communities dwelling within the borders of this continent and those situated to the south of its shores in the Antipodes, which include the oldest and most venerable among all the communities cf the Bahá’í world, and whose members in their aggregate constitute the overwhelming majority of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh, are called upon, in close association with four other Bahá’í communities in the Western Hemisphere, to undertake in the course of the coming decade: First, the construction of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár in Bahá’u’lláh’s native land, in the City of Ṭihrán, surnamed by Bahá’u’lláh “Mother of the World.” Second, the purchase of land for the future construction of three Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kárs, one in the City of Ba<u>gh</u>dád. enshrining the “Most Great House.” the third holiest city of the Bahá’í world, one in New Delhi, the leading city of the Indian sub-continent, and the third in Sydney, the oldest and foremost Bahá’í Center in the Antipodes.

Twelfth, the formation of Israel branches of the National Spiritual Assemblies of the Bahá’ís of Persia, of ‘Iráq, and of Australia; authorized to hold on behalf of their parent institutions property dedicated to the holy Shrines at the World Center of the Faith in the State of Israel. Thirteenth, the appointment, during Riḍván 1954, by the Hands of the Cause in Asia and in Australia of an auxiliary Board of nine members who will, in conjunction with the eight National Spiritual Assemblies participating in the Asiatic and Australian campaigns. assist, through periodic and systematic visits to Bahá’í centers, in the efficient and prompt execution of the Plans formulated for the prosecution of the teaching campaigns in the continent of Asia and in the Antipodes. </p>

<p> The Asiatic continent, the cradle of the principal religions of mankind: the home of so many of the oldest and mightiest civilizations which have flourished on this planet; the crossways of so many kindreds and races: the battleground of so many peoples and nations; above whose horizons, in modern times, the suns of two independent Revelations-the promise and consummation of a six thousand year old religious Cycle — have successively arisen; where the Authors of both of these Revelations suffered banishment and died; within whose confines the Center of a divinely-appointed Covenant was born, endured a forty-year incarceration and passed away: on whose Western extremity the Qiblih of the Bahá’í world has been definitely established; in whose heart the city proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh as the “Mother of the World” is enshrined; within whose borders another City regarded as the “Cynosure of an adoring world” and the scene of the greatest and most glorious Revelation the world has witnessed is embosomed: on whose soil so many saints, heroes and martyrs, associated with both of these Revelations, have lived, struggled and died-such a continent, so privileged among its sister continents and yet so long and so sadly tormented, now stands at the hour of the launching of a world-encompassing Crusade, on the threshold of an era that may well recall in its glory and ultimate repercussions, the great periods of spiritual revival which, from the dawn of recorded history have, at various stages in the revelation of God’s purpose for mankind, illuminated the path of the human race. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May this Crusade, launched simultaneously on the Asiatic mainland, its neighboring islands and the Antipodes, under the direction of eight National Spiritual Assemblies, and through the operation of eight systematic Teaching Plans, and the concerted efforts of Bahá’í communities in both the East and the West, provide, as it unfolds, an effective antidote to the baneful forces of atheism, nationalism, secularism and materialism that are tearing at the vitals of this turbulent continent, and may it re-enact those scenes of spiritual heroism which, more than any of the secular revolutions which have agitated its face, have left their everlasting imprint on the fortunes of the peoples and nations dwelling within its borders. </p>

<p> Dear Baháï Sister:122 Your letter of October 15th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you bn his behalf. </p>

<p> The Guardian was indeed delighted to learn that, although you are still so young in the Faith, you have arisen and gone forth as a pioneer to Dutch New Guinea. He will pray that you may be guided and assisted to find and confirm ready souls, so that in a short time a nucleus of active and devoted Bahá’ís will be established in that virgin area. </p>

<p> The Guardian hopes that, in the near future, your future husband will decide to join the ranks of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh, and will lend his reinforcement to your teaching activities. </p>

<p> He urges you to persevere in your task and never to become disheartened, as this is a most meritorious work, and those who pioneer in virgin territories are receiving special bounties from God in this historic period. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í love, R. Rabbání </p>

<p> Assuring you of my loving prayers for your success and spiritual advancement. Your true brother, Shoghi </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #273 November 1953 p2-4 </p>

<p> (On the) occasion (of the) conclusion (of the) Holy Year (I am) overjoyed (to share the) following triple announcement (with the) attendants (at the) fourth (and) final Intercontinental Teaching Conference, marking (the) termination (of) festivities associated (with the) Centenary (of the) Birth (of) Bahá’u’lláh’s Prophetic Mission. </p>

<p> (The) five-vear-old, three-quarter million dollar enterprise, constituting (the) final stage (in the) initial epoch (of the) evolutionary process initiated over sixty years ago (by the) Founder (of the) Faith, (in the) heart (of the) Mountain (of) God. (is) consummated. (The) finishing touches (of the) installation (of) stained glass windows (in the) Drum (and) Octagon, (the) removal (of) scaffolding (from the) exterior (and) interior (of the) edifice, (the) interior calcimining (of the) Dome. Drum (and) Octagon, tuck-pointing, cleaning (and) floodlighting (the) entire Structure (have been) completed, synchronizing (with the) closing weeks (of the) glorious, twelve month annals (of the) Holy Faith. </p>

<p> (A) steadily swelling throng (of) visitors (from) far (and) near, (on) many days exceeding (a) thousand, (is) flocking (the) gates leading (to the) Inner Sanctuary (of this) majestic mausoleum: paying homage (to the) Queen of Carmel enthroned (on) God’s Mountain, crowned (in) glowing gold, robed (in) shimmering white, girdled (in) emerald green, enchanting every eye from air, sea, plain (and) hill. </p>

<p> (1 am) moved (to) request (the) attendants (at the) Conference (to) hold (a) befitting memorial gathering (to) pay tribute (to the) Hand (of the) Cause. Sutherland Maxwell, immortal architect (of the) Arcade (and) Superstructure (of the) Shrine. (I) feel, moreover, acknowledgement (should) be made (at the) same gathering (to the) unflagging labors (and) vigilance (of the) Hand (of the) Cause, Ugo Giachery, (in) negotiating contracts, inspecting (and) despatching all materials required (for the) construction (of the) Edifice, as well as (of the) assiduous, constant care (of the) Hand (of the) Cause, Leroy Ioas, (in) supervising (the) construction (of) both Drum (and) Dome. To two doors (of the) Shrine recently named after (the) first two aforementioned Hands, (the) Octagon Door, now added, (will) henceforth (be) associated (with the) third Hand who contributed (to the) raising (of this) stately, sacred Structure. </p>

<p> (The) second announcement (is that the) world-wide process (of the) settlement (of) virgin areas (of the) globe (has been) accelerated (by the) arrival (of the) following pioneers (at their) respective posts: Cora Oliver, British Honduras; Carole (and) Dwight Allen, Greece; Mr. (and) Mrs. Xavier Rodrigues. Portuguese Guinea; Brigitte Hasselblatt. Shetlands; Elizabeth Hopper, Ada Schott. Sara Kenny (and) Mrs. Duffield, Madeira: H. J. Snider. Key West; Hugh McKinley and mother, Cyprus; Max Kenyerezi, French Equatorial Africa; Elsa Grossmann, Frisian Islands; Helen Robinson, Baranof; Mr. (and) Mrs. Ted Anderson. Yukon; Tabendeh Payman, San Marino, swelling (the) Roll of Honor, raising (the) number (of) territories (within the) pale (of the) Faith (to one) hundred sixty-five. Two additional pioneers (are) proceeding (to) leper colonies (in) Puerto Rico (and) French Guiana. Two valiant pioneers (from) India (and) America (are) preparing entry (into) Tibet. Two more members (of the) United States National Assembly (have) volunteered (to) pioneer. raising (the) number (to) five. United States pioneers (are) departing (to) twenty-four virgin territories ere (the) conclusion (of the) Holy Year. (The) Feast (of) Names (was) celebrated last August (by) two stalwart Crusaders (at the) weather station (at) Buchanan Bay (on) desolate Ellesmere Island, latitude seventy-nine, less (than) seven hundred miles (from the) North Pole. (The) irresistibly unfolding Crusade (has been) sanctified (by the) death (of) heroic, eighty-eight year old Ella Bailey, elevating her (to the) rank (of the) Martyrs (of the) Faith, shedding further luster (on the) American Bahá’í Community (and) consecrating (the) soil (of the) fast awakening African Continent. </p>

<p> (The) third announcement (is that) preliminary steps (have been) taken, aiming (at the) acquisition (of an) extensive area (at the) head (of the) Holy Mountain, scene (of the) Revelation (of the) Tablet (of) Carmel, preparatory (to the) purchase (of the) site (for the) future Mother Mashriqu’1-Adhkár (of the) Holy Land, made possible (by the) munificent hundred thousand dollar donation (of the) Hand (of the) Cause. Amelia Collins, signalizing (the) opening (of the) second stage (in the) unfoldment (of the) mighty process set (in) motion (by the) Author (of the) Faith. </p>

<p> (This) triple bounty vouchsafed (the) Community (of the) Most Great Name, scattered (over the) face (of the) planet, calls for tremendous, immediate, concerted exertion (by the) assembled believers (in order) adequately (to) discharge (this) triple responsibility. First, redoubled consecration (to the) pioneering task, particularly (in the) Pacific area emphasized (in the) Tablets (of the) Divine Plan, raising thereby, ere adjournment (of the) Conference, (the) number (of) territories opened (to the) Faith or assigned pioneers (for) immediate settlement (to) above two hundred. Second, (the) demonstration (of) increasing self-sacrifice through (the) inauguration (of) Funds (for the) purchase (of) land (for) future Temples (on the) Asiatic continent (and the) Antipodes, (in) Ba<u>gh</u>dád, New Delhi (and) Sydney. (I am) contributing three thousand pounds (for the) furtherance (of these) meritorious enterprises. Third, earnest consultation (by) representatives (of the) Persian (and) ‘Iráqí National Assemblies, directly concerned (with the) Holy Task with (the) assembled Hands (of the) Cause (on) ways (and) means (to) conduct (a) thorough investigation (to) ensure purchase (of the) Holy Places, particularly (the) site (of the) Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál, (the) Cradle (of the) Revelation (to the) Author (of the) Faith, as well as (the) identification (and) transfer (to) Bahá’í cemeteries (of the bodies of the) relatives (of the) Báb (and) Bahá’u’lláh. constituting vital objectives (of the) Ten Year Plan. </p>

<p> (I am) ardently hoping, fervently supplicating (that this) epochal Conference, setting (the) seal (on the) celebration (of the) Second Bahá’í Jubilee, (may) contribute (in an) unprecedented degree through (the) character (of) its deliberations, (the) solidity (of its) achievements, (the) scope (of its) accomplishments (to the) ultimate attainment (of the) shining goals (of the) World Crusade. destined (to) culminate (in the) not far distant Most Great Jubilee associated (with the) hundredth Anniversary (of the) Assumption (by) Bahá’u’lláh (of) His Prophetic Office. </p>

<h2 class='section'> 1425 </h2>
<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1425'> 1954-04-22 on behalf of To an individual re not rely on others categorical assertions </h3>

<p> You speak of the categorical affirmations of Rudolph Steiner in his book regarding certain things commencing with Christ, and that He was the reincarnation of Zoroaster. </p>

<p> We as Bahá’ís are not influenced by the categorical assertions of scholars. We believe that what Bahá’u’lláh has revealed and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written is from God, and divinely inspired; that Bahá’u’lláh is a Manifestation of God, and has access to a knowledge denied to ordinary human beings. </p>

<p> Therefore, he does not see why, in reading these modern philosophical treatises, you should be perturbed in spirit. </p>

<p> Everybody is entitled to their own opinion. If they do not set it forth with conviction, they are failing in their duty to expose their ideas sincerely and graphically; but because they believe something firmly themselves, does not in any way imply that what they believe is the truth. Between the truth which comes from God through His Prophets, and the glimmerings, often misunderstood and misinterpreted, of truth, which comes from the philosophers and thinkers, there is an immense difference. We must never, under any circumstances, confuse the two. </p>

<p> Bahá’u’lláh has said that learning can be the veil between the soul of man and the eternal truth; in other words, between man and the knowledge of God. We have seen that many people who become very advanced in the study of modern physical sciences are led to deny God, and to deny His Prophets. That does not mean that God and the Prophets have not and do not exist. It only means that knowledge has become a veil between their hearts and the light of God. </p>

<p> You ask why the Manifestation of God for this day, in other words, Bahá’u’lláh, has not given all the detailed answers to the theories advanced by occultists, spiritualists and many of the more abstruse philosophers of the present day. </p>

<p> It would be absolutely impossible for anyone to answer all the questions that might be asked by the curious, whether scholars or ordinary people, on any subject. If the Prophet of God only came to this world in order to answer people’s questions, and elucidate all the “nonsense”, for the most part, that people have gotten together and formed into cults and philosophies, They would have no time to instruct man by Their example and through Their Teachings in a new way of life. </p>

<p> We must turn aside from these vain imaginings and suppositions and philosophizings of the world, and fix our eyes upon the clear stream of the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. Out of these teachings, and the society which they will create on this planet, will come a solution to all of the problems of men. Gradually, greater scholars, more deeply spiritual thinkers, will be able to answer from a Bahá’í standpoint many of these questions. It is not necessary that they should be in the divine text; they can be studied and learned in the future; but at present we have not had time to evolve the Bahá’í scholars who can deal with these subjects in detail, and take upon themselves to answer the abstruse points and the many unfounded doctrines which are advanced by modern philosophers. </p>

<p> The Guardian urges you to turn your mind away from these abstrusities, and devote yourself, not only to studying the books at hand in the French language, of our Faith, but also to teaching other people. </p>

<p> It is very unlikely that you will be able to successfully argue with, or to convert, any of the people who study these topics you have mentioned in your letter. They are more interested in mystical things, and in mystery itself, than in this present world in which we live, and how to solve its problems. They enjoy abstractions and complications. Minds such as these are not going to be able to accept the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, which is for here and now, and which involves the purification of the mind, and an application of His teachings to daily life. </p>

<p> He therefore urges you to set aside all of these thoughts from your mind, to turn with a loving and prayerful heart to Bahá’u’lláh, and ask Him to guide you daily to souls that are receptive to, and ready to receive, His Message, and not harass yourself any more with these idle questions, which in the first place, cannot be answered, and in the second place, for the most part do not require an answer, because they are not sufficiently important in themselves. </p>

<p> What Bahá’u’lláh means by the faculty of sight and hearing is the physical faculty, not a spiritual abstraction. He means that we have been given eyes and ears to appreciate what goes on in this world, by Almighty God; in other words, we can read the Teachings and listen to the Message of the Prophet. This is to be taken literally. </p>

<p> We know from His Teachings that Reincarnation does not exist. We come on to this planet once only. Our life here is like the baby in the womb of its mother, which develops in that state what is necessary for its entire life after it is born. The same is true of us. Spiritually we must develop here what we will require for the life after death. In that future life, God through His mercy, can help us to evolve characteristics which we neglected to develop while we were on this earthly plane. It is not necessary for us to come back and be born into another body in order to advance spiritually and grow closer to God. </p>

<p> This is the Bahá’í Teaching, and this is what the followers of Bahá’u’lláh must accept, regardless of what experiences other people may feel they have. You yourself must surely know that modern psychology has taught that the capacity of the human mind for believing what it imagines, is almost infinite. Because people think they have a certain type of experience, think they remember something of a previous life, does not mean they actually had the experience, or existed previously. The power of their mind would be quite sufficient to make them believe firmly such a thing had happened. </p>

<p> We must use the Writings of the Prophets as our measurement. If Bahá’u’lláh had attached the slightest importance to occult experiences, to the seeing of auras, to the hearing of mystic voices; if He had believed that reincarnation was a fact, He, Himself, would have mentioned all of these things in His Teachings. The fact that He passed over them in silence shows that to Him, they had either no importance or no reality, and were consequently not worthy to take up His time as the Divine Educator of the human race. </p>

<p> We must turn our faces away from these things, and toward the actual practice of His Teachings in our every-day life throughout Bahá’í Administration, and in our contact with other people and the examples we give. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #280 June 1954 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Friends: </p>

<p> The resounding victories won during the first year of the Ten Year Crusade have brought great happiness to the beloved Guardian. Ninety-nine of the virgin areas have been settled, and it is hoped all areas outside of the Iron Curtain countries will be settled by the end of the Riḍván period. </p>

<p> The continent of Africa is pre-eminent in its record of achievement. The spread of the Faith has been miraculous there. Since the opening of the Crusade, fifty territories and islands have been opened. Bahá’ís are now living in one hundred 2nd sixty cities of the country. There are over sixty tribes represented in the Bahá’í population. Literature has been translated into over twenty-five languages. </p>

<p> Uganda is the area producing the most remarkable results. Two years ago there were no Bahá’ís in that territory-today the Faith is established in over sixty cities ;-there are thirteen Spiritual Assemblies. Over ten more Spiritual Assemblies will be added April 21, 1954; over six hundred new African Bahá’ís have enrolled. </p>

<p> The beloved Guardian directs that we ponder deeply the great victories won in Uganda, and the reasons why they were achieved. We should analyze why similar victories have not been won everywhere in the Bahá’í world, particularly in North America, the land of the chosen trustees of the Master’s Divine Plan. </p>

<p> Completely dedicated to their sacred mission, consecrated to the great service they had undertaken. their lives and conduct in accordance with the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, the original pioneers to Uganda arose with prayerful zeal to carry the Glad Tidings of the Kingdom to the native inhabitants. They demonstrated that the Bahá’í has no prejudice of any type. Through their loving association on the basis of equality, they soon won the hearts and souls of the people. </p>

<p> So effective has been their teaching, that the new African Bahá’ís have arisen in numbers to carry the Message throughout the land, not only Uganda, but other consolidation territories and, more important, in virgin areas of the Crusade. Over six of the virgin areas of the Crusade have been filled by the new African Bahá’ís. </p>

<p> The peoples generally are seeking the light of Divine Guidance. The problems of the world have awakened the populace. It only remains for the Bahá’ís to raise the Call and give the Message according to the high standards enunciated by the beloved Master. The world can become a.live with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, if the Bahá’ís fulfill their sacred obligations. </p>

<p> In pioneering fields, and on the home front, the friends must arise with the same spirit of dedication and consecration which animated the original pioneers. If they do. they will be astonished at the great results they will achieve. The Guardian calls expectantly to the believers of America, the favored friends of the Master, to arise now, and gain such victories in the Teaching Field, both at home and abroad, as to astonish the Bahá’í world, even surpassing the victories of Africa. He particularly awaits the response of the dedicated souls, white and colored, who will raise the Call among the Negroes of America. </p>

<p> Setting aside all the shibboleths of present day living, leaving behind the false standards of those endeavoring to solve the world’s problems by weak platitudes, and demonstrating the new Bahá’í way of dynamic spiritual living, let them, relying on the guidance of the Holy Spirit, arise to spread the Water of Life over America. This will produce the results which the cries of humanity today require. Where are the spiritual souls who will now seize their opportunity, and achieve immortal glory in the service of the Faith! </p>

<p> Tending the Garden: A Biography of Emeric and Rosemary Sala, p101 </p>

<p> Haifa, Israel, </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May 5,1954 </p>

<p> Mr. and Mrs. Emeric Sala </p>

<p> Dear Bahál Friends: </p>

<p> Your letters, one from Mrs. Sala, dated February 20th, and two from Mr. Sala, dated March 25th and April 15th, have been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> He fully realizes how deep your disappointment has been that you are not able to secure your visa for the Comoro Islands. He himself was deeply disappointed also. However, some of these places are extremely difficult to enter; and he hopes that where you have failed, at least for the time being, someone else will prove successful at a later date. </p>

<p> He urges you, upon your arrival in Zululand, to find out the status of the Cause in neighbouring places, and, if it is possible for you to settle in one of the neighbouring countries where the Center is much weaker, and where it is more difficult for people to get established, and there is a better possibility for people like yourselves to build up a business and remain, that you by all means go to the weaker Center, in preference to Zululand, which now has a certain number of pioneers. </p>

<p> He assures you that the example that you and the Robarts have shown has moved him very deeply, and he hopes it will stir the Canadian Community, and impress upon them the advisability of answering the pioneer call now, while the field is open, and the opportunities and the rewards so glorious. </p>

<p> You are often remembered in his prayers in the holy Shrines, and he is supplicating that you may be richly blessed, and meet with success in both your teaching efforts and in your personal affairs. </p>

<p> With warmest Bahá’í love, </p>

<p> R.Rabbání </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the Beloved bless your constant endeavours, remove all obstacles from your path, and enable you to enrich the record of your meritorious services to His Faith. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #282 August 1954 p1 </p>

<p> As the Guardian cabled the entire Bahá’í world at the time of the Conventions, he hopes that the dynamic spirit which was generated during the first year of the Plan will be augmented during the second year of the Plan, and all the Bahá’ís arise everywhere with renewed effort in order to spread the Glad-Tidings. This year must mark a very substantial increase in the number of Bahá’ís throughout the world — on the homefronts, in the consolidation areas, and in the virgin areas. Particular attention should be paid to the home fronts and the consolidation areas. As the Guardian indicates, he is expecting “ an upsurge of activity which, in its range and intensity, will excel the exploits which have so greatly enlarged the limits, and noised abroad the fame, of the Cause of God.” </p>

<p> The Guardian urges that all the Bahá’ís center their complete attention on the obligations of the Ten Year Crusade. He feels that no new activities should be undertaken of any type, whether of a local or a national nature. The friends must concentrate on the goals of the Ten Year Crusade, which are principally national and universal. For instance, no loeal l:fa~iratu ‘ l-Quds should be considered during the Ten Year Crusade, no projects on a national scale should be considered which do not definitely relate themselves to the prosecution of the Ten Year Crusade. Funds should not be used for any purpose except the objects of the Ten Year Crusade. </p>

<p> We are embarked upon the greatest spiritual drama the world has ever witnessed and it is going to require the sacrifice of every individual, every community and every Assembly, whether local or national, in order to reach the goals. The Guardian feels they can be reached if we will concentrate, and not allow our attention to be diverted for a moment for any purpose whatsoever. </p>

<p> He was very happy indeed to see that you have been united, and that you are going to be able to establish a permanent residence in New Guinea, and teach the Faith there. He attaches the greatest possible importance to your presence in that virgin country; and he urges you under no circumstances to abandon your post, but to perservere, and with tact and patience gradually build up contacts with the local people, so that you can seek out those souls who are waiting to hear the Message of Bahá’u’lláh, and will prove the most receptive. </p>

<p> The most important thing for the pioneers to do in these countries into which it is difficult to gain entry, is to be very careful not to antagonize the officials, the missionaries or the local people, as this might cause them to be deprived of their possibilities of gaining a livelihood, or to be driven out of the country and to have their visa suspended. </p>

<p> To remain, to keep the beacon burning, to teach the Faith discreetly and to establish a foundation, is the work of every single in the Ten Year Crusade. </p>

<p> Looking back in Wonder, Philip Hainsworth, p187-8 </p>

<p> Dear Bahá’í Friends, </p>

<p> Your letters of June 15, October 15 and November 25 1953, with enclosures, have been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> He is also, in order to save himself the extra effort of yet another letter, replying to the personal one from Mr Hainsworth, dated January 28 1954. As he has answered him through a letter written by me, and has also cabled him, I will not go into detail in this letter. The Guardian hopes that, at a future date, it will be possible for him to make the pilgrimage. During the coming months it is out of the question. </p>

<p> The news which your Committee has conveyed to him has greatly rejoiced his heart. Indeed he feels that, of all the countries in the Bahá’í World, Uganda has made the most progress since the inception of the Faith there a few years back and indeed during this year. He is immensely proud of the achievements of both the pioneers there and the African converts to the Faith. They have set a very high standard, and shown forth most exemplary devotion. The spirit of the African believers is very touching, very noble, and indeed presents a challenge to their fellow Bahá’ís all over the world. It seems that God has endowed these races, living in the so — called ‘dark’ continent, with great spiritual faculties, and also with mental faculties which, as they mature in the Faith, will contribute immensely to the whole, throughout the Bahá’í World. </p>

<p> The power of Bahá’u’lláh is being witnessed during the opening years of the Ten-Year Crusade, we might almost say, as never before. Certainly in the teaching field, there has been the most extraordinary leap forward — in one year, one hundred countries! </p>

<p> He will remember all of you also in his prayers in the Holy Shrines, and he compliments you on the wonderful work which you have done during the past year. All the BaháTs, including the Guardian himself, are very proud of Uganda. </p>

<p> Assuring you of my personal prayers for the success of every of every effort you exert for the promotion of our beloved Faith, and the realisation of every hope you cherish in the service. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #282 August 1954 p2 </p>

<p> He (the Guardian) thinks the less time spent on such topics as “ Current Events in the light of the Bahá’í Faith” and “The Bahá’í Faith and Modern Science” the better. There is no harm in having an evening lecture by a qualified speaker once on each of these subjects, but he certainly does not feel that much time should be spent on them, for the very simple reason that there is so little that can be said on the subject. The Bahá’ís are not scientists, and cannot very well go into details of the relation of the Bahá’í Faith to Modern Science; and “ Current Events in the Light of the Bahá’í Faith” is also a topic which can be dealt with briefly. </p>

<p> He feels that the most important thing for the Bahá’í Schools all over the world at present to do is to strongly impress upon the Bahá’í attendants the urgency of arising not only to fulfill pioneer goals and to consolidate the work on the home front, which is getting weaker every year instead of stronger, but also to bring home to the friends the necessity of dispersing. </p>

<p> He is quite serious in stating that he believes that even in the large cities, such as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Baltimore, etc., the Cause would not suffer if the membership were reduced to fifteen. The Bahá’ is, who have been struggling for practically fifty years to attract people to the Faith in these immense cities, have been wholly unsuccessful, when one considers the slight numerical increase in the voting lists. He therefore feels that they had better go out and teach in towns and villages. They will be safer, in case war should break out, and they will be better off spiritually, away from these centers of intense materialism, where so much time is wasted on trivialities and non-essentials. </p>

<p> The Bahá’ís must realize that they belong to a world-wide Order, and not an American civilization. They must try and introduce the Bahá’í atmosphere of life and thought into their Summer Schools, rather than making the Summer School an episode and a pleasant vacation period, during which they learn a little more about the Faith. </p>

<p> For over thirty years, with an enlarged heart and many other ailments she remained at her post in Bulgaria. Never well-to-do, she often suffered actual poverty and want: want of heat, want of clothing, want of food, when her money failed to reach her because Bulgaria had come under the Soviet zone of influence. She was bombed, lost her possessions, she was evacuated, she lived in drafty, cold dormitories for many, many months in the country, she returned, valiant, to the capital of Bulgaria after the war and continued, on foot, to carry out her teaching work. </p>

<p> The Guardian himself urged her strongly, when the war first began to threaten to cut her off’ in Bulgaria, to go to Switzerland. She was a Canadian subject and ran great risks by remaining, not to mention the dangers and privations of war. However, she begged the Guardian not to insist and assured him her one desire was to remain with her spiritual children. This she did, up to the last breath of her glorious life. Her tomb will become a national shrine, immensely loved and revered, as the Faith rises in stature in that country. </p>

<p> He thinks that every Bahá’í and most particularly those who have left their homes and gone to serve in foreign fields, should know of, and turn their gaze to, Marion Jack. </p>

<p> Very active consideration is now being given to the erection of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár for Persia. The Guardian has asked the Persian Bahá’ís to submit plans for this noble edifice. They have provided him with some plans. </p>

<p> Owing to the great importance of this unique structure, the beloved Guardian feels submissions should be made by Bahá’í architects from many parts of the world; and he is therefore asking your Assemblies to inform the friends that he would value any suggestions or plans which any of the Bahá’ís may wish to submit for this sacred enterprise. Will you please let the friends know that the Guardian will appreciate any submissions anyone might wish to make. </p>

<p> In height, the building should be not more than 70 meters, although he feels perhaps a building £5 meters high is sufficient. The building should be wider than the Temple in Chicago, so as to accommodate more people. The interior plans should be so set up as to develop a spaciousness. </p>

<p> Of course, it is understood by that the building should be circular in shape, and nine-sided. The Guardian does not wish detailed blueprint drawings, but he would like a general drawing of the proposals which anyone wishes to submit. </p>

<p> When a person becomes a Bahá’í, actually what takes place is that the seed of the spirit starts to grow in the human soul. This seed must be watered by the outpourings of the Holy Spirit. These gifts of the spirit are received through prayer, meditation, study of the Holy Utterances and service to the Cause of God. The fact of the matter is that service in the Cause is like the plough which ploughs the physical soil when seeds are sown. It is necessary that the soil be ploughed up, so that it can be enriched, and thus cause a stronger growth of the seed. In exactly the same way the evolution of the spirit takes place through ploughing up the soil of the heart so that it is a constant reflection of the Holy Spirit. In this way the human spirit grows and develops by leaps and bounds. </p>

<p> He was very pleased to note that a Certificate of Excellence was awarded to the Publishing Committee. There is no doubt that we cannot make our publications too attractive, especially as they are being so much more widely circulated than before. He placed the Certificate in the mansion in Bahjí. </p>

<p> The Pioneer Record </p>

<p> The phenomenal progress which has been made throughout the Bahá’í world in settling the virgin countries during the first year of the Ten Year Crusade has been a source of great joy and comfort to the Guardian. Over-worked and often tired out as he is, the news of the arrival of pioneers in over one hundred posts has, one might almost say, kept him going. He is very proud of their achievements — the American pioneers and all their co-workers who have arisen to answer this mighty call. However, this is only the beginning. The next step is to keep these virgin areas open and settled with at least one pioneer, and preferably, of course, two or three; and to get pioneers into the few remaining countries outside the Soviet zone of influence. </p>

<p> He thinks that, in spite of a few lapses from duty, so to speak, the record is remarkable, and that your Assembly and your Committees handling the pioneers in different continents have every reason to feel proud and gratified over your success. The pioneers themselves must realize that not only are they fulfilling the wishes of Bahá’u’lláh, and doing that which the Master Himself said He longed to do; namely, to go, if necessary on foot, and carry His Father’s Message to all the regions of the earth; but they are enhancing the prestige of the Faith to a remarkable degree in the eyes of the public, and especially in the eyes of officials. There is no doubt that the rapid forward march of the Faith recently has attracted a far greater measure of attention on the part of thoughtful people, and people of position in society and in educational fields, than has been the case for almost one hundred years. Therefore, each pioneer must feel his responsibility very heavily, and understand that his calling is far above the average service; and his duty to remain at his post a very pressing one indeed. </p>

<p> The Auxiliary Board </p>

<p> The Guardian feels sure that the Auxiliary Boards recently appointed by the Hands of the Cause will stimulate and help the teaching work, which of course includes pioneer work, and be a prop and mainstay to the often over-worked and overburdened National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as to the Hands of the Cause who are carrying, usually, heavy administrative loads in addition to their exalted position as Hands. </p>

<p> The general principle is that the National Spiritual Assembly to which a country has been allotted, is responsible for the progress of the Faith there, and the unfoldment of its administrative activities, regardless of whether the territory in question is the possession of a nation other than that which the National Assembly in question represents. </p>

<p> In other words, your Assembly might be carrying out teaching work in British, Portuguese, Spanish or French territories, and the British, Portuguese, Spanish or French Assemblies would have nothing to do with the matter. </p>

<p> Concern over the Home Front </p>

<p> He is very concerned over the work on the homefront. The American Bahá’ís have, with devotion, enthusiasm and confidence, gone out to answer the pioneer call all over the world, but he does not feel that they have made an adequate response to the needs of the work in the United States. </p>

<p> He has been told that some of the friends are disturbed over reports brought back by the pilgrims concerning the dangers facing America in the future whenever another world conflagration breaks out. </p>

<p> He does not feel that the Bahá’ís should waste time dwelling on the dark side of things. Any intelligent person can understand from the experiences of the last world war, and keeping abreast of what modern science has developed in the way of weapons for any future war, that big cities all over the world are going to be in tremendous danger. This is what the Guardian has said to the pilgrims. </p>

<p> Entirely aside from this, he has urged the Bahá’ís, for the sake of serving the Faith, to go out from these centers of intense materialism, where life nowadays is so hurried and grinding and, dispersing to towns and villages, carry the Message far and wide through the cities of the American Union. He strongly believes that the field outside the big cities is more fertile, that the Bahá’ís in the end will be happier for having made this move, and that, in case of an outbreak of war, it stands to reason they will be safer, just the way any other person living in the country, or away from the big industrial areas, is safer. </p>

<p> Pilgrim’s Notes </p>

<p> It is remarks such as these that the pilgrims have carried back in their notes. He sees no cause for alarm, but he certainly believes that the Bahá’ís should weigh these thoughts, and take action for the sake of spreading the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, and for their own ultimate happiness as well. Indeed the two things go together. </p>

<p> Increase in Local Assemblies </p>

<p> He hopes that during the present year there will be a great surge forward on the home front, that the number of Assemblies will be markedly multiplied, and that also there will be more incorporations of Spiritual Assemblies. The Ten Year Plan, if the friends will study it, comprises not only glamorous goals far afield, but extremely important ones near at hand. If these are not achieved, the Plan will have failed. </p>

<p> He knows from his past experience, </p>

<p> and his long association with the American Bahá’ís in the service of the Faith, that they are capable of arising and meeting the requirements of the hour, and he feels sure that, at this period in their Bahá’í history, they are going to demonstrate their sterling qualities just as they always have in the past. </p>

<p> Temple Dependency </p>

<p> As he has already informed your Assembly. he feels that the first Bahá’í institution to be built in the neighborhood of the Temple at Wilmette should be a Home for the Aged. There arc a number of reasons for this. First of all, it need not be a very expensive undertaking in the beginning. or require a tremendous outlay of capital. Second, he believes that it is now time for the Bahá’ís to show the people of the world that our aim of rendering service to humanity is a concrete thing, and not confined to words. Until now. the Bahá’ís have not been in any position to create philanthropic institutions, and they have often been criticized for this. He feels therefore that in a small way they can now begin. through the founding of this first institution in the neighborhood of the Temple. </p>

<p> Bahá’í Symbol on Tombstones </p>

<p> In regard to your question regarding the use of the Greatest Name on tombstones of Bahá’ís, the Guardian considers this too sacred to be placed in such a position in general use, and the friends should not use it on their tombstones. They can use quotations from the Teachings, if they wish to. but not the Greatest Name. Naturally, if anyone has already used it, it does not matter. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Marriage to a Non-Bahá’í </p>

<p> The general principle in regard to the marriage of a Bahá’í to a non-Bahá’í is as follows: If a Bahá’í marries a non-Bahá’í who wishes to have ........_ the religious ceremony of his own sect carried out, it must be quite clear that, first, the Bahá’í partner is understood to be a Bahá’í by religion, and not to accept the religion of the other party to the marriage through having his or her religious ceremony; and second, the ceremony must be of a nature which does not commit the Bahá’í to any declaration of faith in a religion other than his own. </p>

<p> Under these circumstances, the Bahá’í can partake of the religious ceremony of his non-Bahá’í partner. The Bahá’í should insist on having the Bahá’í ceremony carried out before or after the non-Bahá’í one, on the same day. </p>

The epoch-making travels of some of ‘Abdu’1-Bahá’s disciples, headed by the incomparable Martha Root, during the concluding years of the Heroic, and the opening decade of the Formative Age of the Faith, in response to the call raised by the Centre of the Covenant in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, may be regarded as the prelude to the formal and definite introduction of the Faith in that vast and prominent region. Hie preliminary years of wide-spread and strenuous seed sowing paved the way, on the morrow of the establishment of the framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith in the Western Hemisphere, for the launching of the First Seven Year Plan formulated by the American Bahá’í Community which culminated in the laying of the Administrative foundations of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the Republics of Central America and the Antilles. This initial stage in the rise and establishment of the embryonic World Order of Bahá’u’lláh in the heart of the Western Hemisphere was immediately followed by the initiation of yet another Plan which attained*its climax, on the morrow of the centenary of the Bib’s martyrdom, through the formation of the Central American Bahá’í National Spiritual Assembly, — an auspicious event that was befittingly celebrated in the course of the festivities commemorating the centenary of the birth of Bahá’u’lláh’s mission. This notable and unforgettable event in the annals of the Faith in the New World was destined to be succeeded by the launching of a small albeit carefully devised plan by the newly launched National Spiritual Assembly and which culminated in those same never to be forgotten festivities. The launching of this Plan was in itself a prelude to the initiation of a Ten — Year Plan, formulated to meet the immediate needs of the Central American Bahá’í Community, in conjunction with a Spiritual Crusade embarked upon by National Bahá’í Communities throughout the entire globe. </p>

<p> The opening phase of this Ten-Year Plan, which may be said to have inaugurated the Mission of this same community beyond its homeland has now drawn to a close, a year that has witnessed the opening, with a single exception, of all the virgin territories assigned, in accordance with that same Plan, to this community. </p>

<p> This great victory, in which the followers of the Faith in Central America have themselves played a notable part, and which has virtually set the seal of strength on the initial stage of this glorious crusade must, at this hour of the unfoldment of the second phase of this historic enterprise, prove in turn a forerunner of a period of unprecedented, rapid and systematic expansion and consolidation of the Faith in each of the Republics of Central America and the Antilles, </p>

<p> ‘Whilst every effort must be strenuously exerted to safeguard at any cost the prizes won in the six newly opened territories in the American and Asiatic Continents, attention must, in the course of the present year, be focused on the multiplication of Bahá’í Centers, and on the formation of local assemblies, in order to broaden the foundations on which future independent National Spiritual Assemblies must ultimately rest. A no less assiduous effort should be exerted to increase rapidly the number of the avowed supporters of the Faith, particularly among the Indians, whose spiritual potentialities ‘Abdu’1-Bahá repeatedly emphasized.... Simultaneously measures should be speedily undertaken to assist the United States National Assembly in expediting the translation and publication of Bahá’í literature in the Indian languages specifically mentioned in the provisions of the Ten-Year Plan. No effort should moreover be spared in assisting the South American National Spiritual Assembly in the all-important work of translating, printing and disseminating Bahá’í literature in both the Spanish and Portuguese languages. </p>

<p> Particular attention should likewise be devoted to the acceleration of the process of local Bahá’í incorporation, so vital to the further consolidation of the newly emerged administrative institutions of the Faith in Central America and the Antilles. </p>

<p> As the process of internal expansion and consolidation gains momentum, the elected national representatives of this community must not fail to consecrate themselves to the no less fundamental task of enriching continually the spiritual life of its members, of deepening their understanding of the essential verities, tenets and principles underlying their Faith, of demanding a strict adherence to its laws and statutes, and of setting an example to their fellow-believers through a fuller reflection, in their personal lives and conduct, of the ennobling truths animating the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May this community which, in the course of over a decade, has demonstrated so conspicuously its devotion to the ideals of the Faith it has risen to champion, furnish, as the years roll by, further proofs of its staunchness, its courage, its fidelity, its watchfulness, its singlemindedness and unswerving determination to fulfill its high destiny through the attainment of every single objective of the Plan to which it stands committed. </p>

<p> Divine Springtime — Louise Coswell Recalls, pp95-8 </p>

<p> He was extremely pleased that your Assembly was able to purchase the site for the Bahá’í Temple in Panama before the expiration of the first year of the Ten-Year Crusade. He advises your Assembly while safeguarding and maintaining the property, and living up to the terms of the contract which you signed, to spend as little money on the site as possible. Your resources are too limited, and the needs in the teaching field are too urgent, for money other than for the purpose of the purchase and bare maintenance of the property to be spent on the Temple site, at the 95 present time. The important thing was to buy it, and this has been satisfactorily accomplished. </p>

<p> He is very proud of the fact that Central America had filled all her pioneer goals with the exception of the Marshall Islands, to which Mrs. Steward is now en route.[1] </p>

<p> He has read with attention the consolidation plan prepared by the National Teaching Executive Committee, a copy of which you forwarded to him in your most recent letter; and, although he thinks that the general outline of activities is excellent, there are two points to which he would like to call your attention. </p>

<p> The first is that he has not decided that there will be definitely no Regional National Assemblies prior to the establishment of independent National Assemblies \for each Latin American country. As the work unfolds and the centers multiply, this matter will have to be carefully considered. At present it is premature to reach any conclusions, </p>

<p> He also believes that, before any abolition of the present basis of electing delegates to the National Convention, (in other words, the delegates represent Assemblies, and not Groups and isolated believers as well) is made, the Cause must grow much stronger in each of the Central American republics. </p>

<p> Perhaps your Assembly is not aware of the fact that with the exception of the United States and Persia, the two countries where the mass of the believers is the greatest in the Bahá’í world, all other National Assemblies are elected by delegates, who are elected in their turn by local Assemblies, and not by the body of the believers residing in any particular country. </p>

<p> He considers the introduction of the latter system premature in Lath America. You must first have many more active Groups and isolated centers, before there is any point in electing the national delegates for the Central American Convention by the method used in the United States at present. </p>

<p> This is one of the reasons why he is urging Bahá’ís everywhere to, above all, concentrate on increasing the number of Spiritual Assemblies and Groups, as well as isolated believers, educating them more deeply in the administrative and spiritual fundamentals and doctrines of the Faith, and increasing their awareness of their great responsibility as Bahá’ís in both the teaching and administrative work of the Faith. He always considers that the foundation is securely laid, there should be no attempt at elaborating the superstructure. </p>

<p> He hopes that the Auxiliary Board, working in conjunction with the Hands of the Cause, will be able to carry a new impetus to the teaching work, and, in collaboration with the National Assemblies, help to strengthen and revitalize weak centers. </p>

<p> Another matter to which he attaches the greatest importance is that of keeping the pioneers at their posts, and urging upon them the necessity of persevering at all costs, lest one of the so-hardly-won goals of the Ten-Year Crusade suffer even a momentary eclipse. </p>

<p> Your Assembly must feel very proud of the fact that a number of its members have gone into the pioneer field. The National Assembly must always show forth signs of true Spiritual leadership; and he is very happy that your Body is so active, so devoted and so united. </p>

<p> He hopes that, in the unfoldment of your work throughout the region, you will pay special attention to teaching the Indians and minority groups, and converting them to the Faith. He attaches the greatest importance to this work, and is always glad to receive news of the names of any new Indian tribes represented in the Cause of God, or contacted. </p>

<p> Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Central America from the Bahá’í World Center: </p>

<p> As regards your question about giving the Faith publicity, in the places that pioneers have moved to in order to fill the goals of the Plan; it depends on the place. If there is absolutely no danger of publicity stirritg up antagonism, or leading to the expulsion of the Bahá’í, or his being deprived of his residence visa, then there is no objection to publicity. The general principle, however, is this — that the Bahá’ís should keep as quiet as possible, seek out and confirm the receptive souls, and build their future Assemblies on a solid foundation. To broadcast the news of their activities is not essential in these virgin areas at the present time, and can in most cases be dangerous, and hinder the spread of the Faith. </p>

<p> Dear and Valued Co-Workers: </p>

<p> Hie year which has just^been concluded witnessed a succession of achievements on the part of the members of the Central American Bahá’í Communities and particularly of the elected body of their national representatives, worthy of the highest commendation. In both the teaching and administrative spheres of Bahá’í activity, these newly fledged communities have demonstrated their firm attachment to the Faith they have expounded, their loyalty to its fundamental verities and principles, and their inflexible resolve to extend the range, and reinforce the foundations of their collective and meritorious activities and achievements. </p>

<p> They are now, by the virtue of the splendid services they have performed, the spirit they have so powerfully evinced, the noble example they have set, approaching a stage in the evolution of the Faith in that highly promising area of the globe, which bids fair to eclipse the magnificent efforts which have been exerted, and the noteworthy services which have been performed, since its inception in the Antilles and the Central American Republics. They will soon be entering a period which is destined to witness the emergence of Regional National Assemblies which are to be regarded as stepping stones paving the way for the ultimate establishment of independent National Spiritual Assemblies, which are destined to act as pillars, and participate directly in the formation of the future International House of Justice, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh as the supreme Legislative Organ of His World Order. </p>

<p> Now is the time for those communities to prepare themselves, in the course of the two fast-fleeting years separating them from the opening of the third phase of a world spiritual crusade, individually as well as collectively, to assume befittingly the staggering responsibilities so soon to be placed upon them. </p>

<p> They have thus far, discharged their task with befitting courage, zeal and loyalty. The foundations they have securely laid must now be both enlarged and strengthened. The virgin areas of the globe, assigned to their elected representatives, under the Ten-Year Plan, have been triumphantly and speedily opened.. The translation and publication of the literature of the Faith into both the Spanish and Portuguese tongues have been vigorously undertaken. The plot whereon the first Mashriqu’1-Adhar of Central America must needs be erected has been purchased in the Republic of Panama, the importance of which has been so clearly stressed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The first two of the historic National Ḥaẓíratu’l-Qudu that are to be established in the capital cities of the Republics of Central America and the Islands of the Antilles have been acquired.[1] A beginning has been made in the translation of Bahá’í literature into the American Indian languages spoken in those regions. </p>

<p> •’ *S </p>

<p> The tasks, now confronting them in the course of this current year and of the next, demand a still greater exertion on their part, a more complete dedication to the aims, purposes and principles of their Faith, a firmer resolve to achieve the immediate goals of their Ten-Year Plan, and a still nobler self-sacrifice in the path of the Cause they have espoused to champion. </p>

<p> The two crucial years, constituting the concluding year of the second and the opening year of the third phase of the Ten-Year Plan must be signalized, if they would prove themselves worthy of their stewardship to their Faith, by a series of achievements even more conspicuous than those that have distinguished the opening years in the annals of that Faith in Central America and the Antilles, </p>

<p> The number of avowed adherents of the Faith must, throughout that area, be speedily and substantially increased. Simultaneously a notable multiplication of groups and assemblies must be ensured in order to enlarge and reinforce the foundations of the forthcoming Regional National Assemblies. The incorporation of firmly established local spiritual assemblies must like-wise be expedited. The prizes won in distant and Virgin fields must not only be preserved but continually enhanced. The translation of Bahá’í literature into the American Indian languages assigned under the Ten-Year Plan must also be energetically prosecuted. The establishment of national endowments throughout that area must be, moreover, diligently undertaken and rapidly carried out. Above all, the purchase of National Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds in the remaining Republics of Central America and the Antilles must, ere the conclusion of the second year of the second phase of the Ten-Year Plan be consummated. </p>

<p> * Then, and only then, can the Central America Bahá’í Communities, that have won such superb victories in the past, confidently assume the sacred burden of responsibility incumbent upon them in the course of the third phase of this world encircling crusade. Then, and only then, can they demonstrate to the Bahá’í World their capacity to carry out in its entirety their share in ensuring the triumphant conclusion of this worldwide enterprise launched by the valiant upholders of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> The tribulations now experienced by their brethern in the land of its birth should, far from crushing their spirit or dampening the zeal which animates them, infuse into them fresh courage and a more determined resolve to arise and compensate for the loss which the Cause is now sustaining. Individually as well as collectively, in their capacity as teachers and administrators, they should prove by their conduct the world-redeeming capacity of their Faith, demonstrate its incorruptible spirit, proclaim the sublimity of its teachings, and silence the criticism of its opponents. </p>

<p> Theirs is a glorious opportunity which they must not, in these day of test and trial, neglect. Theirs is a sacred duty which they must be fittingly discharge. May they arise as one man, and armed with the invincible power of Bahá’u’lláh, play their part in a manner that will bring everlasting consolation to the hearts of their persecuted brethern, and dishearten thoroughly those redoubtable adversaries who are so artfully and persistently labouring to undermine its foundations and extinguish its light. </p>

<p>     The Guardian has, at various times, given the N.S.A. certain brief instructions as to Bahá’í divorce; he does not consider that these should be amplified at the present time or elaborated, as it is premature. </p>

<p>     Bahá’ís should turn to their Assembly (first local and then National if necessary) in all questions of divorce. This is the advice he not only has given you and Mrs. Cornell, but all other Bahá’ís. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #306 August 1956 pp1-2 </p>

<p> At this historic hour, marking the opening of the third phase of the global Spiritual Crusade so courageously undertaken by the followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, I hail the convocation of the four epoch-making Bahá’í Conventions now being held in the African Continent. </p>

<p> My heart brims with joy and my soul is uplifted with thankfulness as I contemplate on this auspicious occasion, the magnificent feats which have been accomplished in recent years over the entire length and breadth of a rapidly quickening continent, feats which, in their range, number, quality and swiftness, have eclipsed the signal victories which have distinguished the campaigns successively launched in the Continent of Europe and in Latin America. </p>

<p> Continent Boasts Many Supporters </p>

<p> This vast, highly receptive, spiritually famished and long down-trodden continent-the nest of the Negro race. constituting so large a proportion of the world’s population — which was first opened, in an hour of trial and adversity, in the lifetime of Bahá’u’lláh; whose southern fringes were, during the last epoch of the Heroic Age of the Faith, illuminated by the rays of a divinely established Covenant; on whose northern shores the standard of Bahá’í emancipation has been hoisted and the struggle for the recognition of the independent character of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh has commenced-such a continent now boasts, by virtue of the dynamic influence exerted by a rising divinely conceived Order, and the propelling forces generated by a world-embracing, three-year-old Spiritual Crusade, over three thousand avowed supporters, five-sixths of whom belong to the Negro race, scattered throughout more than fifty territories and islands, and residing in over four hundred localities. Representatives of no less than one hundred and forty of its tribes have, moreover, enlisted under the banner of the Faith. Over a hundred and twenty Bahá’í local assemblies are already functioning throughout its territories. Into more than fifty of its indigenous languages Bahá’í literature has been and is being translated. The process of incorporating the newly formed local assemblies has furthermore been inaugurated. A National Administrative Headquarters has been established in each one of its four pivotal center s, while three Temple sites situated within its confines have been recently purchased, on one of which the Mother Temple of Africa is soon to be erected. </p>

<p> The Concourse on high cannot but laud such remarkable, soul-stirring exploits. The Captain, guiding from His throne of glory in the Abhá Kingdom the march of the army of Bahá’u’lláh’s Crusaders, undoubtedly applauds the fidelity, the valour, the zeal and the perseverance of the executors of His Design, while the Founder of the Faith Himself, the wellspring of the energizing influences nourishing the lives, and sustaining the activities, of these Crusaders, confers His benediction upon, and lays up treasures for, those who have so conspicuously contributed to the glory and honor of His Name. </p>

<p> I feel impelled, on so memorable an occasion, to pay a warm and heartfelt tribute to the Hand of the Cause appointed for the African Continent; to the members of the British, the American, the Persian. the Indian, the Egyptian and the Iraqi National Spiritual Assemblies; to the members of the African Auxiliary Board; to the numerous assemblies, committees and pioneers who have, singly and collectively, contributed in such a large measure to the expansion of so colossal an enterprise, and who have had so decisive a share in directing its course, in stimulating its unfoldment, and in consolidating its foundations. </p>

<p> Assemblies Will Lend Impetus </p>

<p> I cannot but feel confident that the emergence of four regional National Spiritual Assemblies, as a result of the deliberations of the delegates attending these four Bahá’í Conventions-Assemblies designed to pave the way for the erection of the pillars which must support the future Universal House of Justice — will, by enabling the activities of the Faith to be directed and coordinated from within the Continent itself, lend a tremendous impetus to the progress and eventual fruition of the stupendous undertaking launched from coast to coast through the concerted and systematic efforts of the followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p> I call upon these Regional National Spiritual Assemblies to celebrate their birth, and signalize the opening of the third phase of this World Spiritual Crusade, through the formulation of four subsidiary SevenYear Plans, designed to multiply the number of the avowed supporters of the Faith and of the isolated centers, groups and local Assemblies; to consolidate the work already achieved in the newly opened virgin territories within the confines of that Continent and in its neighboring islands; to initiate the institution of the National Bahá’í Fund; to stimulate the twin processes of establishing Bahá’í endowments and of incorporating local spiritual assemblies; to hasten the construction of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the African Continent; to ensure the establishment of the Bahá’í Publishing Trust in Egypt; and to speed up the translation of Bahá’í literature into the remaining African languages listed in the Ten Year Plan, as well as the incorporation of the newly formed Regional National Spiritual Assemblies. </p>

<p> Lend Continued Support </p>

<p> I appeal to the British, the American, the Persian, the Indian, the Egyptian and the Iraqi National Spiritual Assemblies, who have set in motion these vast undertakings, not to abandon these fledgling African Bahá’í communities to their fate, but to lend their support and assistance to the newly emerged Regional National Spiritual Assemblies, enriching thereby the record of the superb and historic services rendered by them, throughout that continent, to its diversified peoples, tribes and races. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the manifold blessings of Bahá’u ‘llah, glorifying in His Kingdom the African victories won in His Name in such rapid succession. rest upon the deliberations of all the delegates attending these four history-making Conventions. May the combined efforts of the faithful, laboring now and in the days that lie ahead, yield, in the years to come, a harvest which will infinitely enable the record of unforgettable achievements associated with the rise of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh and the establishment of His World Order in the African Continent. </p>

<p> Your loving letter of 26 May was presented to the beloved Guardian, and he has directed me to respond on his behalf. </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1473'> 1956-07-19 The Past Bahá’í Administrative Year </h3>

<p class='ref noid'> USBN #307 September 1956 pp1-2 </p>

<p> “The past Bahá’í administrative year was one full of events, achievements and anxiety. In looking back over it, he feels that concrete progress has been made in many fields; that the American Bahá’í’s have reason to feel encouraged by the scope of their activities, and by the fact that many of their enterprises connected with the Ten Year Plan have reached fruition. </p>

<p> “He was particularly glad to note that a friendly contact had been made with the Chief Executive of the United States, and that he had acknowledged over his own signature, in appreciative terms, the receipt of the Bahá’í prayer your Assembly had forwarded to him. He was also very pleased to note the helpful attitude of the State Department, particularly in connection with the persecutions of our brethren in Írán. </p>

<p> An Important Turning Point </p>

<p> “ The establishment of the South and West Africa National Bahá’í Assembly signalizes an important turning-point in the execution of the Divine Plan by the Bahá’ís of America. A capable and representative national body has evidently been elected; and the Guardian cherishes the highest hopes for the unfoldment of the work in that part of the world, a work whose foundations have been so brilliantly laid down by a singularly distinguished and devoted group of pioneers from different countries, chief amongst them those from the western Hemisphere. The new world has indeed paid back part of its debt to the “ dark continent” it at one time so ruthlessly exploited. </p>

<p> “The Guardian hopes that the Kampala Temple project, designs for which are now well advanced, and, have been carried out by the Hand of the Cause, Mr. Mason Remey, will soon be set in motion. The new National Assembly for Central and East Africa will be directly responsible for this work. </p>

<p> “The new incorporations added during the past year in the United States, although a step in the right direction, are not sufficient. He feels that during the coming year every effort should be made by Assemblies that have a well-grounded, if small, community, to incorporate. </p>

<p> “He was particularly happy to hear of the incorporation of the Tokyo Spiritual Assembly. Indeed the initiative shown throughout the Pacific area in this respect and many others is truly challenging and stimulating; and the American Bahá’ís, the parents of so many of these other communities, should take heed and follow the lead of their exuberant offspring. </p>

<p> “The Guardian feels that during the coming year, the National Assembly should pay particular attention to getting teachers with spiritual capacity and a deep knowledge of the Covenant out to the weaker communities on circuit teaching trips, and that an effort should be made for them to stay for some time in each place. It is evident that one of the reasons that the work on the home front in America is so seriously lagging is that the Bahá’ís themselves, though undoubtedly devoted, loyal and conscientious, are not always very deeply grounded in the spiritual fundamentals of their Faith. This produces a maladjustment, so to speak, in the nature of their service to the Cause; and only through a deeper understanding of their Faith and the inner spiritual strength that this understanding brings will they be able to reinforce themselves to meet their tasks to see the joy of discharging their duties and grasping their privileges. </p>

<p> Extraordinary Progress </p>

<p> “The Guardian has been particularly happy at the extraordinary progress made in acquiring Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds and endowments all over the world. The Bahá’ís may well look upon the accomplishments in this field as little short of awe-inspiring, and every believer should feel highly encouraged that one of the most difficult aspects of the Ten Year Plan, namely the financing of such enterprises, has been more than two-thirds fulfilled by the end of the third year of the Plan. </p>

<p> “ The Guardian feels that if the friends would meditate a little more objectively upon both their relationship to the Cause and the vast non-Bahá’í public they hope to influence, they would see things more clearly. The friends are not being forced to do anything, either by the Guardian or by the National Assembly. However, the condition that the world is in is bringing many issues to a head. It would be perhaps impossible to find a nation or people not in a state of crisis today. The materialism, the lack of true religion and the consequent baser forces in human nature which are being released, have brought the whole world to the brink of probably the greatest crisis it has ever faced or will have to face. The Bahá’ís are a part of the world. They too feel the great pressures which are brought to bear upon all people today, whoever and wherever they may be. On the other hand, the Divine Plan, which is the direct method of working toward the establishment of Peace and World Order, has perforce reached an important and challenging point in its unfoldment; because of the desperate needs of the world, the Bahá’ís find themselves, even though so limited in numbers, in financial strength and in prestige-called upon to fulfill a great responsibility. They must, at all times, remember that when the Guardian makes his appeals to the friends, he is only presenting the situation to them. Each one must evaluate what his own response can be and should be; nobody can do this for him. There is no other pressure than the pressure of historical circumstances. He fully realizes that the demands made upon the Bahá’ís are great, and that they often feel inadequate, tired and perhaps frightened in the face of the tasks that confront them. This is only natural. On the other hand, they must realize that the power of God can and will assist them; and that because they are privileged to have accepted the Manifestation of God for this Day, this very act has placed upon them a great moral responsibility toward their fellow-men. It is this moral responsibility to which the Guardian is constantly calling their attention, as he too cannot but obey the compelling force of circumstances and fulfill his paramount duty of calling to the attention of the believers their opportunity, their privileges, and their responsibilities. </p>

<p> “The American Bahá’ís have so far never failed in any mission they undertook, and he hopes and believes there will be no failure this time. He has the greatest confidence in their loyalty, their faith, and their devotion, and he feels sure that with the help of Bahá’u’ llah they will arise to the occasion which history has literally thrust upon them.” </p>

<p> Your letter of September 4th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p> Homosexuality is highly condemned and often a great trial and cause of suffering to a person, as a Bahá’í. Any individual so afflicted must, through prayer, and any other means, seek to overcome this handicap. But, unless the actions of such individuals are flagrantly immoral, it cannot be a pretext for depriving them of their voting rights. </p>

<p> They young believers in question must adhere to their Faith, and not withdraw from active service, because of the tests they experience. In one way or another we are all tested; and this must strengthen us, not weaken us. The Guardian will pray for these two young believers, and also for you and for the situation there. </p>

<p> In building the Temple, one must be careful not to be carried away with the ideals and emotions of the situation, but keep oneself firmly on the ground, and realize they are buildings of steel and stone.

<h3 class='subhead toc' id='section1487'> 1957-07-28 to Central America RSA </h3>

<p> Divine Springtime — Louise Coswell Recalls, pp108-14 </p>

<p> The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer on his behalf your letters dated May 30th, June 26th, and July 16th. </p>

<p> He was delighted to hear that the Convention was such a success, and that the Hand of the Cause, Mr. Khadem, was able to visit so many centers throughout that region. He feels sure that the spirit he imparted to the friends, as well as the stirring events of the Convention and the election of your Assembly, will all mark a turning point in the work in that area and give the forward march of the Faith a new impetus. </p>

<p> Now that the New Regional Assemblies in Latin America have been formed, and that each one embraces a more limited area than the previous Central and South American assemblies, the work should be much easier to handle, and therefore go ahead much faster. He anticipates great things from your assembly and is eagerly awaiting news of fresh victories. </p>

<p> Hie paramount task is, of course, the teaching work: at every session your assembly should give it close attention, considering everything else of secondary importance. Not only must many new assemblies be developed, as well as groups and isolated centers, but special attention must be focused on the work of converting the Indians to the Faith. The goal should be all-Indian assemblies, so that these much exploited and suppressed original inhabitants of the land may realize that they are equals and partners in the affairs of the Cause of God, and that Bahá’u’lláh is the Manifestation of God for them. </p>

<p> Another of the important tasks facing your body is that of purchasing sites for future Temples in the outskirts of the capital cities of all the Republics under your jurisdiction, with the exception of Panama, which has its Temple site already. The land need not be large, two or three acres being quite sufficient for your purposes at this time; it need not be in the city but anywhere within a radius of fifteen kilometers, and economy should be borne in mind. If, when the time comes to build a House of Worship, the site is not suitable, it can be exchanged or sold and another one acquired. </p>

<p> Wherever the laws permit, firmly established local assemblies should be incorporated, thus laying a foundation on which the future independent National Spiritual Assemblies can build when they come into being. </p>

<p> Every step forward in the expansion of our glorious Faith releases new spiritual energies. The believers, as well as your assembly, must seize upon this opportunity they now have with both hands, and arise to new levels of self-sacrifice, service and dedication, confident that Bahá’u’lláh is only waiting for the instruments to be put in His hands in order to fulfill His Divine purpose. </p>

<p> The Guardian assures you he will support you, one and all, with his prayers, and supplicate that you may be guided in carrying out your great work, strengthened and protected. </p>

<p> With warm Bahá’í greetings, </p>

<p class='signature noid'> (Signed) R. Rabbání </p>

<p> Dear and Valued Co-workers: </p>

<p> The formation of a Regional Spiritual Assembly representing the Bahá’í Communities of Central America and Mexico, with its seat fixed in the capital city of a Republic the future 110 of which the pen of the Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant has extolled, is indeed, an auspicious event of far-reaching significance, to be acclaimed as the forerunner of no less than seven National Spiritual Assemblies, designed to support, each as a separate pillar, the noble and divinely conceived structure of the Universal House of Justice. </p>

<p> There can be no doubt that the remarkable progress achieved, singly and collectively, in both the teaching and administrative fluids, by the followers of the Most Great Name, labouring, in the course of two decades, so diligently, for the propagation of His Faith, throughout the length and breadth of an area linking the northern and southern continents of the Western Hemisphere, has been responsible for this great step forward that has been taken towards the consummation of so historic a task. </p>

<p> The various and urgent enterprises, now challenging both their spirit and resources, demand a consecration as complete, a resolve as firm, and a zeal as ardent as any they have hitherto envinced. </p>

<p> The Six-Year Plan formulated to enable them to meet the immediate requirements of their mission should be prosecuted with the utmost diligence. Attention, on the part of all the members of the seven Bahá’í Communities participating in this world crusade, as well as their elected representatives, should be continually focused on its objectives. </p>

<p> A Systematic effort must be made by the rank and file of these communities to increase rapidly the nuMber of avowed supporters of the Faith, of isolated centers, of groups and of local spiritual assemblies. Every firmly grounded assembly should, at the earliest opportunity, be incorporated for the purpose of reinforcing the foundations of the rising structure of a divinely conceived administrative order. Every avenue should moreover, be explored in order to obtain recognition from the civil authorities concerned, of the Bahá’í marriage certificate and of the Bahá’í Holy Days. Nor must the meritorious work, so zealously undertaken in the newly opened virgin territories be, under any circumstances, neglected. The translation of Bahá’í literature into the Spanish and American Indian languages, its publication and dissemination, should likewise, be carried out with efficiency and vigour. The all-important enterprise, aimed at winning the whole-hearted allegiance of the members of various tribes of the American Indians to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh, and of ensuring their active and sustained participation in the conduct of its administrative affairs, must likewise be seriously considered and strenuously pursued. And, last but not least, a site of modest dimensions should in the neighborhood of the capital cities of each of these seven Republics, with the exception of Panama, .be chosen and promptly purchased, designed to pave the way for the ultimate erection of a Mother Temple in each of these Republics. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> Marvellous opportunities, which if not seized at once may not reoccur, have been vouchsafed, at this auspicious hour, to the prosecutors of this historic and momentous Plan, on which the immediate destinies of these communities, now gathered under the shadow of Bahá’u’lláh, depend. Theirs is the privilege and sacred duty to exploit them to the full, ere it is too late, and to play their part, befitting the co-executors of ‘Abdu’1-Bahá’s Divine Plan and members of that band of crusaders now battling for the strength of His Father’s Cause in building up the institutions, and in broadening and reinforcing the foundations, of the embryonic world order of His Faith in the heart of the Western Hemisphere. </p>

<p> No matter how severe the testis and trials they may encounter, however arduous the task that confronts them, they must, one and all, pursue steadily the path they now tread, with undimmed vision, undeviating loyalty, unrestrained devotion and unyielding determination, until the Plan they are pledged to execute will have been carried out in its entirety, and the fondest expectations entertained for their success by their watchful brethern throughout the Western Hemisphere, and, indeed, in every continent of the globe, are triumphantly fulfilled. </p>

<p class='signature noid'> May the spirit of Bahá’u’lláh bountifully sustain them while discharging their manifold and pressing responsibilities, and may the Author of the Divine Plan, whose design they are painstakingly labouring to create, and whose mandate they have willingly arisen to obey, guide every step they take, remove every obstacle obstructing their path, fulfill every hope they cherish, and enable them, through a still greater measure of His abiding grace, promised unequivocally to all those who will respond to His call, to write an unforgettable chapter in Latin American Bahá’í history, and contribute a share to its enrichment which posterity will soever cease to extol. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> The Priceless Pearl, Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, p322-3 </p>

<p> During Mrs. __’s visit, the Guardian discussed with her the teaching work in __ where there is such a response to the Message, and where the people in outlying districts seem to be eager to enroll. He feels that those responsible for accepting new believers should consider that the most important and fundamental qualification for acceptance is the recognition of the station of Bahá’u’lláh in this day on the part of the applicant. We cannot expect people who are illiterate (which is no reflection on their mental abilities or capacities) to have studied the Teachings, especially when so little literature is available in their own language in the first place, and grasp all their ramifications, the way an African, say in London, is expected to. The spirit of the person is the important thing, the recognition of Bahá’u’lláh and His position in the world in this day. The friends therefore must not be too strict, or they will find that the great wave of loving enthusiasm with which the African people have turned to the Faith, many of them already accepting it, cools off; and being very sensitive, they will feel in some subtle way that they are rebuffed, and the work will suffer. </p>

<p> “The purpose of the new National Assemblies in Africa, and the purpose of any administrative body, is to carry the Message to the people and enlist the sincere under the banner of this Faith. </p>

<p> “Your Assembly must never lose sight of this for a moment, and must go on courageously expanding the membership of the communities under your jurisdiction, and gradually educating the friends in both the Teachings and the Administration. Nothing could be more tragic than if the establishment of these great administrative bodies should stifle or bog down the teaching work. The early believers in both the East and the West, we must always remember, knew practically nothing compared to what the average Bahá’í knows about his Faith nowadays; yet they were the ones who shed their blood, the ones who arose and said: ‘I believe’, requiring no proof, and often never having read a single word of the Teachings. Therefore, those responsible for accepting new enrollments must just be sure of one thing — that the heart of the applicant has been touched with the spirit of the Faith. Everything else can be built on this foundation gradually. </p>

<p> He hopes that during the coming year it will be increasingly possible for the African Bahá’í teachers to circulate amongst the newly-enrolled Bahá’ís and deepen their knowledge and understanding of the Teachings. </p>

<p> .... </p>

<p> As regards the questions of tribal practice, the Guardian wishes you to be extremely forbearing and patient in weaning the Bahá’ís away from their old customs. this can only be done by taking each case individually as it comes up, using the greatest wisdom and kindness, and not trying rigorously to impose all Bahá’í laws in every detail at this time. </p>

<p> “Of course it is obvious that if a Bahá’í man already has one wife he cannot take another, no matter what the tribal law may be. Your Assembly should distinguish between this fundamental point and other phases of the tribal community life in which the new Bahá’í may still be deeply involved, and from which he cannot extract himself until the Bahá’í element in his community is strong enough to be a power in its own right. </p>

<p> “He agrees with the feeling of your Assembly that to start imposing the heavy sanction of depriving the friends of their voting rights is most unwise at the present time. The best policy is one of loving education.” </p>

<p> In their constant concern to illuminate the hearts of their countrymen with the radiance of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, and in their daily contact with peoples intensely conservative by nature, steeped in tradition, bound, for the most part, by the ties of religious orthodoxy, sunk in materialism, and fully content with the standard they have achieved, the members of these communities must, of necessity, find the work to which they have dedicated themselves painfully slow, extremely arduous, and often highly discouraging. The seeds, however, they are now sowing —and to this particular task they must, in the days to come, address themselves with redoubled vigour and renewed consecration, despite their daily preoccupations and constant concern with the expansion and consolidation of the administrative machinery of the Faith-will, under the watchful care of Providence, and in consequence of the tribulations which a heedless generation is bound sooner or later to experience, germinate, at the appointed time, and yield a harvest of such proportions as will fill them with astonishment. </p>

<p> .... </p>

<p> As the World Spiritual Crusade moves swiftly along its destined course, and approaches its mid — point, the attention of the indefatigable members of these wide-awake communities must be focused on ways and means that will not only ensure the awakening, to an unprecedented degree, of the interest of the masses in the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, but will bring about a substantial increase in the number of adherents who will willingly arise to proclaim its truths, whole-heartedly support its institutions and effectively promote their interests. </p>

<p> A sustained concentration, on the part of the entire company of the faithful, and particularly their elected representatives, whether local or regional, on this pre-eminent duty, of transcendental importance, and of extreme urgency, cannot fail at this hour, to draw forth from the Source of invisible Power in the Abhá Kingdom a measure of blessings that will abundantly support the bearers of the glad-tidings of the New Day to the peoples and races of a sorely afflicted continent, and enable them to reap, in this particular field the possibilities of which, alas, have not been sufficiently exploited, such a harvest as will amaze not only themselves, but their countrymen as well. </p>

<p> A rapid, a decisive and brilliant success in a vast field stretching from the southern confines of Germany to the southern extremity of the Italian Peninsula, embracing within its scope Corsica and Sardinia to the west, Sicily to the south, and Rhodes to the east of that Peninsula, is bound, through its repercussions, at no distant date, to rouse the potential adversaries of the Faith, belonging to both the catholic and protestant communions, from their lethargy, and precipitate a spiritual contest which by its very nature, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has repeatedly assured the American believers, will be the signal for the launching of a publicity campaign which the combined resources at the disposal of these communities could never enable them to initiate and conduct, paralleled by a corresponding and an extraordinary upsurge of the mysterious forces latent in the Faith, which will carry them upward from the shadowed valleys of obscurity to the sunny uplands of fame, prosperity and triumph. </p>

<p> .... </p>

<p> That the members of these sister communities now linked by ties of spiritual comradeship, at this earliest stage in the unfoldment of their separate Missions, and destined to exert, as they mature, and pursue independently the path of service to their beloved Cause, a profound and abiding influence, by virtue of the position they occupy, and the fame acquired by their countries as seats of mighty institutions, both religious and secular, on the fortunes of the Faith in Europe and beyond its confines, that the members of these communities may meet befittingly the challenge of the present hour, and arise as one man to accomplish each of the goals set before them, is a prayer that I never fail to utter and a wish which I cherish with all my heart. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> The Priceless Pearl, Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, p135 </p>

<p> As he explained to _____, he is very anxious for Switzerland to purchase a plot, however shall in size, and modest a beginning it may be, for the future Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of that country. He feels this should be in the outskirts of Bern, overlooking the Bernese Oberland; and he is very happy to be able to present this land himself to the Swiss Community. No publicity whatsoever should be given to this matter lest an opposition resembling that which has arisen in Germany should be provoked amongst the orthodox element in Bern. Whenever the committee responsible for finding this land has located a suitable plot, he would like your Assembly to inform him of the details. </p>

<p class='ref noid'> 1957-08-12 to NSA Italy and Switzerland re: Temple site </p>

<p class='noid'> ========= </p>

<p> In the Priceless Pearl, pp134-5, Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum says that during the last year of his life, two Swiss pilgrims came to Haifa and he described to them his love of Switzerland and desire for a Swiss Temple, indicating where it should stand. She says that a letter dated 12 Aug 57 to the NSA of Italy and Switzerland he formalized his desire in this regard. The Swiss pilgrims are not identified and a likely named ref to them in the letter is removed. </p>

<p> There has been on-line a paper of unknown provenance, “Refreshed and Renewed: From Shoghi Effendi to the Guardian” by Robert Atkinson, which is mostly about Shoghi Effendi in Switzerland. In it, he says the first two Swiss pilgrims were a Dr. and Mrs Ott, who were on pilgrimage in April 1957, and that they hand carried the letter back to the Swiss and Italian NSA. </p>

<p> In the BW XVII entry for Mark Tobey, it notes “biographical remarks by Dr. Ott, professor of theology at the University of Basel”. </p>

<p> Presumably these are all ref’s to Heinrich Ott, Reformed Church theologian who took the place of Karl Barth. By what I ca find on-line, he was pastor at Castiel from 1952-57, at Arisdorf 1957-62 and was at the Univ of Basel fm 1962. </p>

<p> Was his wife Ingeborg perhaps a Bahá’í who left the Faith or was forced to disassociate herself by her husband’s church positions? the portion of Shoghi Effendi’s letter quoted by Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum indicates his concern about conservative backlash if it is found the Bahá’í’s intended on building a Temple near Bern. </p>

<p> Compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice </p>

<p> To their [German Bahá’ís] brethren in the Eastern Zone, so gravely handicapped by the unfortunate disabilities which they have so long and so patiently suffered, consistent support, in whatever way possible, should be extended, and every avenue should be explored to ensure that the flame burning in those valiant hearts, so heavily burdened by cares and anxieties, will not be extinguished. The no less vital obligation to introduce, however tentatively, the Faith in the territories lying beyond the eastern confines of their homeland, and particularly in the Baltic States, must be promptly and seriously considered, for upon it will, to a very great measure, depend the success of the Mission envisaged for them by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and now confirmed through the provisions of the Ten Year  </p>

<p> He also feels that particular attention should be devoted to the teaching work in the South, and to attracting the colored people. The years of careful attention, which have been devoted to the white element in the South, in the hope of placating them, enrolling them in the Faith, and also enrolling the colored Bahá’ís at the same time, have not shown satisfactory results. In view of this, he urges the friends to concentrate on teaching the Negroes. They should be courageous in their racial stand, particularly as so many non-Bahá’ís and non-Bahá’í organizations are showing marked courage at this time, when the decisions of the Supreme Court are being so hotly contested in the South. The friends must remember that the cardinal principle of their Faith is the Oneness of Mankind. This places an obligation on them far surpassing the obligation which Christian charity and brotherly love places upon the Christians. They should demonstrate this spirit of oneness constantly and courageously in the South. </p>

<p> “Regarding your question of whether you should have more children or not, the Guardian feels that this is a matter for you and your husband to decide. However, we must always bear in mind that God will protect His own, and that the Bahá’í children are the future servants of mankind who will help to carry the world forward into the glorious New Order which Bahá’u’lláh has prepared for it in this day of days. We should not face the future with fear, but with glad and assured hearts.” </p>
