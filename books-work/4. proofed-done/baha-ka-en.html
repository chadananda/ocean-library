  the name of Him Who is the Supreme Ruler over all that hath been and
  all that is to be</span>
  <span class='block dropcap'>
  The first duty
  prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of Him Who is
  the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Fountain of His laws, Who
  representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the
  world of creation. Whoso achieveth this duty hath attained unto all
  good; and whoso is deprived thereof hath gone astray, though he be
  the author of every righteous deed. It behooveth everyone who
  reacheth this most sublime station, this summit of transcendent
  glory, to observe every ordinance of Him Who is the Desire of the
  world. These twin duties are inseparable. Neither is acceptable
  without the other. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Source
  of Divine inspiration. </span>

<p id='2' data-ref='ka_en-1-2'>
They whom God hath endued with insight will readily recognize that
the precepts laid down by God constitute the highest means for the
maintenance of order in the world and the security of its peoples. He
that turneth away from them is accounted among the abject and
foolish. We, verily, have commanded you to refuse the dictates of
your evil passions and corrupt desires, and not to transgress the
bounds which the Pen of the Most High hath fixed, for these are the
breath of life unto all created things. The seas of Divine wisdom and
Divine utterance have risen under the breath of the breeze of the
All-Merciful. Hasten to drink your fill, O men of understanding! They
that have violated the Covenant of God by breaking His commandments,
and have turned back on their heels, these have erred grievously in
the sight of God, the All-Possessing, the Most High. </p>


<p id='3' data-ref='ka_en-1-3'>
O ye peoples of the world! Know assuredly that My commandments are
the lamps of My loving providence among My servants, and the keys of
My mercy for My creatures. Thus hath it been sent down from the
heaven of the Will of your Lord, the Lord of Revelation. Were any man
to taste the sweetness of the words which the lips of the
All-Merciful have willed to utter, he would, though the treasures of
the earth be in his possession, renounce them one and all, that he
might vindicate the truth of even one of His commandments, shining
above the Dayspring of His bountiful care and loving-kindness. </p>


<p id='4' data-ref='ka_en-1-4'>
Say: From My laws the sweet-smelling savor of My garment can be
smelled,<a data-fnid='1'></a> and by their aid the standards of Victory will be planted
upon the highest peaks. The Tongue of My power hath, from the heaven
of My omnipotent glory, addressed to My creation these words:
“Observe My commandments, for the love of My beauty.” Happy is
the lover that hath inhaled the divine fragrance of his Best-Beloved
from these words, laden with the perfume of a grace which no tongue
can describe. By My life! He who hath drunk the choice wine of
fairness from the hands of My bountiful favor will circle around My
commandments that shine above the Dayspring of My creation. </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn1'>
<p>This is an
allusion to the story of Joseph in the Qur’án and the Old
Testament, in which Joseph’s garment, brought by his brothers to
Jacob, their father, enabled Jacob to identify his beloved long-lost
son. The metaphor of the fragrant <i>“garment”</i> is frequently
used in the Bahá’í Writings to refer to the recognition of the
Manifestation of God and His Revelation.</p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh, in one of His Tablets, describes Himself as the
<i>“Divine Joseph”</i> Who has been <i>“bartered away”</i> by
the heedless <i>“for the most paltry of prices.”</i> The Báb, in
the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, identifies Bahá’u’lláh as the <i>“true
Joseph”</i> and forecasts the ordeals that He would endure at the
hands of His treacherous brother (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-190">190</a>).
Likewise, Shoghi Effendi draws a parallel between the intense
jealousy which the preeminence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had aroused
in His half-brother, Mírzá Muḥammad-‘Alí, and the deadly envy
“which the superior excellence of Joseph had kindled in the hearts
of his brothers.”</p>

Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay,
rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might
and power.<a data-fnid='2'></a> To this beareth witness that which the Pen of Revelation
hath revealed. Meditate upon this, O men of insight! </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn2'>
  <p>The consumption of
  wine and other intoxicants is prohibited in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (see
  notes [144] and [170]).</p>
  <p>
  Reference to the use of “wine” in an allegorical sense — such as
  being the cause of spiritual ecstasy — is found, not only in the
  Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, but in the Bible, in the Qur’án,
  and in ancient Hindu traditions.</p>
  <p>
  For example, in the Qur’án the righteous are promised that they
  will be given to drink of the <i>“choice sealed wine.”</i> In His
  Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh identifies the <i>“choice Wine”</i>
  with His Revelation whose <i>“musk-laden fragrance”</i> has been
  wafted <i>“upon all created things.”</i> He states that He has
  <i>“unsealed”</i> this <i>“Wine,”</i> thereby disclosing
  spiritual truths that were hitherto unknown, and enabling those who
  quaff thereof to <i>“discern the splendors of the light of divine
  unity”</i> and to <i>“grasp the essential purpose underlying the
  Scriptures of God.”</i></p>
  <p>
  In one of His meditations, Bahá’u’lláh entreats God to supply
  the believers with <i>“the choice Wine of Thy mercy, that it may
  cause them to be forgetful of anyone except Thee, and to arise to
  serve Thy Cause, and to be steadfast in their love for Thee.”</i></p>

We have enjoined obligatory prayer upon you,<a data-fnid='3'></a> with nine rak‘ahs,<a data-fnid='4'></a> to
be offered at noon and in the morning and the evening <a data-fnid='5'></a> unto God, the
Revealer of Verses. We have relieved you of a greater number,<a data-fnid='6'></a> as a
command in the Book of God. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the
Omnipotent, the Unrestrained. When ye desire to perform this prayer,
turn ye towards the Court of My Most Holy Presence, this Hallowed
Spot that God hath made the Center round which circle the Concourse
on High, and which He hath decreed to be the Point of Adoration for
the denizens of the Cities of Eternity,<a data-fnid='7'></a> and the Source of Command
unto all that are in heaven and on earth; and when the Sun of Truth
and Utterance shall set, turn your faces towards the Spot that We
have ordained for you.<a data-fnid='8'></a> He, verily, is Almighty and Omniscient. </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn3'>
  <p>In Arabic, there
  are several words for prayer. The word “ṣalát,” which appears
  here in the original, refers to a particular category of prayers, the
  recitation of which at specific times of the day is enjoined on the
  believers. To differentiate this category of prayers from other
  kinds, the word has been translated as <i>“obligatory prayer.”</i></p>
  <p>
  Bahá’u’lláh states that <i>“obligatory prayer and fasting
  occupy an exalted station in the sight of God”</i> (Q&amp;A [93]).
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá affirms that such prayers are <i>“conducive
  to humility and submissiveness, to setting one’s face towards God
  and expressing devotion to Him,”</i> and that through these prayers
  <i>“man holdeth communion with God, seeketh to draw near unto Him,
  converseth with the true Beloved of his heart, and attaineth
  spiritual stations.”</i></p>
  <p>
  The Obligatory Prayer (see note [9]) referred
  to in this verse has been superseded by the three Obligatory Prayers
  later revealed by Bahá’u’lláh (Q&amp;A [63]).
  The texts of the three prayers currently in use, together with
  instructions regarding their recital, are to be found in this volume
  in Some Texts Supplementary to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.</p>
  <p>
  A number of the items in Questions and Answers deal with aspects of
  the three new Obligatory Prayers. Bahá’u’lláh clarifies that
  the individual is permitted to choose any one of the three Obligatory
  Prayers (Q&amp;A [65]). Other provisions are
  elucidated in Questions and Answers, numbers [66],
  [67], [81], and [82].</p>
  <p>
  The details of the law concerning obligatory prayer are summarized in
  section IV.A.1.–17. of the Synopsis and Codification.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn4'>
  <p>A rak‘ah is the
  recitation of specifically revealed verses accompanied by a
  prescribed set of genuflections and other movements.</p>
  <p>
  The Obligatory Prayer originally enjoined by Bahá’u’lláh upon
  His followers consisted of nine rak‘ahs. The precise nature of this
  prayer and the specific instructions for its recitation are unknown,
  as the prayer has been lost. (See note [9].)</p>
  <p>
  In a Tablet commenting on the presently binding Obligatory Prayers,
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that <i>“in every word and
  movement of the Obligatory Prayer there are allusions, mysteries and
  a wisdom that man is unable to comprehend, and letters and scrolls
  cannot contain.”</i></p>
  <p>
  Shoghi Effendi explains that the few simple directions given by
  Bahá’u’lláh for the recital of certain prayers not only have a
  spiritual significance but that they also help the individual “to
  fully concentrate when praying and meditating.”</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn5'>
  <p>Regarding the
  definition of the words <i>“morning,”</i> <i>“noon”</i> and
  <i>“evening,”</i> at which times the currently binding medium
  Obligatory Prayer is to be recited, Bahá’u’lláh has stated that
  these coincide with <i>“sunrise, noon and sunset”</i> (Q&amp;A
  [83]). He specifies that the <i>“allowable
  times for Obligatory Prayers are from morning till noon, from noon
  till sunset, and from sunset till two hours thereafter.”</i>
  Further, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stated that the morning
  Obligatory Prayer may be said as early as dawn.</p>
  <p>
  The definition of <i>“noon”</i> as the period <i>“from noon
  till sunset”</i> applies to the recitation of the short Obligatory
  Prayer as well as the medium one.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn6'>
  <p>The requirements
  for obligatory prayer called for in the Bábí and Islámic
  Dispensations were more demanding than those for the performance of
  the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak‘ahs that was
  prescribed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (see note [4]).</p>
  <p>
  In the Bayán, the Báb prescribed an Obligatory Prayer consisting of
  nineteen rak‘ahs which was to be performed once in a
  twenty-four-hour period — from noon of one day to noon of the next.</p>
  <p>
  The Muslim prayer is recited five times a day, namely, in the early
  morning, at midday, in the afternoon and evening, and at night. While
  the number of rak‘ahs varies according to the time of recitation, a
  total of seventeen rak‘ahs are offered in the course of a day.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn7'>
  <p>The <i>“Point of
  Adoration,”</i> that is, the point to which the worshiper should
  turn when offering obligatory prayer, is called the Qiblih. The
  concept of Qiblih has existed in previous religions. Jerusalem in the
  past had been fixed for this purpose. Muḥammad changed the Qiblih
  to Mecca. The Báb’s instructions in the Arabic Bayán were:</p>
  <p>
  <i>The Qiblih is indeed He Whom God will make manifest; whenever He
  moveth, it moveth, until He shall come to rest.</i></p>
  <p>
  This passage is quoted by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
  (¶137) and confirmed by Him in the
  above-noted verse. He has also indicated that facing in the direction
  of the Qiblih is a <i>“fixed requirement for the recitation of
  obligatory prayer”</i> (Q&amp;A [14] and
  [67]). However, for other prayers and
  devotions the individual may face in any direction.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn8'>
  <p>Bahá’u’lláh
  ordains His resting-place as the Qiblih after His passing. The Most
  Holy Tomb is at Bahjí, ‘Akká. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes
  that Spot as the <i>“luminous Shrine,”</i> <i>“the place around
  which circumambulate the Concourse on High.”</i></p>
  <p>
  In a letter written on his behalf, Shoghi Effendi uses the analogy of
  the plant turning in the direction of the sun to explain the
  spiritual significance of turning towards the Qiblih:</p>
  <p>
  …just as the plant stretches out to the sunlight — from which it
  receives life and growth — so we turn our hearts to the Manifestation
  of God, Bahá’u’lláh, when we pray; … we turn our faces … to
  where His dust lies on this earth as a symbol of the inner act.</p>

Everything that is hath come to be through His irresistible decree.
Whenever My laws appear like the sun in the heaven of Mine utterance,
they must be faithfully obeyed by all, though My decree be such as to
cause the heaven of every religion to be cleft asunder. He doeth what
He pleaseth. He chooseth, and none may question His choice.
Whatsoever He, the Well-Beloved, ordaineth, the same is, verily,
beloved. To this He Who is the Lord of all creation beareth Me
witness. Whoso hath inhaled the sweet fragrance of the All-Merciful,
and recognized the Source of this utterance, will welcome with his
own eyes the shafts of the enemy, that he may establish the truth of
the laws of God amongst men. Well is it with him that hath turned
thereunto, and apprehended the meaning of His decisive decree. </p>


<p id='8' data-ref='ka_en-1-8'>
We have set forth the details of obligatory prayer in another Tablet.<a data-fnid='9'></a>
Blessed is he who observeth that whereunto he hath been bidden by Him
Who ruleth over all mankind. In the Prayer for the Dead <a data-fnid='10'></a> six specific
passages have been sent down by God, the Revealer of Verses.<a data-fnid='11'></a> Let one
who is able to read recite that which hath been revealed to precede
these passages; and as for him who is unable, God hath relieved him
of this requirement. He, of a truth, is the Mighty, the Pardoner. </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn9'>
  <p>The original
  Obligatory Prayer had <i>“for reasons of wisdom”</i> been
  revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in a separate Tablet (Q&amp;A [63]).
  It was not released to the believers in His lifetime, having been
  superseded by the three Obligatory Prayers now in use.</p>
  <p>
  Shortly after the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, the text of this
  prayer, along with a number of other Tablets, was stolen by
  Muḥammad-‘Alí, the Arch-breaker of His Covenant.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn10'>
  <p>The Prayer for the
  Dead (see Some Texts Supplementary to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas) is the only
  Bahá’í obligatory prayer which is to be recited in congregation;
  it is to be recited by one believer while all present stand in
  silence (see note [19]). Bahá’u’lláh
  has clarified that the Prayer for the Dead is required only when the
  deceased is an adult (Q&amp;A [70]), that the
  recital should precede the interment of the deceased, and that there
  is no requirement to face the Qiblih when saying this prayer (Q&amp;A
  [85]).</p>
  <p>
  Further details concerning the Prayer for the Dead are summarized in
  the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.A. 13.–14.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn11'>
  <p>The passages that
  form part of the Prayer for the Dead comprise the repetition of the
  greeting “Alláh-u-Abhá” (God is the All-Glorious) six times,
  each followed by nineteen repetitions of one of six specifically
  revealed verses. These verses are identical with those in the Prayer
  for the Dead revealed by the Báb in the Bayán. Bahá’u’lláh
  added a supplication to precede these passages.</p>
</aside>


<p id='9' data-ref='ka_en-1-9'>
Hair doth not invalidate your prayer, nor aught from which the spirit
hath departed, such as bones and the like. Ye are free to wear the

Qur’án, but from the misconceptions of the divines. He, verily, is

<aside class='fn' id='fn12'>
  <p>In some earlier
  religious Dispensations, the wearing of the hair of certain animals
  or having certain other objects on one’s person was held to
  invalidate one’s prayer. Bahá’u’lláh here confirms the Báb’s
  pronouncement in the Arabic Bayán that such things do not invalidate
  one’s prayer.</p>
</aside>


<p id='10' data-ref='ka_en-1-10'>
We have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of
maturity;<a data-fnid='13'></a> this is ordained by God, your Lord and the Lord of your
forefathers. He hath exempted from this those who are weak from
illness or age,<a data-fnid='14'></a> as a bounty from His Presence, and He is the
Forgiving, the Generous. God hath granted you leave to prostrate
yourselves on any surface that is clean,<a data-fnid='15'></a> for We have removed in this
regard the limitation that had been laid down in the Book; God,
indeed, hath knowledge of that whereof ye know naught. Let him that
findeth no water for ablution repeat five times the words “In the
Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure,” and then proceed to his
devotions.<a data-fnid='16'></a> Such is the command of the Lord of all worlds. In regions
where the days and nights grow long, let times of prayer be gauged by
clocks and other instruments that mark the passage of the hours.<a data-fnid='17'></a> He,
verily, is the Expounder, the Wise. </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn13'>
  <p>Bahá’u’lláh
  defines the “age of maturity with respect to religious duties” as
  <i>“fifteen for both men and women”</i> (Q&amp;A [20]).
  For details of the period of fasting, see note [25]. </p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn14'>
  <p>The exemption of
  those who are weak due to illness or advanced age from offering the
  Obligatory Prayers and from fasting is explained in Questions and
  Answers. Bahá’u’lláh indicates that in <i>“time of ill health
  it is not permissible to observe these obligations”</i> (Q&amp;A
  [93]). He defines old age, in this context,
  as being from seventy (Q&amp;A [74]). In
  answer to a question, Shoghi Effendi has clarified that people who
  attain the age of seventy are exempt, whether or not they are weak.</p>
  <p>
  Exemption from fasting is also granted to the other specific
  categories of people listed in the Synopsis and Codification, section
  IV.B.5. See notes [20], [30]
  and [31] for additional discussion.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn15'>
  <p>The requirements
  of prayer in previous Dispensations have often included prostration.
  In the Arabic Bayán the Báb called upon the believers to lay their
  foreheads on surfaces of crystal when prostrating. Similarly, in
  Islám, certain restrictions are imposed with regard to the surface
  on which Muslims are permitted to prostrate. Bahá’u’lláh
  abrogates such restrictions and simply specifies <i>“any surface
  that is clean.”</i></p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn16'>
  <p>Ablutions are to
  be performed by the believer in preparation for the offering of
  obligatory prayer. They consist of washing the hands and face. If
  water is unavailable, the repetition five times of the specifically
  revealed verse is prescribed. See note [34]
  for a general discussion of ablutions.</p>
  <p>
  Antecedents in earlier Dispensations for the provision of substitute
  procedures to be followed when no water is available are found in the
  Qur’án and in the Arabic Bayán.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn17'>
  <p>This refers to
  territories situated in the extreme north or south, where the
  duration of days and nights varies markedly (Q&amp;A [64]
  and [103]). This provision applies also to
  fasting.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn18'>
  <p>The Prayer of the
  Signs is a special form of Muslim obligatory prayer that was ordained
  to be said in times of natural events, like earthquakes, eclipses,
  and other such phenomena, which may cause fear and are taken to be
  signs or acts of God. The requirement of performing this prayer has
  been annulled. In its place a Bahá’í may say, <i>“Dominion is
  God’s, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of creation,”</i>
  but this is not obligatory (Q&amp;A [52]).</p>
</aside>


<p id='12' data-ref='ka_en-1-12'>

<aside class='fn' id='fn19'>
  <p>Congregational
  prayer, in the sense of formal obligatory prayer which is to be
  recited in accordance with a prescribed ritual as, for example, is
  the custom in Islám where Friday prayer in the mosque is led by an
  imám, has been annulled in the Bahá’í Dispensation. The Prayer
  for the Dead (see note [10]) is the only
  congregational prayer prescribed by Bahá’í law. It is to be
  recited by one of those present while the remainder of the party
  stands in silence; the reader has no special status. The congregation
  is not required to face the Qiblih (Q&amp;A [85]).</p>
  <p>
  The three daily Obligatory Prayers are to be recited individually,
  not in congregation.</p>
  <p>
  There is no prescribed way for the recital of the many other Bahá’í
  prayers, and all are free to use such non-obligatory prayers in
  gatherings or individually as they please. In this regard, Shoghi
  Effendi states that</p>
  <p>
  …although the friends are thus left to follow their own
  inclination, … they should take the utmost care that any manner
  they practice should not acquire too rigid a character, and thus
  develop into an institution. This is a point which the friends should
  always bear in mind, lest they deviate from the clear path indicated
  in the Teachings.</p>

God hath exempted women who are in their courses from obligatory

Splendor and Beauty.” Thus hath it been decreed in the Book, if ye
be of them that comprehend. </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn20'>
  <p>Exemption from
  obligatory prayer and fasting is granted to women who are
  menstruating; they should, instead, perform their ablutions (see note
  [34]) and repeat 95 times a day between one
  noon and the next, the verse <i>“Glorified be God, the Lord of
  Splendor and Beauty.”</i> This provision has its antecedent in the
  Arabic Bayán, where a similar dispensation was granted.</p>
  <p>
  In some earlier religious Dispensations, women in their courses were
  considered ritually unclean and were forbidden to observe the duties
  of prayer and fasting. The concept of ritual uncleanness has been
  abolished by Bahá’u’lláh (see note [106]).</p>
  <p>
  The Universal House of Justice has clarified that the provisions in
  the Kitáb-i-Aqdas granting exemptions from certain duties and
  responsibilities are, as the word indicates, exemptions and not
  prohibitions. Any believer is, therefore, free to avail himself or
  herself of an applicable exemption if he or she so wishes. However,
  the House of Justice counsels that, in deciding whether to do so or
  not, the believer should use wisdom and realize that Bahá’u’lláh
  has granted these exemptions for good reason.</p>
  <p>
  The prescribed exemption from obligatory prayer, originally related
  to the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak‘ahs, is now
  applicable to the three Obligatory Prayers which superseded it.</p>

the ever-abiding, the forgiving, compassionate God. Upon completing
your prostrations, seat yourselves cross-legged <a data-fnid='22'></a> — men and women
alike — and eighteen times repeat “Glorified be God, the Lord of
the kingdoms of earth and heaven.” Thus doth the Lord make plain
the ways of truth and guidance, ways that lead to one way, which is
this Straight Path. Render thanks unto God for this most gracious
favor; offer praise unto Him for this bounty that hath encompassed
the heavens and the earth; extol Him for this mercy that hath
pervaded all creation. </p>

  <p>There is a

  <p>
  I was a Hidden Treasure. I wished to be made known, and thus I called
  creation into being in order that I might be known.</p>
  <p>References and
  allusions to this tradition are found throughout the Bahá’í
  Writings. For example, in one of His prayers, Bahá’u’lláh
  reveals:</p>
  <p>
  <i>Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I testify that Thou wast a
  hidden Treasure wrapped within Thine immemorial Being and an
  impenetrable Mystery enshrined in Thine own Essence. Wishing to
  reveal Thyself, Thou didst call into being the Greater and the Lesser
  Worlds, and didst choose Man above all Thy creatures, and didst make
  Him a sign of both of these worlds, O Thou Who art our Lord, the Most
  Compassionate!</i></p>
  <p>
  <i>Thou didst raise Him up to occupy Thy throne before all the people
  of Thy creation. Thou didst enable Him to unravel Thy mysteries, and
  to shine with the lights of Thine inspiration and Thy Revelation, and
  to manifest Thy names and Thine attributes. Through Him Thou didst
  adorn the preamble of the book of Thy creation, O Thou Who art the
  Ruler of the universe Thou hast fashioned!</i> (<i>Prayers and
  Meditations by Bahá’u’lláh</i>, XXXVIII)</p>
  <p>Likewise, in the
  Hidden Words, He states:</p>
  <p>
  <i>O Son of Man! I loved thy creation, hence I created thee.
  Wherefore, do thou love Me, that I may name thy name and fill thy
  soul with the Spirit of life.</i></p>
  <p>‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
  in His commentary on the above-cited tradition, wrote:</p>
  <p>
  <i>O wayfarer in the path of the Beloved! Know thou that the main
  purpose of this holy tradition is to make mention of the stages of
  God’s concealment and manifestation within the Embodiments of
  Truth, They who are the Dawning-places of His All-Glorious Being. For
  example, before the flame of the undying fire is lit and manifest, it
  existeth by itself within itself in the hidden identity of the
  universal Manifestations, and this is the stage of the “Hidden
  Treasure.” And when the blessed Tree is kindled by itself within
  itself, and that Divine fire burneth by its essence within its
  essence, this is the stage of “I wished to be made known.” And
  when it shineth forth from the Horizon of the universe with infinite
  Divine Names and Attributes upon the contingent and placeless worlds,
  this constituteth the emergence of a new and wondrous creation which
  correspondeth to the stage of “Thus I called creation into being.”
  And when the sanctified souls rend asunder the veils of all earthly
  attachments and worldly conditions, and hasten to the stage of gazing
  on the beauty of the Divine Presence and are honored by recognizing
  the Manifestation and are able to witness the splendor of God’s
  Most Great Sign in their hearts, then will the purpose of creation,

  <p>Fasting and
  obligatory prayer constitute the two pillars that sustain the
  revealed Law of God. Bahá’u’lláh in one of His Tablets affirms
  that He has revealed the laws of obligatory prayer and fasting so
  that through them the believers may draw nigh unto God.</p>
  <p>
  Shoghi Effendi indicates that the fasting period, which involves
  complete abstention from food and drink from sunrise till sunset, is</p>
  <p>
  …essentially a period of meditation and prayer, of spiritual
  recuperation, during which the believer must strive to make the
  necessary readjustments in his inner life, and to refresh and
  reinvigorate the spiritual forces latent in his soul. Its
  significance and purpose are, therefore, fundamentally spiritual in
  character. Fasting is symbolic, and a reminder of abstinence from
  selfish and carnal desires.</p>
  <p>
  Fasting is enjoined on all the believers once they attain the age of
  15 and until they reach the age of 70 years.</p>
  <p>
  A summary of the detailed provisions concerning the law of fasting
  and of the exemptions granted to certain categories of people is
  contained in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.B.1.–6. For
  a discussion of the exemptions from fasting see notes [14],
  [20], [30] and [31].</p>
  <p>
  The nineteen-day period of fasting coincides with the Bahá’í
  month of ‘Alá’, usually 2–20 March, immediately after the
  termination of the Intercalary Days (see notes [27]
  and [147]), and is followed by the feast of
  Naw-Rúz (see note [26]).</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn26'>
  <p>The Báb
  introduced a new calendar, known now as the Badí‘ or Bahá’í
  calendar (see notes [27] and [147]).
  According to this calendar, a day is the period from sunset to
  sunset. In the Bayán, the Báb ordained the month of ‘Alá’ to
  be the month of fasting, decreed that the day of Naw-Rúz should mark
  the termination of that period, and designated Naw-Rúz as the Day of
  God. Bahá’u’lláh confirms the Badí‘ calendar wherein Naw-Rúz
  is designated as a feast.</p>
  <p>
  Naw-Rúz is the first day of the new year. It coincides with the
  spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, which usually occurs on 21
  March. Bahá’u’lláh explains that this feast day is to be
  celebrated on whatever day the sun passes into the constellation of
  Aries (i.e. the vernal equinox), even should this occur one minute
  before sunset (Q&amp;A [35]). Hence Naw-Rúz
  could fall on 20, 21, or 22 March, depending on the time of the
  equinox.</p>
  <p>
  Bahá’u’lláh has left the details of many laws to be filled in
  by the Universal House of Justice. Among these are a number of
  matters affecting the Bahá’í calendar. The Guardian has stated
  that the implementation, worldwide, of the law concerning the timing
  of Naw-Rúz will require the choice of a particular spot on earth
  which will serve as the standard for the fixing of the time of the
  spring equinox. He also indicated that the choice of this spot has
  been left to the decision of the Universal House of Justice.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn27'>
  <p>The Badí‘
  calendar is based on the solar year of 365 days, 5 hours, and 50 odd
  minutes. The year consists of 19 months of 19 days each (i.e. 361
  days), with the addition of four extra days (five in a leap year).
  The Báb did not specifically define the place for the intercalary
  days in the new calendar. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas resolves this question
  by assigning the <i>“excess”</i> days a fixed position in the
  calendar immediately preceding the month of ‘Alá’, the period of
  fasting. For further details see the section on the Bahá’í
  calendar in <i>The Bahá’í World</i>, volume XVIII.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn28'>
  <p>Known as the
  Ayyám-i-Há (the Days of Há), the Intercalary Days have the
  distinction of being associated with <i>“the letter Há.”</i> The
  abjad numerical value of this Arabic letter is five, which
  corresponds to the potential number of intercalary days.</p>
  <p>
  The letter “Há” has been given several spiritual meanings in the
  Holy Writings, among which is as a symbol of the Essence of God.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn29'>
  <p>Bahá’u’lláh

  <p>“Alláh-u-Abhá”
  is an Arabic phrase meaning “God the All-Glorious.” It is a form
  of the Greatest Name of God (see note [137]).
  In Islám there is a tradition that among the many names of God, one
  was the greatest; however, the identity of this Greatest Name was
  hidden. Bahá’u’lláh has confirmed that the Greatest Name is
  “Bahá.”</p>
  <p>
  The various derivatives of the word “Bahá” are also regarded as
  the Greatest Name. Shoghi Effendi’s secretary writing on his behalf
  explains that</p>
  <p>
  The Greatest Name is the Name of Bahá’u’lláh. “Yá
  Bahá’u’l-Abhá” is an invocation meaning: “O Thou Glory of
  Glories!” “Alláh-u-Abhá” is a greeting which means: “God
  the All-Glorious.” Both refer to Bahá’u’lláh. By Greatest
  Name is meant that Bahá’u’lláh has appeared in God’s Greatest
  Name, in other words, that He is the supreme Manifestation of God.</p>
  <p>
  The greeting “Alláh-u-Abhá” was adopted during the period of
  Bahá’u’lláh’s exile in Adrianople.</p>
  <p>
  The repetition of “Alláh-u-Abhá” ninety-five times is to be
  preceded by the performance of ablutions (see note [34]).</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn34'>
  <p>Ablutions are
  specifically associated with certain prayers. They must precede the
  offering of the three Obligatory Prayers, the daily recitation of
  “Alláh-u-Abhá” ninety-five times, and the recital of the verse
  prescribed as an alternative to obligatory prayer and fasting for
  women in their courses (see note [20]).</p>
  <p>
  The prescribed ablutions consist of washing the hands and the face in
  preparation for prayer. In the case of the medium Obligatory Prayer,
  this is accompanied by the recitation of certain verses (see Some
  Texts Revealed by Bahá’u’lláh Supplementary to the
  Kitáb-i-Aqdas).</p>
  <p>
  That ablutions have a significance beyond washing may be seen from
  the fact that even should one have bathed oneself immediately before
  reciting the Obligatory Prayer, it would still be necessary to
  perform ablutions (Q&amp;A [18]).</p>
  <p>
  When no water is available for ablutions, a prescribed verse is to be
  repeated five times (see note [16]), and this
  provision is extended to those for whom the use of water would be
  physically harmful (Q&amp;A [51]).</p>

  <p>The Bahá’í
  laws of inheritance apply only in case of intestacy, that is, when
  the individual dies without leaving a will. In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
  (¶109), Bahá’u’lláh instructs every
  believer to write a will. He elsewhere clearly states that the
  individual has full jurisdiction over his property and is free to
  determine the manner in which his or her estate is to be divided and
  to designate, in the will, those, whether Bahá’í or non-Bahá’í,
  who should inherit (Q&amp;A [69]). In this
  connection, a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi explains
  that:</p>
  <p>
  …even though a Bahá’í is permitted in his will to dispose of
  his wealth in the way he wishes, yet he is morally and
  conscientiously bound to always bear in mind, while writing his will,
  the necessity of his upholding the principle of Bahá’u’lláh
  regarding the social function of wealth, and the consequent necessity
  of avoiding its overaccumulation and concentration in a few
  individuals or groups of individuals.</p>
  <p>
  This verse of the Aqdas introduces a lengthy passage in which
  Bahá’u’lláh elaborates the Bahá’í law of inheritance. In
  reading this passage one should bear in mind that the law is
  formulated with the presumption that the deceased is a man; its
  provisions apply, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, when the deceased is a
  woman.</p>
  <p>
  The system of inheritance which provides for distribution of the
  deceased’s estate among seven categories of heirs (children,
  spouse, father, mother, brothers, sisters, and teachers) is based on
  the provisions set out by the Báb in the Bayán. The major features
  of the Bahá’í laws of inheritance in the case of intestacy are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li class='intestacy'>If the
    deceased is a father and his estate includes a personal residence,
    such residence passes to the eldest son (Q&amp;A [34]).</li>

    <li class='intestacy'>If the
    deceased has no male descendants, two-thirds of the residence pass
    to his female descendants and the remaining third passes to the
    House of Justice (Q&amp;A [41], [72]).
    See note [42] concerning the levels of the
    institution of the House of Justice to which this law applies. (See
    also note [44].)</li>

    <li class='intestacy'>The
    remainder of the estate is divided among the seven categories of
    heirs. For details of the number of shares to be received by each
    group, see Questions and Answers, number [5],
    and Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.3.a.</li>

    <li class='intestacy'>In case
    there is more than one heir in any category the share allotted to
    that class should be divided between them equally, be they male or
    female.</li>

    <li class='intestacy'>In cases
    where there is no issue, the share of the children reverts to the
    House of Justice (Q&amp;A [7], [41]).</li>

    <li class='intestacy'>Should one
    leave offspring, but either part or all of the other categories of
    heirs be nonexistent, two-thirds of their shares revert to the
    offspring and one-third to the House of Justice (Q&amp;A [7]).</li>

    <li class='intestacy'>Should none
    of the specified categories exist, two-thirds of the estate revert
    to the nephews and nieces of the deceased. If these do not exist,
    the same shares revert to the aunts and uncles; lacking these, to
    their sons and daughters. In any case the remaining third reverts to
    the House of Justice.</li>

    <li class='intestacy'>Should one
    leave none of the aforementioned heirs, the entire estate reverts to
    the House of Justice.</li>

    <li class='intestacy'>Bahá’u’lláh
    states that non-Bahá’ís have no right to inherit from their
    Bahá’í parents or relatives (Q&amp;A [34]).
    Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf indicates that this
    restriction applies “only to such cases when a Bahá’í dies
    without leaving a will and when, therefore, his property will have
    to be divided in accordance with the rules set forth in the Aqdas.
    Otherwise, a Bahá’í is free to bequeath his property to any
    person, irrespective of religion, provided however he leaves a will,
    specifying his wishes.” It is always possible, therefore, for a
    Bahá’í to provide for his or her non-Bahá’í partner,
    children or relatives by leaving a will.</li>

<aside class='fn' id='fn44'>
  <p>In a Tablet,
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that the residence and personal
  clothing of a deceased man remain in the male line. They pass to the
  eldest son and in the absence of the eldest son, they pass to the
  second-eldest son, and so on. He explains that this provision is an
  expression of the law of primogeniture, which has invariably been
  upheld by the Law of God. In a Tablet to a follower of the Faith in
  Persia He wrote: <i>“In all the Divine Dispensations the eldest son
  hath been given extraordinary distinctions. Even the station of
  prophethood hath been his birthright.”</i> With the distinctions
  given to the eldest son, however, go concomitant duties. For example,
  he has the moral responsibility, for the sake of God, to care for his
  mother and also to consider the needs of the other heirs.</p>
  <p>
  Bahá’u’lláh clarifies various aspects of this part of the law
  of inheritance. He specifies that if there be more than one
  residence, the principal and most important one passes to the male
  offspring. The remaining residences will, together with the other
  possessions of the deceased, have to be divided among the heirs (Q&amp;A
  [34]), and He indicates that in the absence
  of male offspring, two-thirds of the principal residence and the
  personal clothing of the deceased father will revert to the female
  issue and one-third to the House of Justice (Q&amp;A [72]).
  Further, when the deceased is a woman, Bahá’u’lláh states that
  all her used clothing is to be equally divided amongst her daughters.
  Her unworn clothing, jewels and property must be divided among her
  heirs, as well as her used clothing if she leaves no daughter (Q&amp;A
  [37]).</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn45'>
  <p>This aspect of the
  law applies only in the case of the son who predeceases his father or

  <p>The institution of

  Houses of Justice and outlines the method to be pursued for the

  In the verse cited above, the reference is to the Local House of
  Justice, an institution which is to be elected in a locality whenever
  there are nine or more resident adult Bahá’ís. For this purpose,
  the definition of adult was temporarily fixed at the age of 21 years
  by the Guardian, who indicated it was open to change by the Universal
  House of Justice in the future.</p>
  <p>
  Local and Secondary Houses of Justice are, for the present, known as
  Local Spiritual Assemblies and National Spiritual Assemblies. Shoghi

  which, </p>
  <p>
  …as the position and aims of the Bahá’í Faith are better

O people of Bahá! It is incumbent upon each one of you to engage in
some occupation <a data-fnid='56'></a> — such as a craft, a trade or the like. We have
exalted your engagement in such work to the rank of worship of the
one true God. Reflect, O people, on the grace and blessings of your
Lord, and yield Him thanks at eventide and dawn. Waste not your hours
in idleness and sloth, but occupy yourselves with what will profit
you and others. Thus hath it been decreed in this Tablet from whose
horizon hath shone the daystar of wisdom and utterance. The most
despised of men in the sight of God are they who sit and beg. Hold ye
fast unto the cord of means and place your trust in God, the Provider
of all means. </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn56'>
  <p>It is obligatory
  for men and women to engage in a trade or profession. Bahá’u’lláh
  exalts <i>“engagement in such work”</i> to the <i>“rank of
  worship”</i> of God. The spiritual and practical significance of
  this law, and the mutual responsibility of the individual and society
  for its implementation are explained in a letter written on behalf of
  Shoghi Effendi:</p>
  <p>
  With reference to Bahá’u’lláh’s command concerning the
  engagement of the believers in some sort of profession: the Teachings
  are most emphatic on this matter, particularly the statement in the
  Aqdas to this effect which makes it quite clear that idle people who
  lack the desire to work can have no place in the new World Order. As
  a corollary of this principle, Bahá’u’lláh further states that
  mendicity should not only be discouraged but entirely wiped out from
  the face of society. It is the duty of those who are in charge of the
  organization of society to give every individual the opportunity of
  acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of profession, and also
  the means of utilizing such a talent, both for its own sake and for
  the sake of earning the means of his livelihood. Every individual, no
  matter how handicapped and limited he may be, is under the obligation
  of engaging in some work or profession, for work, especially when
  performed in the spirit of service, is according to Bahá’u’lláh
  a form of worship. It has not only a utilitarian purpose, but has a
  value in itself, because it draws us nearer to God, and enables us to
  better grasp His purpose for us in this world. It is obvious,
  therefore, that the inheritance of wealth cannot make anyone immune
  from daily work.</p>
  <p>
  In one of His Tablets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that <i>“if a
  person is incapable of earning a living, is stricken by dire poverty
  or becometh helpless, then it is incumbent on the wealthy or the
  Deputies to provide him with a monthly allowance for his
  subsistence.… By ‘Deputies’ is meant the representatives of the
  people, that is to say the members of the House of Justice.”</i>
  (See also note [162] on mendicancy.)</p>
  <p>
  In response to a question concerning whether Bahá’u’lláh’s
  injunction requires a wife and mother, as well as her husband, to
  work for a livelihood, the Universal House of Justice has explained
  that Bahá’u’lláh’s directive is for the friends to be engaged
  in an occupation which will profit themselves and others, and that
  homemaking is a highly honorable and responsible work of fundamental
  importance to society.</p>
  <p>
  Concerning the retirement from work for individuals who have reached
  a certain age, Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf
  stated that “this is a matter on which the International House of
  Justice will have to legislate as there are no provisions in the
  Aqdas concerning it.”</p>

  fault of character, and ask another person’s forgiveness or pardon,
  we are quite free to do so.</p>

  The Universal House of Justice has also clarified that Bahá’u’lláh’s
  prohibition concerning the confession of sins does not prevent an

  disposition of endowments but also for the succession of authority
  following the passing of Bahá’u’lláh (see note [145])
  and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Bahá’u’lláh, in the Book of His
  Covenant, appointed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, His eldest son, as the

  in His Will and Testament, appointed Shoghi Effendi, His eldest
  grandson, as the Guardian and Head of the Faith.</p>
  <p>
  This passage of the Aqdas, therefore, anticipates the succession of

  of Shoghi Effendi in 1957 precipitated the very situation provided

  <p>
  In one of His Tablets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to some of the
  spiritual and social implications of the violation of the laws of
  morality and, concerning the penalty here described, He indicates
  that the aim of this law is to make clear to all that such an action
  is shameful in the eyes of God and that, in the event that the
  offense can be established and the fine imposed, the principal
  purpose is the exposure of the offenders — that they are shamed and

  of God, and that the motive for punishment is not vengeance, but the
  imposition of a penalty for the committed offense. In <i>Some
  Answered Questions</i>, He confirms that it is the right of society
  to impose punishments on criminals for the purpose of protecting its
  members and defending its existence. </p>
  <p>
  With regard to this provision, Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on
  his behalf gives the following explanation:</p>
  <p>
  In the Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh has given death as the penalty for
  murder. However, He has permitted life imprisonment as an
  alternative. Both practices would be in accordance with His Laws.
  Some of us may not be able to grasp the wisdom of this when it
  disagrees with our own limited vision; but we must accept it, knowing
  His Wisdom, His Mercy and His Justice are perfect and for the
  salvation of the entire world. If a man were falsely condemned to
  die, can we not believe Almighty God would compensate him a
  thousandfold, in the next world, for this human injustice? You cannot
  give up a salutary law just because on rare occasions the innocent
  may be punished.</p>
  <p>
  The details of the Bahá’í law of punishment for murder and arson,
  a law designed for a future state of society, were not specified by
  Bahá’u’lláh. The various details of the law, such as degrees of
  offense, whether extenuating circumstances are to be taken into
  account, and which of the two prescribed punishments is to be the
  norm are left to the Universal House of Justice to decide in light of
  prevailing conditions when the law is to be in operation. The manner
  in which the punishment is to be carried out is also left to the
  Universal House of Justice to decide.</p>
  <p>
  In relation to arson, this depends on what <i>“house”</i> is
  burned. There is obviously a tremendous difference in the degree of
  offense between the person who burns down an empty warehouse and one
  who sets fire to a school full of children.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn87'>
  <p>Shoghi Effendi, in
  response to a question about this verse of the Aqdas, affirmed that
  while capital punishment is permitted, an alternative, “life
  imprisonment,” has been provided “whereby the rigors of such a
  condemnation can be seriously mitigated.” He states that
  “Bahá’u’lláh has given us a choice and has, therefore, left
  us free to use our own discretion within certain limitations imposed
  by His law.” In the absence of specific guidance concerning the
  application of this aspect of Bahá’í law, it remains for the
  Universal House of Justice to legislate on the matter in the future.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn89'>
  <p>While the text of
  the Kitáb-i-Aqdas appears to permit bigamy, Bahá’u’lláh
  counsels that tranquillity and contentment derive from monogamy. In
  another Tablet, He underlines the importance of the individual’s
  acting in such a way as to <i>“bring comfort to himself and to his
  partner.”</i> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the authorized Interpreter
  of the Bahá’í Writings, states that in the text of the Aqdas
  monogamy is in effect enjoined. He elaborates this theme in a number
  of Tablets, including the following:</p>
  <p>
  <i>Know thou that polygamy is not permitted under the law of God, for
  contentment with one wife hath been clearly stipulated. Taking a
  second wife is made dependent upon equity and justice being upheld
  between the two wives, under all conditions. However, observance of
  justice and equity towards two wives is utterly impossible. The fact
  that bigamy has been made dependent upon an impossible condition is
  clear proof of its absolute prohibition. Therefore it is not
  permissible for a man to have more than one wife.</i></p>
  <p>
  Polygamy is a very ancient practice among the majority of humanity.
  The introduction of monogamy has been only gradually accomplished by
  the Manifestations of God. Jesus, for example, did not prohibit
  polygamy, but abolished divorce except in the case of fornication;
  Muḥammad limited the number of wives to four, but making plurality
  of wives contingent on justice, and reintroducing permission for
  divorce; Bahá’u’lláh, Who was revealing His Teachings in the
  milieu of a Muslim society, introduced the question of monogamy
  gradually in accordance with the principles of wisdom and the
  progressive unfoldment of His purpose. The fact that He left His
  followers with an infallible Interpreter of His Writings enabled Him
  to outwardly permit two wives in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas but uphold a
  condition that enabled ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to elucidate later
  that the intention of the law was to enforce monogamy.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn90'>
  <p>Bahá’u’lláh
  states that a man may employ a maiden for domestic service. This was
  not permissible under <u>Sh</u>í‘ih Muslim practice unless the
  employer entered into a marriage contract with her. Bahá’u’lláh
  emphasizes that the <i>“service”</i> referred to in this verse is
  solely <i>“such as is performed by any other class of servants, be
  they young or old, in exchange for wages”</i> (Q&amp;A [30]).
  An employer has no sexual rights over his maid. She is <i>“free to
  choose a husband at whatever time she pleaseth,”</i> for the
  purchase of women is forbidden (Q&amp;A [30]).</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn91'>
  <p>While marriage is
  enjoined in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh clarifies that it
  is not obligatory (Q&amp;A [46]). Shoghi
  Effendi, in a letter written on his behalf, also declared that
  “marriage is by no means an obligation,” and he affirmed that “in
  the last resort, it is for the individual to decide whether he wishes
  to lead a family life or live in a state of celibacy.” If a person
  has to wait a considerable period of time before finding a spouse, or
  ultimately must remain single, it does not mean that the individual
  is thereby unable to fulfill his or her life’s purpose, which is
  fundamentally spiritual.</p>

  <p>The Synopsis and
  Codification, section IV.C.1.j.i.–v., summarizes the main
  provisions concerning the dowry. These provisions have their
  antecedents in the Bayán.</p>
  <p>
  The dowry is to be paid by the bridegroom to the bride. It is fixed
  at 19 mi<u>th</u>qáls of pure gold for city dwellers, and 19
  mi<u>th</u>qáls of silver for village dwellers (see note [94]).
  Bahá’u’lláh indicates that, if, at the time of the wedding, the
  bridegroom is unable to pay the dowry in full, it is permissible for
  him to issue a promissory note to the bride (Q&amp;A [39]).</p>
  <p>
  With the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh many familiar concepts,
  customs and institutions are redefined and take on new meaning. One
  of these is the dowry. The institution of dowry is a very ancient
  practice in many cultures and takes many forms. In some countries it
  is a payment made by the parents of the bride to the bridegroom; in
  others it is a payment made by the bridegroom to the parents of the
  bride, called a “bride-price.” In both such cases the amount is
  often quite considerable. The law of Bahá’u’lláh abolishes all
  such variants and converts the dowry into a symbolic act whereby the
  bridegroom presents a gift of a certain limited value to the bride.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn94'>
  <p>Bahá’u’lláh
  specifies that the criterion for determining the dowry payment is the
  location of the permanent residence of the bridegroom, not of the
  bride (Q&amp;A [87], [88]).</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn95'>
  <p>In answer to a
  question about the dowry, Bahá’u’lláh stated:</p>
  <p>
  <i>Whatever is revealed in the Bayán, in respect to those residing
  in cities and villages, is approved and should be carried out.
  However, in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas mention is made of the lowest level.
  The intention is nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of silver,
  specified in the Bayán for village dwellers. This is more pleasing
  unto God, provided the two parties agree. The purpose is to promote
  the comfort of all, and to bring about concord and union among the
  people. Therefore, the greater the consideration shown in these
  matters the better it will be … The people of Bahá must associate
  and deal with each other with the utmost love and sincerity. They
  should be mindful of the interests of all, especially the friends of
  God.</i></p>
  <p>‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
  in one of His Tablets, summarized some of the provisions for
  determining the level of the dowry. The unit of payment mentioned in
  the extract, cited below, is the “váḥid.” One váḥid is
  equivalent to nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls. He stated:</p>
  <p>
  <i>City dwellers must pay in gold and village dwellers in silver. It
  dependeth on the financial means at the disposal of the groom. If he
  is poor, he payeth one váḥid; if of modest means, he payeth two
  váḥids; if well-to-do, three váḥids; if wealthy, four váḥids;
  and if very rich, he giveth five váḥids. It is, in truth, a matter
  for agreement between the bridegroom, the bride, and their parents.
  Whatever agreement is reached should be carried out.</i></p>
  <p>In this same
  Tablet, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá encouraged the believers to refer
  questions concerning the application of this law to the Universal
  House of Justice which has <i>“the authority to legislate.”</i>
  He stressed that <i>“it is this body which will enact laws and
  legislate upon secondary matters which are not explicit in the Holy
  Text.”</i></p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn108'>
  <p>The Bayán, the
  Mother Book of the Bábí Dispensation, was revealed by the Báb in
  two parts, one Persian and one Arabic. It is the repository of the
  laws and precepts of the Báb’s Dispensation and enshrines most of
  His references and tributes to “Him Whom God will make manifest”
  (Bahá’u’lláh), Whose advent He heralded. In God Passes By
  Shoghi Effendi indicates that the Bayán should be regarded
  “primarily as a eulogy of the Promised One rather than as a code of
  laws and ordinances designed to be a permanent guide to future
  generations.”</p>
  <p>
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written: <i>“The Bayán hath been
  superseded by the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, except in respect of such laws as
  have been confirmed and mentioned in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.”</i></p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn109'>
  <p>In the Tablet of
  I<u>sh</u>ráqát Bahá’u’lláh, referring to the fact that the
  Báb had made the laws of the Bayán subject to His sanction, states
  that He put some of the Báb’s laws into effect <i>“by embodying
  them in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in different words,”</i> while others He
  set aside.</p>
  <p>
  With regard to the destruction of books, the Bayán commanded the
  Báb’s followers to destroy all books except those that were
  written in vindication of the Cause and Religion of God. Bahá’u’lláh
  abrogates this specific law of the Bayán.</p>
  <p>
  As to the nature and severity of the laws of the Bayán, Shoghi
  Effendi in a letter written on his behalf provides the following
  comment:</p>
  <p>
  The severe laws and injunctions revealed by the Báb can be properly
  appreciated and understood only when interpreted in the light of His
  own statements regarding the nature, purpose and character of His own
  Dispensation. As these statements clearly reveal, the Bábí
  Dispensation was essentially in the nature of a religious and indeed
  social revolution, and its duration had therefore to be short, but
  full of tragic events, of sweeping and drastic reforms. Those drastic
  measures enforced by the Báb and His followers were taken with the
  view of undermining the very foundations of <u>Sh</u>í‘ih
  orthodoxy, and thus paving the way for the coming of Bahá’u’lláh.
  To assert the independence of the new Dispensation, and to prepare
  also the ground for the approaching Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh,
  the Báb had therefore to reveal very severe laws, even though most
  of them were never enforced. But the mere fact that He revealed them
  was in itself a proof of the independent character of His
  Dispensation and was sufficient to create such widespread agitation,
  and excite such opposition on the part of the clergy that led them to
  cause His eventual martyrdom.</p>

  <p>The Bahá’í
  Writings enjoin the acquisition of knowledge and the study of the
  arts and sciences. Bahá’ís are admonished to respect people of
  learning and accomplishment, and are warned against the pursuit of
  studies that are productive only of futile wrangling.</p>
  <p>
  In His Tablets Bahá’u’lláh counsels the believers to study such
  sciences and arts as are <i>“useful”</i> and would further <i>“the
  progress and advancement”</i> of society, and He cautions against
  sciences which <i>“begin with words and end with words,”</i> the
  pursuit of which leads to <i>“idle disputation.”</i> Shoghi
  Effendi, in a letter written on his behalf, likened sciences that
  “begin with words and end with words” to “fruitless excursions
  into metaphysical hair-splittings,” and, in another letter, he
  explained that what Bahá’u’lláh primarily intended by such
  “sciences” are “those theological treatises and commentaries
  that encumber the human mind rather than help it to attain the
  truth.”</p>

  <p>This verse
  establishes Ḥuqúqu’lláh, the Right of God, the offering of a
  fixed portion of the value of the believer’s possessions. This
  offering was made to Bahá’u’lláh as the Manifestation of God
  and then, following His Ascension, to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the
  Center of the Covenant. In His Will and Testament, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
  provided that the Ḥuqúqu’lláh was to be offered <i>“through
  the Guardian of the Cause of God.”</i> There now being no Guardian,
  it is offered through the Universal House of Justice as the Head of
  the Faith. This fund is used for the promotion of the Faith of God
  and its interests as well as for various philanthropic purposes. The
  offering of the Ḥuqúqu’lláh is a spiritual obligation, the
  fulfillment of which has been left to the conscience of each Bahá’í.
  While the community is reminded of the requirements of the law of
  Ḥuqúq, no believer may be approached individually to pay it.</p>
  <p>
  A number of items in Questions and Answers further elaborate this
  law. The payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh is based on the calculation of
  the value of the individual’s possessions. If a person has
  possessions equal in value to at least nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of
  gold (Q&amp;A [8]), it is a spiritual
  obligation to pay nineteen percent of the total amount, once only, as
  Ḥuqúqu’lláh (Q&amp;A [89]). Thereafter,
  whenever one’s income, after all expenses have been paid, increases
  the value of one’s possessions by the amount of at least nineteen
  mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold, one is to pay nineteen percent of this
  increase, and so on for each further increase (Q&amp;A [8],
  [90]).</p>
  <p>
  Certain categories of possessions, such as one’s residence, are
  exempt from the payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh (Q&amp;A [8],
  [42], [95]), and
  specific provisions are outlined to cover cases of financial loss
  (Q&amp;A [44], [45]),
  the failure of investments to yield a profit (Q&amp;A [102])
  and for the payment of Ḥuqúq in the event of the person’s death
  (Q&amp;A [9], [69],
  [80]). (In this latter case, see note [47].)</p>
  <p>

  <p>In several of His

  allegorical verses, which are susceptible to interpretation, and
  those verses that relate to such subjects as the laws and ordinances,
  worship and religious observances, whose meanings are evident and
  which demand compliance on the part of the believers.</p>
  <p>
  As explained in notes [145] and [184],
  Bahá’u’lláh designated ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, His eldest Son,
  as His Successor and the Interpreter of His Teachings. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
  in His turn appointed His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, to succeed
  Him as interpreter of the holy Writ and Guardian of the Cause. The
  interpretations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi are
  considered divinely guided and are binding on the Bahá’ís.</p>
  <p>
  The existence of authoritative interpretations does not preclude the
  individual from engaging in the study of the Teachings and thereby
  arriving at a personal interpretation or understanding. A clear
  distinction is, however, drawn in the Bahá’í Writings between
  authoritative interpretation and the understanding that each
  individual arrives at from a study of its Teachings. Individual
  interpretations based on a person’s understanding of the Teachings
  constitute the fruit of man’s rational power and may well
  contribute to a greater comprehension of the Faith. Such views,
  nevertheless, lack authority. In presenting their personal ideas,
  individuals are cautioned not to discard the authority of the
  revealed words, not to deny or contend with the authoritative
  interpretation, and not to engage in controversy; rather they should
  offer their thoughts as a contribution to knowledge, making it clear
  that their views are merely their own.</p>

  <p>Marriage with

  make this impossible.</p>
  <p>
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi confirmed that, while
  stepmothers are the only category of relatives mentioned in the text,
  this does not mean that all other unions within a family are
  permissible. Bahá’u’lláh states that it devolves upon the House
  of Justice to legislate “concerning the legitimacy or otherwise of
  marrying one’s relatives” (Q&amp;A [50]).
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written that the more distant the blood

  <p>The word
  translated here as <i>“boys”</i> has, in this context, in the
  Arabic original, the implication of pederasty. Shoghi Effendi has
  interpreted this reference as a prohibition on all homosexual
  relations.</p>
  <p>
  The Bahá’í teachings on sexual morality center on marriage and
  the family as the bedrock of the whole structure of human society and
  are designed to protect and strengthen that divine institution.
  Bahá’í law thus restricts permissible sexual intercourse to that
  between a man and the woman to whom he is married.</p>
  <p>
  In a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi it is stated:</p>
  <p>
  No matter how devoted and fine the love may be between people of the
  same sex, to let it find expression in sexual acts is wrong. To say
  that it is ideal is no excuse. Immorality of every sort is really
  forbidden by Bahá’u’lláh, and homosexual relationships He looks
  upon as such, besides being against nature. To be afflicted this way
  is a great burden to a conscientious soul. But through the advice and
  help of doctors, through a strong and determined effort, and through
  prayer, a soul can overcome this handicap.</p>

  <p>This passage
  establishes four great festivals of the Bahá’í year. The two
  designated by Bahá’u’lláh as <i>“the two Most Great
  Festivals”</i> are, first, the Festival of Riḍván, which
  commemorates Bahá’u’lláh’s Declaration of His Prophetic
  Mission in the Garden of Riḍván in Ba<u>gh</u>dád during twelve
  days in April/May 1863 and is referred to by Him as <i>“the King of
  Festivals”</i> and, second, the Báb’s Declaration, which
  occurred in May 1844 in <u>Sh</u>íráz. The first, ninth and twelfth
  days of the Festival of Riḍván are Holy Days (Q&amp;A [1]),
  as is the day of the Declaration of the Báb.</p>
  <p>
  The <i>“two other Festivals”</i> are the anniversaries of the
  births of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb. In the Muslim lunar
  calendar these fall on consecutive days, the birth of Bahá’u’lláh
  on the second day of the month of Muḥarram 1233 A.H. (12 November
  1817), and the birth of the Báb on the first day of the same month
  1235 A.H. (20 October 1819), respectively. They are thus referred to
  as the “Twin Birthdays” and Bahá’u’lláh states that these
  two days are accounted as one in the sight of God (Q&amp;A [2]).
  He states that, should they fall within the month of fasting, the
  command to fast shall not apply on those days (Q&amp;A [36]).
  Given that the Bahá’í calendar (see notes [26]
  and [147]) is a solar calendar, it remains
  for the Universal House of Justice to determine whether the Twin Holy
  Birthdays are to be celebrated on a solar or lunar basis.</p>

  Báb as a festival and is here confirmed by Bahá’u’lláh (see
  notes [26] and [147]).</p>
  <p>
  In addition to the seven Holy Days ordained in these passages of the
  Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the anniversary of the Martyrdom of the Báb was also
  commemorated as a Holy Day in the lifetime of Bahá’u’lláh and,
  as a corollary to this, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá added the observance
  of the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, making nine Holy Days in all.
  Two other anniversaries which are observed, but on which work is not

  Bahá’u’lláh removes this prohibition of the Báb. He invites

The Lord hath decreed that the dead should be interred in coffins <a data-fnid='149'></a>
made of crystal, of hard, resistant stone, or of wood that is both
fine and durable, and that graven rings should be placed upon their
fingers. He, verily, is the Supreme Ordainer, the One apprised of
all. </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn149'>
  <p>In the Bayán, the
  Báb prescribed that the deceased should be interred in a coffin made
  of crystal or polished stone. Shoghi Effendi, in a letter written on
  his behalf, explained that the significance of this provision was to
  show respect for the human body which “was once exalted by the
  immortal soul of man.” </p>
  <p>
  In brief, the Bahá’í law for the burial of the dead states that
  it is forbidden to carry the body for more than one hour’s journey
  from the place of death; that the body should be wrapped in a shroud
  of silk or cotton, and on its finger should be placed a ring bearing
  the inscription <i>“I came forth from God, and return unto Him,
  detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful,
  the Compassionate”</i>; and that the coffin should be of crystal,
  stone or hard fine wood. A specific Prayer for the Dead (see note [10])
  is ordained, to be said before interment. As affirmed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
  and the Guardian, this law precludes cremation of the dead. The
  formal prayer and the ring are meant to be used for those who have
  attained the age of maturity, i.e. 15 years of age (Q&amp;A [70]).</p>
  <p>
  With regard to the material from which the coffin is to be made, the
  spirit of the law is that coffins should be of as durable a material
  as possible. Hence, the Universal House of Justice has explained
  that, in addition to the materials specified in the Aqdas, there is
  no objection to using the hardest wood available or concrete for the
  casket. For the present, the Bahá’ís are left free to make their
  own choices in this matter.</p>

The inscription on these rings should read, for men: “Unto God

and for women: “Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and
the earth and whatsoever is between them, and He, in truth, is potent
over all things.” These are the verses that were revealed
aforetime, but lo, the Point of the Bayán <a data-fnid='150'></a> now calleth out,
exclaiming, “O Best-Beloved of the worlds! Reveal Thou in their
stead such words as will waft the fragrance of Thy gracious favors

word from Thee excelleth all that hath been sent down in the Bayán.
Thou, indeed, hast power to do what pleaseth Thee. Deprive not Thy
servants of the overflowing bounties of the ocean of Thy mercy! Thou,
in truth, art He Whose grace is infinite.” Behold, We have
hearkened to His call, and now fulfill His wish. He, verily, is the
Best-Beloved, the Answerer of prayers. If the following verse, which
hath at this moment been sent down by God, be engraved upon the
burial rings of both men and women, it shall be better for them; We,

<aside class='fn' id='fn151'>
  <p>In the Bayán, the

  five sheets of silk or cotton. Bahá’u’lláh confirmed this
  provision and added the stipulation that for <i>“those whose means
  are limited a single sheet of either fabric will suffice.”</i></p>
  <p>
  When asked whether the <i>“five sheets”</i> mentioned in the law
  referred to “five full-length shrouds” or “five cloths which
  were hitherto customarily used,” Bahá’u’lláh responded that
  the intention is the <i>“use of five cloths”</i> (Q&amp;A [56]).</p>
  <p>
  Concerning the way in which the body should be wrapped, there is
  nothing in the Bahá’í Writings to define how the wrapping of the
  body is to be done, either when <i>“five cloths”</i> are used or
  only <i>“a single sheet.”</i> At present, the Bahá’ís are
  free to use their judgment in the matter.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn152'>
  <p>The intention of
  this command is to limit the duration of the journey to one hour’s

  the body to the burial site. Bahá’u’lláh affirms that the
  sooner the burial takes place, <i>“the more fitting and acceptable
  will it be”</i> (Q&amp;A [16]).</p>
  <p>
  The place of death may be taken to encompass the city or town in
  which the person passes away, and therefore the one hour’s journey
  may be calculated from the city limits to the place of burial. The
  spirit of Bahá’u’lláh’s law is for the deceased to be buried
  near where he or she dies.</p>

  explicitly held in abeyance by the Báb, and were subsequently

  Bahá’u’lláh, in quoting this law, points to the fact that, in

<aside class='fn' id='fn160'>
  <p>The Bahá’í
  Writings contain many passages that elucidate the nature of the
  Manifestation and His relationship to God. Bahá’u’lláh
  underlines the unique and transcendent nature of the Godhead. He
  explains that <i>“since there can be no tie of direct intercourse
  to bind the one True God with His creation”</i> God ordains that
  <i>“in every age and dispensation a pure and stainless Soul be made
  manifest in the kingdoms of earth and heaven.”</i> This <i>“mysterious
  and ethereal Being,”</i> the Manifestation of God, has a human
  nature which pertains to <i>“the world of matter”</i> and a
  spiritual nature <i>“born of the substance of God Himself.”</i>
  He is also endowed with a <i>“double station”</i>:</p>
  <p>
  <i>The first station, which is related to His innermost reality,
  representeth Him as One Whose voice is the voice of God Himself …
  The second station is the human station, exemplified by the following
  verses: “I am but a man like you.” “Say, praise be to my Lord!
  Am I more than a man, an apostle?”</i></p>
  <p>Bahá’u’lláh
  also affirms that, in the spiritual realm, there is an <i>“essential
  unity”</i> between all the Manifestations of God. They all reveal
  the <i>“Beauty of God,”</i> manifest His names and attributes,
  and give utterance to His Revelation. In this regard, He states:</p>
  <p>
  <i>Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to declare: “I
  am God,” He, verily, speaketh the truth, and no doubt attacheth
  thereto. For it hath been repeatedly demonstrated that through their
  Revelation, their attributes and names, the Revelation of God, His
  names and His attributes, are made manifest in the world…</i></p>
  <p>While the
  Manifestations reveal the names and attributes of God and are the
  means by which humanity has access to the knowledge of God and His
  Revelation, Shoghi Effendi states that the Manifestations should
  “never … be identified with that invisible Reality, the Essence
  of Divinity itself.” In relation to Bahá’u’lláh, the Guardian
  wrote that the “human temple that has been the vehicle of so
  overpowering a Revelation” is not to be identified with the
  “Reality” of God.</p>
  <p>
  Concerning the uniqueness of Bahá’u’lláh’s station and the
  greatness of His Revelation, Shoghi Effendi affirms that the
  prophetic statements concerning the “Day of God,” found in the
  Sacred Scriptures of past Dispensations, are fulfilled by the advent
  of Bahá’u’lláh:</p>
  <p>
  To Israel He was neither more nor less than the incarnation of the
  “Everlasting Father,” the “Lord of Hosts” come down “with
  ten thousands of saints”; to Christendom Christ returned “in the
  glory of the Father”; to <u>Sh</u>í‘ah Islám the return of the
  Imám Ḥusayn; to Sunní Islám the descent of the “Spirit of God”
  (Jesus Christ); to the Zoroastrians the promised <u>Sh</u>áh-Bahrám;
  to the Hindus the reincarnation of Krishna; to the Buddhists the
  fifth Buddha.</p>
  <p>Bahá’u’lláh
  describes the station of “Divinity” which He shares with all the
  Manifestations of God as</p>
  <p>
  …<i>the station in which one dieth to himself and liveth in God.
  Divinity, whenever I mention it, indicateth My complete and absolute
  self-effacement. This is the station in which I have no control over
  mine own weal or woe nor over my life nor over my resurrection.</i></p>
  <p>And, regarding His
  own relationship to God, He testifies:</p>
  <p>
  <i>When I contemplate, O my God, the relationship that bindeth me to
  Thee, I am moved to proclaim to all created things “verily I am
  God”; and when I consider my own self, lo, I find it coarser than

  <p>In a Tablet
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá expounds the meaning of this verse. He states
  that <i>“mendicancy is forbidden and that giving charity to people
  who take up begging as their profession is also prohibited.”</i> He
  further points out in that same Tablet: <i>“The object is to uproot
  mendicancy altogether. However, if a person is incapable of earning a
  living, is stricken by dire poverty or becometh helpless, then it is
  incumbent on the wealthy or the Deputies to provide him with a
  monthly allowance for his subsistence … By ‘Deputies’ is meant
  the representatives of the people, that is to say the members of the

  The prohibition against giving charity to people who beg does not

<aside class='fn' id='fn170'>
  <p>This prohibition
  of the use of opium is reiterated by Bahá’u’lláh in the final
  paragraph of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. In this connection, Shoghi Effendi
  stated that one of the requirements for “a chaste and holy life”
  is “total abstinence … from opium, and from similar habit-forming
  drugs.” Heroin, ḥa<u>sh</u>í<u>sh</u> and other derivatives of cannabis such as
  marijuana, as well as hallucinogenic agents such as LSD, peyote and
  similar substances, are regarded as falling under this prohibition.</p>
  <p>‘Abdu’l-Bahá
  has written:</p>
  <p>
  <i>As to opium, it is foul and accursed. God protect us from the
  punishment He inflicteth on the user. According to the explicit Text
  of the Most Holy Book, it is forbidden, and its use is utterly
  condemned. Reason showeth that smoking opium is a kind of insanity,
  and experience attesteth that the user is completely cut off from the
  human kingdom. May God protect all against the perpetration of an act
  so hideous as this, an act which layeth in ruins the very foundation
  of what it is to be human, and which causeth the user to be
  dispossessed for ever and ever. For opium fasteneth on the soul so
  that the user’s conscience dieth, his mind is blotted away, his
  perceptions are eroded. It turneth the living into the dead. It
  quencheth the natural heat. No greater harm can be conceived than
  that which opium inflicteth. Fortunate are they who never even speak
  the name of it; then think how wretched is the user.</i></p>
  <p>
  <i>O ye lovers of God! In this, the cycle of Almighty God, violence
  and force, constraint and oppression, are one and all condemned. It
  is, however, mandatory that the use of opium be prevented by any
  means whatsoever, that perchance the human race may be delivered from
  this most powerful of plagues. And otherwise, woe and misery to whoso
  falleth short of his duty to his Lord.</i></p>
  <p>In one of His
  Tablets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stated concerning opium: <i>“the
  user, the buyer and the seller are all deprived of the bounty and
  grace of God.”</i></p>
  <p>In yet another
  Tablet, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written:</p>
  <p>
  <i>Regarding ḥa<u>sh</u>í<u>sh</u> you have pointed out that some Persians have
  become habituated to its use. Gracious God! This is the worst of all
  intoxicants, and its prohibition is explicitly revealed. Its use
  causeth the disintegration of thought and the complete torpor of the
  soul. How could anyone seek the fruit of the infernal tree, and by
  partaking of it, be led to exemplify the qualities of a monster? How
  could one use this forbidden drug, and thus deprive himself of the
  blessings of the All-Merciful?</i></p>

  that heralded the advent of the Faith of the Báb,” prophesied that
  at the appearance of the Promised One all things would be reversed,
  the last would be first, the first last. Bahá’u’lláh in one of
  His Tablets refers to the <i>“symbol and allusion”</i> of the
  <i>“mystery of the Great Reversal in the Sign of the Sovereign.”</i>
  He states: <i>“Through this reversal He hath caused the exalted to
  be abased and the abased to be exalted,”</i> and He recalls that
  <i>“in the days of Jesus, it was those who were distinguished for
  their learning, the men of letters and religion, who denied Him,
  whilst humble fisherman made haste to gain admittance into the
  Kingdom”</i> (see also note [172]). For

  <p>In his writings,
  <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í placed great emphasis on
  the Arabic letter “Váv.” In <i>The Dawn-Breakers,</i> Nabíl
  states that this letter “symbolized for the Báb the advent of a
  new cycle of Divine Revelation, and has since been alluded to by
  Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in such passages as <i>‘the
  mystery of the Great Reversal’</i> and <i>‘the Sign of the
  Sovereign.’</i>”</p>
  <p>
  The name for the letter “Váv” consists of three letters: Váv,
  Alif, Váv. According to the abjad reckoning, the numerical value of
  each of these letters is 6, 1 and 6 respectively. Shoghi Effendi in a
  letter written on his behalf to one of the believers in the East
  provides an interpretation of this verse of the Aqdas. He states that
  the <i>“Upright Alif”</i> refers to the advent of the Báb. The
  first letter with its value of six, which comes before the Alif, is a
  symbol of earlier Dispensations and Manifestations which predate the
  Báb, while the third letter, which also has a numerical value of
  six, stands for Bahá’u’lláh’s supreme Revelation which was
  made manifest after the Alif.</p>

  unlawful to carry arms, unless it is necessary to do so. With regard
  to circumstances under which the bearing of arms might be <i>“essential”</i>
  for an individual, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives permission to a
  believer for self-protection in a dangerous environment. Shoghi
  Effendi in a letter written on his behalf has also indicated that, in
  an emergency, when there is no legal force at hand to appeal to, a
  Bahá’í is justified in defending his life. There are a number of
  other situations in which weapons are needed and can be legitimately
  used; for instance, in countries where people hunt for their food and
  clothing, and in such sports as archery, marksmanship, and fencing.</p>

  does not presuppose the abolition of the use of force, but prescribes
  “a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice,” and
  which provides for the existence of an international peacekeeping
  force that “will safeguard the organic unity of the whole
  commonwealth.” In the Tablet of Bi<u>sh</u>árát, Bahá’u’lláh
  expresses the hope that <i>“weapons of war throughout the world may
  be converted into instruments of reconstruction and that strife and
  conflict may be removed from the midst of men.”</i></p>

  During the meeting, Mullá ‘Alí announced the manifestation of the

  a heretic and expelled from the assembly. He was put on trial,

  <p>Bahá’u’lláh
  cautions people <i>“of insight”</i> not to allow their
  interpretations of the Holy Scriptures to prevent them from
  recognizing the Manifestation of God. Followers of each religion have
  tended to allow their devotion to its Founder to cause them to
  perceive His Revelation as the final Word of God and to deny the
  possibility of the appearance of any subsequent Prophet. This has
  been the case of Judaism, Christianity and Islám. Bahá’u’lláh
  denies the validity of this concept of finality both in relation to
  past Dispensations and to His own. With regard to Muslims, He wrote
  in the Kitáb-i-Íqán that the <i>“people of the Qur’án …
  have allowed the words ‘Seal of the Prophets’ to veil their
  eyes,”</i> <i>“to obscure their understanding, and deprive them
  of the grace of all His manifold bounties.”</i> He affirms that
  <i>“this theme hath … been a sore test unto all mankind,”</i>
  and laments the fate of <i>“those who, clinging unto these words,
  have disbelieved in Him Who is their true Revealer.”</i> The Báb
  refers to this same theme when He warns: <i>“Let not names shut you
  out as by a veil from Him Who is their Lord, even the name Prophet,
  for such a name is but a creation of His utterance.”</i></p>

  after the death of Siyyid Káẓim, who was the appointed successor
  to <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í (see notes [171]

  Regarded as one of the leading savants and prolific authors of his

  learning that were cultivated in those times. He actively opposed
  both the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, and used his treatises to attack
  the Báb and His Teachings. In the Kitáb-i-Íqán, Bahá’u’lláh
  condemns the tone and content of his writings and singles out for
  criticism one of his works which contains negative allusions to the
  Báb. Shoghi Effendi describes him as “inordinately ambitious and
  hypocritical” and describes how he “at the special request of the

  <p>Bahá’u’lláh
  eulogizes the learned among His followers. In the Book of His
  Covenant, He wrote: <i>“Blessed are the rulers and learned among
  the people of Bahá.”</i> Referring to this statement, Shoghi
  Effendi has written:</p>
  <p>
  In this holy cycle the <i>“learned”</i> are, on the one hand, the
  Hands of the Cause of God, and, on the other, the teachers and
  diffusers of His Teachings who do not rank as Hands, but who have
  attained an eminent position in the teaching work. As to the <i>“rulers”</i>
  they refer to the members of the Local, National and International
  Houses of Justice. The duties of each of these souls will be
  determined in the future.</p>
  <p>
  The Hands of the Cause of God were individuals appointed by
  Bahá’u’lláh and charged with various duties, especially those
  of protecting and propagating His Faith. In <i>Memorials of the
  Faithful</i> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá referred to other outstanding
  believers as Hands of the Cause, and in His Will and Testament He
  included a provision calling upon the Guardian of the Faith to
  appoint Hands of the Cause at his discretion. Shoghi Effendi first
  raised posthumously a number of the believers to the rank of Hands of
  the Cause, and during the latter years of his life appointed a total
  of 32 believers from all continents to this position. In the period
  between the passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957 and the election of the
  Universal House of Justice in 1963, the Hands of the Cause directed
  the affairs of the Faith in their capacity as Chief Stewards of
  Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic World Commonwealth (see note [67]).
  In November 1964, the Universal House of Justice determined that it
  could not legislate to make it possible to appoint Hands of the
  Cause. Instead, by a decision of the House of Justice in 1968, the
  functions of the Hands of the Cause in relation to protecting and
  propagating the Faith were extended into the future by the creation
  of the Continental Boards of Counselors, and in 1973 through the
  establishment of the International Teaching Center, which has its
  seat in the Holy Land.</p>
  <p>
  The Universal House of Justice appoints the Counselor members of the
  International Teaching Center and the Continental Counselors. Members
  of Auxiliary Boards are appointed by the Continental Counselors. All
  these individuals fall within the definition of the <i>“learned”</i>
  given by Shoghi Effendi in the statement quoted above.</p>

might understand! We have appointed two signs for the coming of age
of the human race:<a data-fnid='194'></a> the first, which is the most firm foundation, We
have set down in other of Our Tablets, while the second hath been
revealed in this wondrous Book. </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn193'>
  <p>Bahá’u’lláh
  enjoins the adoption of a universal language and script. His Writings
  envisage two stages in this process. The first stage is to consist of
  the selection of an existing language or an invented one which would
  then be taught in all the schools of the world as an auxiliary to the
  mother tongues. The governments of the world through their
  parliaments are called upon to effect this momentous enactment. The
  second stage, in the distant future, would be the eventual adoption
  of one single language and common script for all on earth.</p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn194'>
  <p>The first sign of
  the coming of age of humanity referred to in the Writings of
  Bahá’u’lláh is the emergence of a science which is described as
  that <i>“divine philosophy”</i> which will include the discovery
  of a radical approach to the transmutation of elements. This is an
  indication of the splendors of the future stupendous expansion of
  knowledge.</p>
  <p>
  Concerning the <i>“second”</i> sign which Bahá’u’lláh
  indicates to have been revealed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Shoghi Effendi
  states that Bahá’u’lláh, “…in His Most Holy Book, has
  enjoined the selection of a single language and the adoption of a
  common script for all on earth to use, an injunction which, when
  carried out, would, as He Himself affirms in that Book, be one of the
  signs of the <i>‘coming of age of the human race.’</i>” </p>
  <p>
  Further insight into this process of mankind’s coming of age and
  proceeding to maturity is provided by the following statement of
  Bahá’u’lláh:</p>
  <p>
  <i>One of the signs of the maturity of the world is that no one will
  accept to bear the weight of kingship. Kingship will remain with none
  willing to bear alone its weight. That day will be the day whereon
  wisdom will be manifested among mankind.</i></p>
  <p>
  The coming of age of the human race has been associated by Shoghi
  Effendi with the unification of the whole of mankind, the
  establishment of a world commonwealth, and an unprecedented stimulus
  to “the intellectual, the moral and spiritual life of the entire
  human race.” </p>

<span class='question'>Question: Should a man go on a journey without
specifying a time for his return without indicating, in other words,
the expected period of his absence — and should no word be heard of
him thereafter, and all trace of him be lost, what course should be
followed by his wife?</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> Should he have omitted to fix a time for his return
despite being aware of the stipulation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in this
regard, his wife should wait for one full year, after which she shall
be free either to adopt the course that is praiseworthy, or to choose
for herself another husband. If, however, he be unaware of this
stipulation, she should abide in patience until such time as God
shall please to disclose to her his fate. By the course that is
praiseworthy in this connection is meant the exercise of patience.</span></p>

<p id='qa.5' data-ref='ka_en-3-5' class='nodropcap'>
<span class='question'>Question: Concerning the holy verse: “When We
heard the clamor of the children as yet unborn, We doubled their
share and decreased those of the rest.”</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> According to the Book of God, the estate of the
deceased is divided into 2,520 shares, which number is the lowest
common multiple of all integers up to nine, and these shares are then
distributed into seven portions, each of which is allocated, as
mentioned in the Book, to a particular category of heirs. The
children, for example, are allotted nine blocks of 60 shares,
comprising 540 shares in all. The meaning of the statement “We
doubled their share” is thus that the children receive a further
nine blocks of 60 shares, entitling them to a total of 18 blocks all
told. The extra shares that they receive are deducted from the
portions of the other categories of heirs, so that, although it is
revealed, for instance, that the spouse is entitled to “eight parts
comprising four hundred and eighty shares,” which is the equivalent
of eight blocks of 60 shares, now, by virtue of this rearrangement,
one and a half blocks of shares, comprising 90 shares in all, have
been subtracted from the spouse’s portion and reallocated to the
children, and similarly in the case of the others. The result is that
the total amount subtracted is equivalent to the nine extra blocks of
shares allotted to the children.</span></p>

<p id='qa.6' data-ref='ka_en-3-6' class='nodropcap'>
<span class='question'>Question: Is it necessary that the brother, in order
to qualify for his portion of the inheritance, be descended from both
the father and the mother of the deceased, or is it sufficient merely
that there be one parent in common?</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> If the brother be descended from the father he shall
receive his share of the inheritance in the prescribed measure
recorded in the Book; but if he be descended from the mother, he
shall receive only two-thirds of his entitlement, the remaining third
reverting to the House of Justice. This ruling is also applicable to
the sister.</span></p>

<!-- *************************************** -->
<p id='qa.7' data-ref='ka_en-3-7' class='nodropcap'>
<span class='question'>Question: Amongst the provisions concerning
inheritance it hath been laid down that, should the deceased leave no
offspring, their share of the estate is to revert to the House of
Justice. In the event of other categories of heirs, such as the
father, mother, brother, sister and teacher being similarly absent,
do their shares of the inheritance also revert to the House of
Justice, or are they dealt with in some other fashion? </span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> The sacred verse sufficeth. He saith, exalted be His
Word: “Should the deceased leave no offspring, their share shall
revert to the House of Justice” etc. and “Should the deceased
leave offspring, but none of the other categories of heirs that have
been specified in the Book, they shall receive two-thirds of the
inheritance and the remaining third shall revert to the House of
Justice” etc. In other words, where there are no offspring, their
allotted portion of the inheritance reverteth to the House of
Justice; and where there are offspring but the other categories of
heirs are lacking, two-thirds of the inheritance pass to the
offspring, the remaining third reverting to the House of Justice.
This ruling hath both general and specific application, which is to
say that whenever any category of this latter class of heirs is
absent, two-thirds of their inheritance pass to the offspring and the
remaining third to the House of Justice.</span></p>

<p id='qa.8' data-ref='ka_en-3-8' class='nodropcap'>
<span class='question'>Question: Concerning the basic sum on which
Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable.</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> The basic sum on which Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable is
nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold. In other words, when money to the
value of this sum hath been acquired, a payment of Ḥuqúq falleth
due. Likewise Ḥuqúq is payable when the value, not the number, of
other forms of property reacheth the prescribed amount. Ḥuqúqu’lláh
is payable no more than once. A person, for instance, who acquireth a
thousand mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold, and payeth the Ḥuqúq, is not
liable to make a further such payment on this sum, but only on what
accrueth to it through commerce, business and the like. When this
increase, namely the profit realized, reacheth the prescribed sum,
one must carry out what God hath decreed. Only when the principal
changeth hands is it once more subject to payment of Ḥuqúq, as it
was the first time. The Primal Point hath directed that Ḥuqúqu’lláh
must be paid on the value of whatsoever one possesseth; yet, in this
Most Mighty Dispensation, We have exempted the household furnishings,
that is such furnishings as are needed, and the residence itself.</span></p>

<span class='question'>Question: Which is to take precedence: the
Ḥuqúqu’lláh, the debts of the deceased or the cost of the
funeral and burial?</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> The funeral and burial take precedence, then
settlement of debts, then payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh. Should the
property of the deceased prove insufficient to cover his debts, the
remainder of his estate should be distributed among these debts in
proportion to their size.</span></p>

<span class='question'>Question: If intercourse take place between a couple
during their year of patience, and they become estranged again
thereafter, must they recommence their year of patience, or may the
days preceding the intercourse be included in the reckoning of the
year? And once divorce hath taken place, is it necessary that a
further period of waiting be observed?</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> Should affection be renewed between the couple during
their year of patience, the marriage tie is valid, and what is
commanded in the Book of God must be observed; but once the year of
patience hath been completed and that which is decreed by God taketh
place, a further period of waiting is not required. Sexual
intercourse between husband and wife is forbidden during their year
of patience, and whoso committeth this act must seek God’s
forgiveness, and, as a punishment, render to the House of Justice a
fine of nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold.</span></p>

<span class='question'>Question: Should antipathy develop between a couple
after the Marriage Verses have been read and the dowry paid, may
divorce take place without observance of the year of patience?</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> Divorce may legitimately be sought after the reading
of the Marriage Verses and payment of the dowry, but before the
consummation of the marriage. In such circumstances there is no need
for observance of a year of patience, but recovery of the dowry
payment is not permissible.</span></p>

parents of both parties to the marriage, and in this respect it
maketh no difference whether the bride be a virgin or otherwise.</span></p>

is the hour’s time, whatever the means of transport. The sooner the
burial taketh place, however, the more fitting and acceptable will it

<span class='question'>Question: What procedure should be followed on the
discovery of lost property?</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> If such property be found in the town, its discovery
is to be announced once by the town crier. If the owner of the
property is then found, it should be delivered up to him. Otherwise,
the finder of the property should wait one year, and if, during this
period, the owner cometh to light, the finder should receive from him
the crier’s fee and restore to him his property; only if the year
should pass without the owner’s being identified may the finder
take possession of the property himself. If the value of the property
is less than or equal to the crier’s fee, the finder should wait a
single day from the time of its discovery, at the end of which, if
the owner hath not come to light, he may himself appropriate it; and
in the case of property discovered in an uninhabited area, the finder
should observe a three days’ wait, on the passing of which period,
if the identity of the owner remain unknown, he is free to take
possession of his find.</span></p>

divorce, and should his preparations for the journey extend until a
year hath passed, may this period be counted as the year of patience,
or should the day the couple part be regarded as the starting point
of that year?</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> The starting point for computation is the day the
couple part, and if, therefore, they have separated a year before the
husband’s departure, and if the fragrance of affection hath not
been renewed between the couple, divorce may take place. Otherwise
the year must be counted from the day of his departure, and the

  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> Many Tablets were revealed and dispatched in their

bidden, they were again read out in the Holy Presence, and brought
into conformity with the grammatical conventions of the people in
order to forestall the cavils of opponents of the Cause. Another
reason for this practice is that the new style inaugurated by the
Herald, may the souls of all else but Him be offered up for His sake,
was seen to be marked by substantial latitude in adherence to the
rules of grammar; sacred verses therefore were then revealed in a
style which is for the most part in conformity with current usage for

<span class='question'>Question: Concerning pure water, and the point at
which it is considered used.</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> Small quantities of water, such as one cupful, or even
two or three, must be considered used after a single washing of the
face and hands. But a kurr <a data-fnid='2.8'></a>
or more of water remaineth unchanged after one or two washings of the
face, and there is no objection to its use unless it is altered in
one of the three ways, <a data-fnid='2.9'></a>
for example its color is changed, in which case it should be looked
upon as used.</span></p>

<span class='question'>Question: In a treatise in Persian on various
questions, the age of maturity hath been set at fifteen; is marriage
likewise conditional upon the reaching of maturity, or is it
permissible before that time?</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> Since the consent of both parties is required in the
Book of God, and since, before maturity, their consent or lack of it
cannot be ascertained, marriage is therefore conditional upon
reaching the age of maturity, and is not permissible before that
time.</span></p>

<span class='question'>Question: Concerning fasting and obligatory prayer
by the sick.</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> In truth, I say that obligatory prayer and fasting
occupy an exalted station in the sight of God. It is, however, in a
state of health that their virtue can be realized. In time of ill
health it is not permissible to observe these obligations; such hath
been the bidding of the Lord, exalted be His glory, at all times.
Blessed be such men and women as pay heed, and observe His precepts.

one true God, such as mosques, chapels and temples, must not be used
for any purpose other than the commemoration of His Name. This is an
ordinance of God, and he who violateth it is verily of those who have

<span class='question'>Question: A further question on divorce.</span>
  <span class='block answer'><i>Answer:</i> Since God, exalted be His glory, doth not favor
divorce, nothing was revealed on this issue. However, from the
beginning of the separation until the end of one year, two people or
more must remain informed as witnesses; if, by the end, there is no
reconciliation, divorce taketh place. This must be recorded in the
registry by the religious judicial officer of the city appointed by
the Trustees of the House of Justice. Observance of this procedure is
essential lest those that are possessed of an understanding heart be

hath ordained — may the souls of all else but Him be offered up for
His sake — is well pleasing. The existing heirs should receive their
allotted shares of the inheritance, while a statement of the
remainder must be submitted to the Court of the Most High. In His
hand is the source of authority; He ordaineth as He pleaseth. In this
regard, a law was revealed in the Land of Mystery, <a data-fnid='2.10'></a>
temporarily awarding the missing heirs’ inheritance to the existing
heirs until such time as the House of Justice shall be established,
when the decree concerning this will be promulgated. The inheritance,
however, of those who emigrated in the same year as the Ancient
Beauty, hath been awarded to their heirs, and this is a bounty of God
bestowed upon them.</span></p>

He is God,
exalted be He, the Lord of majesty and power! The Prophets and Chosen
Ones have all been commissioned by the One True God, magnified be His
glory, to nurture the trees of human existence with the living waters
of uprightness and understanding, that there may appear from them
that which God hath deposited within their inmost selves. As may be
readily observed, each tree yieldeth a certain fruit, and a barren
tree is but fit for fire. The purpose of these Educators, in all they
said and taught, was to preserve man’s exalted station. Well is it
with him who in the Day of God hath laid fast hold upon His precepts
and hath not deviated from His true and fundamental Law. The fruits
that best befit the tree of human life are trustworthiness and
godliness, truthfulness and sincerity; but greater than all, after
recognition of the unity of God, praised and glorified be He, is
regard for the rights that are due to one’s parents. This teaching
hath been mentioned in all the Books of God, and reaffirmed by the
Most Exalted Pen. Consider that which the Merciful Lord hath revealed
in the Qur’án, exalted are His words: “Worship ye God, join with
Him no peer or likeness; and show forth kindliness and charity
towards your parents…” Observe how loving-kindness to one’s
parents hath been linked to recognition of the one true God! Happy
they who are endued with true wisdom and understanding, who see and
perceive, who read and understand, and who observe that which God
hath revealed in the Holy Books of old, and in this incomparable and
wondrous Tablet.</p>
