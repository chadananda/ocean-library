    <h3 class='subtitle smaller'>(Tablet of Carmel)</h3>
  </div>


<p id='1.1' data-ref='tb_en-1-p1'>
All glory be to this Day, the Day in which the fragrances of mercy
have been wafted over all created things, a Day so blest that past
ages and centuries can never hope to rival it, a Day in which the
countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned towards His holy seat.
Thereupon the voices of all created things, and beyond them those of
the Concourse on High, were heard calling aloud: “Haste thee, O
Carmel, for lo, the light of the countenance of God, the Ruler of the
Kingdom of Names and Fashioner of the heavens, hath been lifted upon
thee.”</p>

<p id='1.2' data-ref='tb_en-1-p2'>
Seized with transports of joy, and raising high her voice, she thus
exclaimed: “May my life be a sacrifice to Thee, inasmuch as Thou
hast fixed Thy gaze upon me, hast bestowed upon me Thy bounty, and
hast directed towards me Thy steps. Separation from Thee, O Thou
Source of everlasting life, hath well nigh consumed me, and my
remoteness from Thy presence hath burned away my soul. All praise be
to Thee for having enabled me to hearken to Thy call, for having
honored me with Thy footsteps, and for having quickened my soul
through the vitalizing fragrance of Thy Day and the shrilling voice
of Thy Pen, a voice Thou didst ordain as Thy trumpet-call amidst Thy
people. And when the hour at which Thy resistless Faith was to be
made manifest did strike, Thou didst breathe a breath of Thy spirit
into Thy Pen, and lo, the entire creation shook to its very
foundations, unveiling to mankind such mysteries as lay hidden within
the treasuries of Him Who is the Possessor of all created things.”</p>

<p id='1.3' data-ref='tb_en-1-p3'>
No sooner had her voice reached that most exalted Spot than We made
reply: “Render thanks unto thy Lord, O Carmel. The fire of thy
separation from Me was fast consuming thee, when the ocean of My
presence surged before thy face, cheering thine eyes and those of all
creation, and filling with delight all things visible and invisible.
Rejoice, for God hath in this Day established upon thee His throne,
hath made thee the dawning-place of His signs and the dayspring of
the evidences of His Revelation. Well is it with him that circleth
around thee, that proclaimeth the revelation of thy glory, and
recounteth that which the bounty of the Lord thy God hath showered
upon thee. Seize thou the Chalice of Immortality in the name of thy
Lord, the All-Glorious, and give thanks unto Him, inasmuch as He, in
token of His mercy unto thee, hath turned thy sorrow into gladness,
and transmuted thy grief into blissful joy. He, verily, loveth the
spot which hath been made the seat of His throne, which His footsteps
have trodden, which hath been honored by His presence, from which He
raised His call, and upon which He shed His tears.</p>

<p id='1.4' data-ref='tb_en-1-p4'>
“Call out to Zion, O Carmel, and announce the joyful tidings: He
that was hidden from mortal eyes is come! His all-conquering
sovereignty is manifest; His all-encompassing splendor is revealed.
Beware lest thou hesitate or halt. Hasten forth and circumambulate
the City of God that hath descended from heaven, the celestial Kaaba
round which have circled in adoration the favored of God, the pure in
heart, and the company of the most exalted angels. Oh, how I long to
announce unto every spot on the surface of the earth, and to carry to
each one of its cities, the glad-tidings of this Revelation — a
Revelation to which the heart of Sinai hath been attracted, and in
whose name the Burning Bush is calling: ‘Unto God, the Lord of
Lords, belong the kingdoms of earth and heaven.’ Verily this is the
Day in which both land and sea rejoice at this announcement, the Day
for which have been laid up those things which God, through a bounty
beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart, hath destined for revelation.
Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest the
people of Bahá who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.”</p>

<p id='1.5' data-ref='tb_en-1-p5'>
Sanctified be the Lord of all mankind, at the mention of Whose name
all the atoms of the earth have been made to vibrate, and the Tongue
of Grandeur hath been moved to disclose that which had been wrapt in
His knowledge and lay concealed within the treasury of His might. He,
verily, through the potency of His Name, the Mighty, the
All-Powerful, the Most High, is the ruler of all that is in the
heavens and all that is on earth.</p>

    <h3 class='subtitle smaller'>(The Most Holy Tablet) <a data-fnid='2.1'></a></h3>
  </div> <!--section_header-->

<aside class='fn' id='fn2.1'>
Sometimes referred to as Tablet to the Christians.
</aside>

<p id='2.1' data-ref='tb_en-2-p1' class='nodropcap'>
  <span class='block preamble'>
    This is the
Most Holy Tablet sent down from the holy kingdom unto the one who
hath set his face towards the Object of the adoration of the world,
He Who hath come from the heaven of eternity, invested with
transcendent glory
  </span>
  <span class='block salutation'>In
the name of the Lord, the Lord of great glory.</span>
  <span class='block dropcap'>
    This is an Epistle from Our presence unto him whom the veils of names
have failed to keep back from God, the Creator of earth and heaven,
that his eyes may be cheered in the days of his Lord, the Help in
Peril, the Self-Subsisting.
  </span>
</p>

<p id='2.2' data-ref='tb_en-2-p2'>
Say, O followers of the Son! <a data-fnid='2.2'></a>
Have ye shut out yourselves from Me by reason of My Name? Wherefore
ponder ye not in your hearts? Day and night ye have been calling upon
your Lord, the Omnipotent, but when He came from the heaven of
eternity in His great glory, ye turned aside from Him and remained
sunk in heedlessness.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn2.2'>
Jesus.
</aside>

<p id='2.3' data-ref='tb_en-2-p3'>
Consider those who rejected the Spirit <a data-fnid='2.3'></a>
when He came unto them with manifest dominion. How numerous the
Pharisees who had secluded themselves in synagogues in His name,
lamenting over their separation from Him, and yet when the portals of
reunion were flung open and the divine Luminary shone resplendent
from the Dayspring of Beauty, they disbelieved in God, the Exalted,
the Mighty. They failed to attain His presence, notwithstanding that
His advent had been promised them in the Book of Isaiah as well as in
the Books of the Prophets and the Messengers. No one from among them
turned his face towards the Dayspring of divine bounty except such as
were destitute of any power amongst men. And yet, today, every man
endowed with power and invested with sovereignty prideth himself on
His Name. Moreover, call thou to mind the one who sentenced Jesus to
death. He was the most learned of his age in his own country, whilst
he who was only a fisherman believed in Him. Take good heed and be of
them that observe the warning.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn2.3'>
Jesus.
</aside>

<p id='2.4' data-ref='tb_en-2-p4'>
Consider likewise, how numerous at this time are the monks who have
secluded themselves in their churches, calling upon the Spirit, but
when He appeared through the power of Truth, they failed to draw nigh
unto Him and are numbered with those that have gone far astray. Happy
are they that have abandoned them and set their faces towards Him Who
is the Desire of all that are in the heavens and all that are on the
earth.</p>

<p id='2.5' data-ref='tb_en-2-p5'>
They read the Evangel and yet refuse to acknowledge the All-Glorious
Lord, notwithstanding that He hath come through the potency of His
exalted, His mighty and gracious dominion. We, verily, have come for
your sakes, and have borne the misfortunes of the world for your
salvation. Flee ye the One Who hath sacrificed His life that ye may
be quickened? Fear God, O followers of the Spirit, and walk not in
the footsteps of every divine that hath gone far astray. Do ye
imagine that He seeketh His own interests, when He hath, at all
times, been threatened by the swords of the enemies; or that He
seeketh the vanities of the world, after He hath been imprisoned in
the most desolate of cities? Be fair in your judgment and follow not
the footsteps of the unjust.</p>

<p id='2.6' data-ref='tb_en-2-p6'>
Open the doors of your hearts. He Who is the Spirit verily standeth
before them. Wherefore banish ye from Him Who hath purposed to draw
you nigh unto a Resplendent Spot? Say: We, in truth, have opened unto
you the gates of the Kingdom. Will ye bar the doors of your houses in
My face? This indeed is naught but a grievous error. He, verily, hath
again come down from heaven, even as He came down from it the first
time. Beware lest ye dispute that which He proclaimeth, even as the
people before you disputed His utterances. Thus instructeth you the
True One, could ye but perceive it.</p>

<p id='2.7' data-ref='tb_en-2-p7'>
The river Jordan is joined to the Most Great Ocean, and the Son, in
the holy vale, crieth out: “Here am I, here am I O Lord, my God!”,
whilst Sinai circleth round the House, and the Burning Bush calleth
aloud: “He Who is the Desired One is come in His transcendent
majesty.” Say, Lo! The Father is come, and that which ye were
promised in the Kingdom is fulfilled! This is the Word which the Son
concealed, when to those around Him He said: “Ye cannot bear it
now.” And when the appointed time was fulfilled and the Hour had
struck, the Word shone forth above the horizon of the Will of God.
Beware, O followers of the Son, that ye cast it not behind your
backs. Take ye fast hold of it. Better is this for you than all that
ye possess. Verily He is nigh unto them that do good. The Hour which
We had concealed from the knowledge of the peoples of the earth and
of the favored angels hath come to pass. Say, verily, He hath
testified of Me, and I do testify of Him. Indeed, He hath purposed no
one other than Me. Unto this beareth witness every fair-minded and
understanding soul.</p>

<p id='2.8' data-ref='tb_en-2-p8'>
Though beset with countless afflictions, We summon the people unto
God, the Lord of names. Say, strive ye to attain that which ye have
been promised in the Books of God, and walk not in the way of the
ignorant. My body hath endured imprisonment that ye may be released
from the bondage of self. Set your faces then towards His countenance
and follow not the footsteps of every hostile oppressor. Verily, He
hath consented to be sorely abased that ye may attain unto glory, and
yet, ye are disporting yourselves in the vale of heedlessness. He, in
truth, liveth in the most desolate of abodes for your sakes, whilst
ye dwell in your palaces.</p>

<p id='2.9' data-ref='tb_en-2-p9'>
Say, did ye not hearken to the Voice of the Crier, calling aloud in
the wilderness of the Bayán, bearing unto you the glad-tidings of
the coming of your Lord, the All-Merciful? Lo! He is come in the
sheltering shadow of Testimony, invested with conclusive proof and
evidence, and those who truly believe in Him regard His presence as
the embodiment of the Kingdom of God. Blessed is the man who turneth
towards Him, and woe betide such as deny or doubt Him.</p>

<p id='2.10' data-ref='tb_en-2-p10'>
Announce thou unto the priests: Lo! He Who is the Ruler is come. Step
out from behind the veil in the name of thy Lord, He Who layeth low
the necks of all men. Proclaim then unto all mankind the glad-tidings
of this mighty, this glorious Revelation. Verily, He Who is the
Spirit of Truth is come to guide you unto all truth. He speaketh not
as prompted by His own self, but as bidden by Him Who is the
All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p id='2.11' data-ref='tb_en-2-p11'>
Say, this is the One Who hath glorified the Son and hath exalted His
Cause. Cast away, O peoples of the earth, that which ye have and take
fast hold of that which ye are bidden by the All-Powerful, He Who is
the Bearer of the Trust of God. Purge ye your ears and set your
hearts towards Him that ye may hearken to the most wondrous Call
which hath been raised from Sinai, the habitation of your Lord, the
Most Glorious. It will, in truth, draw you nigh unto the Spot wherein
ye will perceive the splendor of the light of His countenance which
shineth above this luminous Horizon.</p>

<p id='2.12' data-ref='tb_en-2-p12'>
O concourse of priests! Leave the bells, and come forth, then, from
your churches. It behooveth you, in this day, to proclaim aloud the
Most Great Name among the nations. Prefer ye to be silent, whilst
every stone and every tree shouteth aloud: “The Lord is come in His
great glory!”? Well is it with the man who hasteneth unto Him.
Verily, he is numbered among them whose names will be eternally
recorded and who will be mentioned by the Concourse on High. Thus
hath it been decreed by the Spirit in this wondrous Tablet. He that
summoneth men in My name is, verily, of Me, and he will show forth
that which is beyond the power of all that are on earth. Follow ye
the Way of the Lord and walk not in the footsteps of them that are
sunk in heedlessness. Well is it with the slumberer who is stirred by
the Breeze of God and ariseth from amongst the dead, directing his
steps towards the Way of the Lord. Verily, such a man is regarded, in
the sight of God, the True One, as a jewel amongst men and is
reckoned with the blissful.</p>

<p id='2.13' data-ref='tb_en-2-p13'>
Say: In the East the light of His Revelation hath broken; in the West
have appeared the signs of His dominion. Ponder this in your hearts,
O people, and be not of those who have turned a deaf ear to the
admonitions of Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Praised. Let the
Breeze of God awaken you. Verily, it hath wafted over the world. Well
is it with him that hath discovered the fragrance thereof and been
accounted among the well-assured.</p>

<p id='2.14' data-ref='tb_en-2-p14'>
O concourse of bishops! Ye are the stars of the heaven of My
knowledge. My mercy desireth not that ye should fall upon the earth.
My justice, however, declareth: “This is that which the Son hath
decreed.” And whatsoever hath proceeded out of His blameless, His
truth-speaking, trustworthy mouth, can never be altered. The bells,
verily, peal out My Name, and lament over Me, but My spirit rejoiceth
with evident gladness. The body of the Loved One yearneth for the
cross, and His head is eager for the spear, in the path of the
All-Merciful. The ascendancy of the oppressor can in no wise deter
Him from His purpose. We have summoned all created things to attain
the presence of thy Lord, the King of all names. Blessed is the man
that hath set his face towards God, the Lord of the Day of Reckoning.</p>

<p id='2.15' data-ref='tb_en-2-p15'>
O concourse of monks! If ye choose to follow Me, I will make you
heirs of My Kingdom; and if ye transgress against Me, I will, in My
long-suffering, endure it patiently, and I, verily, am the
Ever-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p id='2.16' data-ref='tb_en-2-p16'>
O land of Syria! What hath become of thy righteousness? Thou art, in
truth, ennobled by the footsteps of thy Lord. Hast thou perceived the
fragrance of heavenly reunion, or art thou to be accounted of the
heedless?</p>

<p id='2.17' data-ref='tb_en-2-p17'>
Bethlehem is astir with the Breeze of God. We hear her voice saying:
“O most generous Lord! Where is Thy great glory established? The
sweet savors of Thy presence have quickened me, after I had melted in
my separation from Thee. Praised be Thou in that Thou hast raised the
veils, and come with power in evident glory.” We called unto her
from behind the Tabernacle of Majesty and Grandeur: “O Bethlehem!
This Light hath risen in the orient, and traveled towards the
occident, until it reached thee in the evening of its life. Tell Me
then: Do the sons recognize the Father, and acknowledge Him, or do
they deny Him, even as the people aforetime denied Him (Jesus)?”
Whereupon she cried out saying: “Thou art, in truth, the
All-Knowing, the Best-Informed.” Verily, We behold all created
things moved to bear witness unto Us. Some know Us and bear witness,
while the majority bear witness, yet know Us not.</p>

<p id='2.18' data-ref='tb_en-2-p18'>
Mount Sinai is astir with the joy of beholding Our countenance. She
hath lifted her enthralling voice in glorification of her Lord,
saying: “O Lord! I sense the fragrance of Thy garment. Methinks
Thou art near, invested with the signs of God. Thou hast ennobled
these regions with Thy footsteps. Great is the blessedness of Thy
people, could they but know Thee and inhale Thy sweet savors; and woe
betide them that are fast asleep.”</p>

<p id='2.19' data-ref='tb_en-2-p19'>
Happy art thou who hast turned thy face towards My countenance,
inasmuch as thou hast rent the veils asunder, hast shattered the
idols and recognized thine eternal Lord. The people of the Qur’án
have risen up against Us without any clear proof or evidence,
tormenting Us at every moment with a fresh torment. They idly imagine
that tribulations can frustrate Our Purpose. Vain indeed is that
which they have imagined. Verily, thy Lord is the One Who ordaineth
whatsoever He pleaseth.</p>

<p id='2.20' data-ref='tb_en-2-p20'>
I never passed a tree but Mine heart addressed it saying: “O would
that thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified upon thee.”
We revealed this passage in the Epistle to the <u>Sh</u>áh that it
might serve as a warning to the followers of religions. Verily, thy
Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p id='2.21' data-ref='tb_en-2-p21'>
Let not the things they have perpetrated grieve thee. Truly they are
even as dead, and not living. Leave them unto the dead, then turn thy
face towards Him Who is the Life-Giver of the world. Beware lest the
sayings of the heedless sadden thee. Be thou steadfast in the Cause,
and teach the people with consummate wisdom. Thus enjoineth thee the
Ruler of earth and heaven. He is in truth the Almighty, the Most
Generous. Erelong will God exalt thy remembrance and will inscribe
with the Pen of Glory that which thou didst utter for the sake of His
love. He is in truth the Protector of the doers of good.</p>

<p id='2.22' data-ref='tb_en-2-p22'>
Give My remembrance to the one named Murád and say: “Blessed art
thou, O Murád, inasmuch as thou didst cast away the promptings of
thine own desire and hast followed Him Who is the Desire of all
mankind.”</p>

<p id='2.23' data-ref='tb_en-2-p23'>
Say: Blessed the slumberer who is awakened by My Breeze. Blessed the
lifeless one who is quickened through My reviving breaths. Blessed
the eye that is solaced by gazing at My beauty. Blessed the wayfarer
who directeth his steps towards the Tabernacle of My glory and
majesty. Blessed the distressed one who seeketh refuge beneath the
shadow of My canopy. Blessed the sore athirst who hasteneth to the
soft-flowing waters of My loving-kindness. Blessed the insatiate soul
who casteth away his selfish desires for love of Me and taketh his
place at the banquet table which I have sent down from the heaven of
divine bounty for My chosen ones. Blessed the abased one who layeth
fast hold on the cord of My glory; and the needy one who entereth
beneath the shadow of the Tabernacle of My wealth. Blessed the
ignorant one who seeketh the fountain of My knowledge; and the
heedless one who cleaveth to the cord of My remembrance. Blessed the
soul that hath been raised to life through My quickening breath and
hath gained admittance into My heavenly Kingdom. Blessed the man whom
the sweet savors of reunion with Me have stirred and caused to draw
nigh unto the Dayspring of My Revelation. Blessed the ear that hath
heard and the tongue that hath borne witness and the eye that hath
seen and recognized the Lord Himself, in His great glory and majesty,
invested with grandeur and dominion. Blessed are they that have
attained His presence. Blessed the man who hath sought enlightenment
from the Daystar of My Word. Blessed he who hath attired his head
with the diadem of My love. Blessed is he who hath heard of My grief
and hath arisen to aid Me among My people. Blessed is he who hath
laid down his life in My path and hath borne manifold hardships for
the sake of My name. Blessed the man who, assured of My Word, hath
arisen from among the dead to celebrate My praise. Blessed is he that
hath been enraptured by My wondrous melodies and hath rent the veils
asunder through the potency of My might. Blessed is he who hath
remained faithful to My Covenant, and whom the things of the world
have not kept back from attaining My Court of holiness. Blessed is
the man who hath detached himself from all else but Me, hath soared
in the atmosphere of My love, hath gained admittance into My Kingdom,
gazed upon My realms of glory, quaffed the living waters of My
bounty, hath drunk his fill from the heavenly river of My loving
providence, acquainted himself with My Cause, apprehended that which
I concealed within the treasury of My Words, and hath shone forth
from the horizon of divine knowledge engaged in My praise and
glorification. Verily, he is of Me. Upon him rest My mercy, My
loving-kindness, My bounty and My glory.</p>

<i>The ninth Glad-Tidings</i>: When the sinner findeth himself wholly detached and freed from all
save God, he should beg forgiveness and pardon from Him. Confession
of sins and transgressions before human beings is not permissible, as
it hath never been nor will ever be conducive to divine forgiveness.
Moreover such confession before people results in one’s humiliation
and abasement, and God — exalted be His glory — wisheth not the
humiliation of His servants. Verily He is the Compassionate, the
Merciful. The sinner should, between himself and God, implore mercy
from the Ocean of mercy, beg forgiveness from the Heaven of
generosity and say:</p>

<p id='3.13' data-ref='tb_en-3-p13'>
O God, my God! I implore Thee by the blood of Thy true lovers who
were so enraptured by Thy sweet utterance that they hastened unto the
Pinnacle of Glory, the site of the most glorious martyrdom, and I
beseech Thee by the mysteries which lie enshrined in Thy knowledge
and by the pearls that are treasured in the ocean of Thy bounty to
grant forgiveness unto me and unto my father and my mother. Of those
who show forth mercy, Thou art in truth the Most Merciful. No God is
there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.</p>

nor debar him from the revelations of Thy bounty in Thy days, nor
cast him away from Thy door which Thou hast opened wide to all that
dwell in Thy heaven and on Thine earth.</p>

Alas! Alas! My sins have prevented me from approaching the Court of

favorably received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain.
Leave that soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the
Self-Subsisting. Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and
strife. The hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in
the shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance
with that which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree and
the drops of one ocean.</p>

tyranny of the wicked hath been able to thwart His Purpose. How

Great God! Although His signs have encompassed the world and His
proofs and testimonies are shining forth and manifest as the light,
yet the ignorant appear heedless, nay rather, rebellious. Would that
they had been content with opposition. But at all times they are
plotting to cut down the sacred Lote-Tree. Since the dawn of this
Revelation the embodiments of selfishness have, by resorting to
cruelty and oppression, striven to extinguish the Light of divine
manifestation. But God, having stayed their hands, revealed this
Light through His sovereign authority and protected it through the
power of His might until earth and heaven were illumined by its
radiance and brightness. Praise be unto Him under all conditions.</p>

<p id='4.3' data-ref='tb_en-4-p3'>
Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and Desire of the nations, O
Thou Who hast become manifest in the Greatest Name whereby the pearls

countenance.</p>

<p id='4.4' data-ref='tb_en-4-p4'>
I beg of Thee, by that Word through which Thy proof was perfected
among Thy creatures and Thy testimony was fulfilled among Thy

Protector of the seen and the unseen, to make whosoever ariseth to

<p id='4.7' data-ref='tb_en-4-p7'>
<i>The first Ṭaráz</i>  and the first
effulgence which hath dawned from the horizon of the Mother Book is
that man should know his own self and recognize that which leadeth
unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or abasement, wealth or poverty.
Having attained the stage of fulfillment and reached his maturity,
man standeth in need of wealth, and such wealth as he acquireth
through crafts or professions is commendable and praiseworthy in the
estimation of men of wisdom, and especially in the eyes of servants
who dedicate themselves to the education of the world and to the
edification of its peoples. They are, in truth, cup-bearers of the
life-giving water of knowledge and guides unto the ideal way. They
direct the peoples of the world to the straight path and acquaint
them with that which is conducive to human upliftment and exaltation.
The straight path is the one which guideth man to the dayspring of
perception and to the dawning-place of true understanding and leadeth
him to that which will redound to glory, honor and greatness.</p>

<p id='4.8' data-ref='tb_en-4-p8'>
We cherish the hope that through the loving-kindness of the All-Wise,
the All-Knowing, obscuring dust may be dispelled and the power of
perception enhanced, that the people may discover the purpose for
which they have been called into being. In this Day whatsoever
serveth to reduce blindness and to increase vision is worthy of
consideration. This vision acteth as the agent and guide for true
knowledge. Indeed in the estimation of men of wisdom keenness of
understanding is due to keenness of vision. The people of Bahá must
under all circumstances observe that which is meet and seemly and
exhort the people accordingly.</p>

They that are endued with sincerity and faithfulness should associate
with all the peoples and kindreds of the earth with joy and radiance,

Blessed are such as hold fast to the cord of kindliness and tender
mercy and are free from animosity and hatred.</p>

<i>The third Ṭaráz</i>  concerneth good
character. A good character is, verily, the best mantle for men from
God. With it He adorneth the temples of His loved ones. By My life!
The light of a good character surpasseth the light of the sun and the
radiance thereof. Whoso attaineth unto it is accounted as a jewel
among men. The glory and the upliftment of the world must needs
depend upon it. A goodly character is a means whereby men are guided
to the Straight Path and are led to the Great Announcement. Well is
it with him who is adorned with the saintly attributes and character
of the Concourse on High.</p>

<p id='4.13' data-ref='tb_en-4-p13'>

“O Son of Spirit! The best beloved of all things in My sight is
Justice; turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it
not that I may confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine
own eyes and not through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine
own knowledge and not through the knowledge of thy neighbor. Ponder
this in thy heart; how it behooveth thee to be. Verily justice is My
gift to thee and the sign of My loving-kindness. Set it then before
thine eyes.”</p>

<p id='4.15' data-ref='tb_en-4-p15'>
They that are just and fair-minded in their judgment occupy a sublime
station and hold an exalted rank. The light of piety and uprightness
shineth resplendent from these souls. We earnestly hope that the
peoples and countries of the world may not be deprived of the
splendors of these two luminaries.</p>

<p id='4.16' data-ref='tb_en-4-p16'>
<i>The fourth Ṭaráz</i>  concerneth
trustworthiness. Verily it is the door of security for all that dwell
on earth and a token of glory on the part of the All-Merciful. He who
partaketh thereof hath indeed partaken of the treasures of wealth and
prosperity. Trustworthiness is the greatest portal leading unto the
tranquility and security of the people. In truth the stability of
every affair hath depended and doth depend upon it. All the domains
of power, of grandeur and of wealth are illumined by its light.</p>

<p id='4.17' data-ref='tb_en-4-p17'>
Not long ago these sublime words were revealed from the Pen of the
Most High:</p>

<p id='4.18' data-ref='tb_en-4-p18'>
“We will now mention unto thee Trustworthiness and the station
thereof in the estimation of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty
Throne. One day of days We repaired unto Our Green Island. Upon Our
arrival, We beheld its streams flowing, and its trees luxuriant, and
the sunlight playing in their midst. Turning Our face to the right,
We beheld what the pen is powerless to describe; nor can it set forth
that which the eye of the Lord of Mankind witnessed in that most
sanctified, that most sublime, that blest, and most exalted Spot.
Turning, then, to the left We gazed on one of the Beauties of the
Most Sublime Paradise, standing on a pillar of light, and calling
aloud saying: ‘O inmates of earth and heaven! Behold ye My beauty,
and My radiance, and My revelation, and My effulgence. By God, the
True One! I am Trustworthiness and the revelation thereof, and the
beauty thereof. I will recompense whosoever will cleave unto Me, and
recognize My rank and station, and hold fast unto My hem. I am the
most great ornament of the people of Bahá, and the vesture of glory
unto all who are in the kingdom of creation. I am the supreme
instrument for the prosperity of the world, and the horizon of
assurance unto all beings.’ Thus have We sent down for thee that
which will draw men nigh unto the Lord of creation.”</p>

<p id='4.19' data-ref='tb_en-4-p19'>

for your temples and the most glorious crown for your heads. Take ye
fast hold of it at the behest of Him Who is the Ordainer, the
All-Informed.</p>

<p id='4.20' data-ref='tb_en-4-p20'>
<i>The fifth Ṭaráz</i>  concerneth the
protection and preservation of the stations of God’s servants. One
should not ignore the truth of any matter, rather should one give
expression to that which is right and true. The people of Bahá
should not deny any soul the reward due to him, should treat
craftsmen with deference, and, unlike the people aforetime, should
not defile their tongues with abuse.</p>

<p id='4.21' data-ref='tb_en-4-p21'>
In this Day the sun of craftsmanship shineth above the horizon of the
occident and the river of arts is flowing out of the sea of that
region. One must speak with fairness and appreciate such bounty. By
the life of God! The word “Equity” shineth bright and resplendent
even as the sun. We pray God to graciously shed its radiance upon
everyone. He is in truth powerful over all things, He Who is wont to
answer the prayers of all men.</p>

<p id='4.22' data-ref='tb_en-4-p22'>
In these days truthfulness and sincerity are sorely afflicted in the
clutches of falsehood, and justice is tormented by the scourge of
injustice. The smoke of corruption hath enveloped the whole world in
such wise that naught can be seen in any direction save regiments of
soldiers and nothing is heard from any land but the clashing of
swords. We beseech God, the True One, to strengthen the wielders of
His power in that which will rehabilitate the world and bring
tranquility to the nations.</p>

<p id='4.23' data-ref='tb_en-4-p23'>
<i>The sixth Ṭaráz</i>:
 Knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of God. It is incumbent upon
everyone to acquire it. Such arts and material means as are now
manifest have been achieved by virtue of His knowledge and wisdom
which have been revealed in Epistles and Tablets through His Most
Exalted Pen — a Pen out of whose treasury pearls of wisdom and
utterance and the arts and crafts of the world are brought to light.</p>

<p id='4.24' data-ref='tb_en-4-p24'>
In this Day the secrets of the earth are laid bare before the eyes of
men. The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror
of the world. They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of diverse
peoples and kindreds. They both reflect them and make them known.
They are a mirror endowed with hearing, sight and speech. This is an
amazing and potent phenomenon. However, it behooveth the writers
thereof to be purged from the promptings of evil passions and desires
and to be attired with the raiment of justice and equity. They should
inquire into situations as much as possible and ascertain the facts,
then set them down in writing.</p>

<p id='4.25' data-ref='tb_en-4-p25'>
Concerning this Wronged One, most of the things reported in the
newspapers are devoid of truth. Fair speech and truthfulness, by
reason of their lofty rank and position, are regarded as a sun
shining above the horizon of knowledge. The waves rising from this
Ocean are apparent before the eyes of the peoples of the world and
the effusions of the Pen of wisdom and utterance are manifest
everywhere.</p>

<p id='4.26' data-ref='tb_en-4-p26'>
It is reported in the press that this Servant hath fled from the land
of Ṭá (Ṭihrán) and gone to ‘Iráq. Gracious God! Not even for
a single moment hath this Wronged One ever concealed Himself. Rather
hath He at all times remained steadfast and conspicuous before the
eyes of all men. Never have We retreated, nor shall We ever seek
flight. In truth it is the foolish people who flee from Our presence.
We left Our home country accompanied by two mounted escorts,
representing the two honored governments of Persia and Russia until
We arrived in ‘Iráq in the plenitude of glory and power. Praise be
to God! The Cause whereof this Wronged One is the Bearer standeth as
high as heaven and shineth resplendent as the sun. Concealment hath
no access unto this station, nor is there any occasion for fear or
silence.</p>

<p id='4.27' data-ref='tb_en-4-p27'>
The mysteries of Resurrection and the events of the Last Hour are
openly manifest, but the people are sunk in heedlessness and have
suffered themselves to be wrapt in veils. “And when the seas shall
boil… And when the Scriptures shall be unrolled.” <a data-fnid='4.1'></a>
By the righteousness of God! The Dawn hath truly brightened and the
light hath shone forth and the night hath receded. Happy are they

Glorified be God! The Pen is perplexed what to write and the Tongue
wondereth what to utter. Despite unprecedented hardships and after
enduring years of imprisonment, captivity and woeful trials, We now

of understanding to be obscured. Moreover We observe that the fresh
calumnies which are now rife are far more malicious than those of

O people of the Bayán! Fear ye the merciful Lord. Consider the

<p id='4.30' data-ref='tb_en-4-p30'>
I swear by the life of Him Who is the Desire of the world! Were a man
to ponder in his heart he would, free of all attachment to the world,
hasten unto the Most Great Light and would purge and purify himself
from the dust of vain imaginings and the smoke of idle fancy. What
could have prompted the people of the past to err and by whom were
they misled? They still reject the truth and have turned towards
their own selfish desires. This Wronged One calleth aloud for the
sake of God. Whosoever wisheth, let him turn thereunto; whosoever
wisheth, let him turn away. Verily God can well afford to dispense
with all things, whether of the past or of the future.</p>

O Hádí! Give ear unto the Voice of this trustworthy Counselor:
direct thy steps from the left unto the right, that is turn away from
idle fancy unto certitude. Lead not the people into error. The divine
Luminary shineth, His Cause is manifest and His signs are
all-embracing. Set thy face towards God, the Help in Peril, the
Self-Subsisting. Renounce thy leadership for the sake of God and
leave the people unto themselves. Thou art ignorant of the essential
truth, thou art not acquainted therewith.</p>

<p id='4.33' data-ref='tb_en-4-p33'>
O Hádí! Be thou of one face in the path of God. When in company
with the infidels, thou art an infidel and with the pious, thou art
pious. Reflect thou upon such souls as offered up their lives and
their substance in that land, that haply thou mayest be admonished
and roused from slumber. Consider: who is to be preferred, he who
preserveth his body, his life and his possessions or the one who
surrendereth his all in the path of God? Judge thou fairly and be not
of the unjust. Take fast hold of justice and adhere unto equity that
perchance thou mayest not, for selfish motives, use religion as a
snare, nor disregard the truth for the sake of gold. Indeed thine
iniquity and the iniquity of such people as thyself have waxed so
grievous that the Pen of Glory was moved to make such observations.
Fear thou God. He Who heralded this Revelation hath declared: “He
shall proclaim under all conditions: ‘Verily, verily, I am God, no
God is there but Me, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.’”</p>

O people of the Bayán! Ye have been forbidden to contact the loved
ones of God. Why hath this ban been imposed and for what purpose? Be
ye fair, I adjure you by God, and be not of the heedless. Unto such
as are endued with insight, and before the Most Great Beauty, the
object of this ban is known and evident; it is so that no one may
become aware of his (Hádí’s) secrets and deeds.</p>

<p id='4.35' data-ref='tb_en-4-p35'>
O Hádí! Thou hast not been in Our company, thou art therefore
ignorant of the Cause. Act not according to thine idle imaginings.
Aside from these things, scrutinize the Writings with thine own eyes
and ponder upon that which hath come to pass. Have pity upon thyself
and upon the servants of God and be not the cause of waywardness like
unto the people aforetime. The path is unmistakable and the proof is
evident. Change injustice into justice and inequity into equity. We
cherish the hope that the breaths of divine inspiration may
strengthen thee and that thine inner ear may be enabled to hear the
blessed words: “Say, it is God, then leave them to entertain
themselves with their cavillings.” <a data-fnid='4.4'></a>
Thou has been there (Cyprus) and hast seen him (Mírzá Yaḥyá).
Now speak forth with fairness. Do not misrepresent the matter,
neither to thyself nor to the people. Thou art both ignorant and
uninformed. Give ear unto the Voice of this Wronged One and hasten
towards the ocean of divine knowledge that perchance thou mayest be
adorned with the ornament of comprehension and mayest renounce all
else but God. Hearken unto the Voice of this benevolent Counselor,
calling aloud, unveiled and manifest, before the faces of kings and
their subjects, and summon the people of the world, one and all, unto
Him Who is the Lord of Eternity. This is the Word from Whose horizon
the daystar of unfailing grace shineth resplendent.</p>

O Hádí! This Wronged One, rid of all attachment to the world, hath
striven with utmost endeavor to quench the fire of animosity and
hatred which burneth fiercely in the hearts of the peoples of the
earth. It behooveth every just and fair-minded person to render
thanks unto God — exalted be His glory — and to arise to promote this
preeminent Cause, that fire may turn into light, and hatred may give
way to fellowship and love. I swear by the righteousness of God! This
is the sole purpose of this Wronged One. Indeed in proclaiming this
momentous Cause and in demonstrating its Truth We have endured
manifold sufferings, hardships and tribulations. Thou thyself wouldst

    God testifieth that there is none other God but Him and that He Who
hath appeared is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Symbol, the Most
Great Book for all peoples, and the Heaven of bounty for the whole
world. He is the Most Mighty Sign amongst men and the Dayspring of
the most august attributes in the realm of creation. Through Him hath
appeared that which had been hidden from time immemorial and been
veiled from the eyes of men. He is the One Whose Manifestation was
announced by the heavenly Scriptures, in former times and more

of the next, and the earnest wayfarer who hath hastened unto His

overpowering might of the rulers, nor the tumult raised by the

<i>The first Tajallí</i>  which hath dawned
from the Daystar of Truth is the knowledge of God — exalted be His
glory. And the knowledge of the King of everlasting days can in no
wise be attained save by recognizing Him Who is the Bearer of the
Most Great Name. He is, in truth, the Speaker on Sinai Who is now
seated upon the throne of Revelation. He is the Hidden Mystery and
the Treasured Symbol. All the former and latter Books of God are
adorned with His praise and extol His glory. Through Him the standard
of knowledge hath been planted in the world and the ensign of the
oneness of God hath been unfurled amidst all peoples. Attainment unto
the Divine Presence can be realized solely by attaining His presence.
Through His potency everything that hath, from time immemorial, been
veiled and hidden, is now revealed. He is made manifest through the
power of Truth and hath uttered a Word whereby all that are in the
heavens and on the earth have been dumbfounded, except those whom the
Almighty was pleased to exempt. True belief in God and recognition of
Him cannot be complete save by acceptance of that which He hath
revealed and by observance of whatsoever hath been decreed by Him and
set down in the Book by the Pen of Glory.</p>

<p id='5.10' data-ref='tb_en-5-p10'>
They that immerse themselves in the ocean of His utterances should at
all times have the utmost regard for the divinely-revealed ordinances
and prohibitions. Indeed His ordinances constitute the mightiest
stronghold for the protection of the world and the safeguarding of
its peoples — a light upon those who acknowledge and recognize the
truth, and a fire unto such as turn away and deny.</p>

<p id='5.11' data-ref='tb_en-5-p11'>
<i>The second Tajallí</i>  is to remain
steadfast in the Cause of God — exalted be His glory — and to be
unswerving in His love. And this can in no wise be attained except
through full recognition of Him; and full recognition cannot be
obtained save by faith in the blessed words: “He doeth whatsoever
He willeth.” Whoso tenaciously cleaveth unto this sublime word and
drinketh deep from the living waters of utterance which are inherent
therein, will be imbued with such a constancy that all the books of
the world will be powerless to deter him from the Mother Book. O how
glorious is this sublime station, this exalted rank, this ultimate
purpose!</p>

<p id='5.12' data-ref='tb_en-5-p12'>
O ‘Alí-Akbar! Consider how abject is the state of the
disbelievers. They all give utterance to the words: “Verily He is
to be praised in His deeds and is to be obeyed in His behest.”
Nevertheless if We reveal aught which, even to the extent of a
needle’s eye, runneth counter to their selfish ways and desires,
they will disdainfully reject it. Say, none can ever fathom the
manifold exigencies of God’s consummate wisdom. In truth, were He
to pronounce the earth to be heaven, no one hath the right to
question His authority. This is that whereunto the Point of the Bayán
hath testified in all that was sent down unto Him with truth at the
behest of God, He Who hath caused the Dawn to break.</p>

<i>The third Tajallí</i>  is concerning
arts, crafts and sciences. Knowledge is as wings to man’s life, and
a ladder for his ascent. Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone.
The knowledge of such sciences, however, should be acquired as can
profit the peoples of the earth, and not those which begin with words
and end with words. Great indeed is the claim of scientists and
craftsmen on the peoples of the world. Unto this beareth witness the
Mother Book on the day of His return. Happy are those possessed of a
hearing ear. In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure for man, and
a source of glory, of bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer and
gladness unto him. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in this
Most Great Prison.</p>

Divinity, Godhead and the like. Were a man of insight to direct his
gaze towards the blessed, the manifest Lote-Tree and its fruits, he

uttered from the throne of Revelation.</p>

the truth of whatsoever hath streamed forth from the Most Exalted
Pen. If ye be of the people of the Bayán, the Persian Bayán will
guide you aright and will prove a sufficient testimony unto you; and
if ye be of the people of the Qur’án, ponder ye upon the
Revelation on Sinai and the Voice from the Bush which came unto the
Son of ‘Imrán [Moses].</p>

<p id='5.17' data-ref='tb_en-5-p17'>
Gracious God! It was intended that at the time of the manifestation
of the One true God the faculty of recognizing Him would have been
developed and matured and would have reached its culmination.
However, it is now clearly demonstrated that in the disbelievers this
faculty hath remained undeveloped and hath, indeed, degenerated.</p>

<p id='5.18' data-ref='tb_en-5-p18'>
O ‘Alí! That which they accepted from the Bush they now refuse to
accept from Him Who is the Tree of the world of existence. Say, O
people of the Bayán, speak not according to the dictates of passion
and selfish desire. Most of the peoples of the earth attest the truth
of the blessed Word which hath come forth from the Bush.</p>

<p id='5.19' data-ref='tb_en-5-p19'>
By the righteousness of God! But for the anthem of praise voiced by
Him Who heralded the divine Revelation, this Wronged One would never
have breathed a word which might have struck terror into the hearts
of the ignorant and caused them to perish. Dwelling on the
glorification of Him Whom God shall make manifest — exalted be His
Manifestation — the Báb in the beginning of the Bayán saith: “He
is the One Who shall proclaim under all conditions, “Verily,
verily, I am God, no God is there but Me, the Lord of all created
things. In truth all others except Me are My creatures. O, My
creatures! Me alone do ye worship.’” Likewise in another instance
He, magnifying the Name of Him Who shall be made manifest, saith: “I
would be the first to adore Him.” Now it behooveth one to reflect
upon the significance of the “Adorer” and the “Adored One,”
that perchance the people of the earth may partake of a dewdrop from
the ocean of divine knowledge and may be enabled to perceive the
greatness of this Revelation. Verily, He hath appeared and hath
unloosed His tongue to proclaim the Truth. Well is it with him who
doth acknowledge and recognize the truth, and woe betide the froward
and the wayward.</p>

<p id='5.20' data-ref='tb_en-5-p20'>
O kindreds of the earth! Incline your ears unto the Voice from the
divine Lote-Tree which overshadoweth the world and be not of the
people of tyranny on earth — men who have repudiated the
Manifestation of God and His invincible authority and have renounced
His favors — they in truth are reckoned with the contemptible in the
Book of God, the Lord of all mankind.</p>

<p id='5.21' data-ref='tb_en-5-p21'>

Upon thee be the praise of God and His glory. Say: Honesty, virtue,
wisdom and a saintly character redound to the exaltation of man,
while dishonesty, imposture, ignorance and hypocrisy lead to his
abasement. By My life! Man’s distinction lieth not in ornaments or
wealth, but rather in virtuous behavior and true understanding. Most
of the people in Persia are steeped in deception and idle fancy. How
great the difference between the condition of these people and the
station of such valiant souls as have passed beyond the sea of names
and pitched their tents upon the shores of the ocean of detachment.
Indeed none but a few of the existing generation hath yet earned the
merit of hearkening unto the warblings of the doves of the

single drop of the sea of delusion as preferable to an ocean of

O thou who hast turned thy gaze towards My face! In these days there
occurred that which hath plunged Me into dire sadness. Certain
wrong-doers who profess allegiance to the Cause of God committed such
deeds as have caused the limbs of sincerity, of honesty, of justice,
of equity to quake. One known individual to whom the utmost kindness
and favor had been extended perpetrated such acts as have brought
tears to the eye of God. Formerly We uttered words of warning and
premonition, then for a number of years We kept the matter secret
that haply he might take heed and repent. But all to no purpose. In
the end he bent his energies upon vilifying the Cause of God before
the eyes of all men. He tore the veil of fairness asunder and felt
sympathy neither for himself nor for the Cause of God. Now, however,
the deeds of certain individuals have brought sorrows far more
grievous than those which the deeds of the former had caused. Beseech
thou God, the True One, that He may graciously enable the heedless to
retract and repent. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Bountiful, the
Most Generous.</p>

In brief, dissensions among various sects have opened the way to
weakness. Each sect hath picked out a way for itself and is clinging
to a certain cord. Despite manifest blindness and ignorance they
pride themselves on their insight and knowledge. Among them are
mystics who bear allegiance to the Faith of Islám, some of whom
indulge in that which leadeth to idleness and seclusion. I swear by
God! It lowereth man’s station and maketh him swell with pride. Man
must bring forth fruit. One who yieldeth no fruit is, in the words of
the Spirit, <a data-fnid='6.3'></a>  like unto a

That which the aforesaid persons have mentioned concerning the
stations of Divine Unity will conduce in no small measure to idleness
and vain imaginings. These mortal men have evidently set aside the
differences of station and have come to regard themselves as God,
while God is immeasurably exalted above all things. Every created
being however revealeth His signs which are but emanations from Him
and not His Own Self. All these signs are reflected and can be seen
in the book of existence, and the scrolls that depict the shape and
pattern of the universe are indeed a most great book. Therein every
man of insight can perceive that which would lead to the Straight
Path and would enable him to attain the Great Announcement. Consider
the rays of the sun whose light hath encompassed the world. The rays
emanate from the sun and reveal its nature, but are not the sun
itself. Whatsoever can be discerned on earth amply demonstrateth the
power of God, His knowledge and the outpourings of His bounty, while
He Himself is immeasurably exalted above all creatures.</p>

a Tablet to a man of wisdom who had made enquiry as to the meaning of
Elementary Reality, We addressed this famous sage in these words: “If
this saying is truly thine, how is it that thou hast failed to
hearken unto the Call which the Tree of Man hath raised from the
loftiest heights of the world? If thou didst hear the Call yet fear
and the desire to preserve thy life prompted thee to remain heedless
to it, thou art such a person as hath never been nor is worthy of
mention; if thou hast not heard it, then thou art bereft of the sense
of hearing.” In brief, such men are they whose words are the pride

the rulers, the divines and the wise, and enjoineth them to uphold
the cause of religion, and to cleave unto it. Religion is verily the
chief instrument for the establishment of order in the world and of
tranquility amongst its peoples. The weakening of the pillars of
religion hath strengthened the foolish and emboldened them and made
them more arrogant. Verily I say: The greater the decline of

justice, choose thou for thy neighbor that which thou choosest for

Omniscient. Through it the loftiness of man’s station is made
manifest and evident. It is all-knowing and the foremost Teacher in
the school of existence. It is the Guide and is invested with high
distinction. Thanks to its educating influence earthly beings have
become imbued with a gem-like spirit which outshineth the heavens. In
the city of justice it is the unrivalled Speaker Who, in the year
nine, illumined the world with the joyful tidings of this Revelation.
And it was this peerless Source of wisdom that at the beginning of
the foundation of the world ascended the stair of inner meaning and
when enthroned upon the pulpit of utterance, through the operation of
the divine Will, proclaimed two words. The first heralded the promise
of reward, while the second voiced the ominous warning of punishment.
The promise gave rise to hope and the warning begat fear. Thus the
basis of world order hath been firmly established upon these twin

a thing is carried to excess, it will prove a source of evil.
Consider the civilization of the West, how it hath agitated and
alarmed the peoples of the world. An infernal engine hath been
devised, and hath proved so cruel a weapon of destruction that its
like none hath ever witnessed or heard. The purging of such
deeply-rooted and overwhelming corruptions cannot be effected unless
the peoples of the world unite in pursuit of one common aim and
embrace one universal faith. Incline your ears unto the Call of this
Wronged One and adhere firmly to the Lesser Peace.</p>

<p id='6.31' data-ref='tb_en-6-p31'>
Strange and astonishing things exist in the earth but they are hidden
from the minds and the understanding of men. These things are capable

moveth at his command. Immeasurably exalted is the Lord of Power Who
hath laid bare that which He purposed through the potency of His
weighty and invincible command.</p>

<p id='6.32' data-ref='tb_en-6-p32'>
O people of Bahá! Each one of the ordinances We have revealed is a
mighty stronghold for the preservation of the world of being. Verily,

<p id='6.33' data-ref='tb_en-6-p33'>
We exhort the men of the House of Justice and command them to ensure

tribulations as neither the followers of former religions nor the
divines of Persia did ever inflict.</p>

<p id='6.35' data-ref='tb_en-6-p35'>
We have said: “My imprisonment doeth Me no harm, nor do the things
that have befallen Me at the hands of My enemies. That which harmeth
Me is the conduct of my loved ones who, though they bear My name, yet
commit that which maketh My heart and My pen to lament.” Such
utterances as these have again and again been revealed, yet the
heedless have failed to profit thereby, since they are captive to
their own evil passions and corrupt desires. Beseech thou the One
true God that He may enable everyone to repent and return unto Him.
So long as one’s nature yieldeth unto evil passions, crime and
transgression will prevail. We cherish the hope that the hand of
divine power and the outpouring of heavenly blessings may sustain all
men, may attire them with the vesture of forgiveness and bounty and
guard them against that which would harm His Cause among His
servants. He is, in truth, the Potent, the All-Powerful, and He is

understanding to observe that which will cause joy and radiance. Such
practices as are sprung from the loins of idle fancy or are begotten
of the womb of superstition ill beseem men of knowledge. In former
times and more recently some people have been taking up their abodes
in the caves of the mountains while others have repaired to
graveyards at night. Say, give ear unto the counsels of this Wronged

faithful Counselor biddeth you. Deprive not yourselves of the
bounties which have been created for your sake.</p>

Were anyone to ponder in his heart that which hath, in this

hath rather been to attract the souls, through the sublimity of His
words, unto the summit of transcendent glory and to endow them with
the capacity of perceiving that which will purge and purify the
peoples of the world from the strife and dissension which religious
differences provoke. Unto this bear witness My heart, My Pen, My

treasuries latent within their own beings.</p>

<p id='6.41' data-ref='tb_en-6-p41'>
Under all conditions, whether in adversity or at ease, whether
honored or afflicted, this Wronged One hath directed all men to show
forth love, affection, compassion and harmony. And yet whenever there
was any slight evidence of progress and advancement, those concealed
behind the veils would sally forth and utter calumnies more wounding
than the sword. They cling unto misleading and reprehensible words

If these obstructing veils had not intervened Persia would, in some
two years, have been subdued through the power of utterance, the

at other times by allusion, We said whatever had to be said. Thus,
once Persia had been rehabilitated, the sweet savors of the Word of
God would have wafted over all countries, inasmuch as that which hath
streamed forth from the Most Exalted Pen is conducive to the glory,

Ordainer, the Ancient of Days. This is the Day wherein the divine
Lote-Tree calleth aloud, saying: O people! Behold ye My fruits and My
leaves, incline then your ears unto My rustling. Beware lest the
doubts of men debar you from the light of certitude. The Ocean of
utterance exclaimeth and saith: “O ye dwellers on the earth! Behold
My billowing waters and the pearls of wisdom and utterance which I
have poured forth. Fear ye God and be not of the heedless.”</p>

In this Day a great festival is taking place in the Realm above; for
whatsoever was promised in the sacred Scriptures hath been fulfilled.
This is the Day of great rejoicing. It behooveth everyone to hasten
towards the court of His nearness with exceeding joy, gladness,
exultation and delight and to deliver himself from the fire of
remoteness.</p>

O people of Tár! Through the strengthening power of My Name seize ye

signs which have pervaded all that are in heaven and on earth.</p>

The disbelievers among the people of the Bayán are like the

truth accounted with the lost in the Book of God, the All-Knowing,
the All-Wise. The <u>Sh</u>í‘ih divines, one and all, are now
engaged in reviling and denouncing the True One from their pulpits.
Gracious God! Dawlat-Ábádí <a data-fnid='6.10'></a>

which hath caused the Tablet to cry out in anguish and the Pen to
wail. Meditate upon his conduct and the conduct of A<u>sh</u>raf <a data-fnid='6.11'></a>  — upon

The Great Announcement proclaimeth: O people of Persia! In former
times ye have been the symbols of mercy and the embodiments of
affection and kindliness. The regions of the world were illumined and
embellished by the brightness of the light of your knowledge and by
the blaze of your erudition. How is it that you have arisen to
destroy yourselves and your friends with your own hands?</p>

<p id='7.4' data-ref='tb_en-7-p4'>
O Afnán, O thou that has branched from Mine ancient Stock! My glory
and My loving-kindness rest upon thee. How vast is the tabernacle of
the Cause of God! It hath overshadowed all the peoples and kindreds
of the earth, and will, ere long, gather together the whole of
mankind beneath its shelter. Thy day of service is now come.
Countless Tablets bear the testimony of the bounties vouchsafed unto
thee. Arise for the triumph of My Cause, and, through the power of
thine utterance, subdue the hearts of men. Thou must show forth that
which will ensure the peace and the well-being of the miserable and
the downtrodden. Gird up the loins of thine endeavor, that perchance
thou mayest release the captive from his chains, and enable him to
attain unto true liberty.</p>

Justice is, in this day, bewailing its plight, and Equity groaneth
beneath the yoke of oppression. The thick clouds of tyranny have
darkened the face of the earth, and enveloped its peoples. Through
the movement of Our Pen of glory We have, at the bidding of the
omnipotent Ordainer, breathed a new life into every human frame, and
instilled into every word a fresh potency. All created things
proclaim the evidences of this worldwide regeneration. This is the
most great, the most joyful tidings imparted by the Pen of this
Wronged One to mankind. Wherefore fear ye, O My well-beloved ones?
Who is it that can dismay you? A touch of moisture sufficeth to
dissolve the hardened clay out of which this perverse generation is
molded. The mere act of your gathering together is enough to scatter
the forces of these vain and worthless people.</p>

<p id='7.6' data-ref='tb_en-7-p6'>
Strife and conflict befit the beasts of the wild. It was through the
grace of God and with the aid of seemly words and praiseworthy deeds
that the unsheathed swords of the Bábí community were returned to
their scabbards. Indeed through the power of good words, the
righteous have always succeeded in winning command over the meads of
the hearts of men. Say, O ye loved ones! Do not forsake prudence.
Incline your hearts to the counsels given by the Most Exalted Pen and
beware lest your hands or tongues cause harm unto anyone among
mankind.</p>

Referring to the land of Ṭá [Ṭihrán] We have revealed in the

O thou who hast quaffed from the wine of Mine utterance and hast
fixed thy gaze upon the horizon of My Revelation! How strange that
the people of Persia, who were unrivalled in sciences and arts,
should have sunk to the lowest level of degradation among the
kindreds of the earth. O people! In this blessed, this glorious Day,
deprive not yourselves of the liberal effusions of bounty which the
Lord of abounding grace hath vouchsafed unto you. In this Day showers
of wisdom and utterance are pouring down from the clouds of divine
mercy. Well is it with them who judge His Cause with fairness, and
woe betide the unjust.</p>

<p id='7.9' data-ref='tb_en-7-p9'>
Every man of insight will, in this day, readily admit that the
counsels which the Pen of this Wronged One hath revealed constitute
the supreme animating power for the advancement of the world and the
exaltation of its peoples. Arise, O people, and, by the power of
God’s might, resolve to gain the victory over your own selves, that
haply the whole earth may be freed and sanctified from its servitude
to the gods of its idle fancies — gods that have inflicted such loss
upon, and are responsible for the misery of their wretched
worshippers. These idols form the obstacle that impedeth man in his
efforts to advance in the path of perfection. We cherish the hope
that the Hand of divine power may lend its assistance to mankind and
deliver it from its state of grievous abasement.</p>

<p id='7.10' data-ref='tb_en-7-p10'>
In one of the Tablets these words have been revealed: O people of
God! Do not busy yourselves in your own concerns; let your thoughts
be fixed upon that which will rehabilitate the fortunes of mankind
and sanctify the hearts and souls of men. This can best be achieved
through pure and holy deeds, through a virtuous life and a goodly
behavior. Valiant acts will ensure the triumph of this Cause, and a
saintly character will reinforce its power. Cleave unto
righteousness, O people of Bahá! This, verily, is the commandment
which this Wronged One hath given unto you, and the first choice of
His unrestrained Will for every one of you.</p>

<p id='7.11' data-ref='tb_en-7-p11'>
O friends! It behooveth you to refresh and revive your souls through
the gracious favors which in this Divine, this soul-stirring
Springtime are being showered upon you. The Daystar of His great
glory hath shed its radiance upon you, and the clouds of His
limitless grace have overshadowed you. How high the reward of him
that hath not deprived himself of so great a bounty, nor failed to
recognize the beauty of his Best-Beloved in this, His new attire.
Watch over yourselves, for the Evil One is lying in wait, ready to
entrap you. Gird yourselves against his wicked devices, and, led by
the light of the name of the All-Seeing God, make your escape from
the darkness that surroundeth you. Let your vision be
world-embracing, rather than confined to your own self. The Evil One
is he that hindereth the rise and obstructeth the spiritual progress
of the children of men.</p>

<p id='7.12' data-ref='tb_en-7-p12'>
It is incumbent upon every man, in this Day, to hold fast unto
whatsoever will promote the interests, and exalt the station, of all
nations and just governments. Through each and every one of the
verses which the Pen of the Most High hath revealed, the doors of
love and unity have been unlocked and flung open to the face of men.
We have erewhile declared — and Our Word is the truth — : “Consort
with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and
fellowship.” Whatsoever hath led the children of men to shun one
another, and hath caused dissensions and divisions amongst them,
hath, through the revelation of these words, been nullified and
abolished. From the heaven of God’s Will, and for the purpose of
ennobling the world of being and of elevating the minds and souls of
men, hath been sent down that which is the most effective instrument
for the education of the whole human race. The highest essence and
most perfect expression of whatsoever the peoples of old have either
said or written hath, through this most potent Revelation, been sent
down from the heaven of the Will of the All-Possessing, the
Ever-Abiding God. Of old it hath been revealed: “Love of one’s
country is an element of the Faith of God.” The Tongue of Grandeur
hath, however, in the day of His manifestation proclaimed: “It is
not his to boast who loveth his country, but it is his who loveth the
world.” Through the power released by these exalted words He hath
lent a fresh impulse and set a new direction to the birds of men’s
hearts, and hath obliterated every trace of restriction and
limitation from God’s holy Book.</p>

<p id='7.13' data-ref='tb_en-7-p13'>
This Wronged One hath forbidden the people of God to engage in
contention or conflict and hath exhorted them to righteous deeds and
praiseworthy character. In this day the hosts that can ensure the
victory of the Cause are those of goodly conduct and saintly
character. Blessed are they who firmly adhere unto them and woe
betide such as turn away therefrom.</p>

<p id='7.14' data-ref='tb_en-7-p14'>
O people of God! I admonish you to observe courtesy, for above all
else it is the prince of virtues. Well is it with him who is
illumined with the light of courtesy and is attired with the vesture
of uprightness. Whoso is endued with courtesy hath indeed attained a
sublime station. It is hoped that this Wronged One and everyone else
may be enabled to acquire it, hold fast unto it, observe it, and fix
our gaze upon it. This is a binding command which hath streamed forth
from the Pen of the Most Great Name.</p>

<p id='7.15' data-ref='tb_en-7-p15'>
This is the day when the gems of constancy that lie hid in the mine
of men’s inner selves should be made manifest. O people of Justice!
Be as brilliant as the light and as splendid as the fire that blazed
in the Burning Bush. The brightness of the fire of your love will no
doubt fuse and unify the contending peoples and kindreds of the
earth, whilst the fierceness of the flame of enmity and hatred cannot
but result in strife and ruin. We beseech God that He may shield His
creatures from the evil designs of His enemies. He verily hath power
over all things.</p>

<p id='7.16' data-ref='tb_en-7-p16'>
All praise be to the one true God — exalted be His glory — inasmuch
as He hath, through the Pen of the Most High, unlocked the doors of
men’s hearts. Every verse which this Pen hath revealed is a bright
and shining portal that discloseth the glories of a saintly and pious
life, of pure and stainless deeds. The summons and the message which
We gave were never intended to reach or to benefit one land or one
people only. Mankind in its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever
hath been revealed and vouchsafed unto it. Then and only then will it
attain unto true liberty. The whole earth is illuminated with the
resplendent glory of God’s Revelation. In the year sixty He Who
heralded the light of Divine Guidance — may all creation be a
sacrifice unto Him — arose to announce a fresh revelation of the
Divine Spirit, and was followed, twenty years later, by Him through
Whose coming the world was made the recipient of this promised glory,
this wondrous favor. Behold how the generality of mankind hath been
endued with the capacity to hearken unto God’s most exalted
Word — the Word upon which must depend the gathering together and
spiritual resurrection of all men.</p>

<p id='7.17' data-ref='tb_en-7-p17'>
Whilst in the Prison of ‘Akká, We revealed in the Crimson Book that
which is conducive to the advancement of mankind and to the
reconstruction of the world. The utterances set forth therein by the
Pen of the Lord of creation include the following which constitute
the fundamental principles for the administration of the affairs of
men:</p>

<p id='7.18' data-ref='tb_en-7-p18'>
First: It is incumbent upon the ministers of the House of Justice to
promote the Lesser Peace so that the people of the earth may be
relieved from the burden of exorbitant expenditures. This matter is
imperative and absolutely essential, inasmuch as hostilities and
conflict lie at the root of affliction and calamity.</p>

<p id='7.19' data-ref='tb_en-7-p19'>
Second: Languages must be reduced to one common language to be taught
in all the schools of the world.</p>

<p id='7.20' data-ref='tb_en-7-p20'>
Third: It behooveth man to adhere tenaciously unto that which will
promote fellowship, kindliness and unity.</p>

<p id='7.21' data-ref='tb_en-7-p21'>
Fourth: Everyone, whether man or woman, should hand over to a trusted
person a portion of what he or she earneth through trade, agriculture
or other occupation, for the training and education of children, to
be spent for this purpose with the knowledge of the Trustees of the
House of Justice.</p>

<p id='7.22' data-ref='tb_en-7-p22'>
Fifth: Special regard must be paid to agriculture. Although it hath
been mentioned in the fifth place, unquestionably it precedeth the
others. Agriculture is highly developed in foreign lands, however in
Persia it hath so far been grievously neglected. It is hoped that His
Majesty the <u>Sh</u>áh — may God assist him by His grace — will
turn his attention to this vital and important matter.</p>

<p id='7.23' data-ref='tb_en-7-p23'>
Were men to strictly observe that which the Pen of the Most High hath
revealed in the Crimson Book, they could then well afford to dispense
with the regulations which prevail in the world. Certain exhortations
have repeatedly streamed forth from the Pen of the Most High that
perchance the manifestations of power and the dawning-places of might
may, sometime, be enabled to enforce them. Indeed, were sincere
seekers to be found, every emanation of God’s pervasive and
irresistible Will would, for the sake of His love, be revealed. But
where are to be found earnest seekers and inquiring minds? Whither
are gone the equitable and the fair-minded? At present no day passeth
without the fire of a fresh tyranny blazing fiercely, or the sword of
a new aggression being unsheathed. Gracious God! The great and the
noble in Persia glory in acts of such savagery that one is lost in
amazement at the tales thereof.</p>

<p id='7.24' data-ref='tb_en-7-p24'>
Day and night this Wronged One yieldeth thanks and praise unto the
Lord of men, for it is witnessed that the words of counsel and
exhortation We uttered have proved effective and that this people
hath evinced such character and conduct as are acceptable in Our
sight. This is affirmed by virtue of the event which hath truly
cheered the eye of the world, and is none other than the intercession
of the friends with the high authorities in favor of their enemies.
Indeed one’s righteous deeds testify to the truth of one’s words.
We cherish the hope that men of piety may illumine the world through
the radiant light of their conduct, and We entreat the
Almighty — glorified and exalted is He — to grant that everyone may
in this Day remain steadfast in His love and stand firm in His Cause.
He is, in truth, the Protector of those who are wholly devoted to Him
and observe His precepts.</p>

<p id='7.25' data-ref='tb_en-7-p25'>
O people of God! Countless are the realms which Our Pen of Glory hath
revealed and manifold the eyes to which it hath imparted true
enlightenment. Yet most of the people in Persia continue to be
deprived of the benefits of profitable counsels and remain sorely
lacking in useful sciences and arts. Formerly these sublime words
were especially revealed by the Pen of Glory in honor of one of the
faithful, that perchance those that have gone astray may embrace the
Truth and become acquainted with the subtleties of the Law of God.</p>

<p id='7.26' data-ref='tb_en-7-p26'>
The unbelievers and the faithless have set their minds on four
things: first, the shedding of blood; second, the burning of books;
third, the shunning of the followers of other religions; fourth, the
extermination of other communities and groups. Now however, through
the strengthening grace and potency of the Word of God these four
barriers have been demolished, these clear injunctions have been
obliterated from the Tablet and brutal dispositions have been
transmuted into spiritual attributes. Exalted is His purpose;
glorified is His power; magnified is His dominion! Now let us beseech
God — praised be His glory — to graciously guide aright the followers
of the <u>Sh</u>í‘ih sect and to purge them of unseemly conduct.
From the lips of the members of this sect foul imprecations fall
unceasingly, while they invoke the word “Mal‘ún”
(accursed) — uttered with a guttural sound of the letter ‘ayn — as
their daily relish.</p>

<p id='7.27' data-ref='tb_en-7-p27'>
O God my God! Thou hearest the sighing of Him Who is Thy Light
(Bahá), hearkenest unto His lamentations in the daytime and in the
night season and knowest that He desireth naught for Himself but
rather seeketh to sanctify the souls of Thy servants and to deliver
them from the fire with which they are beset at all times. O Lord!
The hands of Thy well-favored servants are raised towards the heaven
of Thy bounty and those of Thy sincere lovers are lifted up to the
sublime heights of Thy generosity. Disappoint them not, I entreat
Thee, in that which they seek from the ocean of Thy favor and from
the heaven of Thy grace and the daystar of Thy bounty. Aid them, O
Lord, to acquire such virtues as will exalt their stations among the
peoples of the world. Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty, the
Most Generous.</p>

<p id='7.28' data-ref='tb_en-7-p28'>
O people of God! Give ear unto that which, if heeded, will ensure the
freedom, well-being, tranquility, exaltation and advancement of all
men. Certain laws and principles are necessary and indispensable for
Persia. However, it is fitting that these measures should be adopted
in conformity with the considered views of His Majesty — may God aid
him through His grace — and of the learned divines and of the
high-ranking rulers. Subject to their approval a place should be
fixed where they would meet. There they should hold fast to the cord
of consultation and adopt and enforce that which is conducive to the
security, prosperity, wealth and tranquility of the people. For were
any measure other than this to be adopted, it could not but result in
chaos and commotion.</p>

<p id='7.29' data-ref='tb_en-7-p29'>
According to the fundamental laws which We have formerly revealed in
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and other Tablets, all affairs are committed to
the care of just kings and presidents and of the Trustees of the
House of Justice. Having pondered on that which We have enunciated,
every man of equity and discernment will readily perceive, with his
inner and outer eyes, the splendors of the daystar of justice which
radiate therefrom.</p>

<p id='7.30' data-ref='tb_en-7-p30'>
The system of government which the British people have adopted in
London appeareth to be good, for it is adorned with the light of both
kingship and of the consultation of the people.</p>

<p id='7.31' data-ref='tb_en-7-p31'>
In formulating the principles and laws a part hath been devoted to
penalties which form an effective instrument for the security and
protection of men. However, dread of the penalties maketh people
desist only outwardly from committing vile and contemptible deeds,
while that which guardeth and restraineth man both outwardly and
inwardly hath been and still is the fear of God. It is man’s true
protector and his spiritual guardian. It behooveth him to cleave
tenaciously unto that which will lead to the appearance of this
supreme bounty. Well is it with him who giveth ear unto whatsoever My
Pen of Glory hath proclaimed and observeth that whereunto he is
bidden by the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days.</p>

<p id='7.32' data-ref='tb_en-7-p32'>
Incline your hearts, O people of God, unto the counsels of your true,
your incomparable Friend. The Word of God may be likened unto a
sapling, whose roots have been implanted in the hearts of men. It is
incumbent upon you to foster its growth through the living waters of
wisdom, of sanctified and holy words, so that its root may become
firmly fixed and its branches may spread out as high as the heavens
and beyond.</p>

<p id='7.33' data-ref='tb_en-7-p33'>
O ye that dwell on earth! The distinguishing feature that marketh the
preeminent character of this Supreme Revelation consisteth in that We
have, on the one hand, blotted out from the pages of God’s holy
Book whatsoever hath been the cause of strife, of malice and mischief
amongst the children of men, and have, on the other, laid down the
essential prerequisites of concord, of understanding, of complete and
enduring unity. Well is it with them that keep My statutes.</p>

<p id='7.34' data-ref='tb_en-7-p34'>
Time and again have We admonished Our beloved ones to avoid, nay to
flee from, anything whatsoever from which the odor of mischief can be
detected. The world is in great turmoil, and the minds of its people
are in a state of utter confusion. We entreat the Almighty that He
may graciously illuminate them with the glory of His Justice, and
enable them to discover that which will be profitable unto them at
all times and under all conditions. He, verily is the All-Possessing,
the Most High.</p>

<p id='7.35' data-ref='tb_en-7-p35'>
We have ere this uttered these sublime words: Let them that bear
allegiance to this Wronged One be even as a raining cloud in moments
of charity and benevolence and as a blazing fire in restraining their
base and appetitive natures.</p>

<p id='7.36' data-ref='tb_en-7-p36'>
Gracious God! A thing hath recently happened which caused great
astonishment. It is reported that a certain person <a data-fnid='7.3'></a>
went to the seat of the imperial throne in Persia and succeeded in
winning the good graces of some of the nobility by his ingratiating
behavior. How pitiful indeed, how deplorable! One wondereth why those
who have been the symbols of highest glory should now stoop to
boundless shame. What is become of their high resolve? Whither is
gone the sense of dignity and honor? The sun of glory and wisdom hath
unceasingly been shining above the horizon of Persia, but nowadays it
hath sunk to such a low level that certain dignitaries have allowed
themselves to be treated as playthings in the hands of the foolish.
The aforesaid person hath written such things concerning this people
in the Egyptian press and in the Beirut Encyclopedia that the
well-informed and the learned were astonished. He proceeded then to
Paris where he published a newspaper entitled <i>‘Urvatu’l-Vu<u>th</u>qá</i>
[The Sure Handle] and sent copies thereof to all parts of the world.
He also sent a copy to the Prison of ‘Akká, and by so doing he
meant to show affection and to make amends for his past actions. In
short, this Wronged One hath observed silence in regard to him. We
entreat God, the True One, to protect him and to shed upon him the
light of justice and fairness. It behooveth him to say:</p>

boundless grace. Thou art in truth the All-Bountiful, the Lord of
grace abounding, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. No God is there but
Thee, the Most Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Omnipotent.</p>

O people of God! In this day everyone should fix his eyes upon the
horizon of these blessed words: “Alone and unaided He doeth
whatsoever He pleaseth.” Whoso attaineth this station hath verily
attained the light of the essential unity of God and is enlightened
thereby, while all others are reckoned in the Book of God among the
followers of idle fancy and vain imagination. Incline your ears to
the Voice of this Wronged One and safeguard the integrity of your
stations. It is highly necessary and imperative that everyone should
observe this matter.</p>

<p id='7.40' data-ref='tb_en-7-p40'>
Unveiled and unconcealed, this Wronged One hath, at all times,
proclaimed before the face of all the peoples of the world that which
will serve as the key for unlocking the doors of sciences, of arts,
of knowledge, of well-being, of prosperity and wealth. Neither have
the wrongs inflicted by the oppressors succeeded in silencing the
shrill voice of the Most Exalted Pen, nor have the doubts of the
perverse or of the seditious been able to hinder Him from revealing
the Most Sublime Word. I earnestly beseech God that He may protect
and purge the people of Bahá from the idle fancies and corrupt
imaginings of the followers of the former Faith.</p>

<p id='7.41' data-ref='tb_en-7-p41'>
O people of God! Righteous men of learning who dedicate themselves to
the guidance of others and are freed and well guarded from the
promptings of a base and covetous nature are, in the sight of Him Who
is the Desire of the world, stars of the heaven of true knowledge. It
is essential to treat them with deference. They are indeed fountains
of soft-flowing water, stars that shine resplendent, fruits of the
blessed Tree, exponents of celestial power, and oceans of heavenly
wisdom. Happy is he that followeth them. Verily such a soul is
numbered in the Book of God, the Lord of the mighty Throne, among
those with whom it shall be well.</p>

<p id='7.42' data-ref='tb_en-7-p42'>
The glory which proceedeth from God, the Lord of the Throne on High
and of the earth below, rest upon you, O people of Bahá, O ye the
companions of the Crimson Ark, and upon such as have inclined their
ears to your sweet voices and have observed that whereunto they are
bidden in this mighty and wondrous Tablet.</p>

  </span>
  <span class='block salutation'>He
is God, exalted is He, the Lord of wisdom and utterance.</span>
  <span class='block dropcap'>
    Praise be unto God, incomparable in majesty, power and beauty,
peerless in glory, might and grandeur; too high is He for human
imaginations to comprehend Him or for any peer or equal to be
ascribed unto Him. He hath clearly set forth His straight Path in
words and utterances of highest eloquence. Verily He is the
All-Possessing, the Most Exalted. When He purposed to call the new
creation into being, He sent forth the Manifest and Luminous Point
from the horizon of His Will; it passed through every sign and
manifested itself in every form until it reached the zenith, as
bidden by God, the Lord of all men.

<p id='8.2' data-ref='tb_en-8-p2'>
This Point is the focal center of the circle of Names and marketh the
culmination of the manifestations of Letters in the world of
creation. Through it have appeared indications of the impenetrable
Mystery, the adorned Symbol, He Who standeth revealed in the Most
Great Name — a Name which is recorded in the luminous Tablet and is
inscribed in the holy, the blessed, the snow-white Scroll. And when
the Point was joined to the second Letter <a data-fnid='8.1'></a>
which appeareth in the beginning of the Ma<u>th</u>ání, <a data-fnid='8.2'></a>
it traversed the heavens of exposition and utterance. Then the
eternal Light of God shed its radiance, flared up in the midmost
heart of the firmament of testimony and produced two Luminaries.
Glorified be the Merciful One, unto Whom no allusion can be made,
Whom no expression can define, nor any assertion reveal, nor any
evidence describe. He is in truth the Ordainer, the All-Bountiful,
both in the beginning and in the end. And He provided for them
protectors and defenders from among the hosts of power and might.
Verily, He is the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Unconstrained.</p>

Praise be unto God Who hath manifested the Point, hath unfolded
therefrom the knowledge of all things, whether of the past or of the
future — a Point He hath chosen to be the Herald of His Name and the
Harbinger of His Great Revelation which hath caused the limbs of all
mankind to quake and the splendor of His light to shine forth above
the horizon of the world. Verily, this is the Point which God hath
ordained to be an ocean of light for the sincere among His servants
and a flame of fire to the froward amidst His creatures and the
impious among His people — they who bartered away the gift of God for
unbelief, and the celestial food for hypocrisy, and led their
associates to a wretched abode. These are the people who have
manifested sedition throughout the world and have violated His
Covenant on the Day when the immortal Being mounted His throne and
the Crier raised His Voice from the haven of security and peace in
the holy Vale.</p>

This is the Point of the Bayán calling aloud before the Throne,
saying: “By the righteousness of God, ye have been created to
glorify this Most Great Announcement, this Perfect Way which lay hid
within the souls of the Prophets, which was treasured in the hearts
of the chosen ones of God and was written down by the glorious Pen of
your Lord, the Possessor of Names.”</p>

Say: Die in your wrath, O malicious ones! Verily He Whose knowledge
nothing escapeth hath appeared. He Who hath caused the countenance of
divine knowledge to be wreathed in smiles is come. Through Him the
kingdom of utterance is embellished, every receptive soul hath set
his face towards the Lord of Revelations, everyone resting on his
knees hath stood up, and every indolent one hath rushed forth to
attain the Sinai of assurance. This is the Day that God hath ordained
to be a blessing unto the righteous, a retribution for the wicked, a
bounty for the faithful and a fury of His wrath for the faithless and
the froward. Verily He hath been made manifest, invested by God with
invincible sovereignty. He hath revealed that wherewith naught on the
earth or in the heavens can compare.</p>

<p id='8.7' data-ref='tb_en-8-p7'>
Fear ye the All-Merciful, O people of the Bayán, and commit not that
which the followers of the Qur’án have committed — they who in the
daytime and in the night season professed belief in the Faith of God,
yet when the Lord of all men did appear, turned aside from Him and
pronounced so cruel a sentence against Him that, on the Day of
Return, the Mother Book sorely bewailed His plight. Call ye to mind
and ponder upon their deeds and words, their stations and merits and
the things they brought to pass when He Who conversed on Sinai
unloosed His tongue, when there was a blast on the Trumpet, whereupon
all that are in heaven and on earth swooned away except such as are
reckoned among the letters of affirmation.</p>

<p id='8.8' data-ref='tb_en-8-p8'>
O people of the Bayán! Abandon your idle fancies and vain
imaginings, then with the eye of fairness look at the Dayspring of
His Revelation and consider the things He hath manifested, the words
He hath divinely revealed and the sufferings that have befallen Him
at the hands of His enemies. He is the One Who hath willingly
accepted every manner of tribulation for the proclamation of His
Cause and the exaltation of His Word. At one time He suffered
imprisonment in the land of Ṭá (Ṭihrán), at another in the land
of Mím (Mázindarán), then once again in the former land, for the
sake of the Cause of God, the Maker of the heavens. In His love for
the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful, He was subjected
there to chains and fetters.</p>

O people of the Bayán! Have ye forgotten My exhortations, which My
Pen hath revealed and My tongue hath uttered? Have ye bartered away
My certitude in exchange for your idle fancies and My Way for your
selfish desires? Have ye cast away the precepts of God and His
remembrance and have ye forsaken His laws and ordinances? Fear ye God
and abandon vain imaginings to the begetters thereof and leave
superstitions to the devisers thereof and misgivings to the breeders
thereof. Advance ye then with radiant faces and stainless hearts
towards the horizon above which the Daystar of certitude shineth
resplendent at the bidding of God, the Lord of Revelations.</p>

Praise be unto God Who hath made the Most Great Infallibility the
shield for the temple of His Cause in the realm of creation, and hath
assigned unto no one a share of this lofty and sublime station — a
station which is a vesture which the fingers of transcendent power
have woven for His august Self. It befitteth no one except Him Who is
seated upon the mighty throne of “He doeth what He pleaseth.”
Whoso accepteth and recognizeth that which is written down at this
moment by the Pen of Glory is indeed reckoned in the Book of God, the
Lord of the beginning and the end, among the exponents of divine
unity, they that uphold the concept of the oneness of God.</p>

<p id='8.11' data-ref='tb_en-8-p11'>
When the stream of words reached this stage, the sweet savors of true
knowledge were shed abroad and the daystar of divine unity shone
forth above the horizon of His holy utterance. Blessed is he whom His
Call hath attracted to the summit of glory, who hath drawn nigh to
the ultimate Purpose, and who hath recognized through the shrill
voice of My Pen of Glory that which the Lord of this world and of the
next hath willed. Whoso faileth to quaff the choice wine which We
have unsealed through the potency of Our Name, the All-Compelling,
shall be unable to discern the splendors of the light of divine unity
or to grasp the essential purpose underlying the Scriptures of God,
the Lord of heaven and earth, the sovereign Ruler of this world and
of the world to come. Such a man shall be accounted among the
faithless in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p id='8.12' data-ref='tb_en-8-p12'>
O thou honored inquirer! <a data-fnid='8.6'></a>
We bear witness that thou didst firmly adhere unto seemly patience
during the days when the Pen was held back from movement and the
Tongue hesitated to set forth an explanation regarding the wondrous
sign, the Most Great Infallibility. Thou hast asked this Wronged One
to remove for thee its veils and coverings, to elucidate its mystery
and character, its state and position, its excellence, sublimity and
exaltation. By the life of God! Were We to unveil the pearls of
testimony which lie hid within the shells of the ocean of knowledge
and assurance or to let the beauties of divine mystery which are
hidden within the chambers of utterance in the Paradise of true
understanding, step out of their habitation, then from every
direction violent commotion would arise among the leaders of religion
and thou wouldst witness the people of God held fast in the teeth of
such wolves as have denied God both in the beginning and in the end.
Therefore We restrained the Pen for a considerable lapse of time in
accordance with divine wisdom and for the sake of protecting the
faithful from those who have bartered away heavenly blessings for
disbelief and have chosen for their people the abode of perdition. <a data-fnid='8.7'></a>

O thou seeker who art gifted with keen insight. I swear by Him Who
attracted the Concourse on High through the potency of His most
sublime Word! Verily, the birds abiding within the domains of My
Kingdom and the doves dwelling in the rose-garden of My wisdom utter
such melodies and warblings as are inscrutable to all but God, the
Lord of the kingdoms of earth and heaven; and were these melodies to
be revealed even to an extent smaller than a needle’s eye, the
people of tyranny would utter such calumnies as none among former
generations hath ever uttered, and would commit such deeds as no one
in past ages and centuries hath ever committed. They have rejected
the bounty of God and His proofs and have repudiated the testimony of
God and His signs. They have gone astray and have caused the people
to go astray, yet perceive it not. They worship vain imaginings but
know it not. They have taken idle fancies for their lords and have
neglected God, yet understand not. They have abandoned the most great
Ocean and are hastening towards the pool, but comprehend not. They
follow their own idle fancies while turning aside from God, the Help
in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

Say, by the righteousness of God! The All-Merciful is come invested
with power and sovereignty. Through His power the foundations of
religions have quaked and the Nightingale of Utterance hath warbled
its melody upon the highest branch of true understanding. Verily, He
Who was hidden in the knowledge of God and is mentioned in the Holy
Scriptures hath appeared. Say, this is the Day when the Speaker on
Sinai hath mounted the throne of Revelation and the people have stood
before the Lord of the worlds. This is the Day wherein the earth hath
told out her tidings and hath laid bare her treasures; when the
oceans have brought forth their pearls and the divine Lote-Tree its
fruit; when the Sun hath shed its radiance and the Moons have
diffused their lights, and the Heavens have revealed their stars, and
the Hour its signs, and the Resurrection its dreadful majesty; when
the pens have unloosed their outpourings and the spirits have laid
bare their mysteries. Blessed is the man who recognizeth Him and
attaineth His presence, and woe betide such as deny Him and turn
aside from Him. I beseech God to aid His servants to return unto Him.
Verily He is the Pardoner, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>

O thou who hast set thy face towards the Realm on High and hast
quaffed My sealed wine from the hand of bounteousness! Know thou that
the term “Infallibility” hath numerous meanings and diverse
stations. In one sense it is applicable to the One Whom God hath made
immune from error. Similarly it is applied to every soul whom God
hath guarded against sin, transgression, rebellion, impiety,
disbelief and the like. However, the Most Great Infallibility is
confined to the One Whose station is immeasurably exalted beyond
ordinances or prohibitions and is sanctified from errors and
omissions. Indeed He is a Light which is not followed by darkness and
a Truth not overtaken by error. Were He to pronounce water to be wine
or heaven to be earth or light to be fire, He speaketh the truth and
no doubt would there be about it; and unto no one is given the right
to question His authority or to say why or wherefore. Whosoever
raiseth objections will be numbered with the froward in the Book of
God, the Lord of the worlds. “Verily He shall not be asked of His
doings but all others shall be asked of their doings.” <a data-fnid='8.8'></a>
He is come from the invisible heaven, bearing the banner “He doeth
whatsoever He willeth” and is accompanied by hosts of power and
authority while it is the duty of all besides Him to strictly observe
whatever laws and ordinances have been enjoined upon them, and should
anyone deviate therefrom, even to the extent of a hair’s breadth,
his work would be brought to naught.</p>

And likewise are the daily prayer, fasting, and the laws which shone
forth above the horizon of the Book of God, the Lord of the World and
the true Educator of the peoples and kindreds of the earth. It is
incumbent upon everyone to obey Him in whatsoever God hath ordained;
and whosoever denieth Him hath disbelieved in God, in His verses, in
His Messengers and in His Books. Were He to pronounce right to be
wrong or denial to be belief, He speaketh the truth as bidden by God.
This is a station wherein sins or trespasses neither exist nor are
mentioned. Consider thou the blessed, the divinely revealed verse in
which pilgrimage to the House is enjoined upon everyone. It devolved
upon those invested with authority after Him <a data-fnid='8.11'></a>
to observe whatever had been prescribed unto them in the Book. Unto
no one is given the right to deviate from the laws and ordinances of

conversed with Thee, <a data-fnid='8.15'></a>
saying: “Bring forth thy people from the darkness into the light

Moreover Thou didst proclaim this truth unto the Spirit <a data-fnid='8.17'></a>
and unto Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, whether of the remote or
more recent past. If all that which Thou hast sent down in
glorification of this Most Great Remembrance, this Great
Announcement, were to stream forth from the wellspring of Thy most
august Pen, the inmates of the cities of knowledge and understanding
would be dumbfounded, except such as Thou wouldst deliver through the
potency of Thy might and wouldst protect as a token of Thy bountiful
favor and Thy grace. I bear witness that Thou hast in truth fulfilled
Thy pledge and hast made manifest the One Whose advent was foretold
by Thy Prophets, Thy chosen ones and by them that serve Thee. He hath
come from the heaven of glory and power, bearing the banners of Thy
signs and the standards of Thy testimonies. Through the potency of
Thine indomitable power and strength, He stood up before the faces of
all men and summoned all mankind to the summit of transcendent glory
and unto the all-highest Horizon, in such wise that neither the
oppression of the ecclesiastics nor the onslaught of the rulers was
able to deter Him. He arose with inflexible resolve and, unloosing
His tongue, proclaimed in ringing tones: “He Who is the
All-Bountiful is come, riding aloft on the clouds. Advance, O people
of the earth, with shining faces and radiant hearts!”</p>

O thou who hast set thy face towards the splendors of My Countenance!
Vague fancies have encompassed the dwellers of the earth and debarred
them from turning towards the Horizon of Certitude, and its
brightness, and its manifestations and its lights. Vain imaginings
have withheld them from Him Who is the Self-Subsisting. They speak as
prompted by their own caprices, and understand not. Among them are
those who have said: “Have the verses been sent down?” Say “Yea,
by Him Who is the Lord of the heavens!” “Hath the Hour come?”
“Nay, more; it hath passed, by Him Who is the Revealer of clear
tokens! Verily, the Inevitable is come, and He, the True One, hath
appeared with proof and testimony. The Plain is disclosed, and
mankind is sore vexed and fearful. Earthquakes have broken loose, and
the tribes have lamented, for fear of God, the Lord of Strength, the
All-Compelling.” Say: “The stunning trumpet-blast hath been
loudly raised, and the Day is God’s, the One, the Unconstrained.”
And they say: “Hath the Catastrophe come to pass?” Say: “Yea,
by the Lord of Lords!” “Is the Resurrection come?” “Nay,
more; He Who is the Self-Subsisting hath appeared with the Kingdom of
His signs.” “Seest thou men laid low?” “Yea, by my Lord, the
Most High, the Most Glorious!” “Have the tree-stumps been
uprooted?” “Yea, more; the mountains have been scattered in dust;
by Him the Lord of attributes!” They say: “Where is Paradise, and
where is Hell?” Say: “The one is reunion with Me; the other thine
own self, O thou who dost associate a partner with God and doubtest.”
They say: “We see not the Balance.” Say: “Surely, by my Lord,
the God of Mercy! None can see it except such as are endued with
insight.” They say: “Have the stars fallen?” Say: “Yea, when
He Who is the Self-Subsisting dwelt in the Land of Mystery. <a data-fnid='8.18'></a>
Take heed, ye who are endued with discernment!” All the signs
appeared when We drew forth the Hand of Power from the bosom of
majesty and might. Verily, the Crier hath cried out, when the
promised time came, and they that have recognized the splendors of
Sinai have swooned away in the wilderness of hesitation, before the
awful majesty of thy Lord, the Lord of creation. The trumpet asketh:
“Hath the Bugle been sounded?” Say: “Yea, by the King of
Revelation! when He mounted the throne of His Name, the
All-Merciful.” Darkness hath been chased away by the dawning light
of the mercy of thy Lord, the Source of all light. The breeze of the
All-Merciful hath wafted, and the souls have been quickened in the
tombs of their bodies. Thus hath the decree been fulfilled by God,
the Mighty, the Beneficent. They who reject the truth have said:
“When were the heavens cleft asunder?” Say: “While ye lay in
the graves of waywardness and error.” Among the faithless is he who
rubbeth his eyes, and looketh to the right and to the left. Say:
“Blinded art thou. No refuge hast thou to flee to.” And among
them is he who saith: “Have men been gathered together?” Say:
“Yea, by My Lord! whilst thou didst lie in the cradle of idle
fancies.” And among them is he who saith: “Hath the Book been
sent down through the power of the true Faith?” Say: “The true
Faith itself is astounded. Fear ye, O ye men of understanding heart!”
And among them is he who saith: “Have I been assembled with others,
blind?” Say: “Yea, by Him that rideth upon the clouds!”
Paradise is decked with mystic roses, and hell hath been made to
blaze with the fire of the impious. Say: “The light hath shone
forth from the horizon of Revelation, and the whole earth hath been
illumined at the coming of Him Who is the Lord of the Day of the
Covenant!” The doubters have perished, whilst he that turned,
guided by the light of assurance, unto the Dayspring of Certitude
hath prospered. Blessed art thou, who hast fixed thy gaze upon Me,
for this Tablet which hath been sent down for thee — a Tablet which
causeth the souls of men to soar. Commit it to memory, and recite it.
By My life! It is a door to the mercy of thy Lord. Well is it with
him that reciteth it at eventide and at dawn. We, verily, heard thy
praise of this Cause, through which the mountain of knowledge was
crushed, and men’s feet have slipped. My glory be upon thee and
upon whomsoever hath turned unto the Almighty, the All-Bounteous. The
Tablet is ended, but the theme is unexhausted. Be patient, for thy

haply they may banish discord from this world and illumine it with
the light of concord.</p>

<p id='8.62' data-ref='tb_en-8-p62'>
It is incumbent upon everyone to firmly adhere to and observe that
which hath streamed forth from Our Most Exalted Pen. God, the True
One, beareth Me witness, and every atom in existence is moved to
testify that such means as lead to the elevation, the advancement,
the education, the protection and the regeneration of the peoples of
the earth have been clearly set forth by Us and are revealed in the
Holy Books and Tablets by the Pen of Glory.</p>

<p id='8.63' data-ref='tb_en-8-p63'>
We entreat God to graciously aid His servants. What this Wronged One
doth expect from everyone is justice and fairness. Let no one be
content with mere hearing; rather doth it behoove everyone to ponder
that which this Wronged One hath revealed. I swear by the Daystar of
utterance, shining above the horizon of the Kingdom of the
All-Merciful, had there been any expounder or speaker discernible, We
would not have made Ourself the object of the censure, ridicule and
slander of the people.</p>

<p id='8.64' data-ref='tb_en-8-p64'>
Upon Our arrival in ‘Iráq We found the Cause of God sunk in deep
apathy and the breeze of divine revelation stilled. Most of the
believers were faint and dispirited, nay utterly lost and dead. Hence
there was a second blast on the Trumpet, whereupon the Tongue of
Grandeur uttered these blessed words: “We have sounded the Trumpet
for the second time.” Thus the whole world was quickened through
the vitalizing breaths of divine revelation and inspiration.</p>

<p id='8.65' data-ref='tb_en-8-p65'>
Certain souls have now sallied forth from behind the veils, intent on
inflicting harm upon this Wronged One. They have hindered and denied
the outpouring of this priceless bounty.</p>

<p id='8.66' data-ref='tb_en-8-p66'>
O ye that judge with fairness! If this Cause is to be denied then
what other cause in this world can be vindicated or deemed worthy of
acceptance?</p>

<p id='8.67' data-ref='tb_en-8-p67'>
Such as have turned away from the Cause of God are diligently seeking
to collect the Holy Writings of this Revelation; and they have
already, through gestures of friendship, managed to secure certain of
these Writings from those who held them in their possession.
Moreover, when they meet the followers of any religion, they hold
themselves out as believers therein. Say, die ye in your wrath!
Verily He hath appeared with so great an authority that no man of
vision, of hearing, of insight, of justice or of equity can ever deny
Him. Unto this beareth witness in this resplendent Hour the Pen of
Him Who is the Ancient of Days.</p>

<p id='8.68' data-ref='tb_en-8-p68'>
O Jalíl! Upon thee be My glory. We exhort the loved ones of God to
perform good deeds that perchance they may be graciously assisted and
may hold fast to that which hath been sent down from the heaven of
His Revelation. The benefits arising from this divine utterance shall
fall upon such as observe His precepts. We beseech God to enable them
to do that which is pleasing and acceptable unto Him, to grant that
they may deal equitably and may observe justice in this
all-compelling Cause, to acquaint them with His Holy Writings and to
direct their steps towards His straight Path.</p>

<p id='8.69' data-ref='tb_en-8-p69'>
Our Exalted Herald — may the life of all else besides Him be offered
up for His sake — hath revealed certain laws. However, in the realm
of His Revelation these laws were made subject to Our sanction, hence
this Wronged One hath put some of them into effect by embodying them
in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in different words. Others We set aside. He
holdeth in His hand the authority. He doeth what He willeth and He
ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. He is the Almighty, the
All-Praised. There are also ordinances newly revealed. Blessed are
they that attain. Blessed are they that observe His precepts.</p>

<p id='8.70' data-ref='tb_en-8-p70'>
The people of God should make the utmost endeavor that perchance the
fire of hatred and malice which smoldereth in the breasts of kindreds
and peoples may, through the living waters of utterance and the
exhortations of Him Who is the Desire of the world, be quenched and
the trees of human existence may be adorned with wondrous and
excellent fruit. He is, in truth, the Admonisher, the Compassionate,
the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p id='8.71' data-ref='tb_en-8-p71'>
May the brightness of His glory shining above the horizon of bounty
rest upon you, O people of Bahá, upon every one who standeth firm
and steadfast and upon those that are well grounded in the Faith and
are endued with true understanding.</p>

<p id='8.72' data-ref='tb_en-8-p72'>
As to thy question concerning interest and profit on gold and silver:
Some years ago the following passage was revealed from the heaven of
the All-Merciful in honor of the one who beareth the name of God,
entitled Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín <a data-fnid='8.25'></a>  — upon
him be the glory of the Most Glorious. He — exalted be His
Word — saith: Many people stand in need of this. Because if there
were no prospect for gaining interest, the affairs of men would
suffer collapse or dislocation. One can seldom find a person who
would manifest such consideration towards his fellow-man, his
countryman or towards his own brother and would show such tender
solicitude for him as to be well-disposed to grant him a loan on
benevolent terms. <a data-fnid='8.26'></a>
Therefore as a token of favor towards men We have prescribed that
interest on money should be treated like other business transactions
that are current amongst men. Thus, now that this lucid commandment
hath descended from the heaven of the Will of God, it is lawful and
proper to charge interest on money, that the people of the world may,
in a spirit of amity and fellowship and with joy and gladness,
devotedly engage themselves in magnifying the Name of Him Who is the
Well-Beloved of all mankind. Verily He ordaineth according to His Own
choosing. He hath now made interest on money lawful, even as He had
made it unlawful in the past. Within His grasp He holdeth the kingdom
of authority. He doeth and ordaineth. He is in truth the Ordainer,
the All-Knowing.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn8.25'>
One of the early believers who is best known to the friends for his
	reliable transcriptions of the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh. (See
	<i>Memorials of the Faithful</i>, Chapter 58: “Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín”.)
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn8.26'>
Such loans as bear no interest and are repayable whenever the
	borrower pleases.
</aside>

<p id='8.73' data-ref='tb_en-8-p73'>
Render thou thanks unto thy Lord, O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín, for this
manifest bounty.</p>

<p id='8.74' data-ref='tb_en-8-p74'>
Many ecclesiastics in Persia have, through innumerable designs and
devices, been feeding on illicit gains obtained by usury. They have
contrived ways to give its outward form a fair semblance of
lawfulness. They make a plaything of the laws and ordinances of God,
but they understand not.</p>

<p id='8.75' data-ref='tb_en-8-p75'>
However, this is a matter that should be practiced with moderation
and fairness. Our Pen of Glory hath, as a token of wisdom and for the
convenience of the people, desisted from laying down its limit.
Nevertheless We exhort the loved ones of God to observe justice and
fairness, and to do that which would prompt the friends of God to
evince tender mercy and compassion towards each other. He is in truth
the Counselor, the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. God grant that
all men may be graciously aided to observe that which the Tongue of
the One true God hath uttered. And if they put into practice what We
have set forth, God — exalted be His glory — will assuredly double
their portion through the heaven of His bounty. Verily He is the
Generous, the Forgiving, the Compassionate. Praise be unto God, the
Most Exalted, the Most Great.</p>

<p id='8.76' data-ref='tb_en-8-p76'>
Nevertheless the conduct of these affairs hath been entrusted to the
men of the House of Justice that they may enforce them according to
the exigencies of the time and the dictates of wisdom.</p>

<p id='8.77' data-ref='tb_en-8-p77'>
Once again We exhort all believers to observe justice and fairness
and to show forth love and contentment. They are indeed the people of
Bahá, the companions of the Crimson Ark. Upon them be the peace of
God, the Lord of all Names, the Creator of the heavens.</p>

  of Qá’in, who was surnamed Nabíl-i-Akbar (see <i>Memorials of
  the Faithful</i>, Chapter 1: “Nabíl-i-Akbar”). Another

O Muḥammad! Hearken unto the Voice proceeding out of the Realm of
Glory, calling aloud from the celestial Tree which hath risen above
the land of Za‘farán: <a data-fnid='9.1'></a>
Verily, no God is there but Me, the Omniscient, the Wise. Be thou as
the breezes of the All-Merciful for the trees of the realm of
existence and foster their growth through the potency of the Name of
thy Lord, the Just, the All-Informed. We desire to acquaint thee with

put away the things current amongst them and set their faces towards

In a Tablet Bahá’u’lláh states, “The Holy Tree [Sadrat] is,

<p id='9.3' data-ref='tb_en-9-p3'>
We exhort mankind in these days when the countenance of Justice is
soiled with dust, when the flames of unbelief are burning high and
the robe of wisdom rent asunder, when tranquility and faithfulness
have ebbed away and trials and tribulations have waxed severe, when
covenants are broken and ties are severed, when no man knoweth how to
discern light and darkness or to distinguish guidance from error.</p>

<p id='9.4' data-ref='tb_en-9-p4'>
O peoples of the world! Forsake all evil, hold fast that which is
good. Strive to be shining examples unto all mankind, and true
reminders of the virtues of God amidst men. He that riseth to serve
My Cause should manifest My wisdom, and bend every effort to banish
ignorance from the earth. Be united in counsel, be one in thought.
Let each morn be better than its eve and each morrow richer than its
yesterday. Man’s merit lieth in service and virtue and not in the
pageantry of wealth and riches. Take heed that your words be purged
from idle fancies and worldly desires and your deeds be cleansed from
craftiness and suspicion. Dissipate not the wealth of your precious
lives in the pursuit of evil and corrupt affection, nor let your
endeavors be spent in promoting your personal interest. Be generous
in your days of plenty, and be patient in the hour of loss. Adversity
is followed by success and rejoicings follow woe. Guard against
idleness and sloth, and cling unto that which profiteth mankind,
whether young or old, whether high or low. Beware lest ye sow tares
of dissension among men or plant thorns of doubt in pure and radiant
hearts.</p>

<p id='9.5' data-ref='tb_en-9-p5'>
O ye beloved of the Lord! Commit not that which defileth the limpid
stream of love or destroyeth the sweet fragrance of friendship. By
the righteousness of the Lord! Ye were created to show love one to
another and not perversity and rancor. Take pride not in love for
yourselves but in love for your fellow-creatures. Glory not in love
for your country, but in love for all mankind. Let your eye be
chaste, your hand faithful, your tongue truthful and your heart
enlightened. Abase not the station of the learned in Bahá and
belittle not the rank of such rulers as administer justice amidst
you. Set your reliance on the army of justice, put on the armor of
wisdom, let your adorning be forgiveness and mercy and that which
cheereth the hearts of the well-favored of God.</p>

<p id='9.6' data-ref='tb_en-9-p6'>
By My life! Thy grievances have plunged Me into sorrow. Regard not
the children of the world and all their doings but fix thy gaze upon
God and His never-ending dominion. Verily, He calleth to thy
remembrance that which is the source of delight for all mankind.
Drink thou the life-giving water of blissful joy from the chalice of
utterance proffered by the Fountainhead of divine Revelation — He Who
hath made mention of thee in this mighty stronghold. Endeavor to the
utmost of thy powers to establish the word of truth with eloquence
and wisdom and to dispel falsehood from the face of the earth. Thus
directeth thee the Dayspring of divine knowledge from this luminous
horizon.</p>

<p id='9.7' data-ref='tb_en-9-p7'>
O thou who speakest in My name! Consider the people and the things
they have wrought in My days. We revealed unto one of the rulers that
which overpowereth all the dwellers of the earth, and requested him
to bring Us face to face with the learned men of this age, that We
might set forth for him the testimony of God, His proofs, His glory
and His majesty; and naught did We intend thereby but the highest
good. However, he committed that which hath caused the inmates of the
cities of justice and equity to lament. Thus hath judgment been given
between Me and him. Verily thy Lord is the Ordainer, the
All-Informed. In such circumstances as thou seest, how can the
Celestial Bird soar into the atmosphere of divine mysteries when its
wings have been battered with the stones of idle fancy and bitter
hatred, and it is cast into a prison built of unyielding stone? By
the righteousness of God! The people have perpetrated a grievous
injustice.</p>

<p id='9.8' data-ref='tb_en-9-p8'>
As regards thine assertions about the beginning of creation, this is
a matter on which conceptions vary by reason of the divergences in
men’s thoughts and opinions. Wert thou to assert that it hath ever
existed and shall continue to exist, it would be true; or wert thou
to affirm the same concept as is mentioned in the sacred Scriptures,
no doubt would there be about it, for it hath been revealed by God,
the Lord of the worlds. Indeed He was a hidden treasure. This is a
station that can never be described nor even alluded to. And in the
station of “I did wish to make Myself known,” God was, and His
creation had ever existed beneath His shelter from the beginning that
hath no beginning, apart from its being preceded by a Firstness which
cannot be regarded as firstness and originated by a Cause inscrutable
even unto all men of learning.</p>

<p id='9.9' data-ref='tb_en-9-p9'>
That which hath been in existence had existed before, but not in the
form thou seest today. The world of existence came into being through
the heat generated from the interaction between the active force and
that which is its recipient. These two are the same, yet they are
different. Thus doth the Great Announcement inform thee about this
glorious structure. Such as communicate the generating influence and
such as receive its impact are indeed created through the
irresistible Word of God which is the Cause of the entire creation,
while all else besides His Word are but the creatures and the effects
thereof. Verily thy Lord is the Expounder, the All-Wise.</p>

<p id='9.10' data-ref='tb_en-9-p10'>
Know thou, moreover, that the Word of God — exalted be His glory — is
higher and far superior to that which the senses can perceive, for it
is sanctified from any property or substance. It transcendeth the
limitations of known elements and is exalted above all the essential
and recognized substances. It became manifest without any syllable or
sound and is none but the Command of God which pervadeth all created
things. It hath never been withheld from the world of being. It is
God’s all-pervasive grace, from which all grace doth emanate. It is
an entity far removed above all that hath been and shall be.</p>

<p id='9.11' data-ref='tb_en-9-p11'>
We are loath to enlarge on this subject, inasmuch as the unbelievers
have inclined their ears towards Us in order to hear that which might
enable them to cavil against God, the Help in Peril, the
Self-Subsisting. And since they are unable to attain to mysteries of
knowledge and wisdom from what hath been unraveled by the Source of
divine splendor, they rise in protest and burst into clamor. But it
is true to say that they object to that which they comprehend, not to
the expositions given by the Expounder, nor the truths imparted by
the One true God, the Knower of things unseen. Their objections, one
and all, turn upon themselves, and I swear by thy life that they are
devoid of understanding.</p>

<p id='9.12' data-ref='tb_en-9-p12'>
Every thing must needs have an origin and every building a builder.
Verily, the Word of God is the Cause which hath preceded the
contingent world — a world which is adorned with the splendors of the
Ancient of Days, yet is being renewed and regenerated at all times.
Immeasurably exalted is the God of Wisdom Who hath raised this
sublime structure.</p>

<p id='9.13' data-ref='tb_en-9-p13'>
Look at the world and ponder a while upon it. It unveileth the book
of its own self before thine eyes and revealeth that which the Pen of
thy Lord, the Fashioner, the All-Informed, hath inscribed therein. It
will acquaint thee with that which is within it and upon it and will
give thee such clear explanations as to make thee independent of
every eloquent expounder.</p>

<p id='9.14' data-ref='tb_en-9-p14'>
Say: Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name, the Maker,
the Creator. Its manifestations are diversified by varying causes,
and in this diversity there are signs for men of discernment. Nature
is God’s Will and is its expression in and through the contingent
world. It is a dispensation of Providence ordained by the Ordainer,
the All-Wise. Were anyone to affirm that it is the Will of God as
manifested in the world of being, no one should question this
assertion. It is endowed with a power whose reality men of learning
fail to grasp. Indeed a man of insight can perceive naught therein
save the effulgent splendor of Our Name, the Creator. Say: This is an
existence which knoweth no decay, and Nature itself is lost in
bewilderment before its revelations, its compelling evidences and its
effulgent glory which have encompassed the universe.</p>

<p id='9.15' data-ref='tb_en-9-p15'>
It ill beseemeth thee to turn thy gaze unto former or more recent
times. Make thou mention of this Day and magnify that which hath
appeared therein. It will in truth suffice all mankind. Indeed
expositions and discourses in explanation of such things cause the
spirits to be chilled. It behooveth thee to speak forth in such wise
as to set the hearts of true believers ablaze and cause their bodies
to soar.</p>

<p id='9.16' data-ref='tb_en-9-p16'>
Whoso firmly believeth today in the rebirth of man and is fully
conscious that God, the Most Exalted, wieldeth supreme ascendancy and
absolute authority over this new creation, verily such a man is
reckoned with them that are endued with insight in this most great
Revelation. Unto this beareth witness every discerning believer.</p>

<p id='9.17' data-ref='tb_en-9-p17'>
Walk thou high above the world of being through the power of the Most
Great Name, that thou mayest become aware of the immemorial mysteries
and be acquainted with that wherewith no one is acquainted. Verily,
thy Lord is the Helper, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Be thou as
a throbbing artery, pulsating in the body of the entire creation,
that through the heat generated by this motion there may appear that
which will quicken the hearts of those who hesitate.</p>

<p id='9.18' data-ref='tb_en-9-p18'>
At the time when We were hidden behind countless veils of light thou
didst commune with Me and didst witness the luminaries of the heaven
of My wisdom and the billows of the ocean of Mine utterance. Verily
thy Lord is the Truthful, the Faithful. Great indeed is the
blessedness of him who hath attained the liberal effusions of this
ocean in the days of his Lord, the Most Bountiful, the All-Wise.</p>

<p id='9.19' data-ref='tb_en-9-p19'>
During Our sojourn in ‘Iráq when We were at the house of one named
Majíd, We set forth clearly for thee the mysteries of creation and
the origin, the culmination and the cause thereof. However since Our
departure We have limited Ourself to this affirmation: “Verily, no
God is there but Me, the Ever-Forgiving, the Bountiful.”</p>

<p id='9.20' data-ref='tb_en-9-p20'>
Teach thou the Cause of God with an utterance which will cause the
bushes to be enkindled, and the call “Verily, there is no God but
Me, the Almighty, the Unconstrained” to be raised therefrom. Say:
Human utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence
and needeth moderation. As to its influence, this is conditional upon
refinement which in turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached
and pure. As to its moderation, this hath to be combined with tact
and wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures and Tablets. Meditate
upon that which hath streamed forth from the heaven of the Will of
thy Lord, He Who is the Source of all grace, that thou mayest grasp
the intended meaning which is enshrined in the sacred depths of the
Holy Writings.</p>

<p id='9.21' data-ref='tb_en-9-p21'>
Those who have rejected God and firmly cling to Nature as it is in
itself are, verily, bereft of knowledge and wisdom. They are truly of
them that are far astray. They have failed to attain the lofty summit
and have fallen short of the ultimate purpose; therefore their eyes
were shut and their thoughts differed, while the leaders among them
have believed in God and in His invincible sovereignty. Unto this
beareth witness thy Lord, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p id='9.22' data-ref='tb_en-9-p22'>
When the eyes of the people of the East were captivated by the arts
and wonders of the West, they roved distraught in the wilderness of
material causes, oblivious of the One Who is the Causer of Causes,
and the Sustainer thereof, while such men as were the source and the
wellspring of Wisdom never denied the moving Impulse behind these
causes, nor the Creator or the Origin thereof. Thy Lord knoweth, yet
most of the people know not.</p>

<p id='9.23' data-ref='tb_en-9-p23'>
Now We have, for the sake of God, the Lord of Names, set Ourself the
task of mentioning in this Tablet some accounts of the sages, <a data-fnid='9.2'></a>
that the eyes of the people may be opened thereby and that they may
become fully assured that He is in truth the Maker, the Omnipotent,
the Creator, the Originator, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

In many of the passages that follow concerning the Greek

<p id='9.24' data-ref='tb_en-9-p24'>
Although it is recognized that the contemporary men of learning are
highly qualified in philosophy, arts and crafts, yet were anyone to
observe with a discriminating eye he would readily comprehend that
most of this knowledge hath been acquired from the sages of the past,
for it is they who have laid the foundation of philosophy, reared its
structure and reinforced its pillars. Thus doth thy Lord, the Ancient
of Days, inform thee. The sages aforetime acquired their knowledge
from the Prophets, inasmuch as the latter were the Exponents of
divine philosophy and the Revealers of heavenly mysteries. Men
quaffed the crystal, living waters of Their utterance, while others
satisfied themselves with the dregs. Everyone receiveth a portion
according to his measure. Verily He is the Equitable, the Wise.</p>

<p id='9.25' data-ref='tb_en-9-p25'>
Empedocles, who distinguished himself in philosophy, was a
contemporary of David, while Pythagoras lived in the days of Solomon,
son of David, and acquired Wisdom from the treasury of prophethood.
It is he who claimed to have heard the whispering sound of the
heavens and to have attained the station of the angels. In truth thy
Lord will clearly set forth all things, if He pleaseth. Verily, He is
the Wise, the All-Pervading.</p>

<p id='9.26' data-ref='tb_en-9-p26'>
The essence and the fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from the
Prophets. That the people differ concerning the inner meanings and
mysteries thereof is to be attributed to the divergence of their
views and minds. We would fain recount to thee the following: One of
the Prophets once was communicating to his people that with which the
Omnipotent Lord had inspired Him. Truly, thy Lord is the Inspirer,
the Gracious, the Exalted. When the fountain of wisdom and eloquence
gushed forth from the wellspring of His utterance and the wine of
divine knowledge inebriated those who had sought His threshold, He
exclaimed: “Lo! All are filled with the Spirit.” From among the
people there was he who held fast unto this statement and, actuated
by his own fancies, conceived the idea that the spirit literally
penetrateth or entereth into the body, and through lengthy
expositions he advanced proofs to vindicate this concept; and groups
of people followed in his footsteps. To mention their names at this
point, or to give thee a detailed account thereof, would lead to
prolixity, and would depart from the main theme. Verily, thy Lord is
the All-Wise, the All-Knowing. There was also he who partook of the
choice wine whose seal had been removed by the Key of the Tongue of
Him Who is the Revealer of the Verses of thy Lord, the Gracious, the
Most Generous.</p>

<p id='9.27' data-ref='tb_en-9-p27'>
Verily, the philosophers have not denied the Ancient of Days. Most of
them passed away deploring their failure to fathom His mystery, even
as some of them have testified. Verily, thy Lord is the Adviser, the
All-Informed.</p>

<p id='9.28' data-ref='tb_en-9-p28'>
Consider Hippocrates, the physician. He was one of the eminent
philosophers who believed in God and acknowledged His sovereignty.
After him came Socrates who was indeed wise, accomplished and
righteous. He practiced self-denial, repressed his appetites for
selfish desires and turned away from material pleasures. He withdrew
to the mountains where he dwelt in a cave. He dissuaded men from
worshipping idols and taught them the way of God, the Lord of Mercy,
until the ignorant rose up against him. They arrested him and put him
to death in prison. Thus relateth to thee this swift-moving Pen. What
a penetrating vision into philosophy this eminent man had! He is the
most distinguished of all philosophers and was highly versed in
wisdom. We testify that he is one of the heroes in this field and an
outstanding champion dedicated unto it. He had a profound knowledge
of such sciences as were current amongst men as well as of those
which were veiled from their minds. Methinks he drank one draught
when the Most Great Ocean overflowed with gleaming and life-giving
waters. He it is who perceived a unique, a tempered, and a pervasive
nature in things, bearing the closest likeness to the human spirit,
and he discovered this nature to be distinct from the substance of
things in their refined form. He hath a special pronouncement on this
weighty theme. Wert thou to ask from the worldly wise of this
generation about this exposition, thou wouldst witness their
incapacity to grasp it. Verily, thy Lord speaketh the truth but most
people comprehend not.</p>

<p id='9.29' data-ref='tb_en-9-p29'>
After Socrates came the divine Plato who was a pupil of the former
and occupied the chair of philosophy as his successor. He
acknowledged his belief in God and in His signs which pervade all
that hath been and shall be. Then came Aristotle, the well-known man
of knowledge. He it is who discovered the power of gaseous matter.
These men who stand out as leaders of the people and are preeminent
among them, one and all acknowledged their belief in the immortal
Being Who holdeth in His grasp the reins of all sciences.</p>

I will also mention for thee the invocation voiced by Balínús who
was familiar with the theories put forward by the Father of
Philosophy regarding the mysteries of creation as given in his
chrysolite tablets, that everyone may be fully assured of the things
We have elucidated for thee in this manifest Tablet, which, if
pressed with the hand of fairness and knowledge, will yield the
spirit of life for the quickening of all created things. Great is the
blessedness of him who swimmeth in this ocean and celebrateth the
praise of his Lord, the Gracious, the Best-Beloved. Indeed the
breezes of divine revelation are diffused from the verses of thy Lord
in such wise that no one can dispute its truth, except those who are
bereft of hearing, of vision, of understanding and of every human
faculty. Verily thy Lord beareth witness unto this, yet the people
understand not.</p>

<p id='9.31' data-ref='tb_en-9-p31'>
This man hath said: “I am Balínús, the wise one, the performer of
wonders, the producer of talismans.” He surpassed everyone else in
the diffusion of arts and sciences and soared unto the loftiest
heights of humility and supplication. Give ear unto that which he
hath said, entreating the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted: “I
stand in the presence of my Lord, extolling His gifts and bounties
and praising Him with that wherewith He praiseth His Own Self, that I
may become a source of blessing and guidance unto such men as
acknowledge my words.” And further he saith: “O Lord! Thou art
God and no God is there but Thee. Thou art the Creator and no creator
is there except Thee. Assist me by Thy grace and strengthen me. My
heart is seized with alarm, my limbs tremble, I have lost my reason
and my mind hath failed me. Bestow upon me strength and enable my
tongue to speak forth with wisdom.” And still further he saith:
“Thou art in truth the Knowing, the Wise, the Powerful, the
Compassionate.” It was this man of wisdom who became informed of
the mysteries of creation and discerned the subtleties which lie
enshrined in the Hermetic writings. <a data-fnid='9.3'></a> </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn9.3'>
In one of His Tablets Bahá’u’lláh wrote: “The first person
	who devoted himself to philosophy was Idrís. Thus was he named.
	Some called him also Hermes. In every tongue he hath a special name.
	He it is who hath set forth in every branch of philosophy thorough
	and convincing statements. After him Balínús derived his knowledge
	and sciences from the Hermetic Tablets and most of the philosophers
	who followed him made their philosophical and scientific discoveries
	from his words and statements.…” In the Qur’án, Súra 19,
	verses 57 and 58, is written: “And commemorate Idrís in the Book;
	for he was a man of truth, a Prophet; And we uplifted him to a place
	on high.”

We have no wish to mention anything further but We shall utter that

Tree is loath to proclaim aught else to the world but this

Thou knowest full well that We perused not the books which men
possess and We acquired not the learning current amongst them, and

will appear before the face of thy Lord in the form of a tablet all
that which hath appeared in the world and is revealed in the Holy
Books and Scriptures. Thus do We set down in writing that which the
eye perceiveth. Verily His knowledge encompasseth the earth and the
heavens.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn9.4'>
In many of the passages that follow concerning the Greek
	philosophers, Bahá’u’lláh quotes verbatim from the works of
	such Muslim historians as Abu’l-Fatḥ-i-<u>Sh</u>áhristání

This is a Tablet wherein the Pen of the Unseen hath inscribed the
knowledge of all that hath been and shall be — a knowledge that none
other but My wondrous Tongue can interpret. Indeed My heart as it is
in itself hath been purged by God from the concepts of the learned
and is sanctified from the utterances of the wise. In truth naught
doth it mirror forth but the revelations of God. Unto this beareth
witness the Tongue of Grandeur in this perspicuous Book.</p>

<p id='9.36' data-ref='tb_en-9-p36'>
Say, O people of the earth! Beware lest any reference to wisdom debar
you from its Source or withhold you from the Dawning-Place thereof.
Fix your hearts upon your Lord, the Educator, the All-Wise.</p>

<p id='9.37' data-ref='tb_en-9-p37'>
For every land We have prescribed a portion, for every occasion an
allotted share, for every pronouncement an appointed time and for
every situation an apt remark. Consider Greece. We made it a Seat of
Wisdom for a prolonged period. However, when the appointed hour
struck, its throne was subverted, its tongue ceased to speak, its
light grew dim and its banner was hauled down. Thus do We bestow and
withdraw. Verily thy Lord is He Who giveth and divesteth, the Mighty,
the Powerful.</p>

<p id='9.38' data-ref='tb_en-9-p38'>
In every land We have set up a luminary of knowledge, and when the
time foreordained is at hand, it will shine resplendent above its
horizon, as decreed by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. If it be
Our Will We are fully capable of describing for thee whatever
existeth in every land or hath come to pass therein. Indeed the
knowledge of thy Lord pervadeth the heavens and the earth.</p>

<p id='9.39' data-ref='tb_en-9-p39'>
Know thou, moreover, that the people aforetime have produced things
which the contemporary men of knowledge have been unable to produce.
We recall unto thee Múrṭus who was one of the learned. He invented
an apparatus which transmitted sound over a distance of sixty miles.
Others besides him have also discovered things which no one in this
age hath beheld. Verily thy Lord revealeth in every epoch whatsoever
He pleaseth as a token of wisdom on His part. He is in truth the
supreme Ordainer, the All-Wise.</p>

<p id='9.40' data-ref='tb_en-9-p40'>
A true philosopher would never deny God nor His evidences, rather
would he acknowledge His glory and overpowering majesty which
overshadow all created things. Verily We love those men of knowledge
who have brought to light such things as promote the best interests
of humanity, and We aided them through the potency of Our behest, for
well are We able to achieve Our purpose.</p>

<p id='9.41' data-ref='tb_en-9-p41'>
Beware, O My loved ones, lest ye despise the merits of My learned
servants whom God hath graciously chosen to be the exponents of His
Name “the Fashioner” amidst mankind. Exert your utmost endeavor
that ye may develop such crafts and undertakings that everyone,
whether young or old, may benefit therefrom. We are quit of those
ignorant ones who fondly imagine that Wisdom is to give vent to one’s
idle imaginings and to repudiate God, the Lord of all men; even as We
hear some of the heedless voicing such assertions today.</p>

<p id='9.42' data-ref='tb_en-9-p42'>
Say: The beginning of Wisdom and the origin thereof is to acknowledge
whatsoever God hath clearly set forth, for through its potency the
foundation of statesmanship, which is a shield for the preservation
of the body of mankind, hath been firmly established. Ponder a while
that ye may perceive what My most exalted Pen hath proclaimed in this
wondrous Tablet. Say, every matter related to state affairs which ye
raise for discussion falls under the shadow of one of the words sent
down from the heaven of His glorious and exalted utterance. Thus have
We recounted unto thee that which will exhilarate thy heart, will
bring solace to thine eyes and will enable thee to arise for the
promotion of His Cause amidst all peoples.</p>

<p id='9.43' data-ref='tb_en-9-p43'>
O My Nabíl! Let nothing grieve thee, rather rejoice with exceeding
gladness inasmuch as I have mentioned thy name, have turned My heart
and My face towards thee and have conversed with thee through this
irrefutable and weighty exposition. Ponder in thy heart upon the
tribulations I have sustained, the imprisonment and the captivity I
have endured, the sufferings that have befallen Me and the
accusations that the people have leveled against Me. Behold, they are
truly wrapped in a grievous veil.</p>

<p id='9.44' data-ref='tb_en-9-p44'>
When the discourse reached this stage, the dawn of divine mysteries
appeared and the light of utterance was quenched. May His glory rest
upon the people of wisdom as bidden by One Who is the Almighty, the
All-Praised.</p>

<p id='9.45' data-ref='tb_en-9-p45'>
Say: Magnified be Thy Name, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name
through which the splendor of the light of wisdom shone resplendent
when the heavens of divine utterance were set in motion amidst
mankind, to graciously aid me by Thy heavenly confirmations and
enable me to extol Thy Name amongst Thy servants.</p>

<p id='9.46' data-ref='tb_en-9-p46'>
O Lord! Unto Thee have I turned my face, detached from all save Thee
and holding fast to the hem of the robe of Thy manifold blessings.
Unloose my tongue therefore to proclaim that which will captivate the
minds of men and will rejoice their souls and spirits. Strengthen me
then in Thy Cause in such wise that I may not be hindered by the
ascendancy of the oppressors among Thy creatures nor withheld by the
onslaught of the disbelievers amidst those who dwell in Thy realm.
Make me as a lamp shining throughout Thy lands that those in whose
hearts the light of Thy knowledge gloweth and the yearning for Thy
love lingereth may be guided by its radiance.</p>

Verily, potent art Thou to do whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy
grasp Thou holdest the kingdom of creation. There is none other God
but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Wise.</p>

The source of all evil is for man to turn away from his Lord and set

 Out of respect,
the Bahá’ís, rather than addressing Bahá’u’lláh directly,
would write to His amanuensis, Mírzá Áqá Ján, surnamed “Servant
of God” and “Servant-in-Attendance.” The reply would be in the
form of a letter from Mírzá Áqá Ján quoting words of
Bahá’u’lláh, but would, in fact, be dictated in its entirety by
Bahá’u’lláh. Thus all parts of the Tablet, even those which
ostensibly are the words of Mírzá Áqá Ján himself, are Sacred
Scripture revealed by Bahá’u’lláh. The Tablet of Maqṣúd is
in this form. It was addressed to Mírzá Maqṣúd, one of the early
believers living at that time in Damascus and Jerusalem.

A praise which is exalted above every mention or description

invisible, Who hath enabled the Primal Point to reveal countless
Books and Epistles and Who, through the potency of His sublime Word,
hath called into being the entire creation, whether of the former or
more recent generations. Moreover He hath in every age and cycle, in
conformity with His transcendent wisdom, sent forth a divine
Messenger to revive the dispirited and despondent souls with the
living waters of His utterance, One Who is indeed the Expounder, the
true Interpreter, inasmuch as man is unable to comprehend that which
hath streamed forth from the Pen of Glory and is recorded in His
heavenly Books. Men at all times and under all conditions stand in
need of one to exhort them, guide them and to instruct and teach
them. Therefore He hath sent forth His Messengers, His Prophets and
chosen ones that they might acquaint the people with the divine
purpose underlying the revelation of Books and the raising up of
Messengers, and that everyone may become aware of the trust of God

Man is the supreme Talisman. Lack of a proper education hath,
however, deprived him of that which he doth inherently possess.
Through a word proceeding out of the mouth of God he was called into
being; by one word more he was guided to recognize the Source of his
education; by yet another word his station and destiny were
safeguarded. The Great Being saith: Regard man as a mine rich in gems
of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its
treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom. If any man were
to meditate on that which the Scriptures, sent down from the heaven
of God’s holy Will, have revealed, he would readily recognize that
their purpose is that all men shall be regarded as one soul, so that
the seal bearing the words “The Kingdom shall be God’s” may be
stamped on every heart, and the light of Divine bounty, of grace, and
mercy may envelop all mankind. The One true God, exalted be His
glory, hath wished nothing for Himself. The allegiance of mankind
profiteth Him not, neither doth its perversity harm Him. The Bird of
the Realm of Utterance voiceth continually this call: “All things
have I willed for thee, and thee, too, for thine own sake.” If the
learned and worldly-wise men of this age were to allow mankind to
inhale the fragrance of fellowship and love, every understanding
heart would apprehend the meaning of true liberty, and discover the
secret of undisturbed peace and absolute composure. Were the earth to
attain this station and be illumined with its light it could then be
truly said of it: “Thou shall see in it no hollows or rising
hills.” <a data-fnid='11.1'></a>

standard of the unity of God and of His singleness was uplifted and
the banners of celestial triumph were unfurled. Through them the
religion of God was firmly established among His creatures and His
Name magnified amidst His servants. I entreat Him — exalted is He — to

Behold the disturbances which, for many a long year, have afflicted
the earth, and the perturbation that hath seized its peoples. It hath
either been ravaged by war, or tormented by sudden and unforeseen
calamities. Though the world is encompassed with misery and distress,
yet no man hath paused to reflect what the cause or source of that
may be. Whenever the True Counselor uttered a word in admonishment,
lo, they all denounced Him as a mover of mischief and rejected His
claim. How bewildering, how confusing is such behavior! No two men
can be found who may be said to be outwardly and inwardly united. The
evidences of discord and malice are apparent everywhere, though all
were made for harmony and union. The Great Being saith: O
well-beloved ones! The tabernacle of unity hath been raised; regard
ye not one another as strangers. Ye are the fruits of one tree, and
the leaves of one branch. We cherish the hope that the light of
justice may shine upon the world and sanctify it from tyranny. If the
rulers and kings of the earth, the symbols of the power of God,
exalted be His glory, arise and resolve to dedicate themselves to
whatever will promote the highest interests of the whole of humanity,
the reign of justice will assuredly be established amongst the
children of men, and the effulgence of its light will envelop the
whole earth. The Great Being saith: The structure of world stability
and order hath been reared upon, and will continue to be sustained
by, the twin pillars of reward and punishment. And in another
connection He hath uttered the following in the eloquent tongue: <a data-fnid='11.4'></a>
Justice hath a mighty force at its command. It is none other than
reward and punishment for the deeds of men. By the power of this
force the tabernacle of order is established throughout the world,
causing the wicked to restrain their natures for fear of punishment.</p>

In another passage He hath written: Take heed, O concourse of the
rulers of the world! There is no force on earth that can equal in its
conquering power the force of justice and wisdom. I, verily, affirm
that there is not, and hath never been, a host more mighty than that
of justice and wisdom. Blessed is the king who marcheth with the
ensign of wisdom unfurled before him, and the battalions of justice
massed in his rear. He verily is the ornament that adorneth the brow
of peace and the countenance of security. There can be no doubt
whatever that if the daystar of justice, which the clouds of tyranny
have obscured, were to shed its light upon men, the face of the earth
would be completely transformed.</p>

<p id='11.7' data-ref='tb_en-11-p7'>
The Great Being, wishing to reveal the prerequisites of the peace and
tranquility of the world and the advancement of its peoples, hath
written: The time must come when the imperative necessity for the
holding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will be
universally realized. The rulers and kings of the earth must needs
attend it, and, participating in its deliberations, must consider
such ways and means as will lay the foundations of the world’s
Great Peace amongst men. Such a peace demandeth that the Great Powers
should resolve, for the sake of the tranquility of the peoples of the
earth, to be fully reconciled among themselves. Should any king take
up arms against another, all should unitedly arise and prevent him.
If this be done, the nations of the world will no longer require any
armaments, except for the purpose of preserving the security of their
realms and of maintaining internal order within their territories.
This will ensure the peace and composure of every people, government
and nation. We fain would hope that the kings and rulers of the
earth, the mirrors of the gracious and almighty name of God, may
attain unto this station, and shield mankind from the onslaught of
tyranny.</p>

<p id='11.8' data-ref='tb_en-11-p8'>
Likewise He saith: Among the things which are conducive to unity and
concord and will cause the whole earth to be regarded as one country
is that the diverse languages be reduced to one language and in like
manner the scripts used in the world be confined to a single script.
It is incumbent upon all nations to appoint some men of understanding
and erudition to convene a gathering and through joint consultation
choose one language from among the varied existing languages, or
create a new one, to be taught to the children in all the schools of
the world.</p>

<p id='11.9' data-ref='tb_en-11-p9'>
The day is approaching when all the peoples of the world will have
adopted one universal language and one common script. When this is
achieved, to whatsoever city a man may journey, it shall be as if he
were entering his own home. These things are obligatory and
absolutely essential. It is incumbent upon every man of insight and
understanding to strive to translate that which hath been written
into reality and action.</p>

<p id='11.10' data-ref='tb_en-11-p10'>
In these days the tabernacle of justice hath fallen into the clutches
of tyranny and oppression. Beseech ye the One true God — exalted be
His glory — not to deprive mankind of the ocean of true
understanding, for were men but to take heed they would readily
appreciate that whatever hath streamed from and is set down by the
Pen of Glory is even as the sun for the whole world and that therein
lie the welfare, security and true interests of all men; otherwise
the earth will be tormented by a fresh calamity every day and
unprecedented commotions will break out. God grant that the people of
the world may be graciously aided to preserve the light of His loving
counsels within the globe of wisdom. We cherish the hope that
everyone may be adorned with the vesture of true wisdom, the basis of
the government of the world.</p>

<p id='11.11' data-ref='tb_en-11-p11'>
The Great Being saith: The heaven of statesmanship is made luminous
and resplendent by the brightness of the light of these blessed words
which hath dawned from the dayspring of the Will of God: It behooveth
every ruler to weigh his own being every day in the balance of equity
and justice and then to judge between men and counsel them to do that
which would direct their steps unto the path of wisdom and
understanding. This is the cornerstone of statesmanship and the
essence thereof. From these words every enlightened man of wisdom
will readily perceive that which will foster such aims as the
welfare, security and protection of mankind and the safety of human
lives. Were men of insight to quaff their fill from the ocean of
inner meanings which lie enshrined in these words and become
acquainted therewith, they would bear witness to the sublimity and
the excellence of this utterance. If this lowly one were to set forth
that which he perceiveth, all would testify unto God’s consummate
wisdom. The secrets of statesmanship and that of which the people are
in need lie enfolded within these words. This lowly servant earnestly
entreateth the One true God — exalted be His glory — to illumine the
eyes of the people of the world with the splendor of the light of
wisdom that they, one and all, may recognize that which is
indispensable in this day.</p>

<p id='11.12' data-ref='tb_en-11-p12'>
That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself to the
service of the entire human race. The Great Being saith: Blessed and
happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples
and kindreds of the earth. In another passage He hath proclaimed: It
is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but
rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one
country, and mankind its citizens.</p>

<p id='11.13' data-ref='tb_en-11-p13'>
Such exhortations to union and concord as are inscribed in the Books
of the Prophets by the Pen of the Most High bear reference unto
specific matters; not a union that would lead to disunity or a
concord which would create discord. This is the station where
measures are set unto everything, a station where every deserving
soul shall be given his due. Well is it with them that appreciate the
meaning and grasp the intent of these words, and woe betide the
heedless. Unto this all the evidences of nature, in their very
essences, bear ample testimony. Every discerning man of wisdom is
well acquainted with that which We have mentioned, but not those who
have strayed far from the living fountain of fairmindedness and are
roving distraught in the wilderness of ignorance and blind
fanaticism.</p>

<p id='11.14' data-ref='tb_en-11-p14'>
The Great Being saith: O ye children of men! The fundamental purpose
animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the
interests and promote the unity of the human race, and to foster the
spirit of love and fellowship amongst men. Suffer it not to become a
source of dissension and discord, of hate and enmity. This is the
straight Path, the fixed and immovable foundation. Whatsoever is
raised on this foundation, the changes and chances of the world can
never impair its strength, nor will the revolution of countless
centuries undermine its structure. Our hope is that the world’s
religious leaders and the rulers thereof will unitedly arise for the
reformation of this age and the rehabilitation of its fortunes. Let
them, after meditating on its needs, take counsel together and,
through anxious and full deliberation, administer to a diseased and
sorely afflicted world the remedy it requireth.</p>

<p id='11.15' data-ref='tb_en-11-p15'>
The Great Being saith: The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with
the two luminaries of consultation and compassion. Take ye counsel
together in all matters, inasmuch as consultation is the lamp of
guidance which leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding.</p>

<p id='11.16' data-ref='tb_en-11-p16'>
At the outset of every endeavor, it is incumbent to look to the end
of it. Of all the arts and sciences, set the children to studying
those which will result in advantage to man, will ensure his progress
and elevate his rank. Thus the noisome odors of lawlessness will be
dispelled, and thus through the high endeavors of the nation’s
leaders, all will live cradled, secure and in peace.</p>

<p id='11.17' data-ref='tb_en-11-p17'>
The Great Being saith: The learned of the day must direct the people
to acquire those branches of knowledge which are of use, that both
the learned themselves and the generality of mankind may derive
benefits therefrom. Such academic pursuits as begin and end in words
alone have never been and will never be of any worth. The majority of
Persia’s learned doctors devote all their lives to the study of a
philosophy the ultimate yield of which is nothing but words.</p>

<p id='11.18' data-ref='tb_en-11-p18'>
It is incumbent upon them who are in authority to exercise moderation
in all things. Whatsoever passeth beyond the limits of moderation
will cease to exert a beneficial influence. Consider for instance
such things as liberty, civilization and the like. However much men
of understanding may favorably regard them, they will, if carried to
excess, exercise a pernicious influence upon men.</p>

<p id='11.19' data-ref='tb_en-11-p19'>
If this point were to be expounded an elaborate explanation would be
required which, it is feared, might become tedious. It is the ardent
hope of this lowly one that God — exalted be His glory — may grant
all men that which is good. For he who is endowed therewith is the
possessor of all things. The Great Being saith: The Tongue of Wisdom
proclaimeth: He that hath Me not is bereft of all things. Turn ye
away from all that is on earth and seek none else but Me. I am the
Sun of Wisdom and the Ocean of Knowledge. I cheer the faint and
revive the dead. I am the guiding Light that illumineth the way. I am
the royal Falcon on the arm of the Almighty. I unfold the drooping
wings of every broken bird and start it on its flight.</p>

<p id='11.20' data-ref='tb_en-11-p20'>
And likewise He saith: The heaven of true understanding shineth
resplendent with the light of two luminaries: tolerance and
righteousness.</p>

<p id='11.21' data-ref='tb_en-11-p21'>
O my friend! Vast oceans lie enshrined within this brief saying.
Blessed are they who appreciate its value, drink deep therefrom and
grasp its meaning, and woe betide the heedless. This lowly one
entreateth the people of the world to observe fairness, that their
tender, their delicate and precious hearing which hath been created
to hearken unto the words of wisdom may be freed from impediments and
from such allusions, idle fancies or vain imaginings as “cannot
fatten nor appease the hunger,” so that the true Counselor may be
graciously inclined to set forth that which is the source of blessing
for mankind and of the highest good for all nations.</p>

<p id='11.22' data-ref='tb_en-11-p22'>
At present the light of reconciliation is dimmed in most countries
and its radiance extinguished while the fire of strife and disorder
hath been kindled and is blazing fiercely. Two great powers who
regard themselves as the founders and leaders of civilization and the
framers of constitutions have risen up against the followers of the
Faith associated with Him Who conversed with God. <a data-fnid='11.5'></a>
Be ye warned, O men of understanding. It ill beseemeth the station of
man to commit tyranny; rather it behooveth him to observe equity and
be attired with the raiment of justice under all conditions. Beseech
ye the One true God that He may, through the power of the hand of
loving-kindness and spiritual education, purge and purify certain
souls from the defilement of evil passions and corrupt desires, that
they may arise and unloose their tongues for the sake of God, that
perchance the evidences of injustice may be blotted out and the
splendor of the light of justice may shed its radiance upon the whole
world. The people are ignorant, and they stand in need of those who
will expound the truth.</p>

The Great Being saith: The man of consummate learning and the sage
endowed with penetrating wisdom are the two eyes to the body of
mankind. God willing, the earth shall never be deprived of these two
greatest gifts. That which hath been set forth and will be revealed
in the future is but a token of this Servant’s ardent desire to
dedicate Himself to the service of all the kindreds of the earth.</p>

<p id='11.24' data-ref='tb_en-11-p24'>
O my friend! In all circumstances one should seize upon every means
which will promote security and tranquility among the peoples of the
world. The Great Being saith: In this glorious Day whatever will
purge you from corruption and will lead you towards peace and
composure, is indeed the Straight Path.</p>

<p id='11.25' data-ref='tb_en-11-p25'>
Please God, the peoples of the world may be led, as the result of the
high endeavors exerted by their rulers and the wise and learned
amongst men, to recognize their best interests. How long will
humanity persist in its waywardness? How long will injustice
continue? How long is chaos and confusion to reign amongst men? How
long will discord agitate the face of society?</p>

<p id='11.26' data-ref='tb_en-11-p26'>
This humble servant is filled with wonder, inasmuch as all men are
endowed with the capacity to see and hear, yet we find them deprived
of the privilege of using these faculties. This servant hath been
prompted to pen these lines by virtue of the tender love he
cherisheth for thee. The winds of despair are, alas, blowing from
every direction, and the strife that divideth and afflicteth the
human race is daily increasing. The signs of impending convulsions
and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order
appeareth to be lamentably defective. I beseech God, exalted be His
glory, that He may graciously awaken the peoples of the earth, may
grant that the end of their conduct may be profitable unto them, and
aid them to accomplish that which beseemeth their station.</p>

<p id='11.27' data-ref='tb_en-11-p27'>
Were man to appreciate the greatness of his station and the loftiness
of his destiny he would manifest naught save goodly character, pure
deeds, and a seemly and praiseworthy conduct. If the learned and wise
men of goodwill were to impart guidance unto the people, the whole
earth would be regarded as one country. Verily this is the undoubted
truth. This servant appealeth to every diligent and enterprising soul
to exert his utmost endeavor and arise to rehabilitate the conditions
in all regions and to quicken the dead with the living waters of
wisdom and utterance, by virtue of the love he cherisheth for God,
the One, the Peerless, the Almighty, the Beneficent.</p>

<p id='11.28' data-ref='tb_en-11-p28'>
No man of wisdom can demonstrate his knowledge save by means of
words. This showeth the significance of the Word as is affirmed in
all the Scriptures, whether of former times or more recently. For it
is through its potency and animating spirit that the people of the
world have attained so eminent a position. Moreover words and
utterances should be both impressive and penetrating. However, no
word will be infused with these two qualities unless it be uttered
wholly for the sake of God and with due regard unto the exigencies of
the occasion and the people.</p>

<p id='11.29' data-ref='tb_en-11-p29'>
The Great Being saith: Human utterance is an essence which aspireth
to exert its influence and needeth moderation. As to its influence,
this is conditional upon refinement which in turn is dependent upon
hearts which are detached and pure. As to its moderation, this hath
to be combined with tact and wisdom as prescribed in the Holy
Scriptures and Tablets.</p>

<p id='11.30' data-ref='tb_en-11-p30'>
Every word is endowed with a spirit, therefore the speaker or
expounder should carefully deliver his words at the appropriate time
and place, for the impression which each word maketh is clearly
evident and perceptible. The Great Being saith: One word may be
likened unto fire, another unto light, and the influence which both
exert is manifest in the world. Therefore an enlightened man of
wisdom should primarily speak with words as mild as milk, that the
children of men may be nurtured and edified thereby and may attain
the ultimate goal of human existence which is the station of true
understanding and nobility. And likewise He saith: One word is like
unto springtime causing the tender saplings of the rose-garden of
knowledge to become verdant and flourishing, while another word is
even as a deadly poison. It behooveth a prudent man of wisdom to
speak with utmost leniency and forbearance so that the sweetness of
his words may induce everyone to attain that which befitteth man’s
station.</p>

<p id='11.31' data-ref='tb_en-11-p31'>
O friend of mine! The Word of God is the king of words and its
pervasive influence is incalculable. It hath ever dominated and will
continue to dominate the realm of being. The Great Being saith: The
Word is the master key for the whole world, inasmuch as through its
potency the doors of the hearts of men, which in reality are the
doors of heaven, are unlocked. No sooner had but a glimmer of its
effulgent splendor shone forth upon the mirror of love than the
blessed word “I am the Best-Beloved” was reflected therein. It is
an ocean inexhaustible in riches, comprehending all things. Every
thing which can be perceived is but an emanation therefrom. High,
immeasurably high is this sublime station, in whose shadow moveth the
essence of loftiness and splendor, wrapt in praise and adoration.</p>

<p id='11.32' data-ref='tb_en-11-p32'>
Methinks people’s sense of taste hath, alas, been sorely affected
by the fever of negligence and folly, for they are found to be wholly
unconscious and deprived of the sweetness of His utterance. How
regrettable indeed that man should debar himself from the fruits of
the tree of wisdom while his days and hours pass swiftly away. Please
God, the hand of divine power may safeguard all mankind and direct
their steps towards the horizon of true understanding.</p>

<p id='11.33' data-ref='tb_en-11-p33'>
Verily our Lord of Mercy is the Helper, the Knowing, the Wise.</p>

<p id='11.34' data-ref='tb_en-11-p34'>
I would like to add that thy second letter which had been sent from
Jerusalem hath been received and that which thou hadst written and
set forth therein was perused and read in His presence. He bade me
write as follows:</p>

<p id='11.35' data-ref='tb_en-11-p35'>
O Maqṣúd! We have heard thy voice and perceived the sighing and
lamentation thou didst raise in thy longing and eagerness. Praised be
God! The sweet savors of love could be inhaled from every word
thereof. Please God, this bounty may last for ever. The
Servant-in-Attendance recited the verses thou hast composed. Thy name
is often mentioned in the presence of this Wronged One and the
glances of Our loving-kindness and compassion are directed towards
thee.</p>

<p id='11.36' data-ref='tb_en-11-p36'>
Great is the station of man. Great must also be his endeavors for the
rehabilitation of the world and the well-being of nations. I beseech
the One true God to graciously confirm thee in that which beseemeth
man’s station.</p>

<p id='11.37' data-ref='tb_en-11-p37'>
Be thou guided by wisdom under all conditions, inasmuch as persons
who harbor evil motives have been and are still diligently engaged in
intriguing. Gracious God! Unto that immeasurably exalted Being Who
seeketh naught but to foster the spirit of love and fellowship
amongst men, and to revive the world and ennoble its life, they have
imputed such charges as the tongue and the pen are ashamed to
recount.</p>

<p id='11.38' data-ref='tb_en-11-p38'>
We have remembered thee and make mention of thee now. We entreat
Him — exalted is His glory — to protect thee with the hands of might
and power and enable thee to recognize that which will serve thy best
interests both in this world and in the next. He is the Lord of
Mankind, the Possessor of the Throne on High and of the world below.
No God is there besides Him, the Omnipotent, the Powerful. God grant
that this Wronged One may observe fidelity. He hath not forgotten nor
will He ever forget thee.</p>

<p id='11.39' data-ref='tb_en-11-p39'>
Thou hast mentioned thine intention to stay in Damascus until spring,
then to proceed to Mosul, should the means be forthcoming. This lowly
servant entreateth God — exalted is His glory — to provide such means
as is deemed expedient, and to aid thee. He is Potent and Powerful.</p>

<p id='11.40' data-ref='tb_en-11-p40'>
Although all the inhabitants of this region have been treated with
the utmost kindness, yet no evidence of fellowship can be discerned
from them. Thou shouldst observe much tact and wisdom, for they seek
at all times to cavil at and deny the Cause. May the One true God
grant them equity.</p>

<p id='11.41' data-ref='tb_en-11-p41'>
Concerning thine own affairs, if thou wouldst content thyself with
whatever might come to pass it would be praiseworthy. To engage in
some profession is highly commendable, for when occupied with work
one is less likely to dwell on the unpleasant aspects of life. God
willing thou mayest experience joy and radiance, gladness and
exultation in any city or land where thou mayest happen to sojourn.
This lowly servant will never forget that distinguished and kind
friend. He hath remembered and will continue to remember thee. The
decree lieth with God, the Lord of all worlds. I fain would hope He
may vouchsafe divine assistance and grant confirmation in that which
is pleasing and acceptable unto Him.</p>

<p id='11.42' data-ref='tb_en-11-p42'>
Every word of thy poetry is indeed like unto a mirror in which the
evidences of the devotion and love thou cherishest for God and His
chosen ones are reflected. Well is it with thee who hast quaffed the
choice wine of utterance and partaken of the soft flowing stream of
true knowledge. Happy is he who hath drunk his fill and attained unto
Him and woe betide the heedless. Its perusal hath truly proved highly
impressive, for it was indicative of both the light of reunion and
the fire of separation.</p>

<p id='11.43' data-ref='tb_en-11-p43'>
Far be it from us to despair at any time of the incalculable favors
of God, for if it were His wish He could cause a mere atom to be
transformed into a sun and a single drop into an ocean. He unlocketh
thousands of doors, while man is incapable of conceiving even a
single one.</p>

<p id='11.44' data-ref='tb_en-11-p44'>
So heedless is this servant that with words such as these he seeketh
to vindicate the supreme power of God — exalted be His glory. I
implore pardon of God, the Most Great, for these assertions and
affirm that this servant at all times recognizeth his grievous
trespasses and misdeeds. He entreateth remission of his sins from the
ocean of the forgiveness of his Lord, the Most Exalted, and beggeth
for that which will make him wholly devoted to God and enable him to
utter His praise, turn himself toward Him and to put his whole trust
in Him. Verily He is the Potent, the Forgiving, the Merciful. Praised
be God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p id='11.45' data-ref='tb_en-11-p45'>
This lowly one hath read the descriptions of the dialogue with the
traveler which thou hast recounted in thy letter to my Lord, may my
life be offered up for His sake. The explanations which were set
forth awaken the people from the slumber of heedlessness. Indeed the
actions of man himself breed a profusion of satanic power. For were
men to abide by and observe the divine teachings, every trace of evil
would be banished from the face of the earth. However, the widespread
differences that exist among mankind and the prevalence of sedition,
contention, conflict and the like are the primary factors which
provoke the appearance of the satanic spirit. Yet the Holy Spirit
hath ever shunned such matters. A world in which naught can be
perceived save strife, quarrels and corruption is bound to become the
seat of the throne, the very metropolis, of Satan.</p>

<p id='11.46' data-ref='tb_en-11-p46'>
How vast the number of the loved and chosen ones of God who have
lamented and moaned by day and by night that haply a sweet and
fragrant breeze might blow from the court of His good-pleasure and
dispel altogether the loathsome and foul-smelling odors from the
world. However, this ultimate goal could not be attained, and men
were deprived thereof by virtue of their evil deeds, which brought
upon them the retribution of God, in accordance with the basic
principles of His divine rule. Ours is the duty to remain patient in
these circumstances until relief be forthcoming from God, the
Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>

<p id='11.47' data-ref='tb_en-11-p47'>
Magnified be Thy Name, O Lord of all beings and Desire of all created
things! I beseech Thee, by the Word which hath caused the Burning
Bush to lift up its Voice and the Rock to cry out, whereby the
well-favored have hastened to attain the court of Thy presence and
the pure in heart the dayspring of the light of Thy countenance, and
by the sighing of Thy true lovers in their separation from Thy chosen
ones and by the lamentation of them that long to behold Thy face
before the dawning splendor of the light of Thy Revelation, to
graciously enable Thy servants to recognize what Thou hast ordained
for them by Thy bounty and Thy grace. Prescribe for them then through
Thy Pen of Glory that which will direct their steps to the ocean of
Thy generosity and will lead them unto the living waters of Thy
heavenly reunion.</p>

<p id='11.48' data-ref='tb_en-11-p48'>
O Lord! Look not at the things they have wrought, rather look unto
the loftiness of Thy celestial bounty which hath preceded all created
things, visible and invisible. O Lord! Illumine their hearts with the
effulgent light of Thy knowledge and brighten their eyes with the
shining splendor of the daystar of Thy favors.</p>

<p id='11.49' data-ref='tb_en-11-p49'>
I entreat Thee, O Lord of Names and Creator of the heavens, by the
blood spilt in Thy Path, and by the heads carried aloft on spears for
the sake of Thy love, and by the souls that have melted in their
separation from Thy loved ones, and by the hearts broken for the
exaltation of Thy Word, to grant that the dwellers of Thy realm may
unite together in their allegiance to Thine incomparable Word so that
they may all acknowledge Thy unity and Thy oneness. There is no God
but Thee, the Omnipotent, the Most Exalted, the Knowing, the Wise.</p>

<p id='11.50' data-ref='tb_en-11-p50'>
I fain would hope that He Who is the All-Sufficing, the Inaccessible,
may heed the solicitation of this lowly servant, may attire the
people of the world with the raiment of goodly deeds and purge them
from evil inclinations. He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Wise,
the All-Perceiving. He heareth and seeth; He is the All-Hearing, the
All-Seeing.</p>

<p id='12.2' data-ref='tb_en-12-p2'>
Blessed art thou O Vafá, inasmuch as thou hast been faithful to the
Covenant of God and His Testament at a time when all men have
violated it and have repudiated the One in Whom they had believed,
and this notwithstanding that He hath appeared invested with every
testimony, and hath dawned from the horizon of Revelation clothed
with undoubted sovereignty.</p>

<p id='12.3' data-ref='tb_en-12-p3'>
It behooveth thee, however, to exert thine utmost to attain the very
essence of fidelity. This implieth to be well assured in thy heart
and to testify with thy tongue to that whereunto God hath testified
for His Own exalted Self, proclaiming: “Verily, self-subsisting am
I within the Realm of Glory.” Whoso is enabled in these days to
solemnly affirm this truth, hath attained unto all good, and the
heavenly Spirit shall descend upon him in the daytime and in the
night season, shall graciously assist him to glorify the Name of his
Lord and suffer him to unloose his tongue and uphold with his words
the Cause of his Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. And none can
ever achieve this except he who hath purged his heart from whatsoever
is created between heaven and earth, and hath entirely detached
himself from all but God, the sovereign Lord, the Almighty, the
Gracious.</p>

<p id='12.4' data-ref='tb_en-12-p4'>
Arise thou to serve the Cause and say: I swear by the righteousness
of God! Verily this is the Primal Point, arrayed in His new attire
and manifested in His glorious Name. He at present beholdeth
everything from this Horizon. Indeed He is supreme over all things.
Amongst the Concourse on High He is known as the Most Great
Announcement and in the Realms of Eternity as the Ancient Beauty, and
before the Throne by this Name <a data-fnid='12.2'></a>
which hath caused the footsteps of them that are endued with
understanding to slip.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn12.2'>
The Most Great Name.
</aside>

<p id='12.5' data-ref='tb_en-12-p5'>
Say, I swear by God! In this Revelation even before a single verse
was sent down from the realm of holiness and sublimity, the supreme
testimony of God had been fulfilled for all the inmates of heaven and
the dwellers on earth; moreover, We have revealed the equivalent of
whatsoever was sent down in the Dispensation of the Bayán. Fear ye
God and suffer not your deeds to be rendered vain and be not of them
that are sunk in heedlessness. Open your eyes that ye may behold the
Ancient Beauty from this shining and luminous station.</p>

<p id='12.6' data-ref='tb_en-12-p6'>
Say, God is my witness! The Promised One Himself hath come down from
heaven, seated upon the crimson cloud with the hosts of revelation on
His right, and the angels of inspiration on His left, and the Decree
hath been fulfilled at the behest of God, the Omnipotent, the
Almighty. Thereupon the footsteps of everyone have slipped except
such as God hath protected through His tender mercy and numbered with
those who have recognized Him through His Own Self and detached
themselves from all that pertaineth to the world.</p>

<p id='12.7' data-ref='tb_en-12-p7'>
Hearken thou unto the Words of thy Lord and purify thy heart from
every illusion so that the effulgent light of the remembrance of thy
Lord may shed its radiance upon it, and it may attain the station of
certitude.</p>

<p id='12.8' data-ref='tb_en-12-p8'>
Know thou moreover that thy letter reached Our presence and We
perceived and perused its contents. We noted the questions thou hast
asked and will readily answer thee. It behooveth everyone in this Day
to ask God that which he desireth, and thy Lord will heed his
petition with wondrous and undeniable verses.</p>

<p id='12.9' data-ref='tb_en-12-p9'>
Thou hast asked regarding the subject of the return. Know thou that
the end is like unto the beginning. Even as thou dost consider the
beginning, similarly shouldst thou consider the end, and be of them
that truly perceive. Nay, rather consider the beginning as the end
itself, and so conversely, that thou mayest acquire a clear
perception. Know thou moreover that every created thing is
continually brought forth and returned at the bidding of thy Lord,
the God of power and might.</p>

<p id='12.10' data-ref='tb_en-12-p10'>
As to the Return, as God hath purposed in His sacred and exalted
Tablets wherein He hath made this theme known unto His servants; by
this is meant the return of all created things in the Day of
Resurrection, and this is indeed the essence of the Return as thou
hast witnessed in God’s own days and thou art of them that testify
to this truth.</p>

<p id='12.11' data-ref='tb_en-12-p11'>
Verily God is fully capable of causing all names to appear in one
name, and all souls in one soul. Surely powerful and mighty is He.
And this Return is realized at His behest in whatever form He
willeth. Indeed He is the One Who doeth and ordaineth all things.
Moreover, thou shouldst not perceive the fulfillment of the Return
and the Resurrection save in the Word of thy Lord, the Almighty, the
All-Knowing. For instance, were He to take a handful of earth and
declare it to be the One Whom ye have been following in the past, it
would undoubtedly be just and true, even as His real Person, and to
none is given the right to question His authority. He doeth what He
willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. Moreover, in this
station take thou heed not to turn thy gaze unto limitations and
allusions, but rather unto that whereby the Revelation itself hath
been fulfilled and be of them that are discerning. Thus do We explain
for thee in a lucid and explicit language that thou mayest comprehend
that which thou didst seek from thine ancient Lord.</p>

<p id='12.12' data-ref='tb_en-12-p12'>
Consider thou the Day of Resurrection. Were God to pronounce the
lowliest of creatures among the faithful to be the First One to
believe in the Bayán, thou shouldst have no misgivings about it and
must be of them that truly believe. In this station look not upon
human limitations and names but rather upon that whereby the rank of
the First One to believe is vindicated, which is faith in God, and
recognition of His Being and assurance in the fulfillment of His
irresistible and binding command.</p>

<p id='12.13' data-ref='tb_en-12-p13'>
Consider thou the Revelation of the Point of the Bayán — exalted is
His glory. He pronounced the First One <a data-fnid='12.3'></a>
to believe in Him to be Muḥammad, the Messenger of God. Doth it
beseem a man to dispute with Him by saying that this man is from
Persia, the Other from Arabia, or this one was called Ḥusayn while
the Other bore the name of Muḥammad? Nay, I swear by God’s holy
Being, the Exalted, the Most Great. Surely no man of intelligence and
insight would ever pay attention unto limitations or names, but
rather unto that with which Muḥammad was invested, which was none
other than the Cause of God. Such a man of insight would likewise
consider Ḥusayn and the position he occupied in the Cause of God,
the Omnipotent, the Exalted, the Knowing, the Wise. And since the
First One to believe in God in the Dispensation of the Bayán was
invested with command similar to that with which Muḥammad, the
Messenger of God, was invested, therefore the Báb pronounced him to
be the latter, namely His return and resurrection. This station is
sanctified from every limitation or name, and naught can be seen
therein but God, the One, the Peerless, the All-Knowing.</p>

Know thou moreover that in the Day of Revelation were He to pronounce
one of the leaves to be the manifestation of all His excellent
titles, unto no one is given the right to utter why or wherefore, and
should one do so he would be regarded as a disbeliever in God and be
numbered with such as have repudiated His Truth.</p>

<p id='12.15' data-ref='tb_en-12-p15'>
Beware, beware lest thou behave like unto the people of the Bayán.
For indeed they erred grievously, misguided the people, ignored the
Covenant of God and His Testament and joined partners with Him, the
One, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing. Verily they failed to
recognize the Point of the Bayán, for had they recognized Him they
would not have rejected His manifestation in this luminous and
resplendent Being. And since they fixed their eyes on names,
therefore when He replaced His Name “the Most Exalted” by “the
Most Glorious” their eyes were dimmed. They have failed to
recognize Him in these days and are reckoned with those that perish.
Indeed, had they known Him through His own Self or by virtue of that
which He hath revealed, they would not have repudiated Him when He
appeared in this glorious and incomparable Name, which God hath
ordained to be the Sword of His Revelation between heaven and earth,
and through which truth is separated from error, even from now until
the Day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p id='12.16' data-ref='tb_en-12-p16'>
Know thou moreover that in the Day of His Manifestation all things
besides God shall be brought forth and placed equally, irrespective
of their rank being high or low. The Day of Return is inscrutable
unto all men until after the divine Revelation hath been fulfilled.
He is in truth the One Who ordaineth whatsoever He willeth. When the
Word of God is revealed unto all created things whoso then giveth ear
and heedeth the Call is, indeed, reckoned among the most
distinguished souls, though he be a carrier of ashes. And he who
turneth away is accounted as the lowliest of His servants, though he
be a ruler amongst men and the possessor of all the books that are in
the heavens and on earth.</p>

<p id='12.17' data-ref='tb_en-12-p17'>
It behooveth thee to look with divine insight upon the things We have
revealed and sent unto thee and not towards the people and that which
is current amongst them. They are in this day like unto a blind man
who, while moving in the sunshine, demandeth: Where is the sun? Is it
shining? He would deny and dispute the truth, and would not be of
them that perceive. Never shall he be able to discern the sun or to
understand that which hath intervened between him and it. He would
object within himself, voice protests, and would be among the
rebellious. Such is the state of this people. Leave them unto
themselves, saying: Unto you be that which ye desire and unto us that
which we desire. Wretched indeed is the plight of the ungodly.</p>

<p id='12.18' data-ref='tb_en-12-p18'>
Know thou moreover that the former Manifestation affirmed that the
return and rising of the spirits would occur on the Day of
Resurrection, while in truth there is a return and resurrection for
every created thing. However We do not wish to mention aught that is
not set forth in the Bayán, lest perchance the people of malice
raise a great outcry. O would that that which interveneth between the
children of men and their Creator were dispelled that they might be
enabled to behold God’s invincible sovereignty and dominion, quaff
from the wellspring of His heavenly streams, be sprinkled with the
outpourings of the ocean of true understanding and be purged from the
defilements of the ungodly and the suspicious.</p>

<p id='12.19' data-ref='tb_en-12-p19'>
As to thy question concerning the worlds of God. Know thou of a truth
that the worlds of God are countless in their number, and infinite in
their range. None can reckon or comprehend them except God, the
All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Consider thy state when asleep. Verily, I
say, this phenomenon is the most mysterious of the signs of God
amongst men, were they to ponder it in their hearts. Behold how the
thing which thou hast seen in thy dream is, after a considerable
lapse of time, fully realized. Had the world in which thou didst find
thyself in thy dream been identical with the world in which thou
livest, it would have been necessary for the event occurring in that
dream to have transpired in this world at the very moment of its
occurrence. Were it so, you yourself would have borne witness unto
it. This being not the case, however, it must necessarily follow that
the world in which thou livest is different and apart from that which
thou hast experienced in thy dream. This latter world hath neither
beginning nor end. It would be true if thou wert to contend that this
same world is, as decreed by the All-Glorious and Almighty God,
within thy proper self and is wrapped up within thee. It would
equally be true to maintain that thy spirit, having transcended the
limitations of sleep and having stripped itself of all earthly
attachment, hath, by the act of God, been made to traverse a realm
which lieth hidden in the innermost reality of this world. Verily I
say, the creation of God embraceth worlds besides this world, and
creatures apart from these creatures. In each of these worlds He hath
ordained things which none can search except Himself, the
All-Searching, the All-Wise. Do thou meditate on that which We have
revealed unto thee, that thou mayest discover the purpose of God, thy
Lord, and the Lord of all worlds. In these words the mysteries of
Divine Wisdom have been treasured. We have refrained from dwelling
upon this theme owing to the sorrow that hath encompassed Us from the
actions of them that have been created through Our words, if ye be of
them that will hearken unto Our Voice.</p>

<p id='12.20' data-ref='tb_en-12-p20'>
Where is the one who can help Me and shield Me from the swords of
these faithless souls? Where is the man of insight who will behold
the Words of God with his own eyes and rid himself of the opinions
and notions of the peoples of the earth?</p>

<p id='12.21' data-ref='tb_en-12-p21'>
O servant! Warn thou the servants of God not to reject that which
they do not comprehend. Say, implore God to open to your hearts the
portals of true understanding that ye may be apprised of that of
which no one is apprised. Verily, He is the Giver, the Forgiving, the
Compassionate.</p>

<p id='12.22' data-ref='tb_en-12-p22'>
Thou hast moreover asked Me concerning the ordinances of God. Know
thou of a truth that whatsoever hath been prescribed in the Book is
indeed the truth, no doubt is there about it, and it is incumbent
upon everyone to observe that which hath been sent down by Him Who is
the Revealer, the All-Knowing. Were a man to put them away despite
his being aware thereof, God would truly be clear of such a one and
We too would be clear of him, inasmuch as His ordinances constitute
the fruits of the divine Tree and none other than the heedless and
the wayward will deviate therefrom.</p>

<p id='12.23' data-ref='tb_en-12-p23'>
As to Paradise: It is a reality and there can be no doubt about it,
and now in this world it is realized through love of Me and My
good-pleasure. Whosoever attaineth unto it God will aid him in this
world below, and after death He will enable him to gain admittance
into Paradise whose vastness is as that of heaven and earth. Therein
the Maids of glory and holiness will wait upon him in the daytime and
in the night season, while the daystar of the unfading beauty of his
Lord will at all times shed its radiance upon him and he will shine
so brightly that no one shall bear to gaze at him. Such is the
dispensation of Providence, yet the people are shut out by a grievous
veil. Likewise apprehend thou the nature of hell-fire and be of them
that truly believe. For every act performed there shall be a
recompense according to the estimate of God, and unto this the very
ordinances and prohibitions prescribed by the Almighty amply bear
witness. For surely if deeds were not rewarded and yielded no fruit,
then the Cause of God — exalted is He — would prove futile.
Immeasurably high is He exalted above such blasphemies! However, unto
them that are rid of all attachments a deed is, verily, its own
reward. Were We to enlarge upon this theme numerous Tablets would
need to be written.</p>

<p id='12.24' data-ref='tb_en-12-p24'>
I swear by the righteousness of the One true God! The Pen is unable
to move by reason of that which hath befallen its Lord, and it
weepeth sore, and so do I weep, and likewise weepeth the eye of Him
Who is the Essence of Grandeur behind the Tabernacle of Names while
seated on the Throne of His glorious Name.</p>

<p id='12.25' data-ref='tb_en-12-p25'>
Purge thou thy heart that We may cause fountains of wisdom and
utterance to gush out therefrom, thus enabling thee to raise thy
voice among all mankind. Unloose thy tongue and proclaim the truth
for the sake of the remembrance of thy merciful Lord. Be not afraid
of anyone, place thy whole trust in God, the Almighty, the
All-Knowing. Say, O people, fulfill whatever ye understand of the
Persian Bayán and whatever ye understand not ask this unerring
Remembrance that He may set forth clearly that which God hath
intended in His Book, for in truth He knoweth that which is enshrined
in the Bayán by virtue of the Will of Him Who is the Omnipotent, the
Powerful.</p>

<p id='12.26' data-ref='tb_en-12-p26'>
Thou hast inquired about the warning We gave to the people at the
time of Our departure from ‘Iráq to the effect that when the Sun
disappeareth from sight, birds of darkness will be in motion and the
standards of Samírí <a data-fnid='12.4'></a>
will be reared high. I swear by God! Those birds have stirred in
these days and Samírí hath raised his clamor. Well is it with him
who recognizeth and is numbered with men of understanding. We have
also warned them against the appearance of the calf. God is My
witness! All Our warnings have come to pass, as indeed, they are
bound to, inasmuch as they have issued from the fingers of glory and
might. Beseech thou God to protect thee from the mischief of these
men and to purify thee from the insinuations of the froward.
Strengthen thy loins then for the promotion of the Cause and pay no
attention unto the words uttered by the people of the Bayán, for
they are truly incapable of understanding and have failed to
comprehend the essence of the Cause as is revealed in this august,
this Most Great Announcement. Thus have We inspired thee, and infused
into thy heart that which will make thee independent of the allusions
of mankind.</p>

words thou dost utter for the love of God, thy Lord, and remain
steadfast in His Cause. All praise be unto God, the Lord of the

O My Name! <a data-fnid='13.1'></a>  Yield thou
praise unto God for having graciously chosen thee to be a shower of
bounty for that which We have sown in the pure and blessed soil and
enabled thee to serve as a springtime of tender mercy for the
wondrous and sublime trees We have planted. Indeed so great is this
favor that of all created things in the world of existence, none can
ever hope to rival it. We have moreover given thee to drink the
choice wine of utterance from the chalice of the heavenly bestowals
of thy merciful Lord, which is none other than this Tongue of
holiness — a Tongue that, as soon as it was unloosed, quickened the
entire creation, set in motion all beings and caused the Nightingale
to pour forth its melodies. This is the Fountain of living water for
all that dwell in the realm of being.

Siyyid Mihdíy-i-Dahají, to whom this Tablet was addressed, had
	been given by Bahá’u’lláh the title Ismu’lláhi’l-Mihdí,
	“The Name of God, Mihdí.” He later broke the Covenant. (See <i>God
	Passes By</i>, Chapter XXI, paragraph beginning “And finally, he
	who, from the moment the Divine Covenant was born…”.)
</aside>

<p id='13.2' data-ref='tb_en-13-p2'>
Oftentimes have We wafted upon thee the sweet savors of the
All-Merciful from this Branch which moveth over the Tablet of thy
Lord, the Mighty, the Unconstrained. By the righteousness of the One
true God! Were all created things, visible and invisible, to direct
themselves towards Him, thou wouldst find them winging their flight
unto the Supreme Goal, the Spot wherein the divine Lote-Tree
exclaimeth: Verily, no God is there but Me, the Almighty, the
All-Bountiful.</p>

<p id='13.3' data-ref='tb_en-13-p3'>
Great is thy blessedness, inasmuch as thou hast been journeying
throughout the lands of God, and been the embodiment of joy and
assurance for the people of Bahá who have renounced all else but
Him, and set their hearts towards this Court which hath shed its
radiance upon all realms, and sprinkled them with the surging waters
of this Ocean wherewith thou thyself hast been sprinkled — an Ocean
which hath encompassed all created things.</p>

<p id='13.4' data-ref='tb_en-13-p4'>
Indeed thou didst grasp the significance of rendering assistance unto
God and didst arise to achieve this through the power of wisdom and
utterance. Say: To assist Me is to teach My Cause. This is a theme
with which whole Tablets are laden. This is the changeless
commandment of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future.
Comprehend this, O ye men of insight. They that have passed beyond
the bounds of wisdom fail to understand the meaning of assisting God
as set forth in the Book. Say: Fear ye God and sow not the seeds of
dissension amongst men. Observe ye that which hath been enjoined upon
you by your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. He knoweth the
reality of victory and hath taught it to you with an utterance that
the vain imaginings of them that rove distraught in the wilderness of
doubt can never corrupt.</p>

<p id='13.5' data-ref='tb_en-13-p5'>
O My Name! Suffer all created things to quaff once again from this
chalice which hath caused the seas to rise. Kindle then in the hearts
the blazing fire which this crimson Tree hath ignited, that they may
arise to extol and magnify His Name amidst the adherents of all
Faiths.</p>

<p id='13.6' data-ref='tb_en-13-p6'>
Numerous letters from thee have been presented before Our Throne. We
have perused them as a token of grace on Our part, and for each name
thou didst mention therein We have revealed that which will stir the
minds of men and will cause the spirits to soar. Moreover We have
repeatedly enabled thee to hearken unto the warblings of the birds of
heaven and to incline thine ear to the songs of the nightingales
pouring forth their melodies upon the branches. Thus was the Pen of
God set in motion in thy remembrance that thou mightest admonish men
through the power of this utterance which is divinely ordained to be
the revealer of the signs of His glory.</p>

<p id='13.7' data-ref='tb_en-13-p7'>
Blessed is the spot wherein the anthem of His praise is raised, and
blessed the ear that hearkeneth unto that which hath been sent down
from the heaven of the loving-kindness of thy Lord, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p id='13.8' data-ref='tb_en-13-p8'>
Exhort thou the servants of God unto that whereunto We have exhorted
thee that they may abstain from whatsoever is forbidden them in the
Mother Book. Those who perpetrate deeds that would create turmoil
among the people have indeed strayed far from helping God and His
Cause and are numbered with the mischief-makers in the Tablet which
God hath designated to be the dawning-place of all Tablets.</p>

<p id='13.9' data-ref='tb_en-13-p9'>
Say: If it be Our pleasure We shall render the Cause victorious
through the power of a single word from Our presence. He is in truth
the Omnipotent, the All-Compelling. Should it be God’s intention,
there would appear out of the forests of celestial might the lion of
indomitable strength whose roaring is like unto the peals of thunder
reverberating in the mountains. However, since Our loving providence
surpasseth all things, We have ordained that complete victory should
be achieved through speech and utterance, that Our servants
throughout the earth may thereby become the recipients of divine
good. This is but a token of God’s bounty vouchsafed unto them.
Verily thy Lord is the All-Sufficing, the Most Exalted.</p>

<p id='13.10' data-ref='tb_en-13-p10'>
Say: Fear ye God and commit not such deeds as would cause My loved
ones on earth to lament. Thus biddeth you this Pen which hath set the
Pen of Glory in motion within the arena of wisdom and true
understanding.</p>

<p id='13.11' data-ref='tb_en-13-p11'>
Convey My greetings unto those whose faces mirror forth the radiance
of Bahá, then mention to them this utterance which cheereth the eyes
of the righteous. The glory of God rest upon thee and upon such as
have firmly clung to the Cord of God, the Revealer of verses.…</p>

<p id='13.12' data-ref='tb_en-13-p12'>
Restrain thou the inhabitants of those regions from provocative acts,
from strife, dissension or aught else that would create trouble. That
which is praiseworthy in these days is the promotion of the Cause.
For instance if those people who pursue certain aims were to dedicate
themselves to the teaching of the Cause, all the dwellers of those
regions would, ere long, be invested with the mantle of faith.</p>

<p id='13.13' data-ref='tb_en-13-p13'>
Should anyone perceive the sweetness of the following passage in the
Tablet revealed in honor of Nabíl of Qá’in, <a data-fnid='13.2'></a>
he would readily comprehend the significance of assistance: Human
utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence and
needeth moderation. As to its influence, this is conditional upon
refinement, which in turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached
and pure. As to its moderation, this hath to be combined with tact
and wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures and Tablets.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn13.2'>
Nabíl-i-Akbar. See Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat, beginning note
</aside>

<p id='13.14' data-ref='tb_en-13-p14'>
O My Name! Utterance must needs possess penetrating power. For if
bereft of this quality it would fail to exert influence. And this
penetrating influence dependeth on the spirit being pure and the
heart stainless. Likewise it needeth moderation, without which the
hearer would be unable to bear it, rather he would manifest
opposition from the very outset. And moderation will be obtained by
blending utterance with the tokens of divine wisdom which are
recorded in the sacred Books and Tablets. Thus when the essence of
one’s utterance is endowed with these two requisites it will prove
highly effective and will be the prime factor in transforming the
souls of men. This is the station of supreme victory and celestial
dominion. Whoso attaineth thereto is invested with the power to teach
the Cause of God and to prevail over the hearts and minds of men.</p>

<p id='13.15' data-ref='tb_en-13-p15'>
O My Name! The Daystar of utterance, shining resplendent from the
dayspring of divine Revelation, hath so illumined the Scrolls and
Tablets that the kingdom of utterance and the exalted dominion of
understanding vibrate with joy and ecstasy and shine forth with the
splendor of His light, yet the generality of mankind comprehend not.</p>

<p id='13.16' data-ref='tb_en-13-p16'>
The reason why the subject of aid and assistance hath time and again
streamed and will continue to stream from the Pen of Providence is to
warn the friends of God lest they engage in activities that would
give rise to strife and turmoil. It is incumbent upon them, one and
all, to diligently seek ways to help the Cause of God in such manner
as We have explained. This is but a token of His grace especially
conferred upon His loved ones that every one of them may attain the
station characterized by the words: “Whoso quickeneth a soul hath
verily quickened all mankind.”</p>

<p id='13.17' data-ref='tb_en-13-p17'>
Temporal ascendancy hath been and will continue to be under the
shadow of this station. Its appointed hour is preordained in the Book
of God. He is truly cognizant thereof and it will be manifested
through the potency of His might. Verily He is the Powerful, the
All-Subduing, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p id='13.18' data-ref='tb_en-13-p18'>
The sanctified souls should ponder and meditate in their hearts
regarding the methods of teaching. From the texts of the wondrous,
heavenly Scriptures they should memorize phrases and passages bearing
on various instances, so that in the course of their speech they may
recite divine verses whenever the occasion demandeth it, inasmuch as
these holy verses are the most potent elixir, the greatest and
mightiest talisman. So potent is their influence that the hearer will
have no cause for vacillation. I swear by My life! This Revelation is
endowed with such a power that it will act as the lodestone for all
nations and kindreds of the earth. Should one pause to meditate
attentively he would recognize that no place is there, nor can there
be, for anyone to flee to.</p>

<p id='13.19' data-ref='tb_en-13-p19'>
In such manner hath the Kitáb-i-Aqdas been revealed that it
attracteth and embraceth all the divinely appointed Dispensations.
Blessed those who peruse it. Blessed those who apprehend it. Blessed
those who meditate upon it. Blessed those who ponder its meaning. So
vast is its range that it hath encompassed all men ere their
recognition of it. Ere long will its sovereign power, its pervasive
influence and the greatness of its might be manifested on earth.
Verily, thy God is the All-Knowing, the All-informed.</p>

<p id='13.20' data-ref='tb_en-13-p20'>
O My Name! Hearken thou unto My Voice coming from the direction of My
Throne. He wisheth to make mention of thy name at all times inasmuch
as thou hast proved thyself steadfast in extolling His virtues
amongst men. Indeed thy Lord loveth fidelity as found in the realm of
creation, and He hath given it precedence over most of the
praiseworthy qualities. Verily, He is Potent and Powerful.</p>

<p id='13.21' data-ref='tb_en-13-p21'>
Know thou moreover that We have heard the praise thou hast uttered in
thy communion with God, thy Lord, the Exalted, the Gracious. Great
indeed is the blessedness awaiting thee, inasmuch as thou hast
curtailed thine own affairs in favor of this inviolable, this mighty
and enlightened Cause. We entreat God to make thy call a magnet which
will attract the embodiments of names in the world of existence that
all beings may spontaneously hasten to heed it. No God is there
besides Him, the Exalted, the Preeminent, the Ever-Blessed, the
Sublime, the Most August, the Most Glorious, the Most Bountiful, the
All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

 This Tablet was

of Martyrs (see <i>God Passes By</i>, Chapter VIII, paragraph
beginning “In Iṣfahán Mullá Káẓim was beheaded…”) and
was addressed to <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>

who was <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muḥammad

He is the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! The winds of
hatred have encompassed the Ark of Baṭḥá, <a data-fnid='14.1'></a>
by reason of that which the hands of the oppressors have wrought. O
Báqir! Thou hast pronounced sentence against them for whom the books
of the world have wept, and in whose favor the scriptures of all
religions have testified. Thou, who art gone far astray, art indeed
wrapt in a thick veil. By God Himself! Thou hast pronounced judgment
against them through whom the horizon of faith hath been illumined.
Unto this bear witness They Who are the Dawning-Places of Revelation
and the Manifestations of the Cause of thy Lord, the Most Merciful,
Who have sacrificed Their souls and all that They possessed in His
straight Path. The Faith of God hath cried everywhere, by reason of
thy tyranny, and yet thou disportest thyself and art of them that
exult. There is no hatred in Mine heart for thee nor for anyone.
Every man of learning beholdeth thee, and such as are like thee,
engulfed in evident folly. Hadst thou realized that which thou hast
done, thou wouldst have cast thyself into the fire, or abandoned
thine home and fled into the mountains, or wouldst have groaned until
thou hadst returned unto the place destined for thee by Him Who is
the Lord of strength and of might. O thou who art even as nothing!
Rend thou asunder the veils of idle fancies and vain imaginings, that
thou mayest behold the Daystar of knowledge shining from this
resplendent Horizon. Thou hast torn in pieces a remnant of the
Prophet Himself, and imagined that thou hadst helped the Faith of
God. Thus hath thy soul prompted thee, and thou art truly one of the
heedless. Thine act hath consumed the hearts of the Concourse on
high, and those of such as have circled round the Cause of God, the
Lord of the worlds. The soul of the Chaste One <a data-fnid='14.2'></a>
melted, by reason of thy cruelty, and the inmates of Paradise wept
sore in that blessed Spot.

denial of Muḥammad, the Apostle of God when He came unto them with

turned into light the darkness of the earth, and enraptured the
hearts of such as had known Him? Indeed thou hast produced, in this
day, the same proofs which the foolish divines advanced in that age.
Unto this testifieth He Who is the King of the realm of grace in this
great Prison. Thou hast, truly, walked in their ways, nay, hast
surpassed them in their cruelty, and hast deemed thyself to be
helping the Faith and defending the Law of God, the All-Knowing, the
All-Wise. By Him Who is the Truth! Thine iniquity hath made Gabriel

breezes of justice have been wafted over all who are in heaven and on

O thou who hast gone astray! Thou hast neither seen Me, nor
associated with Me, nor been My companion for the fraction of a
moment. How is it, then, that thou hast bidden men to curse Me? Didst
thou, in this, follow the promptings of thine own desires, or didst
thou obey thy Lord? Produce thou a sign, if thou art one of the
truthful. We testify that thou hast cast behind thy back the Law of
God, and laid hold on the dictates of thy passions. Nothing, in

hath revealed in the Qur’án: “Say not to every one who meeteth
you with a greeting, ‘Thou art not a believer.’” <a data-fnid='14.4'></a>
Thus hath He decreed in Whose grasp are the kingdoms of Revelation
and of creation, if thou be of them that hearken. Thou hast set aside
the commandment of God, and clung unto the promptings of thine own
desire. Woe, then, unto thee, O careless one that doubtest! If thou
deniest Me, by what proof canst thou vindicate the truth of that
which thou dost possess? Produce it, then, O thou who hast joined

O foolish one! Know thou that he is truly learned who hath
acknowledged My Revelation, and drunk from the Ocean of My knowledge,
and soared in the atmosphere of My love, and cast away all else
besides Me, and taken firm hold on that which hath been sent down
from the Kingdom of My wondrous utterance. He, verily, is even as an

creation. Glorified be the All-Merciful Who hath enlightened him, and
caused him to arise and serve His great and mighty Cause. Verily,
such a man is blessed by the Concourse on high, and by them who dwell
within the Tabernacle of Grandeur, who have quaffed My sealed Wine in
My Name, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful. O Báqir! If thou be of
them that occupy such a sublime station, produce then a sign from
God, the Creator of the heavens. And shouldst thou recognize thy
powerlessness, do thou rein in thy passions, and return unto thy
Lord, that perchance He may forgive thee thy sins which have caused
the leaves of the Divine Lote-Tree to be burnt up, and the Rock to
cry out, and the eyes of men of understanding to weep. Because of
thee the Veil of Divinity was rent asunder, and the Ark foundered,
and the She-Camel was hamstrung, and the Spirit <a data-fnid='14.5'></a>

earth? Open thine eyes that thou mayest behold this Wronged One

thou mayest hearken unto the speech of the Divine Lote-Tree that hath
been raised up in truth by God, the Almighty, the Beneficent. Verily,
this Tree, notwithstanding the things that befell it by reason of thy
cruelty and of the transgressions of such as are like thee, calleth
aloud and summoneth all men unto the Sadratu’l-Muntahá <a data-fnid='14.6'></a>

betwixt earth and heaven We offered up Our souls, and Our bodies, and
Our sons, and Our possessions in the path of God, the Exalted, the

Us in this straight Path. By God! Our hearts were consumed, and Our

Dayspring of Revelation hath come with clear tokens which none can
number. This is the day whereon every man endued with perception hath
discovered the fragrance of the breeze of the All-Merciful in the
world of creation, and every man of insight hath hastened unto the
living waters of the mercy of His Lord, the King of Kings. O heedless

hath made to be the Repository of His Revelation, if thou be of them

with God, and woe betide them that have taken thee as their leader,
without a clear token or a perspicuous Book. How numerous the
oppressors before thee who have arisen to quench the light of God,
and how many the impious who murdered and pillaged until the hearts
and souls of men groaned by reason of their cruelty! The sun of
justice hath been obscured, inasmuch as the embodiment of tyranny
hath been stablished upon the throne of hatred, and yet the people
understand not. The children of the Apostle have been slain and their
possessions pillaged. Say: Was it, in thine estimation, their
possessions or themselves that denied God? Judge fairly, O ignorant
one that hath been shut out as by a veil from God. Thou hast clung to
tyranny and cast away justice; whereupon all created things have
lamented, and still thou art among the wayward. Thou hast put to
death the aged, and plundered the young. Thinkest thou that thou wilt
consume that which thine iniquity hath amassed? Nay, by Myself! Thus
informeth thee He Who is cognizant of all. By God! The things thou
possessest shall profit thee not, nor what thou hast laid up through
thy cruelty. Unto this beareth witness Thy Lord, the All-Knowing.
Thou hast arisen to put out the light of this Cause; ere long will
thine own fire be quenched, at His behest. He, verily, is the Lord of
strength and of might. The changes and chances of the world, and the
powers of the nations, cannot frustrate Him. He doeth what He
pleaseth, and ordaineth what He willeth through the power of His
sovereignty. Consider the she-camel. Though but a beast, yet hath the
All-Merciful exalted her to so high a station that the tongues of the
earth made mention of her and celebrated her praise. He, verily,
overshadoweth all that is in the heavens and on earth. No God is
there but Him, the Almighty, the Great. Thus have We adorned the
heaven of Our Tablet with the suns of Our words. Blessed the man that
hath attained thereunto and been illumined with their light, and woe
betide such as have turned aside, and denied Him, and strayed far
from Him. Praised be God, the Lord of the worlds!

Although the Realm of Glory hath none of the vanities of the world,
yet within the treasury of trust and resignation We have bequeathed
to Our heirs an excellent and priceless Heritage. Earthly treasures
We have not bequeathed, nor have We added such cares as they entail.
By God! In earthly riches fear is hidden and peril is concealed.
Consider ye and call to mind that which the All-Merciful hath
revealed in the Qur’án: “Woe betide every slanderer and defamer,
him that layeth up riches and counteth them.” <a data-fnid='15.1'></a>

The aim of this Wronged One in sustaining woes and tribulations, in
revealing the Holy Verses and in demonstrating proofs hath been
naught but to quench the flame of hate and enmity, that the horizon
of the hearts of men may be illumined with the light of concord and
attain real peace and tranquility. From the dawning-place of the
divine Tablet the daystar of this utterance shineth resplendent, and
it behooveth everyone to fix his gaze upon it: We exhort you, O
peoples of the world, to observe that which will elevate your
station. Hold fast to the fear of God and firmly adhere to what is
right. Verily I say, the tongue is for mentioning what is good,
defile it not with unseemly talk. God hath forgiven what is past.
Henceforward everyone should utter that which is meet and seemly, and
should refrain from slander, abuse and whatever causeth sadness in
men. Lofty is the station of man! Not long ago this exalted Word
streamed forth from the treasury of Our Pen of Glory: Great and
blessed is this Day — the Day in which all that lay latent in man
hath been and will be made manifest. Lofty is the station of man,
were he to hold fast to righteousness and truth and to remain firm
and steadfast in the Cause. In the eyes of the All-Merciful a true
man appeareth even as a firmament; its sun and moon are his sight and
hearing, and his shining and resplendent character its stars. His is
the loftiest station, and his influence educateth the world of being.</p>

Every receptive soul who hath in this Day inhaled the fragrance of

Crimson Book. Grasp ye, in My Name, the chalice of My
loving-kindness, drink then your fill in My glorious and wondrous
remembrance.</p>

<p id='15.4' data-ref='tb_en-15-p4'>
O ye that dwell on earth! The religion of God is for love and unity;
make it not the cause of enmity or dissension. In the eyes of men of
insight and the beholders of the Most Sublime Vision, whatsoever are
the effective means for safeguarding and promoting the happiness and
welfare of the children of men have already been revealed by the Pen
of Glory. But the foolish ones of the earth, being nurtured in evil
passions and desires, have remained heedless of the consummate wisdom
of Him Who is, in truth, the All-Wise, while their words and deeds
are prompted by idle fancies and vain imaginings.</p>

<p id='15.5' data-ref='tb_en-15-p5'>
O ye the loved ones and the trustees of God! Kings are the
manifestations of the power, and the daysprings of the might and
riches, of God. Pray ye on their behalf. He hath invested them with
the rulership of the earth and hath singled out the hearts of men as
His Own domain.</p>

<p id='15.6' data-ref='tb_en-15-p6'>
Conflict and contention are categorically forbidden in His Book. This
is a decree of God in this Most Great Revelation. It is divinely
preserved from annulment and is invested by Him with the splendor of
His confirmation. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p id='15.7' data-ref='tb_en-15-p7'>
It is incumbent upon everyone to aid those daysprings of authority
and sources of command who are adorned with the ornament of equity
and justice. Blessed are the rulers and the learned among the people
of Bahá. They are My trustees among My servants and the
manifestations of My commandments amidst My people. Upon them rest My
glory, My blessings and My grace which have pervaded the world of
being. In this connection the utterances revealed in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas are such that from the horizon of their words the
light of divine grace shineth luminous and resplendent.</p>

<p id='15.8' data-ref='tb_en-15-p8'>
O ye My Branches! A mighty force, a consummate power lieth concealed
in the world of being. Fix your gaze upon it and upon its unifying
influence, and not upon the differences which appear from it.</p>

<p id='15.9' data-ref='tb_en-15-p9'>
The Will of the divine Testator is this: It is incumbent upon the
A<u>gh</u>ṣán, the Afnán and My Kindred to turn, one and all, their
faces towards the Most Mighty Branch. Consider that which We have
revealed in Our Most Holy Book: “When the ocean of My presence hath
ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward
Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient
Root.” The object of this sacred verse is none other except the
Most Mighty Branch [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. Thus have We graciously
revealed unto you Our potent Will, and I am verily the Gracious, the
All-Powerful. Verily God hath ordained the station of the Greater
Branch [Muḥammad ‘Alí] to be beneath that of the Most Great
Branch [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. He is in truth the Ordainer, the
All-Wise. We have chosen “the Greater” after “the Most Great,”
as decreed by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>

<p id='15.10' data-ref='tb_en-15-p10'>
It is enjoined upon everyone to manifest love towards the A<u>gh</u>ṣán,
but God hath not granted them any right to the property of others.</p>

<p id='15.11' data-ref='tb_en-15-p11'>
O ye My A<u>gh</u>ṣán, My Afnán and My Kindred! We exhort you to
fear God, to perform praiseworthy deeds and to do that which is meet
and seemly and serveth to exalt your station. Verily I say, fear of
God is the greatest commander that can render the Cause of God
victorious, and the hosts which best befit this commander have ever
been and are an upright character and pure and goodly deeds.</p>

<p id='15.12' data-ref='tb_en-15-p12'>
Say: O servants! Let not the means of order be made the cause of
confusion and the instrument of union an occasion for discord. We
fain would hope that the people of Bahá may be guided by the blessed
words: “Say: all things are of God.” This exalted utterance is
like unto water for quenching the fire of hate and enmity which
smoldereth within the hearts and breasts of men. By this single
utterance contending peoples and kindreds will attain the light of
true unity. Verily He speaketh the truth and leadeth the way. He is
the All-Powerful, the Exalted, the Gracious.</p>

<p id='15.13' data-ref='tb_en-15-p13'>
It is incumbent upon everyone to show courtesy to, and have regard
for the A<u>gh</u>ṣán, that thereby the Cause of God may be
glorified and His Word exalted. This injunction hath time and again
been mentioned and recorded in the Holy Writ. Well is it with him who
is enabled to achieve that which the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days
hath prescribed for him. Ye are bidden moreover to respect the
members of the Holy Household, the Afnán and the kindred. We further
admonish you to serve all nations and to strive for the betterment of
the world.</p>

<p id='15.14' data-ref='tb_en-15-p14'>
That which is conducive to the regeneration of the world and the
salvation of the peoples and kindreds of the earth hath been sent
down from the heaven of the utterance of Him Who is the Desire of the
world. Give ye a hearing ear to the counsels of the Pen of Glory.
Better is this for you than all that is on the earth. Unto this
beareth witness My glorious and wondrous Book.</p>

trodden, the eye that hath been cheered by the beauty of His
countenance, the ear that hath been honored by hearkening to His
call, the heart that hath tasted the sweetness of His love, the
breast that hath dilated through His remembrance, the pen that hath
voiced His praise, the scroll that hath borne the testimony of His
writings. We beseech God — blessed and exalted be He — that He may
honor us with meeting Him soon. He is, in truth, the All-Hearing, the
All-Powerful, He Who is ready to answer.</p>

<p id='17.1.1' data-ref='tb_en-17-1-p1'>
God testifieth that there is none other God but Him and that He Who
hath come from the heaven of divine revelation is the Hidden Secret,
the Impenetrable Mystery, Whose advent hath been foretold in the Book
of God and hath been heralded by His Prophets and Messengers. Through
Him the mysteries have been unraveled, the veils rent asunder and the
signs and evidences disclosed. Lo! He hath now been made manifest. He
bringeth to light whatsoever He willeth, and treadeth upon the high
places of the earth, invested with transcendent majesty and power.</p>

<p id='17.1.2' data-ref='tb_en-17-1-p2'>
Blessed is that strong one who will shatter the gods of vain
imaginings through the potency of the Name of his Lord, He Who ruleth
over all men.</p>

<p id='17.1.3' data-ref='tb_en-17-1-p3'>
O My Afnán! We would fain mention thy name as a token of grace on
Our part, that the sweet savors of My remembrance may attract thee
unto My Kingdom and draw thee nigh unto the Tabernacle of My majesty
which hath been hoisted through the power of this Name — a Name which
hath caused every foundation to tremble.</p>

<p id='17.1.4' data-ref='tb_en-17-1-p4'>
Say: O peoples of the earth! By the righteousness of God! Whatever ye
have been promised in the Books of your Lord, the Ruler of the Day of
Return, hath appeared and been made manifest. Beware lest the changes
and chances of the world hold you back from Him Who is the Sovereign
Truth. Ere long will everything visible perish and only that which
hath been revealed by God, the Lord of lords, shall endure.</p>

<p id='17.1.5' data-ref='tb_en-17-1-p5'>
Say: This is the Day of meritorious deeds, did ye but know it. This
is the Day of the glorification of God and of the exposition of His
Word, could ye but perceive it. Abandon the things current amongst
men and hold fast unto that which God, the Help in Peril, the
Self-Subsisting, hath enjoined upon you. The day is fast approaching
when all the treasures of the earth shall be of no profit to you.
Unto this beareth witness the Lord of Names, He Who proclaimeth:
Verily, no God is there besides Him, the Sovereign Truth, the Knower
of things unseen.</p>

<p id='17.1.6' data-ref='tb_en-17-1-p6'>
Well is it with thee, O My Afnán, inasmuch as thou wert honored to
receive My Holy Verses, hast inhaled the sweet savors of My
Revelation and responded to My Call at a time when My servants and My
creatures, casting the Mother Book behind their backs and, clinging
to the dictates of the exponents of idle fancy and vain imaginings,
have denounced Me. Thus hath the Tongue of Grandeur spoken in the
kingdom of utterance at the bidding of God, the Lord of Creation.</p>

<p id='17.1.7' data-ref='tb_en-17-1-p7'>
Persevere thou conscientiously in the service of the Cause and,
through the power of the Name of thy Lord, the Possessor of all
things visible and invisible, preserve the station conferred upon
thee. I swear by the righteousness of God! Were anyone apprised of
that which is veiled from the eyes of men, he would become so
enraptured as to wing his flight unto God, the Lord of all that hath
been and shall be.</p>

<p id='17.1.8' data-ref='tb_en-17-1-p8'>
May His glory rest upon thee and upon such as have drawn nigh unto
Him and apprehended the meaning of that which the exalted Pen of God,
the Almighty, the All-Loving, hath recorded in this Tablet.</p>

<p id='17.2.1' data-ref='tb_en-17-2-p1'>
All praise be to Thee, O my God, inasmuch as Thou hast adorned the
world with the splendor of the dawn following the night wherein was
born the One Who heralded the Manifestation of Thy transcendent
sovereignty, the Dayspring of Thy divine Essence and the Revelation
of Thy supreme Lordship. I beseech Thee, O Creator of the heavens and
Fashioner of names, to graciously aid those who have sheltered
beneath the shadow of Thine abounding mercy and have raised their
voices amidst the peoples of the world for the glorification of Thy
Name.</p>

<p id='17.2.2' data-ref='tb_en-17-2-p2'>
O my God! Thou beholdest the Lord of all mankind confined in His Most
Great Prison, calling aloud Thy Name, gazing upon Thy face,
proclaiming that which hath enraptured the denizens of Thy kingdoms
of revelation and of creation. O my God! I behold Mine own Self
captive in the hands of Thy servants, yet the light of Thy
sovereignty and the revelations of Thine invincible power shine
resplendent from His face, enabling all to know of a certainty that
Thou art God, and that there is none other God but Thee. Neither can
the power of the powerful frustrate Thee, nor the ascendancy of the
rulers prevail against Thee. Thou doest whatsoever Thou willest by
virtue of Thy sovereignty which encompasseth all created things, and
ordainest that which Thou pleasest through the potency of Thy behest
which pervadeth the entire creation.</p>

<p id='17.2.3' data-ref='tb_en-17-2-p3'>
I implore Thee by the glory of Thy Manifestation and by the power of
Thy might, Thy sovereignty and Thine exaltation to render victorious
those who have arisen to serve Thee, who have aided Thy Cause and
humbled themselves before the splendor of the light of Thy face. Make
them then, O my God, triumphant over Thine enemies and cause them to
be steadfast in Thy service, that through them the evidences of Thy
dominion may be established throughout Thy realms and the tokens of
Thine indomitable power be manifested in Thy lands. Verily Thou art
potent to do what Thou willest; no God is there but Thee, the Help in
Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p>

<p id='17.2.4' data-ref='tb_en-17-2-p4'>
This glorious Tablet hath been revealed on the Anniversary of the
Birth [of the Báb] that thou mayest recite it in a spirit of
humility and supplication and give thanks unto thy Lord, the
All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Make thou every effort to render
service unto God, that from thee may appear that which will
immortalize thy memory in His glorious and exalted heaven.</p>

<p id='17.2.5' data-ref='tb_en-17-2-p5'>
Say: Glorified art Thou, O my God! I implore Thee by the
Dawning-Place of Thy signs and by the Revealer of Thy clear tokens to
grant that I may, under all conditions, hold fast the cord of Thy
loving providence and cling tenaciously to the hem of Thy generosity.
Reckon me then with those whom the changes and chances of the world
have failed to deter from serving Thee and from bearing allegiance
unto Thee, whom the onslaught of the people hath been powerless to
hinder from magnifying Thy Name and celebrating Thy praise.
Graciously assist me, O my Lord, to do whatever Thou lovest and
desirest. Enable me then to fulfill that which will exalt Thy Name
and will set ablaze the fire of Thy love.</p>

<p id='17.2.6' data-ref='tb_en-17-2-p6'>
Thou art, in truth, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.</p>

O Ḥusayn! God grant thou shalt ever be bright and radiant, beaming

Consider the multitude of souls who seemed to be intensely eager and
athirst, yet when the Ocean of living waters did surge forth in the
world of being, they remained deprived thereof, inasmuch as they
failed to relinquish idle fancy and to become consciously aware of
Him Who is the Object of all knowledge. This failure is in recompense
for the deeds their hands had formerly wrought.</p>

<p id='17.3.3' data-ref='tb_en-17-3-p3'>
Render thou thanks unto the Beloved of the world for having
graciously aided thee to attain confirmation in this glorious Cause.
Entreat Him moreover to make His loved ones steadfast therein, for
the inflammatory writings of the mischief-makers are widespread and
the clamor of the foreboders of evil is raised high. Happy are they
that have cast behind their backs all else save God and have held
fast unto that which the Lord of strength and power hath enjoined
upon them.</p>

<p id='17.4.4' data-ref='tb_en-17-4-p4'>
By the righteousness of God! The world’s horizon is resplendent
with the light of the Most Great Luminary, yet the generality of
mankind perceive it not. Verily He Who is the Sovereign Truth moveth
before the eyes of all men. Unto this beareth witness the One Who is
proclaiming in the midmost heart of the world, “In truth no God is
there but Me, Omnipotent over all things, whether of the past or of
the future.”</p>

<p id='17.4.5' data-ref='tb_en-17-4-p5'>
Great is the blessedness of the believer who hath directed himself
towards Him and hath gained admittance into His presence, and woe
betide every disbeliever who hath turned away from God and followed
the wayward and the outcast.</p>

<p id='17.5.1' data-ref='tb_en-17-5-p1'>
O Friend! In the Bayán We directed everyone in this Most Great
Revelation to see with his own eyes and hear with his own ears.
However when the horizon of the world was illumined with the
resplendent light of this Revelation, many people forgot this divine
commandment, lost sight of this heavenly exhortation and immersed
themselves in the vain imaginings which their minds had devised.
Indeed the face of the sun of justice and fairness is hidden behind
the clouds of idle fancy which the foolish ones have conceived.
Therefore it is not to be wondered at that the movements of the birds
of darkness attract attention. Through the potency of the Name of the
Best-Beloved, invite thou the receptive souls unto God’s holy
court, that perchance they may not remain deprived of the heavenly
Fountain of living water. He is in truth the Gracious, the Forgiving.</p>

O Javád! Such is the greatness of this Day that the Hour itself is
seized with perturbation, and all heavenly Scriptures bear evidence
to its overpowering majesty. In this Day the Book solemnly testifieth
to His glory and the Balance is moved to lift up its voice. This is
the Day wherein the Ṣiráṭ calleth aloud: “I am the straight
Path,” and Mount Sinai exclaimeth: “Verily the Lord of Revelation
is come.”</p>

<p id='17.6.2' data-ref='tb_en-17-6-p2'>
Being overcome by the drunkenness of corrupt inclinations, the people
of the earth find themselves in a state of stupor. They are,

<p id='17.6.3' data-ref='tb_en-17-6-p3'>
It behooveth the people of God to be forbearing. They should impart
the Word of God according to the hearer’s particular measure of
understanding and capacity, that perchance the children of men may be
roused from heedlessness and set their faces towards this Horizon
which is immeasurably exalted above every horizon.</p>

<p id='17.6.4' data-ref='tb_en-17-6-p4'>
O Javád! The manifold bounties of God have ever been and will
continue to be vouchsafed unto thee. Praised be God! Thou hast been
shielded from the most great terror and hast succeeded in drawing
nigh unto the Most Great Bounty at a time when all men were prevented
from recognizing the eternal King by the interposition of the veils
of outward glory, namely the divines of this day. Cherish thou as
dearly as thine own life this testimony pronounced by the
All-Glorious Pen and strive with all thy might to preserve it by the
potency of the Name of Him Who is the Beloved One of the entire
creation, that this sublime honor may be proof against the eyes and

the peoples of the world are wrapt in palpable veils. He testifieth

I bear witness that thou hast hearkened unto the melody of God and
His sweet accents, inclined thine ear to the cooing of the Dove of
divine Revelation and hast heard the Nightingale of fidelity pouring
forth its notes upon the Branch of Glory: Verily there is none other
God but Me, the Incomparable, the All-Informed.</p>

<p id='17.8.3' data-ref='tb_en-17-8-p3'>
O thou who bearest My Name! The glances of the loving-kindness of God
have been and continue to be directed towards thee. While in His
presence, thou hast heard the Voice of the One true God — exalted be
His glory — and hast beheld the unveiled splendor of the Light of
divine knowledge. Ponder a while! How sublime is the Utterance of Him
Who is the Sovereign Truth and how abject are the idle contentions of
the people! The accumulations of vain fancy have obstructed men’s
ears and stopped them from hearing the Voice of God, and the veils of
human learning and false imaginings have prevented their eyes from
beholding the splendor of the light of His countenance. With the arm
of might and power We have rescued a number of souls from the slough
of impending extinction and enabled them to attain the Dayspring of
glory. Moreover We have laid bare the divine mysteries and in most
explicit language foretold future events, that neither the doubts of
the faithless, nor the denials of the froward, nor the whisperings of
the heedless may keep back the seekers of truth from the Source of
the light of the One true God. Nevertheless some people seem to have
been seized with epilepsy, others are torn up even as hollow
tree-stumps. They abandon God, the Most Exalted — He before Whose
revelation of a single verse, all the Scriptures of the past and of
more recent times pale into lowliness and insignificance — and set
their hearts on lying tales and follow empty words.</p>

<p id='17.8.4' data-ref='tb_en-17-8-p4'>
Thou hast surely quaffed from the ocean of Mine utterance and hast
witnessed the effulgent splendor of the orb of My wisdom. Thou hast
also heard the sayings of the infidels who neither are acquainted
with the fundamentals of the Faith, nor have tasted this choice Wine
whose seal hath been broken through the power of My Name, the Help in
Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Beseech thou God that the believers who
are endued with true understanding may be graciously enabled to do
that which is pleasing unto Him.</p>

<p id='17.8.5' data-ref='tb_en-17-8-p5'>
How strange that despite this ringing Call, despite the appearance of
this most wondrous Revelation, We notice that men, for the most part,
have fixed their hearts on the vanities of the world and are sorely
dismayed and troubled by reason of prevailing doubts and evil
suggestions. Say: This is the Day of God Himself; fear ye God and be
not of them that have disbelieved in Him. Cast the idle tales behind
your backs and behold My Revelation through Mine eyes. Unto this have
ye been exhorted in heavenly Books and Scriptures, in the Scrolls and
Tablets.</p>

<p id='17.8.6' data-ref='tb_en-17-8-p6'>
Arise thou to serve the Cause of thy Lord; then give the people the
joyful tidings concerning this resplendent Light whose revelation
hath been announced by God through His Prophets and Messengers.
Admonish everyone moreover to observe prudence as ordained by Him,
and in the Name of God advise them, saying: It behooveth every one in
this Day of God to dedicate himself to the teaching of the Cause with
utmost prudence and steadfastness. Should he discover a pure soil,
let him sow the seed of the Word of God, otherwise it would be
preferable to observe silence.</p>

<p id='17.8.7' data-ref='tb_en-17-8-p7'>
Not long ago this most sublime Word was revealed in the Crimson Book
by the All-Glorious Pen: “The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined
with two luminaries: consultation and compassion.” Please God,
everyone may be enabled to observe this weighty and blessed word.</p>

<p id='17.8.8' data-ref='tb_en-17-8-p8'>
Certain people seem to be entirely bereft of understanding. By
clinging to the cord of idle fancy they have debarred themselves from
the Sure Handle. I swear by My life! Were they to reflect a while
with fairness on that which the All-Merciful hath sent down, they
would, one and all, spontaneously give utterance to these words,
“Verily Thou art the Truth, the manifest Truth.”</p>

<p id='17.8.9' data-ref='tb_en-17-8-p9'>
It behooveth thee to turn thy gaze in all circumstances unto the One
true God, and seek diligently to serve His Cause. Call thou to mind
when thou wert in My company, within the Tabernacle of Glory, and
didst hear from Me that which He Who conversed with God [Moses] heard
upon the Sinai of divine knowledge. Thus did We graciously aid thee,
enabled thee to recognize the truth and cautioned thee, that thou
mightest render thanks unto thy bountiful Lord. Thou shouldst
safeguard this sublime station through the potency of My Name, the
Omnipotent, the Faithful.</p>

O ‘Alí! Woes and sorrows are powerless to restrain thy Lord, the
All-Merciful. Indeed He hath risen to champion the Cause of God in
such wise that neither the overpowering might of the world nor the
tyranny of the nations can ever alarm Him. He calleth aloud betwixt
earth and heaven, saying: The Promised Day is come. The Lord of
creation proclaimeth: Verily, there is no God besides Me, the
Almighty, the All-Bountiful.</p>

<p id='17.9.3' data-ref='tb_en-17-9-p3'>
O ‘Alí! The immature wish to put out the light of God with their
mouths and to extinguish by their acts the flame in the Burning Bush.
Say, wretched indeed is your plight, O ye embodiments of delusion.
Fear ye God and reject not the heavenly grace which hath shed
radiance upon all regions. Say, He Who is the Exponent of the hidden
Name hath appeared, did ye but know it. He Whose advent hath been
foretold in the heavenly Scriptures is come, could ye but understand
it. The world’s horizon is illumined by the splendors of this Most
Great Revelation. Haste ye with radiant hearts and be not of them
that are bereft of understanding. The appointed Hour hath struck and
mankind is laid low. Unto this bear witness the honored servants of
God.</p>

<p id='17.9.4' data-ref='tb_en-17-9-p4'>
O Ḥaydar-‘Alí! I swear by the righteousness of God! The Blast
hath been blown on the Trumpet of the Bayán as decreed by the Lord,
the Merciful, and all that are in the heavens and on the earth have
swooned away except such as have detached themselves from the world,
cleaving fast unto the Cord of God, the Lord of mankind. This is the
Day in which the earth shineth with the effulgent light of thy Lord,
but the people are lost in error and have been shut out as by a veil.
We desire to regenerate the world, yet they have resolved to put an
end to My life. Thus have their hearts prompted them in this Day — a
Day which hath been made bright by the radiant light of the
countenance of its Lord, the Omnipotent, the Almighty, the
Unconstrained. The Mother Book hath lifted up its Voice, but the
people are bereft of hearing. The Preserved Tablet hath been revealed
with truth, yet the generality of mankind peruse it not. They have
denied the gracious favor of God after it hath been sent down unto
them and have turned away from God, the Knower of things unseen. They
firmly cling to the hem of idle fancies, turning their backs on the
hidden Name of the Almighty.</p>

<p id='17.9.5' data-ref='tb_en-17-9-p5'>
Say, O concourse of divines! Be fair in your judgment, I adjure you
by God. Produce then whatever proofs and testimonies ye possess, if
ye are to be reckoned among the inmates of this glorious habitation.
Set your hearts towards the Dayspring of divine Revelation that We
may disclose before your eyes the equivalent of all such verses,
proofs, testimonies, affirmations and evidences as ye and other
kindreds of the earth possess. Fear ye God and be not of them that
well deserve the chastisement of God, the Lord of creation.</p>

<p id='17.9.6' data-ref='tb_en-17-9-p6'>
This is the Day in which the Ocean of knowledge hath lifted up its
Voice and hath brought forth its pearls. Would that ye knew it! The
heaven of the Bayán hath been raised up in truth at the behest of
God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. I swear by God! The
Essence of knowledge exclaimeth and saith: Lo! He Who is the Object
of all knowledge is come and through His advent the sacred Books of
God, the Gracious, the Loving, have been embellished. Every
revelation of grace, every evidence of goodly gifts emanateth from
Him and unto Him doth it return.</p>

<p id='17.9.7' data-ref='tb_en-17-9-p7'>
Fear ye God, O concourse of the foolish, and do not inflict
tribulations upon those who have willed naught but that which God
hath willed. Moreover, if ye heed my call, follow not your selfish
desires. The day is approaching when everything now discernible will
have faded away and ye shall weep for having failed in your duty
towards God. Unto this testifieth this inscribed Tablet.</p>

<p id='17.9.8' data-ref='tb_en-17-9-p8'>
Rejoice thou with great joy that We have remembered thee both now and
in the past. Indeed the sweet savors of this remembrance shall endure
and shall not change throughout the eternity of the Names of God, the
Lord of mankind. We have graciously accepted thy devotions, thy
praise, thy teaching work and the services thou hast rendered for the
sake of this mighty Announcement. We have also hearkened unto that
which thy tongue hath uttered at the meetings and gatherings. Verily
thy Lord heareth and observeth all things. We have attired thee with
the vesture of My good-pleasure in My heavenly Kingdom, and from the
Divine Lote-Tree which is raised on the borders of the vale of
security and peace, situate in the luminous Spot beyond the glorious
City, We call aloud unto thee saying: In truth there is no God but
Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. We have brought thee into being to
serve Me, to glorify My Word and to proclaim My Cause. Center thine
energies upon that wherefor thou hast been created by virtue of the
Will of the supreme Ordainer, the Ancient of Days.</p>

<p id='17.9.9' data-ref='tb_en-17-9-p9'>
At this moment We call to remembrance Our loved ones and bring them
the joyous tidings of God’s unfailing grace and of the things that
have been provided for them in My lucid Book. Ye have tolerated the
censure of the enemies for the sake of My love and have steadfastly
endured in My Path the grievous cruelties which the ungodly have
inflicted upon you. Unto this I Myself bear witness, and I am the
All-Knowing. How vast the number of places that have been ennobled
with your blood for the sake of God. How numerous the cities wherein
the voice of your lamentation hath been raised and the wailing of
your anguish uplifted. How many the prisons into which ye have been
cast by the hosts of tyranny. Know ye of a certainty that He will
render you victorious, will exalt you among the peoples of the world
and will demonstrate your high rank before the gaze of all nations.
Surely He will not suffer the reward of His favored ones to be lost.</p>

<p id='17.9.10' data-ref='tb_en-17-9-p10'>
Take heed lest the deeds wrought by the embodiments of idle fancy
sadden you or the acts committed by every wayward oppressor grieve
you. Seize ye the chalice of constancy through the power of His Name,
quaff then therefrom by virtue of the sovereignty of God, the
Powerful, the Omnipotent. Thus hath the Daystar of My tender
compassion and loving-kindness shone forth above the horizon of this
Tablet that ye may render thanks unto your Lord, the Almighty, the
All-Bountiful.</p>

<p id='17.9.11' data-ref='tb_en-17-9-p11'>
The glory that hath dawned resplendent from the heaven of Mine
utterance rest upon thee and upon them that have directed themselves
towards thee and inclined their ears to the words which thy mouth
hath uttered concerning this glorious, this august Revelation.</p>

By the righteousness of God! The Mother Book is made manifest,
summoning mankind unto God, the Lord of the worlds, while the seas
proclaim: The Most Great Ocean hath appeared, from whose waves one
can hear the thundering cry: “Verily, no God is there but Me, the
Peerless, the All-Knowing.” And the trees raising their clamor
exclaim: O people of the world! The voice of the Divine Lote-Tree is
clearly sounding and the shrill cry of the Pen of Glory is ringing
loud: Give ye ear and be not of the heedless. The sun is calling out:
O concourse of the divines! The heaven of religions is split and the
moon cleft asunder and the peoples of the earth are brought together
in a new resurrection. Fear ye God and follow not the promptings of
your passions, rather follow Him unto Whom have testified the
Scriptures of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>

<p id='17.10.2' data-ref='tb_en-17-10-p2'>
The episode of Sinai hath been reenacted in this Revelation and He
Who conversed upon the Mount is calling aloud: Verily, the Desired
One is come, seated upon the throne of certitude, could ye but
perceive it. He hath admonished all men to observe that which is
conducive to the exaltation of the Cause of God and will guide
mankind unto His Straight Path.</p>

<p id='17.10.3' data-ref='tb_en-17-10-p3'>
How vast the number of the downtrodden who have been enraptured by
the Call of God! How numerous the potentates who have risen up to
commit acts of aggression that have caused the inmates of the
all-highest Paradise to lament and the dwellers of this glorious
habitation to wail with grief! How great the multitude of the poor
who have quaffed the choice wine of divine revelation and how many
the rich who have turned away, repudiated the truth and voiced their
disbelief in God, the Lord of this blessed and wondrous Day!</p>

<p id='17.10.4' data-ref='tb_en-17-10-p4'>
Say: Fear ye God, then observe equity in your judgment of this Great
Announcement before which, as soon as it shone forth, every momentous
announcement bowed low in adoration. Say: O concourse of the foolish!
If ye reject Him, by what evidence can ye prove your allegiance to
the former Messengers of God or vindicate your belief in that which
He hath sent down from His mighty and exalted Kingdom? What benefit
do your possessions bestow upon you? What protection can your
treasures afford you? None, I swear by the Spirit of God that
pervadeth all that are in the heavens and on the earth. Cast away
that which ye have put together with the hands of idle fancy and vain
imaginings and take fast hold of the Book of God which hath been sent
down by virtue of His all-compelling and inviolable authority.</p>

<p id='17.10.5' data-ref='tb_en-17-10-p5'>
Thy letter was presented before this Wronged One and in thine honor
have We revealed this Tablet from which the fragrance of the gracious
favor of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Bountiful, is diffused. We
beseech God to make thee as a banner upraised in the city of His
remembrance, and to exalt thy station in this Cause — a Cause beneath
whose shadow the sincere ones of God shall behold the peoples and
kindreds of the earth seeking shelter. Verily, thy Lord knoweth and
informeth. Moreover We entreat Him to nourish thee with the best of
what hath been treasured in His Book. He is in truth the One Who doth
hear and answer the call.</p>

Persevere thou in helping His Cause through the strengthening power
of the hosts of wisdom and utterance. Thus hath it been decreed by
God, the Gracious, the All-Praised. Blessed is the believer who hath
in this Day embraced the Truth and the man of fixed resolve whom the
hosts of tyranny have been powerless to affright.</p>

The glory which hath shone forth above the horizon of utterance be
upon thee and upon such believers as have seized the chalice of His
sealed wine through the power of His Name, the Self-Subsisting, and
drunk deep despite those that have rejected the One in Whom they had
formerly professed belief — they that have disputed the truth of this
Great Announcement whereunto God hath testified in His precious and
ancient Book.</p>

O Muḥammad Ḥusayn! Be thou prepared to receive the outpourings of
the loving-kindness of God, the Lord of the worlds. The All-Merciful

Where is the man of insight who will recognize and perceive the

My wondrous Voice calling from the realm of glory? Where is the soul

neither the overpowering might of the kings, nor the violent
commotions of their subjects may frustrate him, lifting up his voice
amidst the entire creation through the power of wisdom and utterance
and testifying unto that whereunto hath testified God, that verily no

Omnipotent, the Knowing, the Wise.</p>

<p id='17.11.3' data-ref='tb_en-17-11-p3'>
O Ḥusayn! Thy name hath been mentioned in the Most Great Prison
before this Wronged One and We have revealed for thee that with which
none of the books of the world can compare. Unto this beareth witness
the King of eternity; yet the generality of mankind are numbered
among the heedless. From the dawning-place of testimony We have
raised the Call unto all that dwell in the realm of creation. Amongst
men there are those who have been carried away by the fragrance of
the utterance of their Lord in such manner that they have forsaken
everything which pertaineth unto men in their eagerness to attain the
court of the presence of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. There
are also those who are sore perplexed and wavering. Others have made
haste, winged their way to answer the Call of their Lord, the Ancient
of Days. Still others have turned aside, rejected the truth and
eventually disbelieved in God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. And
there are yet others who have pronounced judgment against Him with
such cruelty that every wise and discerning soul hath been moved to
lament. We have graciously summoned them unto the river that is life
indeed, while they have, with manifest injustice, decreed the
shedding of My blood. Thus hath the Daystar of wisdom shone forth
from above the horizon of the utterance of thy Lord, the
All-Merciful. Shouldst thou attain unto its light, it behooveth thee
to magnify the praise of thy Lord and say, I yield Thee thanks, O God
of the worlds.</p>

We have revealed Ourself unto men, have unveiled the Cause, guided

In these days the people have debarred themselves from the effusions

vain imaginings. The Ocean of divine knowledge hath risen high whilst

upright character, virtuous deeds and a goodly utterance. The

outpourings of the showers of divine mercy, have reached the skies. A
dried-up tree, however, hath never been nor will be worthy of any
mention.</p>

<p id='17.18.3' data-ref='tb_en-17-18-p3'>
Happy is the faithful one who is attired with the vesture of high
endeavor and hath arisen to serve this Cause. Such a soul hath truly
attained the desired Goal and hath apprehended the Object for which
it hath been created. But a myriad times alas for the wayward who are
like unto dried-up leaves fallen upon the dust. Ere long mortal
blasts shall carry them away to the place ordained for them. Ignorant
did they arrive, ignorant did they linger and ignorant did they
retire to their abodes.</p>

<p id='17.18.4' data-ref='tb_en-17-18-p4'>
The world is continually proclaiming these words: Beware, I am
evanescent, and so are all my outward appearances and colors. Take ye
heed of the changes and chances contrived within me and be ye roused
from your slumber. Nevertheless there is no discerning eye to see,
nor is there a hearing ear to hearken.</p>

<p id='17.18.5' data-ref='tb_en-17-18-p5'>
In this Day the inner ear exclaimeth and saith: Indeed well is it
with me, today is my day, inasmuch as the Voice of God is calling
aloud. And the essence of vision crieth out: Blessed am I, this is my
day, for the Ancient Beauty is shining resplendent from the most
exalted Horizon.</p>

<p id='17.18.6' data-ref='tb_en-17-18-p6'>
It behooveth the people of Bahá to invoke and entreat the Lord of
Names that perchance the people of the world may not be deprived of
the effusions of grace in His days.</p>

<p id='17.18.7' data-ref='tb_en-17-18-p7'>
In the past the divines were perplexed over this question, a question
which He Who is the Sovereign Truth hath, during the early years of
His life, Himself heard them ask repeatedly: “What is that Word
which the Qá’im will pronounce whereby the leaders of religion are
put to flight?” Say, that Word is now made manifest and ye have
fled ere ye heard it uttered, although ye perceive it not. And that
blessed, that hidden, that concealed and treasured Word is this:
“‘HE’ hath now appeared in the raiment of ‘I.’ He Who was
hidden from mortal eyes exclaimeth: Lo! I am the All-Manifest.”
This is the Word which hath caused the limbs of disbelievers to
quake. Glorified be God! All the heavenly Scriptures of the past
attest to the greatness of this Day, the greatness of this
Manifestation, the greatness of His signs, the greatness of His Word,
the greatness of His constancy, the greatness of His preeminent
station. Yet despite all this the people have remained heedless and
are shut out as by a veil. Indeed all the Prophets have yearned to
attain this Day. David saith: “Who will bring me into the Strong
City?” <a data-fnid='17.18.1'></a>  By Strong
City is meant ‘Akká. Its fortifications are very strong and this
Wronged One is imprisoned within its walls. Likewise it is revealed
in the Qur’án: “Bring forth thy people from the darkness into
the light and announce to them the days of God.” <a data-fnid='17.18.2'></a>
</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn17.18.1'>
Psalms 59:9; 108:10.
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn17.18.2'>
Qur’án 14:5.
</aside>

<p id='17.18.8' data-ref='tb_en-17-18-p8'>
The glory with which this Day is invested hath been explicitly
mentioned and clearly set forth in most heavenly Books and
Scriptures. However, the divines of the age have debarred men from
this transcendent station, and have kept them back from this Pinnacle
of Glory, this Supreme Goal.</p>

<p id='17.18.9' data-ref='tb_en-17-18-p9'>
Blessed art thou inasmuch as the darkness of vain imaginings hath
been powerless to hinder thee from the light of certitude, and the
onslaught of the people hath failed to deter thee from the Lord of
mankind. Appreciate thou the value of this high station and beseech
God — exalted is His glory — to graciously enable thee to safeguard
it. Imperishable dominion hath exclusively pertained unto the One
true God and His loved ones and will continue to pertain unto them
everlastingly.</p>

<p id='17.18.10' data-ref='tb_en-17-18-p10'>
The glory that hath shone forth from the horizon of eternity rest
upon thee and upon such as have taken fast hold of the Cord of God
that no man can sever.</p>

<p id='17.19.2' data-ref='tb_en-17-19-p2'>
The clay clods of the world have set forth to visit the embellished,

they pretend to be gentle and meek. Gracious God! When will this
world-afflicting craftiness be transformed into sincerity? The
exhortations of God, the True One, have compassed the world, but
until now their influence hath not been disclosed. Men’s unseemly
deeds have kept them back from attaining unto Him. We entreat
God — exalted and glorified is He — to pour down, out of the clouds
of divine grace, the overflowing rain of His bounty upon all His

O ‘Alí Ḥaydar! O thou who hast risen to serve My Cause and art
engaged in magnifying the praise of God, the Lord of the mighty
throne! Unto the emblems of justice and the exponents of equity it is
indubitably clear and evident that this Wronged One, strengthened by
the transcendent power of the Kingdom, is seeking to efface from
among the peoples and kindreds of the earth every evidence of
disorder, discord, dissension, differences or divisions; and it is
for no other reason but this great, this momentous object that He
hath again and again been cast into prison and many a day and a night
hath been subjected to chains and fetters. Blessed are they that
judge this impregnable Cause, this glorious Announcement, with
fairness and equity.</p>

surged through the potency of His august Name. Amongst men there are
those who have turned away from Him and gainsaid His testimony, while
others have quaffed the wine of assurance in the glory of His Name

<p id='17.20.4' data-ref='tb_en-17-20-p4'>
While in prison We have revealed a Book which We have entitled “The

We desire to mention him who hath set his face towards Us and to let
him once again drink deep from the life-giving waters of Our gracious
providence that he may be enabled to draw nigh unto My Horizon, be
adorned with Mine attributes, soar in Mine atmosphere, be confirmed
in that which will cause the sanctity of My Cause to be manifested
amongst My people and to celebrate My praise in a manner that will
cause every hesitating soul to hasten, every motionless creature to
wing its flight, every mortal frame to be consumed, every chilled
heart to be stirred with life and every dejected spirit to surge with
delight. Thus doth it behoove him who hath turned his face to Mine,
hath entered beneath the shadow of My loving-kindness and received My
verses which have pervaded the whole world.</p>

<p id='17.21.2' data-ref='tb_en-17-21-p2'>
O ‘Alí! He Who is the Dayspring of divine Revelation is calling
unto thee through this most wondrous utterance. By the righteousness
of God! If thou wert present before My Throne and didst hearken unto
the Tongue of might and grandeur, thou wouldst sacrifice thy body,
thy soul, thine entire being as a token of thy love for God, the
Sovereign, the Protector, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and wouldst
so thrill to the fascination of His Voice that every pen would be
powerless to recount thy station and every eloquent speaker would be
confounded in his attempt to describe it. Ponder a while concerning
this Revelation and its invincible sovereignty; aid it then as it
beseemeth thy Lord, the Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Direct thou the
people unto the Dayspring of glory. Verily it is He Himself Who is
established upon His mighty Throne. Through Him hath the horizon of
this Prison been made to shine and by Him have all that are in the
heavens and on the earth been illumined.</p>

We have deigned to mention thy name in the past as well as in this
gracious Tablet that thou mayest once again inhale the sweet

<p id='17.21.4' data-ref='tb_en-17-21-p4'>
Grieve thou not at men’s failure to apprehend the Truth. Ere long

will have subdued the hearts of all that dwell on earth. He is in

Give ear unto that which the Spirit imparteth unto thee from the

nigh unto the Station where thou shalt behold thine entire being set
ablaze with the fire of the love of God in such wise that neither the
ascendancy of the rulers nor the whisperings of their vassals can
quench it, and thou wilt arise amidst the peoples of the world to
celebrate the praise of thy Lord, the Possessor of Names. This is
that which well beseemeth thee in this Day.</p>

<p id='17.22.2' data-ref='tb_en-17-22-p2'>
We will recount for thee the thing that hath happened in the past
that thou mayest perceive the sweetness of this utterance and become
aware of such events as have transpired in former times. Verily thy
Lord is the Admonisher, the Gracious, the Best-Beloved.</p>

<p id='17.22.3' data-ref='tb_en-17-22-p3'>
Call thou to mind the days when He Who conversed with God tended, in
the wilderness, the sheep of Jethro, His father-in-law. He hearkened
unto the Voice of the Lord of mankind coming from the Burning Bush
which had been raised above the Holy Land, exclaiming, “O Moses!
Verily I am God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers, Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob.” He was so carried away by the captivating accent
of the Voice that He detached Himself from the world and set out in
the direction of Pharaoh and his people, invested with the power of
thy Lord Who exerciseth sovereignty over all that hath been and shall
be. The people of the world are now hearing that which Moses did
hear, but they understand not.</p>

<p id='17.22.4' data-ref='tb_en-17-22-p4'>
Say, I swear by the righteousness of God! Ere long the pomp of the
ministers of state and the ascendancy of the rulers shall pass away,
the palaces of the potentates shall be laid waste and the imposing
buildings of the emperors reduced to dust, but what shall endure is
that which We have ordained for you in the Kingdom. It behooveth you,
O people, to make the utmost endeavor that your names may be
mentioned before the Throne and ye may bring forth that which will
immortalize your memories throughout the eternity of God, the Lord of
all being.</p>

<p id='17.22.5' data-ref='tb_en-17-22-p5'>

Say, take heed lest the overpowering might of the oppressors alarm
you. The day is approaching when every emblem of vainglory will have
been reduced to nothingness; then shall ye behold the invincible
sovereignty of your Lord ruling over all things visible and
invisible.</p>

<p id='17.22.7' data-ref='tb_en-17-22-p7'>
Beware lest the veils deter you from the outpourings of His bounty in
this Day. Cast away the things that keep you back from God and
persevere on this far-stretching Way. We desire naught for you but
that which profiteth you as hath been recorded in His Preserved
Tablet. We often remember Our loved ones; however, We have found them
wanting in that which becometh them at the Court of the favor of
their Lord, the Gracious, the Forgiving, save those whom God desireth
to exempt. Verily, potent is He to do what He willeth. He giveth and
withholdeth. He is indeed the Eternal Truth, the Knower of things
unseen.</p>

<p id='17.22.8' data-ref='tb_en-17-22-p8'>
Seize ye, O loved ones of the All-Merciful, the chalice of eternal
life proffered by the hand of the bountiful favors of your Lord, the
Possessor of the entire creation, then drink ye deep therefrom. I
swear by God, it will so enrapture you that ye shall arise to magnify
His Name and proclaim His utterances amidst the peoples of the earth
and shall conquer the cities of the hearts of men in the name of your
Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised.</p>

<p id='17.22.9' data-ref='tb_en-17-22-p9'>
Moreover, We announce unto everyone the joyful tidings concerning
that which We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book — a Book from above
whose horizon the daystar of My commandments shineth upon every
observer and every observed one. Hold ye fast unto it and fulfill
that which is revealed therein. Indeed better is this for you than
whatsoever hath been created in the world, did ye but know it. Beware
lest the transitory things of human life withhold you from turning
unto God, the True One. Ponder ye in your hearts the world and its
conflicts and changes, so that ye may discern its merit and the
station of those who have set their hearts upon it and have turned
away from that which hath been sent down in Our Preserved Tablet.</p>

<p id='17.22.10' data-ref='tb_en-17-22-p10'>
Thus have We revealed these holy verses and sent them unto thee that
thou mayest arise to glorify the Name of God, the Help in Peril, the
Self-Subsisting. The glory of God be upon thee and upon such as have
partaken of this choice, sealed Wine.</p>

commandments and the Dayspring of His Revelation, hath everlastingly

obligation resteth upon every soul. One is to be steadfast in the
Cause with such steadfastness that were all the peoples of the world
to attempt to prevent him from turning to the Source of Revelation,
they would be powerless to do so. The other is observance of the
divine ordinances which have streamed forth from the wellspring of
His heavenly propelled Pen. For man’s knowledge of God cannot
develop fully and adequately save by observing whatsoever hath been
ordained by Him and is set forth in His heavenly Book.</p>

<p id='17.23.3' data-ref='tb_en-17-23-p3'>

may be graciously aided to serve Thy Cause and be inspired to
remember Thee and praise Thee. Send down then upon me from the heaven
