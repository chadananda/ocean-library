   Margaret Stevenson
  </p>
  
  <p>Margaret Stevenson, the first New Zealand Bahá’í was born on November 30th, 1865. Her first intimation of the Bahá’í Faith was through reading “The Christian Commonwealth” and she admitted later that “she did not think any more about it”. She received this journal from her sister who was in London studying music and had heard ‘Abdu’l-Bahá address the congregation of St. John’s, Westminster at the invitation of Canon Wilberforce. She was so impressed that when another discourse given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at City Temple, London was printed in “The Christian Commonwealth” dated March 27th, 1911, she sent a copy of the journal to Margaret in New Zealand. In 1912, Miss Dorothea Spinney arrived in Auckland from London and stayed with Margaret at her home, “Clunie”, 3, Cowie Street, Parnell where she talked about the Bahá’í Cause and her own meeting with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. To quote Margaret’s own words: “As a child, I used to wish I had lived when Christ was on earth. As Miss Spinney spoke, I remembered my childhood wish, and the thought came to me that I too might have denied Him as so many others had done. It was this secret thought that made me seriously think of what I heard from Miss Spinney, and through God’s grace and mercy I was enabled to grasp and believe in Bahá’u’lláh and His Message”.* Margaret spoke to others of her belief and obtained literature from America, becoming a subscriber to “Star of the West”. Eventually a study group was formed in Auckland and for ten years, Margaret’s home was a venue for these classes. It was here that the first Bahá’í Feast in New Zealand took place in January, 1923. </p>

  <p id=''>  In 1925, Margaret was one of a small group who journeyed from New Zealand to the Holy Land on pilgrimage, and after an inspiring nineteen days in Haifa, travelled on to England where she met with the English Bahá’í community. The pilgrims arrived back in Auckland in December, 1925, bringing with them some dust from the Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh which was placed in New Zealand soil at the Stevenson’s home in a ceremony held on February 14th, 1926.</p>

  </p>

  <p>  In such a geographically remote country, the early New Zealand believers had scant knowledge of Bahá’í administration and erroneously called themselves an Assembly as early as 1924. This was corrected with 1945 the receipt of a booklet on the subject and the first properly constituted Bahá’í Assembly in New Zealand was formed on April 21st, 1926, with Margaret Stevenson as its Secretary. A steadfast worker, Margaret was a member of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Australia and New Zealand which was elected in 1934, and served the Bahá’í Cause with faithfulness and efficiency until her passing to the Abhá Kingdom on February 11th, 1941. </p>

He loves you all and prays for your happiness and spiritual growth. </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn2'> 
    <p>  Born in London in 1855, Hyde Dunn was engaged in business in Britain and continental Europe before emigrating to the United States. In 1905, whilst at a tinsmith’s shop in Seattle, he observed the shopkeeper in excited conversation with a man who had just returned from the Prison of ‘Akká and the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; he overheard the quotation “Let not a man glory in this, that he loves his country, but let him glory in this, that he loves his kind”. Hyde Dunn later recalled that “The words reached me with dynamic force, its truth and power crystallised in my heart — a new consciousness awakened... That one glorious utterance magnetised my whole being, appealed as a new note, sent forth from God to His wandering creatures — a Message from the Supreme to the sons of men”.*  Recognising the Truth, Hyde Dunn interrupted the conversation, and accepted immediately the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. The year was 1905. </p>

    <p class='reference'>* (“The Bahá’í World, Vol. IX, 1940-1944”, pp. 593-596. Bahá’í Publishing Committee, Wilmette, Illinois) </p>

    <p>  In 1912, he was present at a meeting with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in San Francisco and declared it was the Master’s “penetrating glance, his life giving words, he felt gave him the power that enabled him later to become the spiritual conqueror of a continent”. Accompanied by his English born wife, Clara, he answered the call of the “Tablets of the Divine Plan” and on April 18th, 1920 reached Australia whence they travelled to New Zealand in 1922-3, not knowing there was already a believer there (Margaret Stevenson). With their arrival in Auckland, the Cause grew in that country and when Hyde Dunn left to return to Australia, Clara remained for a time to organise a study group in New Zealand.</p>

    <p>  Known affectionately among Bahá’ís as “Mother” and “Father” Dunn, they carried the Message of Bahá’u’lláh from New South Wales to Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, across the desert to Perth and to tropical Queensland and became the spiritual parents of Australia. After “Mother” Dunn returned from a lone pilgrimage to the Holy Land, “Father” was elected a member of the first National Spiritual Assembly of 1945 the Bahá’ís of Australia and New Zealand in 1934. After his passing on February 17th, 1941, “Mother” Dunn’s dedication to the Bahá’í Faith continued unabated and in 1952 she was elevated to the station of Hand of the Cause of God by Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith: “Father” Dunn was subsequently elevated to the same station posthumously.</p>

    <p>  Despite her advanced years, “Mother” Dunn returned to New Zealand in 1957 as representative of the Guardian at the formation of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of New Zealand. In March, 1958, at the request of the Guardian, she placed plaster from the Castle of Mah-Ku in the foundations of the Australasian Bahá’í House of Worship in Sydney during the Australian Inter-Continental Conference. Until her passing to the Abhá Kingdom in 1960 at the age of 91 years, “Mother” Dunn retained her memory of many Bahá’í prayers and was reciting these at the time of her death. </p>

<p id='1.3'> 	It is true that your group is now still small, but he assures you that your group will before long grow larger and larger day by day. It has been always the case with the growth of every religion. Some pure soul or souls go to some land and sow the seeds of the heavenly teachings in the hearts of few who are most pure and so most receptive. The seeds will germinate and grow in them. The fruits of these seeds appear in the regeneration of the lives of these primary adherents. These primary adherents share the bounties they have received with other souls, who through them obtain new life and light and in turn illumine other people. </p>

<p id='1.4'> 	The primary adherents are the stars of great magnitude in every land in the firmament of the Kingdom of God. They are the chosen people. They are like candles which, through their sacrificial efforts, are weeping their lives away in order to give light to the world and establish the purpose of their Lord and Saviour, which purpose is the salvation of mankind. His Holiness, Jesus Christ! see how small the group of His disciples was! No matter how few the number of the disciples was, yet they through His power illumined the world. Our Era is similar to that, but through the development of <span data-pg='4'></span> humanity it is greater, and through the evils of the material civilization and negligence of mankind our sacrifices must be greater. Divine light must make itself manifest in our daily life deeds. </p>

<p id='1.5'> 	In the early days of the appearance of our Saviour, virtue was to save <i>ourselves</i>. When we are once established in our faith, then virtue is to save <i>others</i>. The three mottoes of education hold true in our case too. First <i>grow</i>, then <i>become</i> and then <i>contribute</i>. We have developed; we have established ourselves, and now it is time to contribute to others. We have inexhaustible capital. The candles of our spiritual lives constantly weep away their lives in shedding light to the world, but they never become exhausted. For there is connection between our lives and that of Bahá’u’lláh and our beloved ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>

<p id='1.6'> 	It cannot be described how much we long to see our dear New Zealand brethren and sisters. We hope the day will come when they can come to us and we to them. Meanwhile, we are praying at the Holy Threshold of our beloved Master for your success and happiness. We hope you will pray for us too. The effect of the prayers of the pure hearts is tremendously great. </p>

<p id='1.7'> 	Our dear Shoghi Effendi wants you not to look at your own capacity, but at the power of the Holy Ghost of God. He sends you all his loving greeting and tender affection. </p>

   Sarah Blundell
   </p>
  
    <p>  The Blundell family: Mrs Sarah Blundell was born at Burwell, Cambridgeshire, England in 1850, a year sacred in Bahá’í history as that of the Báb’s martyrdom, and was destined to become one of the pioneers of the Bahá’í Cause in New Zealand. She received her early religious training from her “Non-Conformist” father, a man whose strong convictions led him to withdraw his seven year old daughter from religious instruction classes at her boarding school. The feeling of isolation which followed caused her to think for herself and she had the rare distinction of being one of the first women to enter the Cambridge University Examinations in an age prejudiced against the education of women.</p>

    <p>  In 1886, with her husband and seven children, she arrived in New Zealand where she endured hardship and difficulties in a strange country. She persisted in her unfettered search for truth and rejected several dogmas until, with an open mind and a prepared heart, she read in “The Christian Commonwealth” of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to London in 1911 and sent overseas for additional literature. When Mr and Mrs Dunn arrived in Auckland in 1922-3, Mrs Blundell invited them to her home, “Lymbury”, Ridings Road, Remuera to meet a group of twenty people whom she thought might be interested. This was the first Bahá’í meeting held in New Zealand and shortly afterwards Mrs Blundell accepted the Bahá’í Faith. </p>

    <p>  On hearing from Martha Root that Shoghi Effendi and the Ladies of the Household were eager to welcome the New Zealand friends, Sarah Blundell arranged to make the journey to the Holy Land in 1925 visit the Holy Family, and the Shrines of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and to meet in person many other Bahá’ís — this was “a crowning gift to one whose spiritual path had been travelled alone.”* She returned to New Zealand after first going home to England to see her relatives and, at the Guardian’s suggestion, make personal contact with the English Bahá’í community. She continued to work unsparingly in New Zealand to serve the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh until her passing at the age of eighty-four years on December 20th, 1934.</p>

   Ethel Blundell
   </p>
   
    <p>  One of her daughters, Ethel Blundell who accepted the Bahá’í Faith in 1925, was a delegate to the first Bahá’í Convention and was elected as a member of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Australia and New Zealand in May, 1934.</p>

    <p>  Mrs Blundell’s son, Hugh, was also destined to serve the Bahá’í Cause. Although not at that time a Bahá’í, Hugh accompanied his mother and sister on their pilgrimage to Haifa in 1925 and accepted the Faith the following year. A tireless worker for the Cause, he was New Zealand’s first Auxiliary Board Member and passed to the Abhá Kingdom on October 16th, 1976 in his ninety-second year. </p>
</aside>

<p id='2.2'> 	I forget whether I gave you the address of Mr and Mrs King, c/o Messrs Hayman and King, 202 Old Christchurch Rd. Bournemouth. They are very kind-hearted Bahá’ís and will be delighted to see any of you if you call. Both of them work in the business and you are most likely to see them if you call there. They live above the shop. </p>

<p id='2.3'> 	I gave you Sister Challis’s address at West Moors (Ferndown Lodge). You can get there by ‘bus from Bournemouth Sq. or Lansdowne, which will drop you right at Sister Challis’s door (She keeps a nursing home) or you can go by train from West Bournemouth to West Moors station which is within 5 minutes’ walk of Ferndown Lodge. I hope you will be able to see her. </p>

<p id='2.4'> 	As I write, the Greatest Holy Leaf is on a visit to the Shrine of the Master. It is over a year, I think, since she has been able to visit the shrine and until now she has not seen the new Gardens, in the laying out of which Shoghi Effendi has taken such a deep interest. The Gardens are looking lovely now and it is easy to imagine how delighted she will be. One day during the feast of Riḍván she and the Holy Mother were able to visit Bahjí and the Garden of Riḍván. </p>

<p id='2.5'> I have quite recovered from my pleurisy now and am steadily regaining my strength. </p>

<p id='2.6'> Shoghi Effendi is still tired. I hope he will soon be able to take a rest. </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn4'>
  
    <p>  Effie Baker became disenchanted with the Church and, having an open and enquiring attitude, was one of a committee formed in Melbourne responsible for arranging speakers to address the “New Thought” organisation. This led her to attend a public meeting at which Hyde Dunn spoke on the Bahá’í Faith and, recognising the truth of the Message, Effie Baker accepted the Faith the same evening and so became the first woman believer in Australia. She accompanied Martha Root on the latter’s lecture tour of New Zealand and, learning of the New Zealand Bahá’ís projected journey to the Holy Land in 1925, Effie sold her home and joined the pilgrims. </p>

    <p>  After the bounty of visiting the Shrines and meeting with the Guardian and the Greatest Holy Leaf, Effie acceded to Shoghi Effendi’s request and accompanied the New Zealand friends to London so as to contact the British Bahá’í community. She planned to return to Australia and assist the Dunns, and had accepted an invitation from the Ladies of the Holy Family to stop over in Haifa on her homeward journey, but on arriving there in June, she found Shoghi Effendi was away from the Holy Land and so decided to wait until he returned. Her offer to serve was accepted and she remained at the World Centre of the Bahá’í Faith in Israel for the next eleven years where she assumed the duties of hostess, welcoming the friends to the Pilgrim House, using her artistry and talent to photograph events in Haifa for the Guardian. In 1930, when the need arose to secure 1937 photographs of places in Persia associated with the early history of the Bahá’í Faith, Effie undertook arduous journeys by road through Syria and ‘Iráq, undeterred by danger from hostile bandits. This intrepid worker now embarked on an exacting and fruitful period of direct service to the Guardian, often using cars supplied by the Persian believers, at times travelling on horseback, mule or donkey to all but a few sites where it was too dangerous for a westerner to venture. The unique photographic record she obtained was immortalised by being selected by the Guardian for inclusion in Nabíl’s “The Dawnbreakers”.</p>

    <p>  In 1936, Effie returned to her homeland, Australia, where she looked after the National Archives over a long period. Her last years were spent in a small flat in the Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds in Sydney at the invitation of the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand who had been requested by the Guardian to take care of her until her passing on January 2nd, 1968. </p>

<p id='3'>	The Greatest Holy Leaf and Shoghi Effendi have asked me to answer on their behalf your kind letters of Apr. 2nd from Port Sa‘íd and April 14th from London. </p>

<p id='3.2'>	We were sorry to hear that Mrs Blundell got a chill on the steamer and was laid up for a few days after her arrival in London. We hope that by this time she is all right again. We had a note from her from Bournemouth. </p>

<p id='3.3'>	You will be glad to hear that the Greatest Holy Leaf and the Holy Mother were able to motor to Bahjí and Riḍván one day during the Feast of Riḍván, and that yesterday the Greatest Holy Leaf motored to the Shrine of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and saw the new Gardens in which Shoghi Effendi has been taking so much interest. </p>

<p id='3.4'>	Yesterday a Dutchman arrived here from Port Sa‘íd, the first Dutch Bahá’í, so far as we know. He has been a sincere and earnest truth-seeker for years. About 9 months ago he left his home at the Hague and walked on foot through Belgium, France and Italy. Then he felt some inward urge to go to Egypt, and travelled thither by a Dutch Cargo Steamer. When the steamer arrived at Port Sa‘íd, Maḥmúd Effendi, one of the Port Sa‘íd Bahá’ís came on board and was introduced to Mesdag (the Dutchman). They struck up a friendship at once and after 2 days Mesdag went to live in <span data-pg='7'></span> Maḥmúd’s house. There he met Martha Root, Mr Schopflocher and various other Bahá’ís, read my book and became thoroughly interested and seems now already a firm believer. He has already, since his arrival yesterday morning, translated our 8-page folder into Dutch and we hope he will be able to do much to make the Cause known in Holland and win adherents there.  </p>

<p id='3.5'>	I have quite recovered from my pleurisy now and am feeling almost as vigorous as before the attack. ‘Azíz’u’lláh Bahadur is now in Stuttgart. There is as yet no improvement in his hand, but he is having skilled treatment now and we hope it will be successful. He seems to be having a very happy time with the German friends. </p>

<p id='3.6'>	Shoghi Effendi is much in need of rest, but fairly well. He and all the members of the Holy Family join in loving greetings and heartfelt prayers for your welfare. We hope you will have a fine time in England and return to New Zealand refreshed and reinvigorated physically and spiritually to take up your work for the Kingdom there with new enthusiasm and devotion. We pray that you may always be guided and strengthened by the Divine Confirmations. </p>

	Dear Bahá’í Brother, </p>

<p id='4'>	Shoghi Effendi has asked me to reply to your kind letter of 11th April. He is delighted to hear that you propose starting a Bahá’í Magazine for Australia and New Zealand and suggests as a suitable title “The Herald of the South”. Every 19 days a letter will be sent from Haifa to Mr and Mrs Hyde Dunn giving the news of the Cause. Owing to the restricted facilities for multiplying copies which are at present available here, I fear it will not be possible to send another copy to you, but doubtless you can arrange with Mr and Mrs Hyde Dunn to have their copy passed on to you for the magazine. We are glad to hear that notwithstanding the absence of the Blundells and Margaret Stevenson, the friends in New Zealand are remaining united and active. We hope that when the pilgrims return the faith and enthusiasm of the believers will be greatly deepened and strengthened and that many new believers may be attracted. I had a long letter from Effie Baker yesterday. She is very devoted and whole-hearted and will be a valuable worker for the Cause, I think, and a great help to Father and Mother Dunn. When she wrote, Margaret Stevenson had gone to Scotland and Mrs and Miss Blundell were in Bournemouth. Effie Baker hopes to make a return visit to Haifa on her way back to Australia.</p>

	Alláh–u–Abhá. 
	Dear Bahá’í Sister, </p>

<p id='5'>  Shoghi Effendi asks me to thank you on his behalf for your letter of 14th May. He received the letter of Mrs. Amy Thornton all right. I remember answering it for him some weeks ago, so you can set your mind at rest on that score.</p>

<p id='5.2'>The recovery of your Bahá’í ring and stones was very remarkable. It reminds me of a somewhat similar occurrence in Bournemouth. One of our Bahá’í friends had her Bahá’í ring stolen, and nothing was heard or seen of it for some months. Mr King, another of our group, has an antique shop in Bournemouth and one day his partner (a non-Bahá’í) bought a ring from a man who said it was his wife’s, but as they had become very badly off she wanted to sell it. When Mr King saw the ring he recognized it as a Bahá’í ring and knowing that this friend had lost her ring, he sent it to me. It turned out to be her ring and she was delighted to recover it. The curious thing is that out of the dozens of jewellers and antique shops in Bournemouth to which the ring might have been taken for sale, it should be taken to the one where there was a Bahá’í who recognized it.</p>

<p id='5.3'>  I hope that before you leave Scotland you may be able to go to Aberdeen and see my home people. They would be delighted to see you. My father’s address is Fairford, Cults, (about 3 miles from Aberdeen, by car or train). He is 86 years of age and rather frail. My sister looks after him. My two <span data-pg='10'></span> married brothers are Peter Esslemont, 21, Louisville Avenue (Business: John E. Esslemont, 16 King Street) and W.D.E., 12 Wellbrae Terr., Mannofield. Both of their houses are near the Mannofield Car Line.</p>

<p id='5.4'>  We were very glad to hear of your meetings with the friends at London and West Moors.</p>

<p id='5.5'>  Many thanks for your letter to myself and the excellent snap-shots enclosed. I am glad you have fallen in love with Sister Challis and hope you will see her again before you leave. I had a delightful letter yesterday from Miss Kilford of West Moors, whom I regard as a Bahá’í grand-daughter, as she was brought into the Cause by Sister Challis who calls me her Bahá’í father! </p>

<p id='5.6'>  We hope Shoghi Effendi will get away soon for a much needed rest. The Greatest Holy Leaf was rather seriously ill last week, but is a good deal better again, although very feeble and frail. </p>

<p id='5.7'>  I have been advised by the Drs to leave Haifa for the summer months, as my breathing has lately been troublesome and they think the moist heat during the summer here would be bad for me. On the same day on which this decision was arrived at, I received a cordial invitation to go to a place in the Black Forest for my summer vacation. The Drs considered this place would be ideal for me and that the sooner I got away the better, so I leave in 3 days time. My address will be c/o Frau Victoria von Sigsfeld, Husli, Finsterlingen, bei St Blaisien, Baden, Germany. I hope to return to Haifa in the latter part of Sept. to resume my work here.</p>

	Dear Bahá’í Sister,  </p>

<p id='6'>  Shoghi Effendi received your kind letter and wishes me to acknowledge its receipt. He hopes that on your return to New Zealand you will obtain divine assistance in your services to the Cause. That land has been newly opened to the Bahá’í Movement. The work of the friends therefore, interesting and useful as it may be, is hard and most exacting to one’s patience and energy. It needs great perseverance to obtain a hearing among the people and draw their attention to this Blessed Cause. But once that that has been obtained and the way smoothed then progress becomes increasingly great and the fruits of your labours appreciated. </p>

<p id='6'>Shoghi Effendi is very glad that you have enjoyed your trip to England. The Friends there though they are few in number, are full of love and affection, one cannot but feel at home among them. </p>

<p id='6.2'>  Shoghi Effendi thanks Miss Nora Lee for the kind contribution she has made to the Cause. It will be spent for the progress of this movement so dear to the heart of us all. Enclosed there will be a receipt for that amount. </p>

<p id='7.2' class='italic'>  I have followed the progress of the activities of the Bahá’ís of Australia and New Zealand with keen interest and ever-increasing confidence, and with a deep sense of pride and gratitude. I most heartily welcome this newly-added link in the chain of the many services, so lovingly and spontaneously rendered by the pioneers of the Cause in these lands. I assure you of my steadfast prayers for the speedy expansion and consolidation of this youngest of all Bahá’í Magazines, and of my earnest endeavours to enable it attain a standard worthy of the bearer of such a noble Message.</p>

<p id='7.3' class='italic'>  It should be the object and purpose of its author and publisher to open its pages to the consideration and review of matters that are strictly Bahá’í in character, as well as to the treatment of topics of a humanitarian, ethical and religious nature; that its readers, while witnessing to the liberal and broad-minded attitude of the Bahá’í Cause, may receive from <span data-pg='13'></span> it their full share of inspiration which only a clear and direct statement of the Divine Message can impart. </p>

<p id='7.4' class='italic'>  Go forth, on thy noble errand, O thou Herald of the South! Join thy voice, however feeble, to those of thy sister-journals who, in various parts of the world, are raising with one accord the call of this new Day of God. Persevere in thy labours, endeavour to reach every circle and every home, that the light thou bearest may in the fulness of time illuminate with its healing rays the uttermost corners of that distant and troubled continent.</p>

	My very dear Spiritual Sister:  </p>

<p id='10'> Shoghi Effendi has been in receipt of your interesting letter dated June 7, 1926. It is a great pity that your health has more or less handicapped you in your service to the Cause. We, however, hope that this weakness will soon vanish and your health and strength be fully restored.</p>

<p id='10.2'> The case of the teacher who has been in Palestine is one really to be lamented. All such persons instead of procuring their information from the very source, when they are so near to it, they go to the Missionaries who are undoubtedly biased. They are immediately told that the Cause is nothing more than a sect of Islám; a Movement that may do immense good to the Muḥammadan world, but far from ranking with Christianity or satisfying its needs. Then they refer this ignorant and innocent person to books such as Brown’s. It is their fault for having gone to the wrong source for proper information, but once they have gone it is not their mistake to have been misled. We have heard of many such instances and there is absolutely no remedy except to leave them until they find the truth for themselves. We can only pray for their guidance. </p>

<p id='10.3'> Shoghi Effendi always prays for you as well as the other Auckland friends, so that through your combined efforts the Cause may prosper there, and obtain a strong position in the life of the people. I am not the least familiar with the social conditions there, but I am sure there is a ready field for active service.</p>

	My dear Spiritual Sister:  </p>

<p id='11'> Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated June 7, 1926. It was most interesting to go over your circular letter and read the many points of interest. I was especially struck by the literature you have sent to Lord and Lady Allenby. If they have at all seen them I am sure they were much impressed, for they knew the Master so well. They were surely very astonished to see a group of Bahá’ís formed in such a distant land.</p>

<p id='11.2'> I am very ashamed of myself not to have yet answered your letter of some months ago. It was mainly because Shoghi Effendi wrote you and acknowledged the receipt of your contribution for the pilgrim house that I have been so neglectful. I took Miss Baker’s advice on the matter and together we went down-town and bought a set of straw chairs. We thought that would be most appreciated by the friends while sitting in the veranda of the new Pilgrim House. </p>

<p id='11.3'> I remember a prayer, which you wrote, has been asked by a certain friend to be read daily. I believe sometimes the friends through their zeal and ardour do things that are not asked in the Cause. We have only one prayer that we have to say daily. No one in the world has the power, given to him by Bahá’u’lláh to add another to that daily prayer. If we should admit this the life of the friends will soon be spent in mere prayer, which is not the aim of the Cause. The healing prayer and such ones are only for occasional use when the need arises. <span data-pg='21'></span> </p>

	Dear Spiritual Sister:  </p>

<p id='15'>  Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated September 13th 1926. He was most gratified to read the nice and encouraging news it contained.<a data-fnid='5'></a> He hopes that the “Herald of the South” will daily increase in importance and now that it is coming out in printed form, obtain a great number of readers. You should try from the very start to maintain a high standard for its articles. They should be broad in view, clear in style and scholarly in their development of the different subjects. In short the ‘public’ should be taught to consider it as a paper fully worthwhile to read and meditate upon. Shoghi Effendi will remember in his prayers all those who are working in this noble field of service.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn5'>
     <p>  Mrs Amy Dewing and her son Bertram were among New Zealand’s earliest Bahá’ís; Mrs Dewing came from an orthodox Church of England background and viewed with disapproval her son’s questioning attitude which led him to describe himself as a Rationalist. They heard of and accepted the Truth of the Bahá’í Cause after meeting with “Mother” and “Father” Dunn in Devonport, Auckland and, in 1926, both of them served as members of the first Local Spiritual Assembly in Auckland. Amy Dewing, as one of a small and persevering group of New Zealand believers, was active in spreading the Message as was her son through whose efforts a Bahá’í magazine was published in Australia and New Zealand to promote the teachings. Prior to her passing in 1957, Amy Dewing witnessed the emergence of the New Zealand community as an independent entity. </p>

    <p>  Having travelled extensively overseas, Bertram Dewing eventually settled in Auckland. A tireless worker for the Faith, he was a member of the first Local Spiritual Assembly in Devonport in 1951 and in 1958 was elected to the second National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of New Zealand. He pioneered to Hokianga in the same year and a decade later assisted in spreading the Faith to New Plymouth where he worked for the Cause with unabated zeal until he passed to the Abhá Kingdom in 1972 at the age of seventy.</p>
</aside>

<p id='15.2'>  Shoghi Effendi desires that you should extend his loving greetings to all the friends in Auckland. He hopes that through their endeavours and the Master’s invisible guiding hand they will succeed to raise the standard of the Cause in that land to such heights that it will arouse the interest of all the seeking souls and in due time win their support. </p>

<p id='15.3'>  The members of the Master’s family are well and send you their loving greetings.</p>

May its voice grow in strength and power, and may its pages increasingly reflect the dynamic spirit of the Faith and mirror forth the ever-expanding activities of the friends in Australasia as well as in distant lands. Persevere in your efforts, let not obstacles damp your zeal and determination and rest assured that the Power of God which is reinforcing your efforts will in the end triumph and enable you to fulfil your cherished desire.</p>

<h4 class='subhead no-pad-above recipient' id='lt_16b'> To Amy Dewing </h4>

<p class='salutation noid verse' id='lt_16c'> 
	Dear Bahá’í Sister,  </p>

<p id='16'>  Our beloved Guardian has asked me to write to you for him. He is very pleased with your letter of Dec. 8th which reached him on Jan. 10th and he is very glad to hear of your activities in New Zealand. He will pray earnestly that your sincere efforts to make Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation widely known will bring forth much fruit and have a great result. In the newer countries minds are more open, and the people more ready and willing to receive this Great Message.</p>

<p id='16.2'>  With regard to the Queen of Rumania’s 3 articles — he will see that you receive them correctly. He considers the last one in which she acknowledges Muḥammad as a true Prophet of God to have great importance for the East and especially in Persia. This evening, I personally have had a most interesting conversation with Dr. Habíb of Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh <a data-fnid='7'></a> who is now on a visit to Shoghi Effendi with his wife and little girl. He was telling us of the continued fanaticism of the Moslems of Persia — and how during two periods of the year especially, the fanatical Mullás preach against the Bahá’ís from their pulpits — saying to the ignorant “No matter what evil things you have done during your life, or what sins you have committed, <span data-pg='26'></span> if you kill a Bahá’í who is an enemy of Islám, or even if you take his property or severely injure him, all your own sins will be wiped out and forgiven for the sake of this good deed of destroying an enemy of the Faith!!” — in this way they incite the people to deeds of violence and persecution. He said that the Bahá’í teachings are spreading rapidly amongst the more educated classes — but it is difficult to teach the very poor and ignorant fanatical people — tho’ when they do become Believers, they are very strong and faithful. The 2 periods of particular danger for the Bahá’ís in Persia are the fast month and the period of Moharram <a data-fnid='8'></a> — which lasts for 8 weeks.</p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn7'>
    <p>  Dr Habíb, whose older brother attained martyrdom, was born in 1888 at Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh, Persia and was given the name Mu’ayyad (meaning ‘confirmed’) by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. At the age of twenty-one, when en route to Beirut to begin his medical studies at the American University, he spent a month in the Holy Land with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who took a personal interest in his progress. Thereafter he returned each summer to serve the Cause, extending hospitality to visitors and pilgrims, recording daily events, acquiring spiritual knowledge from outstanding Bahá’í scholars and being entrusted with the receipt and dispatch of Tablets. Referring to Habíb’s student days, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá extolled the young man’s influence, detachment and sanctity, saying “the fragrance of Beirut” perfumed His nostrils. </p>

    <p>  After graduating from the University of Beirut in 1914, Dr Habíb operated a dispensary at Abu-Sinan, a Druse village northeast of ‘Akká where the Master had temporarily settled the Bahá’ís: this period of close contact with the Holy Family and daily lessons from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá he was later to describe as the “most precious segment of his life”. In a Tablet to Dr Habíb’s father, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá described this dedicated young Bahá’í as “A lamp enkindled with the love of God”. </p>

    <p>  In 1915, responding to the Master’s specific instructions, Dr Habíb returned to his birthplace to practice his profession and teach the Faith to which he was so deeply devoted, and was for forty years a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh, also serving for a period on the National Spiritual Assembly. His published works include two volumes of reminiscences based on the principles of the Covenant and the history of the Cause, whilst his much loved poem entitled “Hold Thou my Hand, O ‘Abdu’l-Bahá” is widely sung at gatherings of the Bahá’ís in Írán. Dr Habíb Mu’ayyad passed to the Abhá Kingdom on October 29th, 1971. </p>
</aside>

<aside class='fn' id='fn8'>
    <p>  The Moslem calendar dates from Muḥammad’s emigration or Hijrah from Mecca to Medina in 622 A.D. The Moslem year begins with the month of Muharram of which the first ten days are observed by <u>Sh</u>í‘ah Moslems as part of their mourning period for the Imáms. The tenth day is called Ashura and commemorates the martyrdom of Ḥusayn, the grand-son of Muḥammad, who was cut down by thirty-three strokes of swords and lances and decapitated: his clothes were torn from him and his naked body trampled by horses hooves.</p>
</aside>

<p id='16.3'>  Shoghi Effendi is very interested to hear of the engagement of your son to a Bahá’í young lady — and he prays that in future they may do a great work for the “Cause”. He hopes so much that you will recover your full health and strength, and he will pray especially for that. It is good to know that Esperanto is increasingly studied in New Zealand. </p>

<p id='16.4'>  He will certainly pray for Miss Palter <a data-fnid='9'></a> and her Mother as you ask him to do — and also for your dear son and your two daughters. Please accept all best wishes from myself and Believe me</p>

   Emily Axford
   </p>
    <p>  Mrs Emily Axford was born in Huddersfield, England on October 19th, 1870 and was an infant teacher before her marriage. In 1907, the family emigrated to New Zealand where her husband practiced medicine in Te Aroha until his passing in 1912, after which Mrs Axford moved to Auckland so as to educate her three children. Having rejected conventional Christianity, she was attracted by the New England Transcendental Movement until she became aware of the Bahá’í Faith through her friendship with Sarah Blundell and was enrolled as a member in 1923. Three years later, Mrs Axford was elected Chairman of the first Local Spiritual Assembly in Auckland and for many years conducted classes in public speaking to help the friends overcome their shyness and reticence so that they might teach the Faith effectively. Emily was one of three New Zealand delegates who attended the National Convention held in Sydney during 1934 and the following year was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Australia and New Zealand. She continued to work staunchly for the Faith, being appointed in 1946 to the Regional Teaching Committee responsible for formulating teaching plans throughout New Zealand. The following year, she assumed the delicate task of conducting negotiations with the immigration authorities so that Bahá’ís from Persia might be permitted to enter New Zealand as University students, and was actively engaged in this work up to the time of her passing on December 26th, 1949. </p>
</aside>

<p id='23.2'>  The Guardian has already written Mr. Paul and expressed to him his deep appreciation for the service he has rendered to the Faith, but especially to his own people who through the means of such literature will be acquainted with the teachings and will receive the light of guidance brought to the world by Bahá’u’lláh. </p>

<p id='23.3'>  I believe the Guardian has already intimated his approval of this pamphlet and the desire that the friends in Australia publish and circulate it among the Maoris. </p>

<p id='23.4'>  As regards the passages in the sacred writings indicating the wrath of God; Shoghi Effendi says that the Divinity has many attributes: He is loving and merciful but also just. Just as reward and punishment, according to Bahá’u’lláh, are the pillars upon which society rests, so mercy and justice may be considered as their counterpart in the world to come. Should we disobey God and work against His commands He will view our acts in the light of justice and punish us for it. That punishment may not be in the form of fire, as some believe, but in the form of spiritual deprivation and degradation. This is why we read so often in the prayers statements such as “God do not deal with us with justice, but rather through thy infinite mercy.” The wrath of God is in the administration of His justice, both in this world and in the world <span data-pg='33'></span> to come. A God that is only loving or only just is not a perfect God. The divinity has to possess both of these aspects as every father ought to express both in his attitude towards his children. If we ponder a while, we will see that our welfare can be insured only when both of these divine attributes are equally emphasised and practiced. </p>

<p id='23.5'>  In closing may I express the Guardian’s loving greetings and best wishes for the progress of your work in serving the Cause.</p>

<p class='salutation noid verse' id='lt_24c'> 
	Dear Bahá’í Friend,  </p>

<p id='24'>  Shoghi Effendi has directed me to address you these few lines, acknowledging the receipt of your welcome letter of July 20th, 33, which he has read with deepest interest. He was gratified to learn that you have newly embraced the Cause and that you are earnestly endeavouring to spread it through every possible means. It is on young and active Bahá’ís, like you, that the Guardian centers all his hopes for the future progress and expansion of the Cause and it is on their shoulders that he lays all the responsibility for the upkeep of the spirit of selfless service among their fellow-believers. Without that spirit, no work can be successfully achieved. With it triumph, though hardly-won, is but inevitable. You should, therefore, try all your best to carry aflame within you the torch of faith, for through it you will surely find guidance, strength and eventual success. <span data-pg='34'></span> </p>

<p id='24.2'>  The Guardian is fully conscious of the difficulties that impede the progress of the Faith in your community. Chief among these, you mention the lack of courage and of initiative on the part of the believers, and a feeling of inferiority complex which prevents them from addressing the public. It is precisely these weaknesses that he wishes the friends to overcome, for these do not only paralyze their efforts but actually serve to quench the flame of faith in their hearts. Not until all the friends come to realize that every one of them is able, in his own measure, to deliver the Message, can they ever hope to reach the goal that has been set before them by a loving and wise Master. It is no use waiting for some able and eloquent teacher to take all the responsibility for the spread of the Cause. For such a thing is not only contrary to the spirit of the Teachings but to the explicit text of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, both of whom place the obligation of teaching not on any particular class, as in former ecclesiastical organizations, but on every faithful and loyal follower of the Cause. The teaching of the Word is thus made universal and compulsory. How long then shall we wait to carry out this command, the full wisdom of which only future generations will be able to appreciate? We have no special teachers in the Cause. Everyone is a potential teacher. He has only to use what God has given him and thus prove that he is faithful to his trust.</p>

<p id='24.3'>  Visiting teachers, who are, at least in a general way, supposed to be more competent and able than the rest, are undoubtedly of a great help. But these can never replace the mass of individual believers and fulfil what must be inevitably accomplished through the collective effort and wisdom of the community at large. What visiting teachers are supposed to do is to give the final touch to the work that has been done, to consolidate rather than supplement individual efforts and thereby direct them in a constructive and suitable channel. Their task is to encourage and inspire individual believers, and to broaden and deepen their vision of the task that is to be <span data-pg='35'></span> done. And this, not by virtue of any inherent spiritual right, but in the spirit of simple and whole-hearted cooperation. </p>

<p id='24.4'>  It is in this light that Shoghi Effendi views the whole problem of teaching not only in New Zealand but in all the Bahá’í world. He would, therefore, encourage you to take a leading part in the carrying out of his wishes on this point, to take yourself an active interest in teaching, not only private but also public, and in this way stimulate the friends to follow your example. It is then, and only then, that there can be a need for a qualified and competent visiting teacher in order to bring to full fruition individual teaching efforts. </p>

<p id='24.5'>  Assuring you of our Guardian’s fervent prayers on your behalf, so that you may be increasingly blessed in your efforts for the spread of the Message.</p>

<p id='26'>  The Guardian was profoundly grieved to learn of the passing away of your dear mother, and has directed me to convey to you and to the bereaved members of your family, his heartfelt condolences and sympathy for this severe loss which you have sustained. </p>

<p id='26.2'>  Mrs Blundell’s departure is, indeed, a loss not only to her family, but also to the community of her fellow-believers in New Zealand. For in her they have come to lose one of their oldest and most distinguished co-workers. </p>

<p id='26.4'>  Shoghi Effendi is fervently praying for the soul of our departed sister, and is entreating Bahá’u’lláh to give her her full share of divine blessings in the other world. </p>

<p id='27'>  Shoghi Effendi has just been in receipt of your kind letter of the fourteenth of December last, and has read its <span data-pg='41'></span> contents with deep interest and gratification. It made him so happy, indeed, to learn that you are pursuing your activities for the Faith with such steadfastness and self-sacrifice, and also that through your beautiful and loving spirit those members of your family who have not yet embraced the Faith are being gradually attracted to it. He is ardently entreating Bahá’u’lláh that through your inspiration and guidance their interest in the Teachings may wax stronger and lead them to eventually espouse His Cause. </p>

<p id='27.2'>  With reference to the suggestion made by Mr Alexander <a data-fnid='12'></a> for taking a record of the Guardian’s voice, he wishes me to inform you that although he fully appreciates the spirit in which this and similar suggestions are made to him he is, nevertheless, extremely reluctant that the believers should give any prominence to his writings, specially in the meetings which, he is firmly convinced, should be chiefly devoted to the reading and study of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and the Master.</p>

An adventurous and enquiring soul, she undertook her first pilgrimage to Haifa in 1938, arriving there shortly after the marriage of Shoghi Effendi and, after living for two years in Australia, she returned to New Zealand where she embarked on a life of service to the Cause. Towards the end of the Second World War, she willingly made available her premises (a counter lunch-shop) in Anzac Avenue as a venue for the Auckland Bahá’í community and, in the 1950’s, responded to the call by travel teaching in Mangakino and Whangarei. She served on the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of New Zealand during 1958 and, two years later, moved from Christchurch to Hamilton to aid in establishing an assembly there. 1964 saw her travel teaching in Invercargill and the following year she was appointed to the National Teaching Committee. Responding to the need for the believers to establish another assembly, Kitty finally made her home in Tauranga where she is an active and much loved exponent of the Cause.</p>

	Dear Bahá’í Sister,  </p>

<p id='35'>  I am directed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated February 25th, informing him of the date of your departure from England, and your inability to defer your visit to Haifa till next November. He regrets indeed that you should find it impossible to extend your stay in Europe and come to Palestine in autumn, as the situation here is now so tense and dangerous that there seems very little hope of any real amelioration in security conditions to take <span data-pg='49'></span> place by next May. General conditions throughout the country are, at present, even worse than a month ago, and the tension is daily increasing. </p>

<p id='35.2'>  In case, however, security is reestablished by the time you reach Port-Said, you would be welcome to visit the Shrines, but the Guardian would be still away. </p>

<p id='35.3'> Wishing you again a successful and happy return home, and with the renewed assurance of the Guardian’s prayers for your welfare, protection and guidance, </p>
  
<p class='signature noid verse'>Yours most sincerely,
	H. Rabbání </p>



<p class='ed noid'> 	[From the Guardian:] </p>

<p class='salutation noid'>Dear and valued co-worker: </p>

<p id='35.4' class='italic'>I deeply regret that the situation in Palestine has not yet improved as I realize how eager you are to visit the Holy Shrines. If however when you reach Port-Said it will at all be possible for you to visit the Shrine, you will be most welcome, I assure you. May the Almighty fulfil the dearest hope of your heart, </p>

<p id='36'>  Shoghi Effendi has instructed me to answer your letter to him of May 10th, which just came. </p>

<p id='36.2'>  He was, as already expressed in the cable he sent you, greatly impressed by the statement in the Quarterly on the true Bahá’í attitude at the present time. It displayed a correctness of viewpoint, a courage, and a loyalty to Bahá’u’lláh which has led him to disseminate it far and wide: in the American News Letter, in the two Haifa News Letters, English and Persian, etc. It was indeed a timely and most noble contribution to the Faith. </p>

<p id='36.3'>  The friends in both Australia and New Zealand seem to <span data-pg='50'></span> have developed a most outstanding soundness in their relation to the teachings. This leads Shoghi Effendi to believe that they will make great contributions to the unfoldment of the world-wide aspects of the Faith.</p>

<p id='36.4'>  His prayers are always with you, and he most deeply appreciates the splendid services you are rendering the Cause, and will pray that the way will open for you to do even greater work and in an ever widening field. </p>

<p id='36.5'>  Please assure all the dear friends of Auckland of his loving remembrance and his prayers for their work.</p>

<p class='salutation noid verse' id='lt_37c'> 
	Dear Bahá’í Brother:  </p>

<p id='37'>  Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Dec. 12th has been received, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. The previous letter you mention cannot have reached him, as he always replies to letters from the friends. </p>

<p id='37.2'>  Your book <a data-fnid='16'></a> touches on a very important subject, and he regrets that he cannot read it himself. His work is so pressing and multiplying so fast that he invariably refuses to go over the manuscripts the friends send him as he simply cannot attend to such things as well as all his other work. You should send it to the Reviewing Com. in the U.S.A. and ask <span data-pg='51'></span> their advice. Perhaps an outside publisher would be interested in it? The Bahá’í funds have such heavy demands made on them at present that even essential literature must often wait to be published, unfortunately. </p>

<aside class='fn' id='fn16'>
  <p>  This refers to a book on Islám written by Bertram Dewing which was never published. Addressees Letters addressed to individuals by letter number. Only letters presented in their entirety are indicated.</p>
</aside>

<p id='37.3'>  He fully appreciates the fact that the believers locally, in different parts of the world, often feel that their political party is in many ways striving to accomplish ideals akin to our Bahá’í aims — but the fact remains that the only way for the Bahá’ís to preserve their international character, their unity and integrity, is for them individually to sacrifice these desired political affiliations for the universal good and protection of the Faith. There is no political party in existence with whose platform we wholly agree, and we must abstain from membership in such parties. Likewise people who join the Faith must have the courage and conviction to leave their political affiliations behind.</p>

<p id='37.4'>  There is no reason why this should cause enmity as they are not joining another party, but a universal Faith striving for the advancement of the entire human race. He thinks there is very little possibility of any politician joining the Faith. The sacrifice of such individuals’ personal ambitions is too great a one for them to make. The condition of the world today is such that it is obvious no political solution to its problems is going to be found. We Bahá’ís must therefore concentrate on Bahá’u’lláh’s World Order — the true solution. </p>

<p id='37.5'>  He assures you he will pray your teaching labours may be very successful. He will also pray for your dear mother’s welfare.</p>

	Dear Bahá’í Sister:  </p>

<p id='38'>  Your letter of October 28 has been received, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. </p>

<p id='38.2'>  First, let me say how very deeply he appreciates the services you have been rendering our glorious Faith in Australia, and particularly Perth, during the past two years. Your trip has been of real assistance to the teaching work, and it pleased him greatly. </p>

<p id='38.3'>  Regarding Mr. ...: it was with the approval of the Guardian that his name was removed from the voting list. It is very bad for the Cause to have a member of the Community, actively, in the public eye, teaching the Faith, and at the same time showing dishonest characteristics. We cannot possibly say that because a person also has many virtues, faults as grave as lying and dishonourable conduct regarding money, can be overlooked! This means that we tolerate as representatives of our Faith people who flagrantly disobey its laws and fundamental teachings. This does not mean there is no hope for Mr. ...; let him change his conduct, if he really loves the Cause, and then a way will be opened for him to again be active. But the change must be real and obvious; mere protestations will serve no purpose. </p>

<p id='38.4'>  He urges you to continue your services in the teaching field in New Zealand, and also to write to the friends in Australia who are disturbed about Mr. ..., and strengthen their faith and determination.</p>

<p id='39.'>  Your letter of November 1st was received, and, although our beloved Guardian is so busy at present on the Shrine work here that his mail is piling up alarmingly, he does want to send you a word of appreciation for your fine, constructive spirit and the services you are rendering the Faith. </p>

<p id='39.2'>  Vicious criticism is indeed a calamity. But its root is lack of faith in the system of Bahá’u’lláh (i.e. the administrative order) and lack of obedience to Him — for He has forbidden it. If the Bahá’ís would follow the Bahá’í laws in voting, in electing, in serving, and in abiding by assembly decisions, all this waste of strength thru criticizing others could be diverted into cooperation and achieving the Plan. Keep on trying to point this out to them!</p>

<p class='salutation noid verse' id='lt_64c'> 
	Message from the Guardian at the inception of the New Zealand National Spiritual Assembly.  </p>

<p id='64'>  I share with the assembled delegates, gathered to elect, on this historic occasion, the second National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the Antipodes, the feelings of profound satisfaction and gratitude to Bahá’u’lláh evoked by <span data-pg='71'></span> this epoch-making event in the evolution of His Faith in that far off region of the globe. I am deeply conscious of the decisive share which the Australian Bahá’í Community, labouring during more than three decades, for the spread of the light of this glorious revelation among the highly progressive people of that distant continent, has had in the laying of the foundations of the Administrative Order and the erection of yet another pillar of the future Universal House of Justice in this remote Dominion.</p>

<p id='64.2'>  The emergence of this independent Bahá’í Community, no matter how limited its numerical strength and modest its resources, must be regarded as a highly significant development in the rise and establishment of the Bahá’í Faith in the Pacific Area, and should synchronise with the formulation, on the part of the National Spiritual Assembly now being elected in that Island, of a subsidiary Six-Year-Plan, designed to reinforce substantially the numerical strength of the Community; to multiply its Centres, as well as its Local Spiritual Assemblies; to incorporate the solidly grounded amongst them; to inaugurate a National Fund; to obtain recognition for both the Bahá’í marriage certificate and the Bahá’í Holy Days; to lend an unprecedented impetus to the conversion of the Maoris, and to ensure their active participation in the conduct of Bahá’í Administrative Institutions; to extend the scope of the work already initiated in the South Island; to incorporate the newly formed National Spiritual Assembly, and to select and acquire a site for the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of that Dominion. </p>

<p id='64.3'>  I call upon the members of the Australian National Spiritual Assembly, as well as the members of the Australian Bahá’í Community, to continue to lend their valued support to this newly pledged sister Community, and to enable it, through the extension of material assistance as well as the dispatch of visiting teachers and pioneers, to contribute, in an ever increasing measure, to the furtherance of the magnificent and colossal campaign now being so vigorously <span data-pg='72'></span> conducted in the North, in the South, and in the heart of the Pacific Ocean. </p>

<p id='64.4'>  May the outpourings of the Holy Spirit continue to energise this small yet resolute forward marching, dedicated community, and may the outcome of the collective efforts of its members contribute decisively to the triumphant consummation of the World Crusade on which the entire body of the followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh have so confidently embarked. </p>

<p class='salutation noid verse' id='lt_66c'>  
	Dear Bahá’í Sister: </p>

<p id='66'>  I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to write you on his behalf and assure you he was most happy to receive your letter dated May 4. <span data-pg='73'></span> </p>

<p id='66.2'>  He rejoices with the New Zealand Bahá’ís in the formation of their historic National Assembly. They are now firmly launched on the course of their own destiny, and undoubtedly the Faith will go forward very much faster. They have an advantage not shared by many of their fellow National Assemblies, of exclusively administering the affairs of the Faith in a small area, which means that they can function much more efficiently. When one remembers the many years that the New Zealand and Australian believers toiled to carry on the work in those two countries, with the sea in between, and inadequate funds to provide transportation, which necessitated so much of the National Assembly’s work being carried on by correspondence, one can appreciate the advantages you now enjoy. </p>

<p id='66.3'>  The formation of a new National Body in any case is an organic thing, and a new and lively flow of life will go out into all the members of the Community from this Assembly. </p>

<p id='66.4'>  As regards the question you asked him about the site for the Temple, this need not be a large piece of land at this time — three or four acres would be sufficient for the site if you find suitable land is expensive. If the worst comes to the worst, when the time comes to build the Temple, the site can be changed. In Uganda some years ago, they purchased a Temple site, and later, a large piece of land for their endowment. With the Guardian’s permission, they exchanged the two as the Endowment’s position was better for the Temple. So you see, it need not be too rigid. The point is to get a Temple site as soon as possible. He feels it should be in the outskirts of Auckland, within easy motoring distance, so that the friends can attend services there. Naturally the closer to the city, the better. </p>

<p id='66.5'>  As you formulate your plans and carry them out for the work entrusted to you during the next six years, he wishes you to particularly bear in mind the need of teaching the Maoris. These original discoverers of New Zealand are of a very fine race, and they are a people long admired for their <span data-pg='74'></span> noble qualities; and special effort should be made, not only to contact the Maoris in the cities and draw them into the Faith, but to go to their towns and live amongst them and establish Assemblies in which at least the majority of the believers will be Maoris, if not all. This would be indeed a worthy achievement. </p>

<p id='66.6'>  The beloved Guardian assures you all of his prayers for the success of the historic work you are now undertaking, and he feels sure you will achieve your goals. </p>

<p class='ed noid'> 	[From the Guardian:] </p>

<p class='salutation noid'>Dear and valued co-workers: </p>

<p id='66.7' class='italic'>The emergence of the New Zealand National Spiritual Assembly, as a result of the convocation of the first Bahá’í historic Convention held in that far-away and promising Dominion, will be hailed by posterity as an event of the greatest significance, marking the erection of another pillar designed to support, in the South Pacific area, the future Universal House of Justice. My heart overflows with happiness and is filled with gratitude as I contemplate the splendid progress achieved, in recent years, in that far-off island, and note the loyalty and devotion with which the members of this valiant community, now standing on the threshold of unprecedented achievements, have discharged their manifold and sacred responsibilities. </p>


<p id='66.8' class='italic'>	The six brief years that now lie ahead must witness a swift expansion in the scope of Bahá’í activities throughout the length and breadth of that Dominion, as well as a steady consolidation of the foundations of the institutions that have been so painstakingly laid. The Six-Year Plan upon which the New Zealand believers have now so auspiciously embarked must be diligently prosecuted and brought to a triumphant conclusion. All must participate, whether young or old, veterans as well as newly enrolled believers, all must contribute their share to the ultimate success of this mighty collective <span data-pg='75'></span> enterprise, however limited their means, however modest their abilities, however restricted the range of their previous experiences. </p>

<p id='66.9' class='italic'>	The increase in the number of the avowed adherents of the Faith; the multiplication of isolated centres, groups, and local assemblies; the incorporation of the newly formed National Spiritual Assembly as well as all firmly grounded local assemblies; the recognition of the Bahá’í marriage certificate by the civil authorities, and of the Bahá’í Holy Days by the Superintendent of schools in that island; the rapid conversion of the Maoris and their close association with the white believers in the administration of the affairs of the community; the consolidation of the work energetically initiated in the South Island; the selection and purchase of the site for the Mother Temple of New Zealand — these stand out as the foremost objectives of the Plan now demanding of its high minded determined prosecutors, the utmost consecration, unrelaxing vigilance and the noblest self-sacrifice. </p>

<p id='66.10' class='italic'>	The tasks, challenging the spirit and resources of this community, whose numerical strength is as yet so limited, whose material resources are so circumscribed, whose past experiences have, in many respects, been confined to a narrow range, are truly formidable. The alloted time, during which so stupendous an undertaking is to be consummated, is short. The obstacles confronting its members are varied and manifold. Yet the sustaining grace promised to all those who will arise, with single-mindedness, courage, dedication and high resolve to aid in the attainment of these noble objectives, is of such potency that no earthly power can resist the ultimate fulfilment of so glorious a task, or even delay its eventual fruition. </p>

<p id='66.11' class='italic'>	I appeal most earnestly to all those who, in both the teaching and administrative fields, are committed to carry out so magnificent an enterprise, as well as to those who, in an unofficial capacity, are called upon to further, by every means in their power, the interests of this epoch-making <span data-pg='76'></span> Plan, to dedicate themselves, at this hour to the arduous, yet infinitely precious task they have shouldered, and to devote, in the days and years that lie ahead, every ounce of their energy to the systematic prosecution of a Plan, on which the immediate destinies of the entire New Zealand Bahá’í community directly depend; and which can alone provide the stepping-stone to the still more brilliant achievements destined to ennoble the annals of the Faith in that remote island of the globe.</p>

	Dear Bahá’í Brother: </p>

<p id='67'>  ...As regards the “Herald of the South” magazine, in view of the important work lying ahead of your Assembly, and the fact that this magazine is a drain on the limited resources of the Community, he thinks it would be quite all right to suspend publication until a future date when the financial situation permits such expenditures to be made with relative ease. He leaves, however, the final decision to your Assembly. </p>

<p id='67.2'>  The Committee responsible for the publication of this magazine has certainly laboured valiantly throughout the years, and the publication will be missed by its readers. However, it is some years since the American Bahá’í Magazine was abandoned for similar reasons, and the Guardian feels that you can do so in Australia, and the funds be used to better advantage, at this time. However, now that you have found a printer in Sydney and appointed a new committee, he thinks you should continue it and give the new Plan a try.... </p>

<p id='67.3'>  The successful culmination of the long standing partnership of the Australian and New Zealand believers thru the emergence of the New Zealand N. S. A. is a source of great satisfaction to the Guardian, and no doubt to all the <span data-pg='77'></span> members of both communities. He feels sure this will mark a turning point in the work in the Antipodes and the neighbouring islands and give a new lease of life to the teaching work throughout that area. Both your Assembly and that of New Zealand have now emerged into your permanent form as pillars of the future International House of Justice. The bones of the skeleton of the World Order are growing strong, but only the teaching work can clothe them with flesh....</p>

<p class='salutation noid'>Dear and valued co-workers: </p>

<p id='67.4' class='italic'>...Particularly commendable, and indeed exemplary, has been the share of the Australian believers in enabling the New-Zealand Bahá’í Community to make such rapid strides, in recent years, strides that have prepared it for the assumption of its sacred and vital function as an independent community, and which culminated in the formation of a body qualified to take its place, and assume the weighty responsibilities incumbent on it, as a distinct and separate member of the world-wide family of Bahá’í national and regional Spiritual Assemblies....</p>

<p id='75'> 	We cannot prove man was always man for this is a fundamental doctrine, but it is based on the assertion that nothing can exceed its own potentialities, that everything, a stone, a tree, an animal and a human being existed in plan, potentially, from the very “beginning” of creation. We don’t believe man has always had the form of man, but rather that from the outset he was going to evolve into the human form and species and not be a haphazard branch of the ape family. </p>

<p id='75.2'>	You see our whole approach to each matter is based on the belief that God sends us divinely inspired Educators; what they tell us is fundamentally true, what science tells us today is true; tomorrow may be entirely changed to better explain a new set of facts.</p>

<p id='75.3'>	When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says man breaks the laws of nature, He means we shape nature to meet our own needs, as no animal does. Animals adapt themselves to better fit in with and benefit from their environment. But men both surmount and change environment. Likewise when He says nature is devoid of memory He means memory as we have it, not the strange memory of inherited habits which animals so strikingly possess.</p> 

<p id='75.4'>	These various statements must be taken in conjunction <span data-pg='86'></span> with all the Bahá’í teachings; we cannot get a correct picture by concentrating on just one phrase.</p>

<p id='80'> 	We must not take many of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements as dogmatic finalities, for there are other points which when added to them round out the picture. For instance, when He calls Aristotle and Plato Philosophers of the East, He is obviously placing them in that category because He believes they belong more correctly to Eastern culture than to Central European and the New World cultures of the West. When He calls the philosophers of the West materialistic this does not for a moment mean He includes all Western philosophers for, as you truly point out, many of them have been very spiritual in their concepts.... </p>

<p id='82'> 	When studying at present, in English, the available Bahá’í writings on the subject of body, soul and spirit, one is handicapped by a certain lack of clarity because not all were translated by the same person, and also there are, as you know, still many Bahá’í writings untranslated. But there is no doubt that spirit and soul seem to have been interchanged in meaning sometimes; soul and mind have, likewise, been interchanged in meaning, no doubt due to difficulties arising from different translations. What the Bahá’ís do believe though is that we have three aspects of our humanness, so to speak, a body, a mind and an immortal identity — soul or spirit. We believe the mind forms a link between the soul and the body, and the two interact on each other. </p>
