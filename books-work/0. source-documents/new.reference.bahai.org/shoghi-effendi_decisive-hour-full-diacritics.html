I am deeply conscious of the many obstacles that stand in the path of
the American believers in their stupendous endeavor to attain their
goal—a goal on which our dearly beloved Greatest Holy Leaf had set
her fondest hopes. I cannot, however, overlook, much as I sympathize
with them in their financial tribulation and anxieties, the
mysterious power which resides in the united will and concerted
action of all the members of that self-sacrificing community—a
community which, since the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, has lent an
impetus to the advancement of the Cause out of all proportion to its
numerical strength, its youthfulness, and experience of the powers
latent in this sacred Faith. What an untold wealth of blessings will
flow out of a renewed, an irrevocable resolution, representing the
combined will of the steadfast lovers of the Cause of God in that
land, to carry out, in its entirety, during the few remaining months,
a Plan on which so much that is vital to its worldwide interests
depends! The American believers, the stouthearted supporters of the
Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, have already given too many evidences of
their preponderating influence in the direction of its affairs to
allow the slightest disappointment to mar the radiance of their past
achievements. Their will to succeed must eventually triumph.</p>

The handling of this delicate and vital problem regarding
non-participation by Bahá’ís of East and West in political
affairs calls for the utmost circumspection, tact, patience and
vigilance on the part of those whose function and privilege is to
guard, promote and administer the activities of a worldwide
ever-advancing Cause. The misgivings and apprehensions of individual
Bahá’ís should be allayed and eventually completely dispelled.
Any misconception of the sane and genuine patriotism that animates
every Bahá’í heart, if it ever obscures or perplexes the minds of
responsible government officials, should be instantly and
courageously dissipated. Any deliberate misrepresentation, by the
enemies of the Cause of God, of the aims, the tenets and methods of
the administrators of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh should be
vigorously faced and its fallacy pitilessly exposed. The Cause, to
which we belong, stands on the threshold of an era of unprecedented
expansion. Its problems are many, divers and challenging. Our methods
and ways of approach must likewise be characterized by unusual
sagacity, consummate skill and wisdom. He will surely never fail us
in meeting the needs of a critical hour.</p>

behalf of the assembly have just reached me. Concerning the removal
of believers I feel that such a vitally important matter should be
given the most serious consideration and preferably be referred to
the National Assembly for further consideration and final decision.
We should be slow to accept and reluctant to remove. I fully approve
and wholeheartedly and unreservedly uphold the principle to which you
refer that personalities should not be made centers around which the
community may revolve, but that they should be subordinated under all
conditions and however great their merits to the properly constituted
Assemblies. You and your co-workers can never overestimate or
overemphasize this cardinal principle of Bahá’í Administration.</p>

I feel I must reaffirm the vital importance and necessity of the
right of voting—a sacred responsibility of which no adult
recognized believer should be deprived, unless he is associated with
a community that has not as yet been in a position to establish a
Local Assembly. This distinguishing right which the believer
possesses, however, does not carry with it nor does it imply an
obligation to cast his vote, if he feels that the circumstances under
which he lives do not justify or allow him to exercise that right
intelligently and with understanding. This is a matter which should
be left to the individual to decide for himself according to his own
conscience and discretion. Praying for your success in the
maintenance and application of this principle.</p>

The separation that has set in between the institutions of the Bahá’í
Faith and the Islamic ecclesiastical organizations that oppose it—a
movement that has originated in Egypt and is now spreading steadily
throughout the Middle East, and will in time communicate its
influence to the West—imposes upon every loyal upholder of the
Cause the obligation of refraining from any word or action that might
prejudice the position which our enemies have, in recent years and of
their own accord, proclaimed and established.<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
This historic development, the beginnings of which could neither be
recognized nor even anticipated in the years immediately preceding
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing, may be said to have signalized the
Formative Period of our Faith and to have paved the way for the
consolidation of its Administrative Order. As this movement gains
momentum, as it receives added impetus from the attitude and future
action of the civil authorities in Persia, it will inevitably
manifest its repercussions in the West and will rouse the leaders of
the Church and finally the civil authorities to challenge the claims
and eventually to recognize the independent status of the Religion of
Bahá’u’lláh. Nothing whatever in the mean time should be said
or done by any one of us, whether in the political field or in our
relations with ecclesiastical organizations, that would tend to
confuse the issues with which our struggling Cause will sooner or
later be confronted. We should accept no position, should avoid any
affiliations or commitments that could in any way harm our future
position or provide our potential enemies with weapons with which
they can resist the complete emancipation of our Cause or retard its
ultimate recognition and victory. Though our Cause unreservedly
recognizes the Divine origin of all the religions that preceded it
and upholds the spiritual truths which lie at their very core and are
common to them all, its institutions, whether administrative,
religious or humanitarian, must, if their distinctive character is to
be maintained and recognized, be increasingly divorced from the
outworn creeds, the meaningless ceremonials and man-made institutions
with which these religions are at present identified. Our adversaries
in the East have initiated the struggle. Our future opponents in the
West will, in their turn, arise and carry it a stage further. Ours is
the duty, in anticipation of this inevitable contest, to uphold
unequivocally and with undivided loyalty the integrity of our Faith
and demonstrate the distinguishing features of its divinely appointed
institutions.</p>

As the activities of the American Bahá’í community expand, and
its worldwide prestige correspondingly increases, the institution of
the national Fund, the bedrock on which all other institutions must
necessarily rest and be established, acquires added importance, and
should be increasingly supported by the entire body of the believers,
both in their individual capacities, and through their collective
efforts, whether organized as groups or as Local Assemblies. The
supply of funds, in support of the national Treasury, constitutes, at
the present time, the lifeblood of these nascent institutions which
you are laboring to erect. Its importance cannot surely be
overestimated. Untold blessings shall no doubt crown every effort
directed to that end. I am eagerly and prayerfully awaiting the news
of an unprecedented expansion in so vital an organ of the
Administrative Order of our Faith.</p>

This new stage in the gradual unfoldment of the Formative Period of
our Faith into which we have just entered—the phase of concentrated
teaching activity—synchronizes with a period of deepening gloom, of
universal impotence, of ever-increasing destitution and widespread
disillusionment in the fortunes of a declining age. This is truly
providential and its significance and the opportunities it offers us
should be fully apprehended and utilized. Now that the administrative
Organs of a firmly established Faith are vigorously and harmoniously
functioning, and now that the Symbol<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
of its invincible might is lending unprecedented impetus to its
spread, an effort unexampled in its scope and sustained vitality is
urgently required so that the moving spirit of its Founder may
permeate and transform the lives of the countless multitudes that
hunger for its teachings. That the beloved friends in America, who
have carried triumphantly the banner of His Cause through the initial
stages of its development, will in a still greater measure prove
themselves capable of meeting the challenge of the present hour I for
one can never doubt. Of the evidences of their inexhaustible vitality
I am sufficiently and continually conscious. My fervent plea will
not, I feel certain, remain unanswered. For them I shall continue to
pray from all my heart.</p>

I fervently hope and pray that the year into which we have just
entered may be signalized by fresh conquests and unprecedented
triumphs in the teaching field within the United States and beyond
its confines. A systematic, carefully conceived, and well-established
plan should be devised, vigorously pursued and continuously extended.
Initiated by the national representatives of the American believers,
the vanguard and standard-bearers of the valiant army of Bahá’u’lláh,
this plan should receive the wholehearted, the sustained and
ever-increasing support, both moral and financial, of the entire body
of His followers in that continent. Its supreme immediate objective
should be the permanent establishment of at least one center in every
state of the American Republic and in every Republic of the American
continent not yet enlisted under the banner of His Faith. Its
ramifications should gradually be extended to the European continent,
and its scope should be made to include those countries, such as the
Baltic states, Poland, Greece, Spain and Portugal, where no avowed
believer has established any definite residence. The field is
immense, the task gigantic, the privilege immeasurably precious. Time
is short, and the obligation sacred, paramount and urgent. The
American community must muster all its force, concentrate its
resources, summon to its aid all the faith, the determination and
energies of which it is capable, and set out single-minded and
undaunted, to attain still greater heights in its mighty exertions
for the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>

initiated to promote the teaching work within, and beyond the
confines of, the American continent. The American believers, if they
wish to carry out, in the spirit and the letter, the parting wishes
of their beloved Master, must intensify their teaching work a
thousandfold and extend its ramifications beyond the confines of
their native land and as far as the most distant outposts of their
far-flung Faith. The Tablets of the Divine Plan invest your Assembly
with unique and grave responsibilities, and confer upon it privileges
which your sister Assemblies might well envy and admire. The present
opportunity is unutterably precious. It may not recur again.

I cannot allow this communication to be sent without adding a few
words in person and stressing afresh the significance of the
undertaking in which the entire Bahá’í community has embarked.
The promulgation of the Divine Plan, unveiled by our departed Master
in the darkest days of one of the severest ordeals which humanity has
ever experienced,<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> is
the Key which Providence has placed in the hands of the American
believers whereby to unlock the doors leading them to fulfill their
unimaginably glorious Destiny. As the proclamation of the Message
reverberates throughout the land, as its resistless march gathers
momentum, as the field of its operation widens and the numbers of its
upholders and champions multiply, its potentialities will
correspondingly unfold, exerting a most beneficent influence, not
only on every community throughout the Bahá’í world, but on the
immediate fortunes of a travailing society. The repercussions of this
campaign are already apparent in Europe, India, Egypt, Iraq and even
among the sorely tried communities in Persia and Russia. The Faith of
God is gaining in stature, effectiveness and power. Not until,
however, the great enterprise which you are now conducting runs its
full course and attains its final objective, at its appointed time,
can its world-encompassing benefits be fully apprehended or revealed.
The perseverance of the American believers will, no doubt, ensure the
ultimate realization of these benefits. Praying with undiminished
fervor for you all.</p>

receipt of your communications, all of which testify most strikingly

uninterrupted prosecution of this holy enterprise and its extension

no doubt attract unimaginable blessings and must entail far-reaching
consequences. In the course of this year, when the American believers
are commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
visit to America, a mighty impetus should be lent to this campaign
which you have so splendidly initiated. A complete rededication to
its ideals, its purposes and requirements, on the part of all
individuals and Assemblies, can alone befit such a nationwide
celebration. I pray that you may all fulfill your high destiny.</p>

The responsibilities which, under your direction and in response to
my plea, the American community is now assuming, over and above the
task they have already undertaken in connection with the Divine Plan,
proclaim in unmistakable terms their unswerving determination to
prove themselves worthy of the sublimity of their mission, and of
their privileged position among their sister communities in both the
East and the West. The twofold task they have arisen to perform will,
if carried out in time, release the potentialities with which the
community of the Greatest Name has been so generously and
mysteriously endowed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
To carry out in its entirety and to its final consummation this dual
enterprise would shed on the closing years of this first century of
the Bahá’í Era a luster no less brilliant than the immortal deeds
which have signalized its birth in the Heroic Age of our Faith. To
the American believers, the spiritual descendants of the heroes of
God’s Cause, I again address my plea, to arise as one soul and to
prosecute, with unrelaxing resolve, the high mission with which their
immediate destinies are inextricably interwoven. The call has gone
forth, the path is clear, the goal manifest and within their reach.
Though their responsibilities be pressing and heavy and the obstacles
formidable and manifold, yet the spirit of our invincible Faith will
enable them to conquer if they arise unitedly and determinedly and
persevere till the very end.</p>

To this letter, dealing chiefly with the day-to-day administration of
your Assembly’s activities, I wish to add a few observations
connected with the wider and more challenging issues with which the
American believers as a body are now being confronted. As I lift up
my gaze beyond the strain and stresses which a struggling Faith must
necessarily experience, and view the wider scene which the
indomitable will of the American Bahá’í community is steadily
unfolding, I cannot but marvel at the range which the driving force
of their ceaseless labors has acquired and the heights which the
sublimity of their faith has attained. The outposts of a Faith,
already persecuted in both Europe and Asia, are in the American
continent steadily advancing, the visible symbols of its undoubted
sovereignty are receiving fresh luster every day and its manifold
institutions are driving their roots deeper and deeper into its soil.
Blest and honored as none among its sister communities has been in
recent years, preserved through the inscrutable dispensations of
Divine Providence for a destiny which no mind can as yet imagine,
such a community cannot for a moment afford to be content with or
rest on the laurels it has so deservedly won. It must go on,
continually go on, exploring fresh fields, scaling nobler heights,
laying firmer foundations, shedding added splendor and achieving
further renown in the service and for the glory of the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh. The Seven Year Plan,<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
which it has sponsored and with which its destiny is so closely
interwoven, must at all costs be prosecuted with increasing force and
added consecration. All should arise and participate. Upon the
measure of such a participation will no doubt depend the welfare and
progress of those distant communities which are now battling for
their emancipation. To such a priceless privilege the inheritors of
the shining grace of Bahá’u’lláh cannot surely be indifferent.
The American believers must gird up the loins of endeavor and step
into the arena of service with such heroism as shall astound the
entire Bahá’í world. Let them be assured that my prayers will
continue to be offered on their behalf.</p>

The Seven Year Plan, with which the immediate fortunes of the
American Bahá’í community are so closely interwoven, demands, at
this critical stage in its development, serious and prayerful
consideration of certain vital requirements, without which such a
stupendous task can never be brought to a successful completion. The
evolution of the Plan imposes a threefold obligation, which all
individual believers, all Local Assemblies, as well as the National
Assembly itself, must respectively recognize and conscientiously
fulfill. Each and every believer, undaunted by the uncertainties, the
perils and the financial stringency afflicting the nation, must arise
and ensure, to the full measure of his or her capacity, that
continuous and abundant flow of funds into the national Treasury, on
which the successful prosecution of the Plan must chiefly depend.
Upon the Local Assemblies, whose special function and high privilege
is to facilitate the admission of new believers into the community,
and thereby stimulate the infusion of fresh blood into its organic
institutions, a duty no less binding in character devolves. To them I
wish particularly to appeal, at this present hour, when the call of
God is being raised throughout the length and breadth of both
continents in the New World, to desist from insisting too rigidly on
the minor observances and beliefs, which might prove a
stumbling-block in the way of any sincere applicant, whose eager
desire is to enlist under the banner of Bahá’u’lláh. While
conscientiously adhering to the fundamental qualifications already
laid down, the members of each and every Assembly should endeavor, by
their patience, their love, their tact and wisdom, to nurse,
subsequent to his admission, the newcomer into Bahá’í maturity,
and win him over gradually to the unreserved acceptance of whatever
has been ordained in the teachings. As to the National Assembly,
whose inescapable responsibility is to guard the integrity,
coordinate the activities, and stimulate the life, of the entire
community, its chief concern, at the present moment, should be to
anxiously deliberate on how best to enable both individual believers
and Local Assemblies to fulfill their respective tasks. Through their
repeated appeals, through their readiness to dispel all
misunderstandings and remove all obstacles, through the example of
their lives, their unrelaxing vigilance, their high sense of justice,
their humility, consecration and courage, they must demonstrate to
those whom they represent their capacity to play their part in the
progress of the Plan in which they, no less than the rest of the
community, are involved. May the all-conquering Spirit of Bahá’u’lláh
be so infused into each component part of this harmoniously
functioning System as to enable it to contribute its proper share to
the consummation of the Plan.</p>

A year has almost elapsed since the Seven Year Plan has been launched
with characteristic vigor and noble enthusiasm by the American Bahá’í
community. For no less than six consecutive years this twofold and
stupendous enterprise, which has been set in operation, must, if the
American believers are to prove themselves worthy of their high
calling, be wisely conducted, continually reinforced and
energetically prosecuted to its very end. Severe and unprecedented as
may be the internal tests and ordeals which the members of this
community may yet experience, however tragic and momentous the
external happenings which might well disrupt the fabric of the
society in which they live, they must not, throughout these six
remaining years, allow themselves to be deflected from the course
they are now steadily pursuing. Nay rather, as the impelling forces
which have set in motion this mighty undertaking acquire added
momentum and its potentialities are more fully manifested, they who
are responsible for its success must as time goes on evince a more
burning enthusiasm, demonstrate a higher sense of solidarity, reveal
greater depths of consecration to their task, and display a more
unyielding determination to achieve its purpose. Then and only then
will the pleas, the hopes and the wishes of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
eternally enshrined in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, be worthily
acknowledged and fulfilled. “<i>Let your exertions henceforth
increase a thousandfold</i>” is the earnest appeal voiced by Him in
those Tablets. “<i>Summon the people,</i>” He exhorts them, “<i>in
these countries, capitals, islands, assemblies and churches to enter
the Abhá Kingdom. The scope of your exertions must needs be
extended. The wider its range, the more striking will be the evidence
of divine assistance.</i>” “<i>The moment,</i>” He solemnly
affirms, “<i>this divine Message is carried forward by the American
believers from the shores of America and is propagated through the
continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of Australasia … this
community will find itself securely established upon the throne of an
everlasting dominion.… Then will the whole earth resound with the
praises of its majesty and greatness.</i>” The Seven Year Plan, to
which every American believer is fully and irrevocably pledged,
during the closing years of the First century of the Bahá’í Era,
is in itself but an initial stage in the unfoldment of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
vision of America’s spiritual destiny—a destiny which only those
who will have successfully accomplished this preliminary task can
enable the rising generations who will labor after them to fulfill in
the course of the succeeding century.</p>

I wish to reaffirm in person my sense of joy and gratitude, as
expressed in my last cable to your Assembly, at the new spirit of
alertness and determination which you have so clearly demonstrated
while yet on the threshold of your year of stewardship in the service
of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. I am filled with fresh hopes, and
yearn to witness, ere the present year draws to a close, not only the
fulfillment of an unexampled record of service but the revelation of
such depths of consecration as will astonish, nay thrill, both the
members of your own community and the rest of the Bahá’í world.
Pregnant indeed are the years looming ahead of us all. The twin
processes of internal disintegration and external chaos are being
accelerated every day and are inexorably moving towards a climax. The
rumblings that must precede the eruption of those forces that must
cause “the limbs of humanity to quake” can already be heard. “The
time of the end,” “the latter years,” as foretold in the
Scriptures, are at long last upon us. The Pen of Bahá’u’lláh,
the voice of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, have time and again, insistently and
in terms unmistakable, warned an unheeding humanity of impending
disaster. The Community of the Most Great Name, the leaven that must
leaven the lump, the chosen remnant that must survive the rolling up
of the old, discredited, tottering Order and assist in the unfoldment
of a new one in its stead, is standing ready, alert, clear-visioned,
and resolute. The American believers, standard-bearers of this
worldwide community and torchbearers of an as yet unborn
civilization, have girt up their loins, unfurled their banners and
stepped into the arena of service. Their Plan has been formulated.
Their forces are mobilized. They are steadfastly marching towards
their goal. They cannot afford either to turn back or hesitate. The
hosts of the Abhá Kingdom are rushing forth, as promised, to direct
their steps and reinforce their power. Through their initial
victories they have provided the impulse that must now surge and,
with relentless force, sweep over their sister-communities and
eventually overpower the entire human race. The generality of
mankind, blind and enslaved, is wholly unaware of the healing power
with which this community has been endowed, nor can it as yet suspect
the role which this same community is destined to play in its
redemption. Fierce and manifold will be the assaults with which
governments, races, classes and religions, jealous of its rising
prestige and fearful of its consolidating strength, will seek to
silence its voice and sap its foundations. Unmoved by the relative
obscurity that surrounds it at the present time, and undaunted by the
forces that will be arrayed against it in the future, this community,
I cannot but feel confident, will, no matter how afflictive the
agonies of a travailing age, pursue its destiny, undeflected in its
course, undimmed in its serenity, unyielding in its resolve, unshaken
in its convictions.</p>

I feel truly exhilarated as I witness the ever-recurrent
manifestations of unbroken solidarity and unquenchable enthusiasm
that distinguish every stage in the progressive development of the
nationwide enterprise which is being so unflinchingly pursued by the
whole American Bahá’í community. The marked deterioration in
world affairs, the steadily deepening gloom that envelops the
storm-tossed peoples and nations of the Old World, invest the Seven
Year Plan, now operating in both the North and South American
continents, with a significance and urgency that cannot be
overestimated. Conceived as the supreme agency for the establishment,
in the opening century of the Bahá’í Era, of what is but the
initial stage in the progressive realization of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Plan for the American believers, this enterprise, as it extends its
ramifications throughout the entire New World, is demonstrating its
power to command all the resources and utilize all the facilities
which the machinery of a laboriously evolved Administrative Order can
place at its disposal. However we view its aspects, it offers in its
functioning a sharp contrast to the workings of the moribund and
obsolescent institutions to which a perverse generation is
desperately clinging. Tempestuous are the winds that buffet and will,
as the days go by, fiercely assail the very structure of the Order
through the agency of which this twofold task is being performed. The
potentialities with which an almighty Providence has endowed it will
no doubt enable its promoters to achieve their purpose. Much,
however, will depend upon the spirit and manner in which that task
will be conducted. Through the clearness and steadiness of their
vision, through the unvitiated vitality of their belief, through the
incorruptibility of their character, through the adamantine force of
their resolve, the matchless superiority of their aims and purpose,
and the unsurpassed range of their accomplishments, they who labor
for the glory of the Most Great Name throughout both Americas can
best demonstrate to the visionless, faithless, and restless society
to which they belong their power to proffer a haven of refuge to its
members in the hour of their realized doom. Then and only then will
this tender sapling, embedded in the fertile soil of a Divinely
appointed Administrative Order, and energized by the dynamic
processes of its institutions, yield its richest and destined fruit.
That the community of the American believers, to whose keeping so
vast, so delicate and precious a trust has been committed, will,
severally and collectively, prove themselves worthy of their high
calling, I for one, who in my association with them have been
privileged to observe more closely than perhaps anyone else the
nature of their reactions to the momentous issues that have
confronted them in the past, will refuse to doubt.</p>

I have, in a recent cable addressed to your Assembly, felt it
necessary to stress the paramount need of maintaining the proper
balance between the Temple construction work and the teaching
activities which have been initiated and are being so energetically
conducted under your direction in accordance with the Seven Year
Plan. The twofold aim you are now pursuing should at no time become
obscured, nor should either one of the dual responsibilities you have
assumed be allowed to preponderate over the other. The urgency of the
task connected with the ornamentation of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár
has been rightly recognized, and its immediate needs have been
generously and promptly met. A similar, nay a mightier, effort should
now be deliberately and persistently exerted in the field of pioneer
teaching, in both the United States and Canada. Every facility and
encouragement, moral and material, should be extended to the National
Teaching Committee and its auxiliary agencies to ensure the speedy
termination of the first stage in the teaching campaign to which
every American believer is now pledged.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-46-p2"></a>
Very soon we shall be entering the second half of the last decade of
this, the first century of the Bahá’í Era. The five remaining
years should essentially be consecrated to the imperative, the
spiritual needs of the remaining republics of both Central and South
America, for whose entry into the fellowship of Bahá’u’lláh the
Plan was primarily formulated. The prime requisite for the definite
opening of what may come to be regarded as one of the most brilliant
chapters in American Bahá’í history is the completion of the
initial task which American Bahá’í pioneers must perform in the
nine remaining states and provinces as yet unassociated with the
organic structure of the Faith.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-46-p3"></a>
The period ahead is short, strenuous, fraught with mortal perils for
human society, yet pregnant with possibilities of unsurpassed
triumphs for the power of Bahá’u’lláh’s redemptive Cause. The
occasion is propitious for a display, by the American Bahá’í
Community, in its corporate capacity, of an effort which in its
magnitude, character, and purpose must outshine its past endeavors.
Failure to exploit these present, these golden opportunities would
blast the hopes which the prosecution of the Plan has thus far
aroused, and would signify the loss of the rarest privilege ever
conferred by Providence upon the American Bahá’í Community. It is
in view of the criticalness of the situation that I was led to place
at the disposal of any pioneer willing to dedicate himself to the
task of the present hour such modest resources as would facilitate
the discharge of so enviable a duty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-46-p4"></a>
The Bahá’í world, increasingly subjected to the rigors of
repression, in both the East and the West, watches with unconcealed
astonishment, and derives hope and comfort from, the rapid unfoldment
of the successive stages of God’s Plan for so blest a community.
Its eyes are fixed upon this community, eager to behold the manner in
which its gallant members will break down, one after another, the
barriers that obstruct their progress towards a divinely appointed
goal. On every daring adventurer in the service of the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh the Concourse on high shall descend, “<i>each
bearing aloft a chalice of pure light.</i>” Every one of these
adventurers God Himself will sustain and inspire, and will “<i>cause
the pure waters of wisdom and utterance to gush out and flow
copiously from his heart.</i>” “<i>The Kingdom of God,</i>”
writes ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “<i>is possessed of limitless potency.
Audacious must be the army of life if the confirming aid of that
Kingdom is to be repeatedly vouchsafed unto it … Vast is the arena,
and the time ripe to spur on the charger within it. Now is the time
to reveal the force of one’s strength, the stoutness of one’s
heart and the might of one’s soul.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-46-p5"></a>
Dearly beloved friends! What better field than the vast virgin
territories, so near at hand, and waiting to receive, at this very
hour, their full share of the onrushing tide of Bahá’u’lláh’s
redeeming grace? What theater more befitting than these
long-neglected nine remaining states and provinces in which the true
heroism of the intrepid pioneers of His World Order can be displayed?
There is no time to lose. There is no room left for vacillation.
Multitudes hunger for the Bread of Life. The stage is set. The firm
and irrevocable Promise is given. God’s own Plan has been set in
motion. It is gathering momentum with every passing day. The powers
of heaven and earth mysteriously assist in its execution. Such an
opportunity is irreplaceable. Let the doubter arise, and himself
verify the truth of such assertions. To try, to persevere, is to
ensure ultimate and complete victory.</p>

I was deeply stirred by the news conveyed in your recent cable. The
abiding assurance I derived from its contents eases the burden of my
cares and fortifies me in my tasks. The illustrious community of the
American believers, contemptuous of risk or peril, is driving ahead,
relentlessly and with its whole vigor, towards the dual goal which
the Seven Year Plan has set before it. The virtual completion of the
contract for the gallery section of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár,
the inauguration of the First Story Construction Fund, the signature
of the contract for the models of the Main Story, the prompt response
to the Fund newly associated with the memory of the Greatest Holy
Leaf, the consequent placing of a further contract for the
construction of the molds, the acceleration of pioneer teaching
activity and the resultant penetration of the Faith into practically
every state and province in the United States and Canada—all these
have, in the course of the second year of the Seven Year Plan,
followed in amazingly swift succession. With dramatic swiftness, with
unyielding resolve, with uncompromising fidelity and superb courage,
the community responsible for such a unique demonstration of Bahá’í
initiative and enterprise is overcoming the barriers, whether
material or moral, that threaten to interfere with the execution of
its declared purpose.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-47-p2"></a>
The task regarded as an essential preliminary to the crusade destined
to embrace the whole of Latin America is now in full swing and is
being rapidly carried out. A further step, designed to hasten the
conclusion of the final phase of the ornamentation of the Temple, has
also been taken. As the days roll by, as the perturbations of an
imperiled civilization are more alarmingly manifested, the
potentialities of God’s creative Plan correspondingly unfold, and
the valor and heroism of its intrepid supporters are more widely and
convincingly demonstrated. With every successful effort to muster its
young and scattered forces, to perfect its methods, to extend the
range of its operations, to deepen its spiritual life and to scale
loftier heights of individual heroism, there will, I cannot but feel
confident, be granted to this community a greater opportunity to
prove its worth, and a fuller measure of celestial strength to enable
it to re-enact, on the soil of the United States and Canada and
throughout the entire Western Hemisphere, those stirring exploits
that have shed such luster on the Apostolic Age of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh. Though much has thus far been achieved, yet the
processes now set in motion through the evolution of the Plan are
still far too rudimentary to permit even a faint glimpse of the
brilliancy of the epoch in which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own Plan must
come to fruition. Not ours to attempt, at the present moment, a
survey of the distant scene, or to seek to visualize its glories, or
to dwell on the consequences of the eventual attainment of an as yet
far-off goal. Ours is the solemn, the inescapable duty to labor
faithfully and unremittingly to ensure that no opportunity is being
missed, that no avenues are left unexplored, that might, however
indirectly, contribute to the furtherance of those tasks that claim
so insistently our immediate attention. That those into whose hands
this dynamic Plan has been entrusted are aware of the essential
character of their obligations and will discharge worthily their
duties no one, viewing the range and quality of their achievements,
can entertain the slightest doubt.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-50-p1"></a>
I have in two recent successive messages, cabled to your Assembly,
given expression, as far as it lay in my power, to the feelings of
overflowing gratitude which the response of so many pioneers to the
call of teaching has evoked in my heart. I have moreover felt
impelled to convey my congratulations to the members of your
Assembly, who, through their resource, unity and single-mindedness,
have lent so needed and timely an impetus to the mighty work
associated with the second year of the Seven Year Plan. There can be
no doubt whatever that what the American believers, no less than
their elected national representatives, have accomplished, the long
and assiduous care of the former and the potent methods employed by
the latter have witnessed to the uprising of a new spirit on which
the defamers of the Cause may well pause to reflect, and from which
its lovers cannot but derive deep joy and solace. I again wish to
thank with all my soul those whose acts have stirred the imagination
of friend and foe alike.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-50-p2"></a>
In my desire not to omit anything that might help to spur on or
reinforce the community of the American believers as they move on to
their destiny, I feel it necessary to add a word of warning in
connection with the work that has been so splendidly begun lest it
should be jeopardized or frustrated. The initial phase of the
teaching work operating under the Seven Year Plan has at long last
been concluded. They who have pushed it forward have withstood the
test gloriously. By their acts, whether as teachers or
administrators, they have written a glorious page in the struggle for
the laying of a continent-wide foundation for the Administrative
Order of their Faith. At this advanced stage in the fulfillment of
the purpose to which they have set their hand, there can be no
turning back, no halting, no respite. To launch the bark of the
Faith, to implant its banner, is not enough. Support, ample,
organized and unremitting, should be lent, designed to direct the
course of that bark and to lay an unassailable foundation for the
fort destined to stand guard over that banner.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-50-p3"></a>
The National Spiritual Assembly, the National Teaching Committee, the
Regional and Local Teaching Committees, no less than the itinerant
teachers, should utilize every possible means calculated to fan the
zeal, enrich the resources, and ensure the solidity and permanency of
the work, of those who, actuated by so laudable and shining a spirit
of self-sacrifice, have arisen to face the hazards and perils of so
holy and historic an adventure. Indeed every believer, however humble
and inexperienced, should sense the obligation to play his or her
part in a mission that involves so very deeply the destinies not only
of the American Bahá’í community but of the nation itself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-50-p4"></a>
Whether through the frequency of their visits, the warmth of their
correspondence, the liberality of their support, the wisdom of their
counsels, the choice of the literature placed at the disposal of the
pioneers, the members of the community should, at this hour when the
sands of a moribund civilization are inexorably running out, and at a
time when they are preparing themselves to launch yet another stage
in their teaching activities, ensure the security, and provide for
the steady expansion, of the work initiated in those territories so
recently set alight from the torch of an inextinguishable Faith.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-50-p5"></a>

The concerted activities of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in the
North American continent assume, as they multiply and develop, a dual
aspect, and may be said to fall into two distinct categories, both
equally vital and complementary to each other. The one aims at the
safeguarding and consolidation of the work already achieved; the
other is designed to enlarge the range of its operation. The former
depends chiefly for its success upon the capacity, the experience,
and the loyalty of wise, resourceful, and judicious administrators
who, impelled by the very nature of their task, will be increasingly
called upon to exercise the utmost care and vigilance in protecting
the interests of the Faith, in resolving its problems, in regulating
its life, in enriching its resources, and in preserving the pristine
purity of its precepts. The latter is essentially pioneer in nature,
demanding first and foremost those qualities of renunciation,
tenacity, dauntlessness and passionate fervor that can alone brave
the dangers and sweep away the obstacles with which an infant Faith,
struggling against vested interests and face to face with the
entrenched forces of prejudice, of ignorance and fanaticism, must
needs contend. In both of these spheres of Bahá’í activity the
community of the American believers, it is becoming increasingly
evident, is evincing those characteristics which must be regarded as
the essential foundation for the success of their dual task.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-55-p2"></a>
As to those whose function is essentially of an administrative
character it can hardly be doubted that they are, steadily and
indefatigably, perfecting the structural machinery of their Faith,
are multiplying its administrative agencies and are legalizing the
status of its newly established institutions. Slowly and patiently
they are canalizing the spirit that at once directs, energizes and
safeguards its operation. They are exploiting its potentialities,
broadcasting its message, publicizing its literature, fostering the
aspirations of its youth, devising ways and means for the training of
its children, guarding the integrity of its teachings, and paving the
way for the ultimate codification of its laws. Through all the
resources at their disposal they are promoting the growth and
consolidation of that pioneer movement for which the entire machinery
of their Administrative Order has been primarily designed and
erected. They are visibly and progressively contributing to the
enrichment of their unique community life, and are ensuring, with
magnificent courage and characteristic promptitude, the completion of
their consecrated Edifice—the embodiment of their hopes and the
supreme symbol of their ideals.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-55-p3"></a>
As to those into whose valiant and trusted hands—and no believer,
however humble, is to think himself debarred from joining their
ranks—the standards of a forward-marching Faith have been
entrusted, they too with no less zest and thoroughness are pushing
farther and farther its frontiers, breaking new soil, establishing
fresh outposts, winning more recruits, and contributing to the
greater diversification and more harmonious blending of the elements
comprised in the worldwide society of its followers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-55-p4"></a>
The Edifice of this new World Order, which the Báb has heralded,
which the mind of Bahá’u’lláh has envisioned, and whose
features ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, its Architect, has delineated, we,
whatever our capacities, opportunities or position, are now, at so
precarious a period in the world’s history, summoned to found and
erect. The community of the Most Great Name in the Western Hemisphere
is, through the nature of its corporate life and the scope of its
exertions, assuming, beyond the shadow of a doubt, a preponderating
share in the laying of such a foundation and the erection of such a
structure. The eyes of its sister communities are fixed upon it.
Their prayers ascend on its behalf. Their hands are outstretched to
lend whatever aid lies within their power. I, for my part, am
determined to reinforce the impulse that impels its members forward
to meet their destiny. The Founders of their Faith survey from the
Kingdom on high the range of their achievements, acclaim their
progress, and are ever ready to speed their eventual triumph.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-55-p5"></a>
Far be it from me to underrate the gigantic proportions of their
task, nor do I for one moment overlook the urgency and gravity of the
times in which they are laboring. Nor do I wish to minimize the
hazards and trials that surround or lie ahead of them. The grandeur
of their task is indeed commensurate with the mortal perils by which
their generation is hemmed in. As the dusk creeps over a steadily
sinking society the radiant outlines of their redemptive mission
become sharper every day. The present world unrest, symptom of a
worldwide malady, their world religion has already affirmed, must
needs culminate in that world catastrophe out of which the
consciousness of world citizenship will be born, a consciousness that
can alone provide an adequate basis for the organization of world
unity, on which a lasting world peace must necessarily depend, the
peace itself inaugurating in turn that world civilization which will
mark the coming of age of the entire human race.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-55-p6"></a>
Fortified by such reflections, the American believers, in whichever
section of the Western Hemisphere they find themselves laboring,
whether at home or abroad, and however dire and distressing the
processes involved in the disintegration of the structure of
present-day civilization, will, I feel convinced, prove themselves,
through their lives and deeds, worthy of that priceless heritage
which it is their undoubted privilege to proclaim, preserve and
perpetuate.</p>

The readiness of your Assembly, as expressed in your recently cabled
message, to transfer the National Bahá’í Secretariat to the
vicinity of the Temple in Wilmette has evoked within me the deepest
feelings of thankfulness and joy.<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
Your historic decision, so wise and timely, so surprising in its
suddenness, so far-reaching in its consequences, is one that I cannot
but heartily and unreservedly applaud. To each one of your brethren
in the Faith throughout the United States and Canada, who are
witnessing, from day to day and at an ever-hastening speed, the
approaching completion of their national House of Worship, the great
Mother Temple of the West, your resolution to establish within its
hallowed precincts and in the heart of the North American continent
the Administrative Seat of their beloved Faith cannot but denote
henceforward a closer association, a more constant communion, and a
higher degree of coordination between the two primary agencies
providentially ordained for the enrichment of their spiritual life
and for the conduct and regulation of their administrative affairs.
To the far-flung Bahá’í communities of East and West, most of
which are being increasingly proscribed and ill treated, and none of
which can claim to have had a share of the dual blessings which a
specially designed and constructed House of Worship and a fully and
efficiently functioning Administrative Order invariably confer, the
concentration in a single locality of what will come to be regarded
as the fountainhead of the community’s spiritual life and what is
already recognized as the mainspring of its administrative activities
signalizes the launching of yet another phase in the slow and
imperceptible emergence, in these declining times, of the model
Bahá’í community—a community divinely ordained, organically
united, clear-visioned, vibrant with life, and whose very purpose is
regulated by the twin directing principles of the worship of God and
of service to one’s fellowmen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-57-p2"></a>
The decision you have arrived at is an act that befittingly marks the
commencement of your allotted term of stewardship in service to the
Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. Moreover, it significantly coincides with
the inauguration of that world Mission of which the settlement of
Bahá’í pioneers in the virgin territories of the North American
continent has been but a prelude. That such a decision may speedily
and without the slightest hitch be carried into effect is the deepest
longing of my heart. That those who have boldly carried so weighty a
resolution may without pause or respite continue to labor and build
up, as circumstances permit, around this administrative nucleus such
accessories as the machinery of a fast-evolving Administrative Order,
functioning under the shadow of, and in such close proximity to, the
Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, must demand is the object of my
incessant and fervent prayer. That such a step, momentous as it is,
may prove the starting-point for acts of still greater renown and of
richer possibilities that will leave their distinct mark on the third
year of the Seven Year Plan is a hope which I, together with all
those who are eagerly following its progress, fondly and confidently
cherish.</p>

The American believers, while straining to accomplish befittingly
this particular task, must simultaneously brace themselves for
another sublime effort to discharge, ere the present year draws to a
close, their manifold responsibilities allotted to them under the
Seven Year Plan. The placing of yet another contract for the casting
of the ornamentation of the first story of the Temple, the permanent
settlement of the six remaining Republics of Central America, and the
extension of continual support, both material and moral, to those
weaker states, provinces, and Republics that have been recently
incorporated in the body of the Faith, combine to offer, at this hour
when the fate of civilization trembles in the balance, the boldest
and gravest challenge that has ever faced the community of the
American believers both in the propagative and administrative spheres
of Bahá’í activity. In the field of pioneer teaching, and
particularly in connection with the opening of the Republics of
Haiti, Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Dominica and Guatemala, the
utmost encouragement should at all times be vouchsafed by the elected
representatives of the community to those who, out of the abundance
of their hearts, and in direct response to the call of their Faith
and the dictates of their conscience, have renounced their comforts,
fled their homes, and hazarded their fortunes, for the sake of
bringing into operation the majestic Plan of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, while
special support should be extended to those who appear to be best
qualified for the strenuous labors which pioneering under such
exacting circumstances demands. Care should be exercised lest any
hindrance should for any reason be placed in the way of those who
have, whether young or old, rich or poor, so spontaneously dedicated
themselves to so urgent and holy a mission.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-57-p4"></a>
Towards this newly appointed enterprise a more definite reorientation
is needed. To its purposes a more complete dedication is demanded. In
its fortunes a more widespread concern is required. For its further
consolidation and speedy fulfillment a larger number and a greater
variety of participants are indispensable. For its success a more
abundant flow of material resources should be assured.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-57-p5"></a>
Let the privileged few, the ambassadors of the Message of
Bahá’u’lláh, bear in mind His words as they go forth on their
errands of service to His Cause. “<i>It behooveth whosoever willeth
to journey for the sake of God, and whose intention is to proclaim
His Word and quicken the dead, to bathe himself with the waters of
detachment, and to adorn his temple with the ornaments of resignation
and submission. Let trust in God be his shield, and reliance on God
his provision, and the fear of God his raiment. Let patience be his
helper, and praiseworthy conduct his succorer, and goodly deeds his
army. Then will the concourse on high sustain him. Then will the
denizens of the Kingdom of Names march forth with him, and the
banners of Divine guidance and inspiration be unfurled on his right
hand and before him.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-57-p6"></a>
Faced with such a challenge, a community that has scaled thus far
such peaks of enduring achievement can neither falter nor recoil.
Confident in its destiny, reliant on its God-given power, fortified
by the consciousness of its past victories, galvanized into action at
the sight of a slowly disrupting civilization, it will—I can have
no doubt—continue to fulfill unflinchingly the immediate
requirements of its task, assured that with every step it takes and
with each stage it traverses, a fresh revelation of Divine light and
strength will guide and propel it forward until it consummates, in
the fullness of time and in the plenitude of its power, the Plan
inseparably bound up with its shining destiny.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-58-p1"></a>
A triple call, clear-voiced, insistent and inescapable, summons to
the challenge all members of the American Bahá’í community, at
this, the most fateful hour in their history. The first is the voice,
distant and piteous, of those sister communities which now, alas, are
fettered by the galling chains of religious orthodoxy and isolated
through the cruel barriers set up by a rampant nationalism. The
second is the plea, no less vehement and equally urgent, of those
peoples and nations of the New World, whose vast and unexplored
territories await to be warmed by the light and swept into the orbit
of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. The third, more universal and
stirring than either of the others, is the call of humanity itself
crying out for deliverance at a time when the tide of mounting evils
has destroyed its equilibrium and is now strangling its very life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-58-p2"></a>
These imperative calls of Bahá’í duty the American believers can
immediately if only partially answer. Their present status, their
circumscribed resources, debar them, however great their eagerness,
from responding completely and decisively to the full implications of
this threefold obligation. They can neither, individually nor through
their concerted efforts, impose directly their will upon those into
whose hands the immediate destinies of their persecuted brethren are
placed. Nor are they as yet capable of launching a campaign of such
magnitude as could capture the imagination and arouse the conscience
of mankind, and thereby ensure the immediate and full redress of
those grievances from which their hapless co-religionists in both the
East and the West are suffering. They cannot moreover hope to wield
at the present time in the councils of nations an influence
commensurate with the stupendous claims advanced, or adequate to the
greatness of the Cause proclaimed, by the Author of their Faith. Nor
can they assume a position or exercise such responsibilities as would
enable them by their acts and decisions to reverse the process which
is urging so tragically the decline of human society and its
institutions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-58-p3"></a>
And yet, though their influence be at the present hour indecisive and
their Divinely conferred authority unrecognized, the role they can
play in both alleviating the hardships that afflict their brethren
and in attenuating the ills that torment mankind is none the less
considerable and far-reaching. By the range and liberality of their
contributions to mitigate the distress of the bereaved, the exiled,
and the imprisoned; by the persistent, the wise and judicious
intervention of their elected representatives through the authorities
concerned; by a clear and convincing exposition, whenever
circumstances are propitious, of the issues involved; by a vigorous
defense of the rights and liberties denied; by an accurate and
dignified presentation of the events that have transpired; by every
manner of encouragement which their sympathies may suggest, or their
means permit, or their consciences dictate, to succor the outcast and
the impoverished; and above all by their tenacious adherence to, and
wide proclamation of, those principles, laws, ideals, and
institutions which their disabled fellow believers are unable to
affirm or publicly espouse; and lastly by the energetic prosecution
of those tasks which their oppressed fellow workers are forbidden to
initiate or conduct, the privileged community of the American Bahá’ís
can play a conspicuous part in the great Drama involving so large a
company of their unemancipated brethren in the Asiatic, the European
and African continents.<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-38"><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-58-p4"></a>
Their duties towards mankind in general are no less distinct and
vital. Their impotence to stem the tide of onrushing calamities,
their seeming helplessness in face of those cataclysmic forces that
are to convulse human society, do not in the least detract from the
urgency of their unique mission, nor exonerate them from those
weighty responsibilities which they alone can and must assume.
Humanity, heedless and impenitent, is admittedly hovering on the edge
of an awful abyss, ready to precipitate itself into that titanic
struggle, that crucible whose chastening fires alone can and will
weld its antagonistic elements of race, class, religion and nation
into one coherent system, one world Commonwealth. “<i>The hour is
approaching,</i>” is Bahá’u’lláh’s own testimony, “<i>when
the most great convulsion will have appeared.… I swear by God! The
promised day is come, the day when tormenting trials will have surged
above your heads, and beneath your feet, saying: ‘Taste ye what
your hands have wrought!’</i>” Not ours to question the almighty
wisdom, or fathom the inscrutable ways of Him in Whose hands the
ultimate destiny of an unregenerate yet potentially glorious race
must lie. Ours rather is the duty to believe that the worldwide
community of the Most Great Name, and in particular at the present
time its vanguard in North America, however buffeted by the powerful
currents of these troublous times, and however keen their awareness
of the inevitability of the final eruption, can, if they will, rise
to the level of their calling and discharge their functions, both in
the period which is witnessing the confusion and breakdown of human
institutions and in the ensuing epoch during which the shattered
basis of a dismembered society is to be recast, and its forces
reshaped, redirected and unified. With the age that is still unborn,
with its herculean tasks and unsuspected glories, we need not concern
ourselves at present. It is to the fierce struggles, the imperious
duties, the distinctive contributions which the present generation of
Bahá’ís are summoned to undertake and render that I feel we
should, at this hour, direct our immediate and anxious attention.
Though powerless to avert the impending contest the followers of
Bahá’u’lláh can, by the spirit they evince and the efforts they
exert, help to circumscribe its range, shorten its duration, allay
its hardships, proclaim its salutary consequences, and demonstrate
its necessary and vital role in the shaping of human destiny. Theirs
is the duty to hold, aloft and undimmed, the torch of Divine
Guidance, as the shades of night descend upon, and ultimately envelop
the entire human race. Theirs is the function, amidst its tumults,
perils and agonies, to witness to the vision, and proclaim the
approach, of that re-created society, that Christ-promised Kingdom,
that World Order whose generative impulse is the spirit of none other
than Bahá’u’lláh Himself, whose dominion is the entire planet,
whose watchword is unity, whose animating power is the force of
Justice, whose directive purpose is the reign of righteousness and
truth, and whose supreme glory is the complete, the undisturbed, and
everlasting felicity of the whole of humankind. By the sublimity and
serenity of their faith, by the steadiness and clarity of their
vision, the incorruptibility of their character, the rigor of their
discipline, the sanctity of their morals, and the unique example of
their community life, they can and indeed must in a world polluted
with its incurable corruptions, paralyzed by its haunting fears, torn
by its devastating hatreds, and languishing under the weight of its
appalling miseries, demonstrate the validity of their claim to be
regarded as the sole repository of that grace upon whose operation
must depend the complete deliverance, the fundamental reorganization
and the supreme felicity of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-58-p5"></a>
Though the obstacles confronting the followers of Bahá’u’lláh
of the American continent in their efforts to completely emancipate
their fellow Bahá’ís on the one hand, and to speedily
rehabilitate the fortunes of their fellowmen on the other, be in the
main insurmountable, such impediments cannot as yet be said to exist
that can frustrate their efforts to fully discharge the second duty
now incumbent upon them in the intercontinental sphere of Bahá’í
teaching. The field, in all its vastness and fertility, is wide open
and near at hand. The harvest is ripe. The hour is overdue. The
signal has been given. The spiritual forces mysteriously released are
already operating with increasing momentum, unchallenged and
unchecked. Victory, speedy and unquestioned, is assured to whomsoever
will arise and respond to this second, this urgent and vital call. In
this field, as in no other, the American believers can most easily
evince the full force of their latent energies, can exercise in their
plenitude their conspicuous talents, and can rise to the highest
level of their God-given opportunities. Fired by their zeal, their
love for and faith in Bahá’u’lláh; armed with that Holy
Charter,<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> wherein
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s mandate investing them with their world mission
is inscribed; piloted through the instrumentality of those agencies
which a divine, a smoothly functioning Administrative Order has
providentially placed at their disposal; disciplined and invigorated
by those immutable verities, spiritual principles and administrative
regulations that distinguish their religious beliefs, govern their
individual conduct and regulate their community life; aspiring to
emulate the example of those heroes and martyrs, the narrative of
whose exploits they have admired and pondered, it behooves all
members of the American Bahá’í community to gird themselves as
never before to the task of befittingly playing their part in the
enactment of the opening scene of the First Act of that superb Drama
whose theme is no less than the spiritual conquest of both the
Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Their immediate task under the Seven
Year Plan, the object of which is the establishment of a minimum of
one Bahá’í center in each of the Republics of Middle and South
America, has now been gloriously ushered in through the settlement of
one pioneer in most of the Central American Republics, and bids fair
to be recognized by posterity as the original impulse imparted to an
enterprise that will go round the world. That impulse must, as time
goes by, communicate itself to the farthest extremities of Latin
America, and must be reinforced, in every manner, by as many of the
American believers as possible. The broader the basis of this
campaign and the deeper its roots, the finer the flower into which it
shall eventually blossom. That its call may be heeded, that its
implications may be recognized and its potentialities progressively
unfold is my earnest prayer, and the supreme longing of my heart.</p>

The transfer of the sacred remains of the brother and mother of our
Lord and Master ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Mount Carmel and their final
interment within the hallowed precincts of the Shrine of the Báb,
and in the immediate neighborhood of the resting-place of the
Greatest Holy Leaf, constitute, apart from their historic
associations and the tender sentiments they arouse, events of such
capital institutional significance as only future happenings,
steadily and mysteriously unfolding at the World Center of our Faith,
can adequately demonstrate.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p2"></a>
The circumstances attending the consummation of this long, this
profoundly cherished hope were no less significant. The swiftness and
suddenness with which so delicate and weighty an undertaking was
conducted; the surmounting of various obstacles which the outbreak of
war and its inevitable repercussions necessarily engendered; the
success of the long-drawn-out negotiations which the solution of
certain preliminary problems imposed; the execution of the plan in
the face of the continued instability and persistent dangers
following the fierce riots that so long and so violently rocked the
Holy Land, and despite the smoldering fire of animosity kindled in
the breasts of ecclesiastics and Covenant-breakers alike—all
combined to demonstrate afresh and with compelling power the
invincible might of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p3"></a>
The Purest Branch, the martyred son, the companion and amanuensis of
Bahá’u’lláh, that pious and holy youth, who in the darkest days
of Bahá’u’lláh’s incarceration in the barracks of ‘Akká
entreated, on his deathbed, his Father to accept him as a ransom for
those of His loved ones who yearned for, but were unable to attain,
His presence, and the saintly mother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, surnamed
Navváb by Bahá’u’lláh, and the first recipient of the honored
and familiar title of “the Most Exalted Leaf,” separated in death
above half a century, and forced to suffer the humiliation of an
alien burial ground, are now at long last reunited with the Greatest
Holy Leaf, with whom they had so abundantly shared the tribulations
of one of the most distressing episodes of the Heroic Age of the
Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Avenged, eternally safeguarded,
befittingly glorified, they repose embosomed in the heart of Carmel,
hidden beneath its sacred soil, interred in one single spot, lying
beneath the shadow of the twin holy Tombs, and facing across the bay,
on an eminence of unequaled loveliness and beauty, the silver-city of
‘Akká, the Point of Adoration of the entire Bahá’í world, and
the Door of Hope for all mankind. “<i>Haste thee, O Carmel,</i>”
thus proclaims the pen of Bahá’u’lláh, “<i>for lo, the light
of the countenance of God, the Ruler of the Kingdom of Names and
Fashioner of the heavens, hath been lifted upon thee.</i>”
“<i>Rejoice, for God hath in this Day established upon thee His
throne, hath made thee the dawning-place of His signs and the
dayspring of the evidences of His Revelation.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p4"></a>
The machinations of Badí‘u’lláh—the brother and lieutenant of
the Focal Center of sedition and Archbreaker of the Covenant of
Bahá’u’lláh, the deceased Muḥammad-‘Alí—who with
uncommon temerity and exceptional vigor addressed his written protest
to the civil authorities, claiming the right to oppose the projected
transfer of the remains of the mother and brother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
have been utterly frustrated. So foolish a claim, advanced by one who
in the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has been denounced as
an “<i>alert and active worker of mischief,</i>” and whose life
has been marked by so many instances of extravagance, of betrayal and
folly, has been summarily rejected by the fairness and justice of the
civil authorities, in whose custody the notorious Sá<u>dh</u>ij, the
daughter of that same Badí‘u’lláh, is still retained, as a
direct result of her ceaseless instigations to rebellion and
terrorism, and whose acts constitute a clear and double violation of
the civil law of the land and of the spiritual ordinances of
Bahá’u’lláh, in Whose Faith she professes to believe.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p5"></a>
Unabashed by his appalling mistakes and blunders; undeterred by the
galling failure of his persistent efforts, in conjunction with his
brother, to establish, in the days following the passing of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, their alleged right to the custody of the Most
Holy Tomb; unrestrained by the memory of the abortive attempt of
Muḥammad-‘Alí to retain the Mansion of Bahá’u’lláh<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
as a private residence for himself and his family; unchastened by the
spiritual and material misery into which he and his kindred have
sunk; and impotent to perceive the contrast between that misery and
the consolidating strength and ever-enhancing prestige of the
institutions heralding the birth of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh
at its international center, he has, with characteristic insolence,
dared to raise once again his voice against the resistless march of
events that are steadily accelerating the expansion and establishment
of the Faith in the Holy Land.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p6"></a>
For it must be clearly understood, nor can it be sufficiently
emphasized, that the conjunction of the resting-place of the Greatest
Holy Leaf with those of her brother and mother incalculably
reinforces the spiritual potencies of that consecrated Spot which,
under the wings of the Báb’s overshadowing Sepulcher, and in the
vicinity of the future Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár which will
be reared on its flank, is destined to evolve into the focal center
of those world-shaking, world-embracing, world-directing
administrative institutions, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh and
anticipated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and which are to function in
consonance with the principles that govern the twin institutions of
the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice. Then, and then
only, will this momentous prophecy which illuminates the concluding
passages of the Tablet of Carmel be fulfilled: “<i>Erelong will God
sail His Ark upon thee </i>(Carmel)<i>, and will manifest the people
of Bahá who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p7"></a>
To attempt to visualize, even in its barest outline, the glory that
must envelop these institutions, to essay even a tentative and
partial description of their character or the manner of their
operation, or to trace however inadequately the course of events
leading to their rise and eventual establishment is far beyond my own
capacity and power. Suffice it to say that at this troubled stage in
world history the association of these three incomparably precious
souls who, next to the three Central Figures of our Faith, tower in
rank above the vast multitude of the heroes, Letters, martyrs, hands,
teachers and administrators of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh, in
such a potentially powerful spiritual and administrative Center, is
in itself an event which will release forces that are bound to hasten
the emergence in a land which, geographically, spiritually and
administratively, constitutes the heart of the entire planet, of some
of the brightest gems of that World Order now shaping in the womb of
this travailing age.</p>

For such as might undertake, in the days to come, the meritorious and
highly enviable pilgrimage to these blessed shrines, as well as for
the benefit of the less privileged who, aware of the greatness of
their virtue and the preeminence of their lineage, desire to commune
with their spirits, and to strive to acquire an added insight into
the glory of their position, and to follow in their footsteps, let
these testimonies written by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
be their inspiration and guidance in their noble quest:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p9"></a>
“<i>At this very moment,</i>” Bahá’u’lláh testifies, “<i>My
son is being washed before My face, after Our having sacrificed him
in the Most Great Prison. Thereat have the dwellers of the Abhá
Tabernacle wept with a great weeping, and such as have suffered
imprisonment with this Youth in the path of God, the Lord of the
promised Day, lamented. Under such conditions My Pen hath not been
prevented from remembering its Lord, the Lord of all nations. It
summoneth the people unto God, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. This
is the day whereon he that was created of the light of Bahá has
suffered martyrdom, at a time when he lay imprisoned at the hands of
his enemies.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p10"></a>
“<i>Upon thee, O Branch of God!</i>” He solemnly and most
touchingly, in that same Tablet, bestows upon him His benediction,
“<i>be the remembrance of God and His praise, and the praise of all
that dwell in the Realm of Immortality, and of all the denizens of
the Kingdom of Names. Happy art thou in that thou hast been faithful
to the Covenant of God and His Testament, until thou didst sacrifice
thyself before the face of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Unconstrained.
Thou, in truth, hast been wronged, and to this testifieth the Beauty
of Him, the Self-Subsisting. Thou didst, in the first days of thy
life, bear that which hath caused all things to groan, and made every
pillar to tremble. Happy is the one that remembereth thee, and
draweth nigh, through thee, unto God, the Creator of the Morn.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p11"></a>
“<i>Glorified art Thou, O Lord, my God!</i>” He, in a prayer,
astoundingly proclaims, “<i>Thou seest Me in the hands of Mine
enemies, and My son bloodstained before Thy face, O Thou in Whose
hands is the kingdom of all names. I have, O my Lord, offered up that
which Thou hast given Me, that Thy servants may be quickened and all
that dwell on earth be united.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p12"></a>
“<i>Blessed art thou,</i>” He, in another Tablet affirms, “<i>and
blessed he that turneth unto thee, and visiteth thy grave, and
draweth nigh, through thee, unto God, the Lord of all that was and
shall be … I testify that thou didst return in meekness unto thine
abode. Great is thy blessedness and the blessedness of them that hold
fast unto the hem of thy outspread robe … Thou art, verily, the
trust of God and His treasure in this land. Erelong will God reveal
through thee that which He hath desired. He, verily, is the Truth,
the Knower of things unseen. When thou wast laid to rest in the
earth, the earth itself trembled in its longing to meet thee. Thus
hath it been decreed, and yet the people perceive not … Were We to
recount the mysteries of thine ascension, they that are asleep would
waken, and all beings would be set ablaze with the fire of the
remembrance of My Name, the Mighty, the Loving.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p13"></a>
Concerning the Most Exalted Leaf, the mother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Bahá’u’lláh has written: “<i>The first Spirit through which
all spirits were revealed, and the first Light by which all lights
shone forth, rest upon thee, O Most Exalted Leaf, thou who hast been
mentioned in the Crimson Book! Thou art the one whom God created to
arise and serve His own Self, and the Manifestation of His Cause, and
the Dayspring of His Revelation, and the Dawning-Place of His signs,
and the Source of His commandments; and Who so aided thee that thou
didst turn with thy whole being unto Him, at a time when His servants
and handmaidens had turned away from His Face … Happy art thou, O
My handmaiden, and My leaf, and the one mentioned in My Book, and
inscribed by My Pen of Glory in My Scrolls and Tablets … Rejoice
thou, at this moment, in the most exalted Station and the All-highest
Paradise, and the Abhá Horizon, inasmuch as He Who is the Lord of
Names hath remembered thee. We bear witness that thou didst attain
unto all good, and that God hath so exalted thee, that all honor and
glory circled around thee.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p14"></a>
“<i>O Navváb!</i>” He thus, in another Tablet, addresses her, “<i>O
Leaf that hath sprung from My Tree, and been My companion! My glory
be upon thee, and My loving-kindness, and My mercy that hath
surpassed all beings. We announce unto thee that which will gladden
thine eye, and assure thy soul, and rejoice thine heart. Verily, thy
Lord is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. God hath been and will
be pleased with thee, and hath singled thee out for His own Self, and
chosen thee from among His handmaidens to serve Him, and hath made
thee the companion of His Person in the daytime and in the night
season.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p15"></a>
“<i>Hear thou Me once again,</i>” He reassures her, “<i>God is
well pleased with thee, as a token of His grace and a sign of His
mercy. He hath made thee to be His companion in every one of His
worlds, and hath nourished thee with His meeting and presence, so
long as His Name, and His Remembrance, and His Kingdom, and His
Empire shall endure. Happy is the handmaid that hath mentioned thee,
and sought thy good pleasure, and humbled herself before thee, and
held fast unto the cord of thy love. Woe betide him that denieth thy
exalted station, and the things ordained for thee from God, the Lord
of all names, and him that hath turned away from thee, and rejected
thy station before God, the Lord of the mighty throne.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p16"></a>
“<i>O faithful ones!</i>” Bahá’u’lláh specifically enjoins,
“<i>Should ye visit the resting-place of the Most Exalted Leaf, who
hath ascended unto the Glorious Companion, stand ye and say:
‘Salutation and blessing and glory upon thee, O Holy Leaf that hath
sprung from the Divine Lote-Tree! I bear witness that thou hast
believed in God and in His signs, and answered His Call, and turned
unto Him, and held fast unto His cord, and clung to the hem of His
grace, and fled thy home in His path, and chosen to live as a
stranger, out of love for His presence and in thy longing to serve
Him. May God have mercy upon him that draweth nigh unto thee, and
remembereth thee through the things which My Pen hath voiced in this,
the most great station. We pray God that He may forgive us, and
forgive them that have turned unto thee, and grant their desires, and
bestow upon them, through His wondrous grace, whatever be their wish.
He, verily, is the Bountiful, the Generous. Praise be to God, He Who
is the Desire of all worlds, and the Beloved of all who recognize
Him.’</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-64-p17"></a>
And, finally, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself, in one of His remarkably
significant Tablets, has borne witness not only to the exalted
station of one whose “seed shall inherit the Gentiles,” whose
Husband is the Lord of Hosts, but also to the sufferings endured by
her who was His beloved mother. “<i>As to thy question concerning
the 54th chapter of Isaiah,” He writes, “This chapter refers to
the Most Exalted Leaf, the mother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. As a proof to
this it is said: ‘For more are the children of the desolate, than
the children of the married wife.’ Reflect upon this statement, and
then upon the following: ‘And thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles,
and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.’ And truly the
humiliation and reproach which she suffered in the path of God is a
fact which no one can refute. For the calamities and afflictions
mentioned in the whole chapter are such afflictions which she
suffered in the path of God, all of which she endured with patience
and thanked God therefor and praised Him, because He had enabled her
to endure afflictions for the sake of Bahá. During all this time,
the men and women (Covenant-breakers) persecuted her in an
incomparable manner, while she was patient, God-fearing, calm, humble
and contented through the favor of her Lord and by the bounty of her
Creator.</i>”</p>

The association of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of
the West with the hallowed memories of the Purest Branch and of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s mother, recently reinterred under the shadow of
the Báb’s holy Shrine, inaugurates a new, and at long last the
final, phase of an enterprise which, thirty years ago, was
providentially launched on the very day the remains of the Forerunner
of our Faith were laid to rest by our beloved Master in the sepulcher
specifically erected for that purpose on Mount Carmel.<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
The birth of this holy enterprise, pregnant with such rich, such
infinite possibilities, synchronized with, and was consecrated
through, this historic event which, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself has
affirmed, constitutes the most signal act of the triple mission He
had been prompted to perform. The site of the Temple itself was
honored by the presence of Him Who, ever since this enterprise was
initiated, had, through His messages and Tablets, bestowed upon it
His special attention and care, and surrounded it with the marks of
His unfailing solicitude. Its foundation-stone was laid by His own
loving hands, on an occasion so moving that it has come to be
regarded as one of the most stirring episodes of His historic visit
to the North American continent.<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>
Its superstructure was raised as a direct consequence of the pent-up
energies which surged from the breasts of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
lovers at a time when His sudden removal from their midst had plunged
them into consternation, bewilderment and sorrow. Its external
ornamentation was initiated and accelerated through the energizing
influences which the rising and continually consolidating
institutions of a divinely established Administrative Order had
released in the midst of a community that had identified its vital
interests with that Temple’s destiny. The measures devised to
hasten its completion were incorporated in a Plan which derives its
inspiration from those destiny-shaping Tablets wherein, in bold
relief, stands outlined the world mission entrusted by their Author
to the American Bahá’í community. And finally, the Fund, designed
to receive and dispose of the resources amassed for its prosecution,
was linked with the memory, and bore the name, of her whose ebbing
life was brightened and cheered by those tidings that unmistakably
revealed to her the depth of devotion and the tenacity of purpose
which animate the American believers in the cause of their beloved
Temple. And now, while the Bahá’í world vibrates with emotion at
the news of the transfer of the precious remains of both the Purest
Branch and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s mother to a spot which, watched
over by the Twin holy Shrines and in the close neighborhood of the
resting-place of the Greatest Holy Leaf, is to become the focus of
the administrative institutions of the Faith at its world center, the
mere act of linking the destiny of so far-reaching an undertaking
with so significant an event in the Formative Period of our Faith
will assuredly set the seal of complete triumph upon, and enhance the
spiritual potentialities of, a work so significantly started and so
magnificently executed by the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in the
North American continent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-66-p2"></a>
The Plan which your Assembly has suggested to raise the sum of fifty
thousand dollars by next April, which will enable you to place the
necessary contract for the final completion of the entire First Story
of the Mashriqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, meets with my unqualified
approval. It was specially in order to initiate and encourage the
progress of such a plan that I felt impelled to pledge the sum of one
thousand pounds in the memory of these two glorious souls who, apart
from the Founders of our Faith and its Exemplar, tower, together with
the Greatest Holy Leaf, above the rank and file of the faithful.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-66-p3"></a>
The interval separating us from that date is admittedly short. The
explosive forces which lie dormant in the international field may,
ere the expiry of these fleeting months, break out in an eruption
that may prove the most fateful that mankind has experienced. It is
within the power of the organized body of the American believers to
further demonstrate the imperturbability of their faith, the serenity
of their confidence and the unyielding tenacity of their resolve.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-66-p4"></a>
We stand at the threshold of the decade within which the centenary of
the birth of our Faith is to be celebrated. Scarcely more than four
years stand between us and that glorious consummation. No community,
no individual, neither in the East nor in the West, however
afflictive the circumstances that now prevail, can afford to hesitate
or falter. The few years immediately ahead are endowed with potencies
that we can but dimly appreciate. Ours is the duty and privilege to
utilize to the full the opportunities which these fate-laden years
offer us. The American Bahá’í community, already responsible,
over such a long period, for such heroic acts, under such severe
handicaps, cannot and will not hesitate or falter. The past is a
witness of their splendid triumphs. The future will be no less a
witness of their final victory.</p>

The fourth year of the Seven Year Plan enters upon its course in
circumstances that are at once critical, challenging, and
unprecedented in their significance. The year that has passed has,
insofar as the rise and establishment of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
in the Western Hemisphere is concerned, been one of the most eventful
since the Plan began to operate and exercise its potent and
beneficent influence. Both within and without the community of the
Most Great Name, the events which the last twelvemonth has unfolded
have in some mysterious way, whether directly or indirectly,
communicated their force to the Plan’s progressive unfoldment,
contributed to the orientation of its policy and assisted in the
consolidation of the diversified undertakings, both primary and
subsidiary, that fall within its orbit. Even the losses which the
ranks of its stouthearted upholders have sustained will, when viewed
in their proper perspective, be regarded as gains of incalculable
value, affecting both its immediate fortunes as well as its ultimate
destiny.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-70-p2"></a>
The successive international crises which agitated the opening months
of the year that has elapsed, culminating in the outbreak of the war
in Europe, far from drowning the enthusiasm or daunting the spirit of
the prosecutors of God’s Plan, served, by deflecting their gaze
from a storm-tossed continent, to focus their minds and resources on
ministering to the urgent needs of that Hemisphere in which the first
honors and the initial successes of the heroes of the Formative Age
of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh are to be scored and won. The
sudden extinction of the earthly life of that star-servant of the
Cause of Bahá’u’lláh, Martha Root, who, while on the last lap
of her fourth journey round the world—journeys that carried her to
the humblest homes as well as the palaces of royalty—was hurrying
homeward to lend her promised aid to her fellow countrymen in their
divinely appointed task—such a death, though it frustrated this
cherished resolution of her indomitable spirit, steeled the hearts of
her bereaved lovers and admirers to carry on, more energetically than
ever, the work which she herself had initiated, as far back as the
year 1919, in every important city in the South American
continent.<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> The subtle
and contemptible machinations by which the puny adversaries of the
Faith, jealous of its consolidating power and perturbed by the
compelling evidences of its conspicuous victories, have sought to
challenge the validity and misrepresent the character of the
Administrative Order embedded in its teachings have galvanized the
swelling army of its defenders to arise and arraign the usurpers of
their sacred rights and to defend the long-standing strongholds of
the institutions of their Faith in their home country. And now as
this year, so memorable in the annals of the Faith, was drawing to a
close, there befell the American Bahá’í community, through the
dramatic and sudden death of May Maxwell, yet another loss, which
viewed in retrospect will come to be regarded as a potent blessing
conferred upon the campaign now being so diligently conducted by its
members. Laden with the fruits garnered through well-nigh half a
century of toilsome service to the Cause she so greatly loved,
heedless of the warnings of age and ill health, and afire with the
longing to worthily demonstrate her gratitude in her overwhelming
awareness of the bounties of her Lord and Master, she set her face
towards the southern outpost of the Faith in the New World, and laid
down her life in such a spirit of consecration and self-sacrifice as
has truly merited the crown of martyrdom. To Keith Ransom-Kehler,
whose dust sleeps in far-off Iṣfahán; to Martha Root, fallen in
her tracks on an island in the midmost heart of the ocean; and to May
Maxwell, lying in solitary glory in the southern outpost of the
Western Hemisphere—to these three heroines of the Formative Age of
the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh they who now labor so assiduously for
its expansion and establishment owe a debt of gratitude which future
generations will not fail to adequately recognize.</p>

I need not expatiate on other, though less prominent, events that
have contributed their share to the furtherance of the Seven Year
Plan, or marked its systematic development. The association of the
Fund, specifically inaugurated for its prosecution, with the hallowed
memories of both the Mother and Brother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; the
establishment of at least one pioneer in each of the Republics of
Central and South America; the ushering in of the last phase of the
external ornamentation of the Temple; the conjunction of the
institutions of the Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds and the Mashriqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár
in the heart of the North American continent; the founding of yet
another institution designed as a training school for Inter-America
teaching work;<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> the
steady rise in the number of groups and Assemblies functioning within
the Administrative Framework of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh—these
stand out as further evidences of the animating Force that propels
the Plan towards its final consummation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-70-p4"></a>
Varied and abundant as have been the past manifestations of this
driving, resistless Force, they cannot but pale before the brilliant
victories which its progressive and systematic development must
achieve in the future.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-70-p5"></a>
The American believers, standing on the threshold of the fourth year
of the Seven Year Plan, pursue their God-given task with a radiance
that no earthly gloom can dim, and will continue to shoulder its
ever-growing duties and responsibilities with a vigor and loyalty
that no earthly power can either sap or diminish.</p>

To these words, written on my behalf, and in answer to your
particular questions relating to the administrative issues that
confront you in these days, I wish to add my own tribute to the
magnificent manner in which you face the problems, both spiritual and
administrative, which the expansion of the Faith is continually
raising, and to the way in which you resolve them, explain their
nature, and derive fresh strength from your experience of any one of
them. The text of the annual reports demonstrates this fact, and
establishes for all time the high standard according to which the
administrative machinery of the Faith is functioning, developing and
consolidating itself under your able and energetic direction. As the
administrative processes expand, as their operation steadily
improves, as their necessity is more fully and strikingly
demonstrated, and their beneficent influence correspondingly grows
more apparent and evident, so will the blessings, the strength, and
guidance bestowed by Him Who animates and directs these processes be
more abundantly vouchsafed to those who have been called upon to
utilize them, in this age, for the execution of God’s Purpose and
for the ultimate redemption of a sore-stricken, travailing humanity.
Many will be the setbacks, the shocks and the disturbances, which the
commotions of a convulsive age must produce; yet no force, however
violent and worldwide in its range and catastrophic in its immediate
consequences, can either halt these processes or deflect their
appointed course. How great, then, the privilege, and how staggering
the responsibility, of those who are destined to guard over them and
to bring them eventually to full fruition. Nothing short of utter, of
continuous, consecration to His Will and Purpose can enable them to
fulfill their high destiny.</p>

My heart is thrilled with delight as I witness, in so many fields,
and in such distant outposts, and despite such formidable
difficulties, restrictions, obstacles and dangers, so many evidences
of the solidarity, the valor, and the achievements of the American
Bahá’í community. As the end of the First Century of the Bahá’í
Era approaches, as the shadows descending upon and enveloping mankind
steadily and remorselessly deepen, this community, which can almost
be regarded as the solitary champion of the Faith in the Western
World, is increasingly evincing and demonstrating its capacity, its
worth, and ability as the torchbearer of the New, the World
civilization which is destined to supplant in the fullness of time
the present one. And more particularly in the virgin and far-flung
territories of Latin America, it has, in recent months, abundantly
given visible evidence of its merits and competence to shoulder the
immense responsibilities which the carrying of the sacred fire to all
the Republics of the Western Hemisphere must necessarily entail.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-79-p2"></a>
Through these initial steps which, in pursuance of the Plan conceived
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, this community has taken, through the
settlement in each of these sovereign states of the New World of
American Bahá’í pioneers, through the formation of Bahá’í
groups and the establishment of two Assemblies in Buenos Aires and
Bahia, the American National Assembly, as well as its Inter-America
Committee, and all subsidiary agencies, no less than the individual
members of the North American Bahá’í community who have
sacrificed and are still sacrificing so much in their support of this
Divine and momentous Plan, have earned the unqualified admiration and
the undying gratitude of sister Assemblies and fellow workers
throughout the Bahá’í world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-79-p3"></a>
Their work, however, is only beginning. The dispatch of pioneers, the
provision of adequate means for their support, their settlement and
initiation of Bahá’í activities in these far-off lands, however
strenuous and meritorious, are insufficient if the Plan is to evolve
harmoniously and yield promptly its destined fruit. The extension by
the Parent Assembly—the immediate source from which this vast
system with all its ramifications is now proceeding—of the
necessary support, guidance, recognition, and material assistance to
enable these newly fledged groups and Assemblies to function in
strict accordance with both the spiritual and administrative
principles of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh would seem as essential
and urgent as the preliminary task already achieved. To nurse these
tender plants of the Vineyard of God, to foster their growth, to
direct their development, to accord them the necessary recognition,
to help resolve their problems, to familiarize them, with gentleness,
patience and fidelity, with the processes of the Administrative Order
and thus enable them to assume independently the conduct of future
local and national Bahá’í activities, would bring the Plan to
swift and full fruition and would add fresh laurels to the crown of
immortal glory already won by a community that holds, in these days
of dark and dire calamities, valiantly and almost alone, the Fort of
the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Fortified by these reflections, let
them gird up their loins for still mightier exertions and more
brilliant victories.</p>

the titanic upheaval foreshadowed as far back as seventy years ago by
Bahá’u’lláh. It can be viewed in no other light except as a
direct interposition by Him Who is the Ordainer of the Universe, the
Judge of all men, and the Deliverer of the nations. It is the rod of
both the anger of God and of His correction. The fierceness of its
devastating power chastens the children of men for their refusal to
acclaim the century-old Message of their promised, their Heaven-sent
Redeemer. The fury of its flames, on the other hand, purges away the
dross, and welds the limbs of humanity into one single organism,
indivisible, purified, God-conscious and Divinely directed. Its
immediate cause can be traced to the forces engendered by the last
war of which it may truly be regarded as the direct continuation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-82-p2"></a>
Its first sparks were kindled on the eastern shores of the Asiatic
continent, enveloping two sister races of the world in a
conflagration which no force seems able to either quench or
circumscribe. This cataclysmic process was accelerated by the
outbreak of a fierce conflict in the heart of Europe, fanning into
flame age-long animosities and unchaining a series of calamities as
swift as they were appalling. As the turmoil gathered momentum it
swept remorselessly into its vortex the most powerful nations of the
European continent—the chief protagonists of that highly vaunted
yet lamentably defective civilization. The mounting tide of its havoc
and devastation soon overspread the northernmost regions of that
afflicted continent, subsequently ravaged the shores of the
Mediterranean, and invaded the African continent as far as Ethiopia
and the surrounding territories. The Balkan countries, as predicted
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, were soon to sustain the impact of this tragic
ordeal, communicating in their turn the commotions to which they had
been subjected to both the Near and Middle East, wherein are
enshrined the Heart of the Faith itself, its Cradle, its chief Center
of Pilgrimage, and its most sacred and historic sites.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-82-p3"></a>
Its menace is overleaping the limits of the Old World and is plunging
into consternation the Great Republic of the West, as well as the
peoples of Central and South America. The New World, as well as the
Old, is experiencing the terrific impact of this disruptive force.
Even the peoples of the Antipodes are trembling before the
approaching tempest that threatens to burst on their heads.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-82-p4"></a>
The races of the world, Nordic, Slavonic, Mongolian, Arab and African
are alike subjected to its consuming violence. The world’s
religious systems are no less affected by the universal paralysis
which is creeping over the minds and souls of men. The persecution of
world Jewry, the rapid deterioration of Christian institutions, the
intestine divisions and disorders of Islám, are but manifestations
of the fear and trembling that has seized humanity in its hour of
unprecedented turmoil and peril. On the high seas, in the air, on
land, in the forefront of battle, in the palaces of kings and the
cottages of peasants, in the most hallowed sanctuaries, whether
secular or religious, the evidences of God’s retributive act and
mysterious discipline are manifest. Its heavy toll is steadily
mounting—a holocaust sparing neither prince nor peasant, neither
man nor woman, neither young nor old.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-82-p5"></a>
The Faith of Bahá’u’lláh—that priceless gem of Divine
Revelation, enshrining the Spirit of God and incarnating His Purpose
for mankind in this age—can neither aspire nor expect to escape
unhurt amid the hurricane of human disasters that blows around it. By
most men unnoticed, scorned and ridiculed by some, feared and
challenged by others, this world-redemptive Faith, for whose precious
sake the world is undergoing such agony, finds its virgin strength
assailed, and its infant institutions hemmed in by the dark forces
which a godless civilization has unloosed over the face of the
planet. In the Old World, whether in Europe, Asia or Africa, it is
being buffeted about, ostracized, arraigned and repressed. In certain
countries its community life is being extinguished, in others a ban
is severely imposed on its propagation, in still others its members
are denied all intercourse with its World Center. Dangers, grave and
unsuspected, confront its Cradle and surround its very Heart.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-82-p6"></a>
Not so, however, with the countries of the Western Hemisphere. The
call of Bahá’u’lláh summons, at this challenging hour, the
peoples of the New World and its leaders to redress the balance of
the Old. “<i>O Rulers of America,</i>” He thus addresses the
Chief Magistrates of that continent, “<i>and the Presidents of the
Republics therein! … Adorn the temple of your dominion with the
ornament of Justice and of the fear of God, and its head with the
crown of the remembrance of your Lord, the Maker of the heavens.</i>”
The Great Republic of the West, an object of special solicitude
throughout the ministry of the Center of the Covenant, whose soil has
been hallowed by His footsteps, and the foundation of whose
Edifice—the Mother Temple of the West—has been consecrated by His
hand, has been singled out through the operation of His Will and been
invested by His pen with a unique, an inescapable, a weighty and most
sacred responsibility. The Mission entrusted to the community of the
North American believers in the darkest days of the last war is,
after a period of incubation of well-nigh twenty years, and through
the instrumentality of the administrative agencies erected after
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing, efflorescing under our very eyes.
Already, since the inception of the Seven Year Plan, this community
can well claim to have attained, through its deeds, a stature that
dwarfs its sister communities, and can glory in a parentage that
embraces every Republic of Latin America. The first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár
of the West, its beauteous and noble handiwork, is virtually
completed. A nucleus for a future flourishing local community is
already formed in every state and province in North America. The
administrative structure, following the pattern of its prototype in
the U.S.A., is, through the agency of that same Plan, raising its
triumphant head in the Central and South American Republics. The Plan
itself, propelled by the energies released by those immortal Tablets
which constitute its charter, bids fair, in the fifth year of its
operation, to exceed the highest expectations of those who have so
courageously launched it. Its consummation, coinciding with the
termination of the first century of the Bahá’í Era, will mark the
opening of yet another phase in a series of crusades which must
carry, in the course of the succeeding century, the privileged
recipients of those epoch-making Tablets beyond the Western
Hemisphere to the uttermost ends of the earth, to implant the banner,
and lay an unassailable basis for the administrative structure of the
Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-82-p7"></a>
The quality and magnitude of the work already achieved by these
stalwart champions of God’s New World Order are inexpressibly
exhilarating and infinitely meritorious. The immensity of the tasks
still to be performed staggers our fancy and inflames our
imagination. The potentialities with which those tasks are endowed
elude our shrewdest calculations. The promise they enshrine is too
dazzling to contemplate. What else can we do but bow our heads in
thanksgiving and reverence, steel our hearts in preparation for the
strenuous days ahead, and intensify a hundredfold our resolution to
carry on the task to which our hands are set at present?</p>

As I survey the activities and accomplishments of the American
believers in recent months, and recall their reaction to the urgent
call for service, embodied in the Seven Year Plan, I feel overwhelmed
by a threefold sense of gratitude and admiration which I feel
prompted to place on record, but which I cannot adequately express.
Future generations can alone appraise correctly the value of their
present services, and the Beloved, Whose mandate they are so
valiantly obeying, can alone befittingly reward them for the manner
in which they are discharging their duties.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p2"></a>
The virtual completion of a thirty-year-old enterprise, which was
initiated in His days and blessed by His hand, is the first and
foremost accomplishment that must shed imperishable luster not only
on the administrative annals of the Formative Age of the Faith, but
on the entire record of the signal achievements performed in the
course of the First Century of the Bahá’í Era.<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
The steady expansion and consolidation of the world Mission,
entrusted by that same Master to their hands, and set in operation
after His passing, constitutes the second object of my undying
gratitude to a community that has abundantly demonstrated its
worthiness to shoulder the superhuman tasks with which it has been
entrusted. The spirit with which that same community has faced and
resisted the onslaught of the enemies of the Faith who, for various
reasons, and with ever-increasing subtlety and malice, have
persistently striven to disrupt the administrative machinery of an
Order, foreshadowed by the Báb, enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh, and
established by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is yet another testimony to the
unrivaled merits and the eminent position attained by its privileged
members since the ascension of the Center of the Covenant.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p3"></a>
The extinction of the influence precariously exerted by some of these
enemies, the decline that has set in in the fortunes of others, the
sincere repentance expressed by still others and their subsequent
reinstatement and effectual participation in the teaching and
administrative activities of the Faith, constitute in themselves
sufficient evidence of the unconquerable power and invincible spirit
which animate those who stand identified with, and loyally carry out
the provisions and injunctions of, the Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p4"></a>
And now more particularly concerning the prime mover of this latest
agitation,<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> which,
whatever its immediate consequences, will sooner or later come to be
regarded as merely one more of those ugly and abortive attempts
designed to undermine the foundation, and obscure the purpose, of the
Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh: Obscure in
his origin, ambitious of leadership, untaught by the lesson of such
as have erred before him, odious in the hopes he nurses, contemptible
in the methods he pursues, shameless in his deliberate distortions of
truths he has long since ceased to believe in, ludicrous in his
present isolation and helplessness, wounded and exasperated by the
downfall which his own folly has precipitated, he, the latest
protagonist of a spurious cause, cannot but in the end be subjected,
as remorselessly as his infamous predecessors, to the fate which they
invariably have suffered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p5"></a>
Generated by the propelling and purifying forces of a mysterious
Faith, born of delusion or malice, winning a fleeting notoriety
derived from the precarious advantages of wealth, fame, or fortune,
these movements, sponsored by deluded, self-seeking adventurers, find
themselves, sooner or later, enmeshed in the machinations of their
authors, are buried in shame, and sink eventually into complete
oblivion.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p6"></a>
The schism which their foolish leaders had contrived so sedulously to
produce within the Faith, will soon, to their utter amazement, come
to be regarded as a process of purification, a cleansing agency,
which, far from decimating the ranks of its followers, reinforces its
indestructible unity, and proclaims anew to a world, skeptical or
indifferent, the cohesive strength of the institutions of that Faith,
the incorruptibility of its purposes and principles, and the
recuperative powers inherent in its community life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p7"></a>
Were anyone to imagine or expect that a Cause, comprising within its
orbit so vast a portion of the globe, so turbulent in its history, so
challenging in its claims, so diversified in the elements it has
assimilated into its administrative structure, should at all times be
immune to any divergence of opinion, or any defection on the part of
its multitudinous followers, would be sheer delusion, wholly
unreasonable and unwarranted, even in the face of the unprecedented
evidences of the miraculous power which its rise and progress have so
powerfully exhibited. That such a secession, however, whether
effected by those who apostatize their faith or preach heretical
doctrines, should have failed, after the lapse of a century, to split
in twain the entire body of the adherents of the Faith, or to create
a grave, a permanent and irremediable breach in its organic
structure, is a fact too eloquent for even a casual observer of the
internal processes of its Administrative Order to either deny or
ignore.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p8"></a>
Therein every loyal and intelligent upholder of Bahá’u’lláh’s
incomparable Covenant—a Covenant designed by Him as the sole refuge
against schism, disruption, and anarchy—will readily recognize the
hallmark of His Faith, and will acclaim it as the supreme gift
conferred by Him Who is the Lord of Revelation upon the present and
future generations who are destined, in this greatest of all
Dispensations, to flock, from every creed and religion, to the
banner, and espouse the Cause, of His Most Great Name.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p9"></a>
Dear friends! Manifold, various, and at times extremely perilous,
have been the tragic crises which the blind hatred, the unbounded
presumption, the incredible folly, the abject perfidy, the vaulting
ambition of the enemy have intermittently engendered within the pale
of the Faith. From some of its most powerful and renowned votaries,
at the hands of its once trusted and ablest propagators, champions,
and administrators, from the ranks of its most revered and highly
placed trustees, whether as companions, amanuenses, or appointed
lieutenants of the Herald of the Faith, of its Author, and of the
Center of His Covenant, from even those who were numbered among the
kindred of the Manifestation, not excluding the brother, the sons and
daughters of Bahá’u’lláh, and the nominee of the Báb Himself,
a Faith, of such tender age, and enshrining so priceless a promise,
has sustained blows as dire and treacherous as any recorded in the
world’s religious history.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p10"></a>
From the record of its tumultuous history, almost every page of which
portrays a fresh crisis, is laden with the description of a new
calamity, recounts the tale of a base betrayal, and is stained with
the account of unspeakable atrocities, there emerges, clear and
incontrovertible, the supreme truth that with every fresh outbreak of
hostility to the Faith, whether from within or from without, a
corresponding measure of outpouring grace, sustaining its defenders
and confounding its adversaries, has been providentially released,
communicating a fresh impulse to the onward march of the Faith, while
this impetus, in its turn, would, through its manifestations, provoke
fresh hostility in quarters heretofore unaware of its challenging
implications—this increased hostility being accompanied by a still
more arresting revelation of Divine Power and a more abundant
effusion of celestial grace, which, by enabling the upholders of that
Faith to register still more brilliant victories, would thereby
generate issues of still more vital import and raise up still more
formidable enemies against a Cause that cannot but in the end resolve
those issues and crush the resistance of those enemies, through a
still more glorious unfoldment of its inherent power.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p11"></a>
The resistless march of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, viewed in
this light, and propelled by the stimulating influences which the
unwisdom of its enemies and the force latent within itself both
engender, resolves itself into a series of rhythmic pulsations,
precipitated, on the one hand, through the explosive outbursts of its
foes, and the vibrations of Divine Power, on the other, which speed
it, with ever-increasing momentum, along that predestined course
traced for it by the Hand of the Almighty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p12"></a>
As opposition to the Faith, from whatever source it may spring,
whatever form it may assume, however violent its outbursts, is
admittedly the motive-power that galvanizes, on the one hand, the
souls of its valiant defenders, and taps for them, on the other,
fresh springs of that Divine and inexhaustible Energy, we, who are
called upon to represent, defend, and promote its interests, should,
far from regarding any manifestation of hostility as an evidence of
the weakening of the pillars of the Faith, acclaim it as both a
God-sent gift and a God-sent opportunity which, if we remain
undaunted, we can utilize for the furtherance of His Faith and the
routing and complete elimination of its adversaries.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p13"></a>
The Heroic Age of the Faith, born in anguish, nursed in adversity,
and terminating in trials as woeful as those that greeted its birth,
has been succeeded by that Formative Period which is to witness the
gradual crystallization of those creative energies which the Faith
has released, and the consequent emergence of that World Order for
which those forces were made to operate.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p14"></a>
Fierce and relentless will be the opposition which this
crystallization and emergence must provoke. The alarm it must and
will awaken, the envy it will certainly arouse, the
misrepresentations to which it will remorselessly be subjected, the
setbacks it must, sooner or later, sustain, the commotions to which
it must eventually give rise, the fruits it must in the end garner,
the blessings it must inevitably bestow and the glorious, the Golden
Age it must irresistibly usher in, are just beginning to be faintly
perceived, and will, as the old Order crumbles beneath the weight of
so stupendous a Revelation, become increasingly apparent and
arresting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-85-p15"></a>
Not ours, dear friends, to attempt to survey the distant scene; ours
rather the duty to face the trials of the present hour, to ponder its
meaning, to discharge its obligations, to meet its challenge, and
utilize the opportunity it offers to the fullest extent of our
ability and power.</p>

The entry of the United States of America into the war invests it
with the character of a truly world-embracing crisis, designed to
release world-shaking, world-shaping forces, which, as they operate,
and mount in intensity, will throw down the barriers that hinder the
emergence of that world community which the world Religion of
Bahá’u’lláh has anticipated and can alone permanently
establish. It marks a milestone on the road which must lead the
peoples of the North American continent to the glorious destiny that
awaits them. It confronts the American Bahá’í community, already
so well advanced in the prosecution of their Seven Year Plan, with a
challenge at once severe and inescapable. The exterior ornamentation
of their consecrated Edifice has been providentially expedited to a
point where its completion is now assured. The intercontinental and
national teaching campaigns that constitute the second and even more
vital aspect of that Plan, though progressing magnificently in the
States, in Canada and throughout Latin America, are still far from
having attained their consummation. The obstacles which the extension
of the war to the Western Hemisphere has raised are, I am well aware,
manifold and formidable. The heroic self-sacrifice exhibited by the
North American Bahá’í community will, I am confident, surmount
them. The Hand of Omnipotence, which has led so mighty a member of
the human race to plunge into the turmoil of world disaster, that has
provided thereby the means for the effective and decisive
participation of so promising a nation in the immediate trials and
the future reconstruction of human society, will not and cannot allow
those who are directly, consciously and worthily promoting the
highest interests of their nation and of the world to fall short of
the accomplishment of their God-given task. He will, more than ever
before in their history, pour out His blessings upon them, if they
refuse to allow the present circumstances, grievous though they are,
to interfere with the full and uninterrupted execution of this
initial undertaking in pursuance of their world Mission. The coming
two years must witness, fraught as they may well be with the greatest
ordeal afflicting their countrymen, a manifestation of spiritual
vitality and an output of heroic action, commensurate with the
gravity and afflictions of the present hour, and worthy of the
concluding years of the first Bahá’í century.</p>

Viewed in the perspective of Bahá’í history, the Seven Year Plan,
associated with the closing years of the First Bahá’í Century,
will come to be regarded as the mightiest instrument yet forged,
designed to enable the trustees of a firmly established, steadily
evolving Administrative Order to complete the initial stage in the
prosecution of the world mission confidently entrusted by the Center
of the Covenant to His chosen disciples. The Divine Plan, thus set in
operation, may be said to have derived its inspiration from, and been
dimly foreshadowed in, the injunction so significantly addressed by
Bahá’u’lláh to the Chief Magistrates of the American continent.
It was prompted by the contact established by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
Himself, in the course of His historic journey, with the entire body
of His followers throughout the United States and Canada. It was
conceived, soon after that contact was established, in the midst of
what was then held to be one of the most devastating crises in human
history. It underwent a period of incubation, after His ascension,
while the machinery of a divinely appointed Administrative Order was
being laboriously devised and its processes set in motion. Its
initial operations were providentially made to synchronize with the
final years of a century that witnessed the birth and rise of a Faith
of which it is the direct consequence. The opening stage in its
execution has been faced by, and will survive, the severe challenge
of a crisis of still greater magnitude than that which baptized its
birth. The conclusion of the first phase of its tremendous and
irresistible unfoldment is now approaching. The hopes and aspirations
of a multitude of believers, in both the East and the West, young and
old, whether free or suppressed, hang on its triumphant consummation.
The Temple itself, that fair incarnation of the soul of an
unconquerable Faith, and the first fruit of the Plan now set in
motion, stands, in its silent beauty, ready to reinforce the
strenuous endeavors of its prosecutors. Towering in grandeur and
resplendent in its majesty it calls aloud incessantly for a greater,
a far greater, number of pioneers who, both at home and in foreign
fields, will scatter to sow the Divine seeds and gather the harvest
into its gates. The Author of the Plan Himself, looking down from His
retreats above, and surveying the prodigious labors of His defeatless
disciples, voices, with even greater insistence, the same call. The
time in which to respond to it is relentlessly shortening. Let men of
action seize their chance ere the swiftly passing days place it
irretrievably beyond their reach.</p>

The completion of the Temple should, and I feel confident will,
release tremendous and unprecedented forces of spiritual energy
destined to be wholly consecrated to the teaching tasks now
confronting the American believers. The concentrated, the sustained,
and undivided attention of the individual believers and all Bahá’í
agencies, local, regional, as well as national, should be directed to
the attainment of this supreme, this shining goal. The increase in
the number of pioneers, of every class, race, age and outlook, is the
vital need of the present hour. May the Beloved bless richly and

I am thrilled with admiration as I contemplate, at this advanced
stage in the unfoldment of the Seven Year Plan, the vastness of the
field already covered by the pioneer activities of its stalwart and
valiant prosecutors. The heights of heroic self-sacrifice to which
they have attained, the depths of faith and devotion they have
plumbed in the course of their ceaseless exertions are no less
noteworthy than the immensity of the task they have already
performed. An effort so prodigious, a mission so sublime, a
solidarity so truly remarkable, an achievement which in its scope and
quality stands unparalleled in American Bahá’í history, provide a
befitting climax to the century-old record of magnificent
accomplishments associated with the rise and progress of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh. Such a glorious century, so unique in the annals
of mankind’s spiritual history, is, however, not yet completed. The
gigantic enterprises which the American believers are pledged to
consummate are as yet but partially concluded. The remaining two
years must witness an intensification of Bahá’í activity,
throughout the entire Western Hemisphere, on such a scale as to
eclipse the splendor of all past achievements, and worthily crown
this initial phase in the progressive evolution of the Divine Plan.
An unprecedented multiplication in the number of pioneer teachers and
settlers; an unexampled flow of material resources for their
maintenance and the extension of their labors; a still wider
dissemination of Bahá’í literature, to aid and support them in
their presentation of the Faith to Latin American peoples; an
immediate increase in the number of groups and Assemblies in the
states and provinces of North America; an increased awareness on the
part of all believers, whether in the North or in the South, whether
newly enrolled or of old standing in the Faith, that every one of
them shares, vitally and directly and without any exception, in the
responsibility for the successful prosecution of the Plan; a still
firmer resolution not to allow a world-convulsing conflict, with its
attendant miseries, perils, dislocations, and anxieties, to deflect
them from their course or distract their attention—these are the
crying needs of this critical, this challenging, this swiftly passing
hour. To exploit its possibilities, to meet its challenge, to grasp
its implications, is the manifest, the inescapable and urgent duty of
every member of the Bahá’í communities now laboring so
assiduously in the Western Hemisphere. May the cumulative effect of
their concentrated and sustained labors shed further luster on the
concluding years of this, the first century of the Bahá’í Era.</p>

The recent response of the American friends to my appeal for pioneers
to go forth and settle in virgin territories and places where the
need is greatest has raised a load from my heart, and mightily
reinforced the hopes and expectations which their past achievements
have aroused within me. We stand at the threshold of the last year of
the first Bahá’í century. The unfinished tasks, however much they
have been reduced, are still formidable. The Temple is as yet
unfinished. The initiation of a nationwide publicity campaign,
intelligently directed and energetically pursued, utilizing to the
full the advantages gained in recent years in so many fields of
Bahá’í activity still remains to be undertaken. Measures for a
befitting celebration of the centennial anniversary of the Faith must
be carefully considered and duly executed. The aims and purposes of
our beloved Cause, the achievements of its heroes, martyrs, teachers,
pioneers, and administrators, the unity of its followers, the
character of the institutions they have reared, should, one and all,
be ably presented, widely broadcast, carefully explained in
publications, through the radio and the press. There is no time to
lose. A great responsibility rests on the elected representatives of
the most envied community in the Bahá’í world, whose advantages
are unique, whose capacities are incomparable, whose vision, courage,
tenacity, resolution and loyalty are exemplary, and which has amply
demonstrated its worthiness to be the recipient of the countless
favors showered upon it by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and of the specific
bounty conferred upon the rulers and presidents of the continent of
which it is a part by no one less than Bahá’u’lláh Himself, in
His Most Holy Book. To His “Apostles,” as testified by the Center
of His Covenant, I direct my fervent plea that they establish, beyond
the shadow of a doubt in these concluding months of the first Bahá’í
century, their indisputable right to be designated by so exalted a
title, and vindicate their ability to execute the mission with which
that title has invested them.</p>

The completion of the exterior ornamentation of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár
in Wilmette, the most hallowed Temple ever to be erected by the
followers of Bahá’u’lláh and the crowning glory of the first
Bahá’í century, is an event of unique and transcendental
significance. Neither the first Mashriqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the
Bahá’í world, reared in the City of ‘I<u>sh</u>qábád, nor any
House of Worship to be raised in succeeding centuries, can claim to
possess the vast, the immeasurable potentialities with which this
Mother Temple of the West, established in the very heart of so
enviable a continent, and whose foundation stone has been laid by the
hand of the Center of the Covenant Himself, has been endowed.
Conceived forty years ago by that little band of far-sighted and
resolute disciples of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, members of the first Bahá’í
community established in the Western Hemisphere; blessed and fostered
by a vigilant Master Who directed its course from the hour of its
inception to the last days of His life; supported by the spontaneous
contributions of Bahá’ís poured in from the five continents of
the globe; this noble, this mighty, this magnificent enterprise
deserves to rank among the immortal epics that have adorned the
annals of the Apostolic Age of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-108-p2"></a>
The debt of gratitude owed by the entire Bahá’í world to its
champion builders is indeed immeasurable. The admiration which this
brilliant exploit has evoked in the breasts of countless followers of
the Faith in East and West knows no bounds. The creative energies its
completion must unleash are incalculable. The role it is destined to
play in hastening the emergence of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh,
now stirring in the womb of this travailing age, cannot as yet be
fathomed. We stand too close to so majestic, so lofty, so radiant, so
symbolic a monument raised so heroically to the glory of the Most
Great Name, at so critical a stage in human history, and at so
significant a spot in a continent so richly endowed, to be able to
visualize the future glories which the consummation of this
institution, this Harbinger of an as yet unborn civilization, must in
the fullness of time disclose to the eyes of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-108-p3"></a>
That so laborious, so meritorious, an undertaking has been completed
a year before its appointed time is a further cause for rejoicing and
gratitude and an added testimony to the vision, the resourcefulness,
and enterprising spirit of the American believers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-108-p4"></a>
No need, however, to dwell at length on their past achievements,
remarkable and exemplary though they have been, nor is this the time
to expatiate on the superb spirit that has characterized their
stewardship in the service of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Tasks,
of extreme urgency, of great magnitude, of the utmost significance,
await them in this concluding year of the first Bahá’í century,
and at this hour of great peril, of stress and trial for all mankind.
The sacred, the pressing, the inescapable teaching responsibilities,
assumed under the Seven Year Plan, must be resolutely faced as befits
those whose record has shed so brilliant a light on the annals of the
first Bahá’í century. The consolidation of each and every
nucleus, formed so painstakingly in every Republic of Central and
South America, the formation of a Bahá’í Assembly in every virgin
state and province in the North American continent, call for
undivided attention, for further heroism, for a concerted, a
persistent, and herculean effort on the part of the stalwart builders
of that beauteous Edifice which posterity will recognize as the
greatest shrine in the Western world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-108-p5"></a>
Nor must the elaborate preparations in connection with the
forthcoming celebration of the centenary of our glorious Faith be
overlooked or neglected, if we would befittingly consummate this
first, this most fecund, century of the Bahá’í Era. An
unprecedented, a carefully conceived, efficiently coordinated,
nationwide campaign, aiming at the proclamation of the message of
Bahá’u’lláh, through speeches, articles in the press, and radio
broadcasts, should be promptly initiated and vigorously prosecuted.
The universality of the Faith, its aims and purposes, episodes in its
dramatic history, testimonials to its transforming power, and the
character and distinguishing features of its World Order should be
emphasized and explained to the general public, and particularly to
eminent friends and leaders sympathetic to its cause, who should be
approached and invited to participate in the celebrations. Lectures,
conferences, banquets, special publications should, to whatever
extent is practicable and according to the resources at the disposal
of the believers, proclaim the character of this joyous Festival. An
All-America Convention, at which representatives of Bahá’í
centers in every republic in Central and South America will be
invited to participate and, to which, for the first time, all
isolated believers, all groups, and all communities already
possessing Local Spiritual Assemblies, will have the right to appoint
delegates and to share in the election of the National Spiritual
Assembly, will moreover have to be held to commemorate this
epoch-making event. A dedication ceremony, in consonance with the
solemnity of the occasion, and held beneath the dome of the
Mashriqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár on the very day and at the very hour of
the Báb’s historic Declaration, followed by a public session,
consecrated to the memory of both the Báb and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
should constitute the leading features of this historic Convention.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-108-p6"></a>
For it should be borne in mind that in the year 1944 we celebrate not
only the termination of the first century of the Bahá’í Era, but
also the centenary of the birth of the Bábí Dispensation, of the
inception of the Bahá’í cycle, and of the birth of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and commemorate as well the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment
of the Bahá’í Faith in the western world.<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-63"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-108-p7"></a>
No effort nor any sacrifice can be deemed too great to ensure the
decisive, the brilliant success of the celebrations which this
historic year, of such manifold significance, must witness. He Who in
the past has, in divers ways and on so many occasions, graciously and
unfailingly guided, blessed, and sustained the members of this
privileged community will, no doubt, continue to aid and inspire them
to carry to a victorious conclusion the unfinished tasks which still
confront them, and will enable them to crown their labors in a manner
that will befit their high destiny.</p>

The latest evidences of the magnificent success that has marked the
activities of the members of the American Bahá’í community have
been such as to excite the brightest hopes for the victorious
consummation of the collective undertaking they have so courageously
launched and have so vigorously prosecuted in recent years. As the
first Bahá’í Century approaches its end, the magnitude and
quality of their achievements acquire added significance and shed
increasing luster on its annals. The proceedings of the recently held
annual Convention; the formation of twenty-eight Assemblies in the
course of the year that has just elapsed; the splendid progress
achieved in the inter-American field of Bahá’í activity; the
superb spirit evinced by the pioneers holding their lonely posts in
widely scattered areas throughout the Americas; the exemplary
attitude shown by the entire body of the faithful towards the
machinations of those who have so sedulously striven to disrupt the
Faith and pervert its purpose—these have, to a marked degree,
intensified the admiration of the Bahá’í communities for those
who are contributing so outstanding a share to the enlargement of the
limits, and the enhancement of the prestige of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh. The preparations which the American believers are
undertaking for the celebration of the Centenary of the Faith must be
such as to crown with immortal glory the fifty-year-long record of
their stewardship in the service of that Faith. Such a celebration
must, in its scope and magnificence, fully compensate for the
disabilities which hinder so many Bahá’í communities in Europe
and elsewhere, and even in Bahá’u’lláh’s native land, from
paying a befitting tribute to their beloved Faith at so glorious an
hour in its history. The few remaining months of this century must
witness a concentration of effort, a scale of achievement, a spirit
of heroism that will outshine even the most daring exploits that have
already immortalized the Seven Year Plan and covered with glory its
valiant prosecutors. The plea I address to them, at this late hour,
will, I am sure, meet with a response no less remarkable than their
past reactions to the appeals I have felt impelled to make to them
ever since the inception of the Plan. He Who at every stage of their
collective enterprise has so abundantly blessed them will, no doubt,
continue to vouchsafe His blessings until the seal of unqualified
victory is set upon their epoch-making task.</p>

The vigorous action promptly taken by your Assembly to ensure the
success of the forthcoming Centenary celebrations is highly
commendable, and provides a fresh demonstration of the magnificent
response made by the American believers to every call demanding
renewed exertion on their part in the service of the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh. The progress recently achieved in building up
Spiritual Assemblies in the virgin areas of the North American
continent has been truly remarkable. To consummate so vast an
enterprise, however, a still more compelling display of the vitality
of the spirit animating the American Bahá’í community is
required, a still greater concentration of effort is needed, an even
more stirring evidence of the daring boldness of its members is
imperative. Whoever will arise, in these concluding, fast-fleeting
months of the last year of the first Bahá’í Century, to fill the
remaining posts, and thereby set the seal of total victory on a Plan
so pregnant with promise, will earn the lasting gratitude of the
present generation of believers in both the East and the West, will
merit the acclaim of posterity, will be vouchsafed the special
benediction of the Concourse on High, and be made the recipient of
the imperishable bounties of Him Who is the Divine Author of the Plan
itself. Whoever will rush forth, at this eleventh hour, and cast his
weight into the scales, and contribute his decisive share to so
gigantic, so sacred and historic an undertaking, will have not only
helped to seal the triumph of the Plan itself but will also have
notably participated in the fulfillment of what may be regarded as
the crowning act of an entire century. The opportunity that presents
itself at this crucial hour is precious beyond expression. The
blessings destined to flow from a victory so near at hand are rich
beyond example. One final surge of that indomitable spirit that has
carried the American Bahá’í community to such heights is all that
is required, as the first Bahá’í Century speeds to a close, to
release the flow of those blessings that must signalize the
termination of the first, and usher in the dawn of the second, Bahá’í
Century.</p>

The one remaining, and indeed the most challenging, task confronting
the American Bahá’í Community has at long last been brilliantly
accomplished. The structural basis of the Administrative Order of the
Faith of Bahá’u’lláh has, through this superb victory, and on
the very eve of the worldwide celebrations of the Centenary of His
Faith, been firmly laid by the champion-builders of His World Order
in every state of the Great Republic of the West and in every
province of the Dominion of Canada. In each of the republics of
Central and South America, moreover, the banner of His undefeatable
Faith has been implanted by the members of that same community, while
in no less than thirteen republics of Latin America, as well as in
two dependencies in the West Indies, Spiritual Assemblies have been
established and are already functioning—a feat that has outstripped
the goal originally fixed for the valiant members of that community
in their intercontinental sphere of Bahá’í activity. The exterior
ornamentation of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the
West—the culmination of a forty-year-old enterprise repeatedly
blessed and continually nurtured by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá—has,
furthermore, through a remarkable manifestation of the spirit of
Bahá’í solidarity and self-sacrifice so powerfully animating the
members of that stalwart community, been successfully completed, more
than a year in advance of the time set for its termination.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-125-p2"></a>
The triple task undertaken with such courage, confidence, zeal and
determination—a task which ever since the inception of the Seven
Year Plan has challenged and galvanized into action the entire body
of the American believers and for the efficient prosecution of which
the processes of a divinely appointed Administrative Order had,
during no less than sixteen years, been steadily evolving—is now
finally accomplished and crowned with total victory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-125-p3"></a>
The greatest collective enterprise ever launched by the Western
followers of Bahá’u’lláh, and indeed ever undertaken by any
Bahá’í community in the course of an entire century, has been
gloriously consummated. A victory of undying fame has marked the
culmination of the fifty-year-long labors of the American Bahá’í
Community in the service of Bahá’u’lláh and has shed
imperishable luster on the immortal records of His Faith during the
first hundred years of its existence. The exploits that have marked
the progress of this prodigious, this threefold enterprise, covering
a field stretching from Alaska in the North to the extremity of Chile
in the South, affecting the destinies of so great a variety of
peoples and nations, involving such a tremendous expenditure of
treasure and effort, calling forth so remarkable a spirit of heroism
and self-sacrifice, and undertaken notwithstanding the vicious
assaults and incessant machinations of the breakers of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Covenant, and despite the perils, the trials and restrictions of a
desolating war of unexampled severity, augur well for the successful
prosecution, and indeed assure the ultimate victory, of the remaining
stages of the Plan conceived a quarter of a century ago by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in the North
American continent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-125-p4"></a>
To the band of pioneers, whether settlers or itinerant teachers, who
have forsaken their homes, who have scattered far and wide, who have
willingly sacrificed their comfort, their health and even their lives
for the prosecution of this Plan; to the several committees and their
auxiliary agencies that have been entrusted with special and direct
responsibility for its efficient and orderly development and who have
discharged their high responsibilities with exemplary vigor, courage
and fidelity; to the national representatives of the community
itself, who have vigilantly and tirelessly supervised, directed and
coordinated the unfolding processes of this vast undertaking ever
since its inception; to all those who, though not in the forefront of
battle, have, through their financial assistance and through the
instrumentality of their deputies, contributed to the expansion and
consolidation of the Plan, I myself, as well as the entire Bahá’í
world, owe a debt of gratitude that no one can measure or describe.
To the sacrifices they have made, to the courage they have so
consistently shown, to the fidelity they have so remarkably
displayed, to the resourcefulness, the discipline, the constancy and
devotion they have so abundantly demonstrated future generations,
viewing the magnitude of their labors in their proper perspective,
will no doubt pay adequate tribute—a tribute no less ardent and
well-deserved than the recognition extended by the present-day
builders of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh to the
Dawn-Breakers, whose shining deeds have signalized the birth of the
Heroic Age of His Faith.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-125-p5"></a>
To the elected representatives of all the Bahá’í communities of
the New World, assembled beneath the Dome of the Mother Temple of the
West, on the occasion of the historic, first All-America Bahá’í
Convention—a convention at which every state and province in the
North American continent is represented, in which the representatives
of every republic of Latin America have been invited to participate,
whose delegates have been elected, for the first time in American
Bahá’í history, by all local communities already possessing
Assemblies, by all groups and isolated believers throughout the
United States and Canada, and whose proceedings will be for ever
associated with the celebration of the Centenary of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh, of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the
Bahá’í Faith in the Western Hemisphere, and of the completion of
the exterior ornamentation of the First Mashriqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár
of the West—to all the privileged attendants of such an
epoch-making Convention, I, on my own behalf, as well as in the name
of all Bahá’í communities sharing with them, at this great
turning-point in the history of our Faith, the joys and triumphs of
this solemn hour, feel moved to convey the expression of our loving
admiration, our joy and our gratitude for the brilliant conclusion of
what posterity will no doubt acclaim as one of the most stirring
episodes in the history of the Formative Age of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh, as well as one of the most momentous enterprises
undertaken during the entire course of the first century of the
Bahá’í Era.</p>

The splendid and unique success that has attended the centenary
celebrations so admirably conducted by the American Bahá’í
community has befittingly crowned not only the fifty-year record of
services rendered by its valiant members, but the labors associated
with the entire body of their fellow workers in East and West in the
course of an entire century. The consummation of the Seven Year Plan,
immortalizing the fame of this richly blessed community, set the seal
of complete spiritual triumph on these historic celebrations. A
memorable chapter in the history of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in
the West has been closed. A new chapter is now opening, a chapter
which, ere its termination, must eclipse the most shining victories
won so heroically by those who have so fearlessly launched the first
stage of the Great Plan conceived by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the
American believers. The prizes won so painstakingly in both the North
and South American continents must be preserved at all costs. A
mighty impetus should, at however great a sacrifice, be lent to the
multiplication of Bahá’í centers in Latin America, to the
expansion of Bahá’í literature, to the translation of the Bahá’í
sacred writings, to the proclamation of the verities of the Faith to
the masses, to the strengthening of the bonds binding the newly
fledged communities to each other, and to the deepening of the
spiritual life of their members.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-131-p2"></a>
The task so marvelously initiated in the Latin republics must be
further consolidated ere the prosecutors of the world Plan bequeathed
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá can embark on further stages, of still greater
significance, in their world teaching Mission. The cessation of
hostilities will open before them fields of service of tremendous
fertility and undreamed of magnitude. The advantages and
opportunities these fields will offer them cannot be exploited unless
and until the work to which they have already set their hands in the
Western Hemisphere is sufficiently advanced and consolidated. Time is
pressing. The new tasks are already beginning to loom on the horizon.
The work that still remains to be accomplished ere the next stage is
ushered in is still considerable and exacting. I feel confident that
the American Bahá’í community will, as it has in the past, rise
to the occasion and discharge its high duties as befits the unique
position it occupies.</p>

world-embracing Faith and the swiftly ebbing fortunes of a
war-ravaged, disillusioned and bankrupt society, is drawing to a
close. In every continent of the globe; in the Holy Land, the Heart
and Center of our Faith and Pivot of its institutions; in the land of
its birth; in the adjoining territory of ‘Iráq; throughout the
Western Hemisphere; in the British Isles, so severely subjected to
the violence of a world tempest; throughout the length and breadth of
India; in far-off Australasia and in the Nile Valley—all with the
sole exception of the distant republics of the West subjected in
varying degrees to the imminent danger of becoming the theater of
war—the communities laboring for the promotion of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh have, throughout five tumultuous years, been
providentially spared to hold aloft its banner, to preserve its
integrity, to maintain the continuity of its institutions, to enrich
its annals, to consolidate its structure, to further disseminate its
literature and to befittingly celebrate its Centenary. Preponderant
indeed has been the share of that privileged community, which has
been invested by the Pen of the Center of the Covenant with a
worldwide Mission, in the prosecution of a task which, ever since the
onset of this world upheaval and despite its mounting horrors, the
builders of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
have so unflaggingly pursued. Neither the participation of the Great
Republic of the West in this fierce contest, nor the sorrows, burdens
and restrictions which such direct association with the agonies of a
travailing age has entailed have thus far been capable of dimming the
splendor of the exploits that have immortalized the record of the
services of this community since the ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Indeed, coincident with the period of America’s direct
participation in this world struggle and in direct proportion to the
turmoil and the tribulations which such a participation has
engendered, the members of this community have evinced a heroism and
proved themselves capable of a concerted effort that have eclipsed
the notable achievements that have heralded the establishment of the
Administrative Order of the Faith as well as the first stage in the
development of the Seven Year Plan.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-135-p2"></a>
What the year 1945, on whose threshold we now stand, has in store for
the members of this determined, this valiant, this watchful, this
exemplary community only the future can reveal. That the trials and
afflictions suffered by their country and its people must wax as this
world upheaval moves towards a climax no one can any longer doubt.
The challenge that will face this stalwart community will no doubt be
severe. To allow the prizes so nobly won, over so vast a field, at so
great a cost, at so critical an hour, to fall into jeopardy would be
unworthy of a career so auspiciously initiated, so completely
dedicated to the Cause of God, so rich in promise and so brilliant in
almost every phase of its evolution. Every Local Assembly, the
ordained pivot of a divinely ordained System, which has been
established in the states and provinces of the North American
continent, as well as in the republics of Latin America, must,
through a supreme effort on the part of pioneers, visiting teachers
and Regional Committees, be steadfastly maintained. Simultaneously a
no less determined effort should be exerted to enable the admittedly
large number of groups scattered throughout the Americas to attain
Assembly status. No less urgent is the obligation to proclaim the
verities enshrined in the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh by every means
which individuals, Assemblies and committees can devise, through the
press and radio, through an unprecedented dissemination of
literature, through its systematic translation into Spanish and
Portuguese and above all through active association with leaders of
public thought as well as direct contact with the masses of the
people. Through such means as these, and through such means only, can
the members of the American Bahá’í community, who have so
audaciously and successfully launched the first stage of the Divine
Plan, be enabled to pave the way and usher in, soon after the
cessation of hostilities, the succeeding stage in the evolution of
their world Mission. My prayers and loving thoughts surround them
continually in their devoted labors.</p>

The Divine Plan conceived by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the American
Bahá’í community, in the midst of one of the darkest periods in
human history, and with which the destinies of the followers of
Bahá’u’lláh in the North American continent must for
generations to come remain inextricably interwoven, has, during the
concluding years of the first Bahá’í century, triumphantly
emerged from the first stage of its evolution. Its initiation,
officially and on a vast scale, had, for well-nigh twenty years, been
held in abeyance, while the processes of a slowly emerging
Administrative Order were, under the unerring guidance of Providence,
creating and perfecting the agencies for its efficient and systematic
prosecution. The next stage in the evolution of the Plan cannot,
however, be embarked upon, until the external causes, hampering its
further unfoldment in other continents of the globe, are removed
through the cessation of hostilities, and the signal victories
already won through its initial development are sufficiently
consolidated throughout the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-140-p2"></a>
The tasks confronting those who have so valiantly and brilliantly
inaugurated the first stage in the execution of the Great Design
unfolded by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the promulgation of the Faith of
His Father, during this transitional period, are manifold, exacting,
urgent and sacred. The local administrative units, so laboriously
constituted throughout the Americas, must needs, as already pointed
out and repeatedly stressed, be maintained, reinforced, closely
integrated and their number steadily multiplied. The spirit that has
inflamed the pioneers who have set the seal of triumph on the Seven
Year Plan, must, under the vigilant care of the national
representatives of the American Bahá’í community, be constantly
watched, kept alive and nourished. The literature of the Faith,
particularly in Spanish and Portuguese, must be widely disseminated
in both Central and South America, as a necessary adjunct to the
systematic consolidation of the work that has been undertaken. Above
all, the healing Message of Bahá’u’lláh must, during the
opening years of the second Bahá’í century, and through the
instrumentality of an already properly functioning Administrative
Order, whose ramifications have been extended to the four corners of
the Western Hemisphere, be vividly, systematically brought to the
attention of the masses, in their hour of grief, misery and
confusion. A more audacious assertion of the challenging verities of
the Faith; a more convincing presentation of its distinguishing
truths; a fuller exposition of the character, the aims, and the
achievements of its rising Administrative system, as the nucleus and
pattern of its future world-embracing order; a more direct and
intimate contact and association with the leaders of public thought
whose activities and aims are akin to the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh,
for the purpose of demonstrating the universality, the
comprehensiveness, the liberality and the dynamic power of His Divine
Message; a closer scrutiny of the ways and means whereby its claims
can be vindicated, its defamers and detractors silenced, and its
institutions safeguarded; a more determined effort to exploit, to the
fullest extent possible, the talents and abilities of the rank and
file of the believers for the purpose of achieving these ends—these
stand out as the paramount tasks summoning to a challenge, during
these years of transition and turmoil, the entire body of the
American believers. The facilities which the Radio and Press furnish
must be utilized to a degree unprecedented in American Bahá’í
history. The combined resources of the much-envied, exemplary
American Bahá’í community must be harnessed for the effectual
promotion of these meritorious purposes. Blessings, undreamt of in
their scope and plenteousness, are bound to be vouchsafed to those
who will, in these dark yet pregnant times, arise, to further these
noble ends, and to hasten through their acts the hour at which a
still more momentous stage in the evolution of a Divine and worldwide
Plan can be launched.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-140-p3"></a>
There is no time to lose. The hour is ripe for the proclamation,
without fear, without reserve, and without hesitation, and on a scale
never as yet undertaken, of the One Message that can alone extricate
humanity from the morass into which it is steadily sinking, and from
which they who claim to be the followers of the Most Great Name can
and will eventually rescue it. The sooner they who labor for the
recognition and triumph of His Faith in the New World arise to carry
out these inescapable duties, the sooner will the hopes, the aims and
objectives of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as enshrined in His own Plan, be
translated from the realm of vision to the plane of actuality and
manifest the full force of the potentialities with which they have
been endowed.</p>

The cessation of hostilities on the continent of Europe, the prospect
of an early termination of the bloody conflict raging in the Far
East, invest the members of the world Bahá’í community, and
particularly its standard-bearers in the great Republic of the West,
with a great, a unique, and inescapable responsibility. The first
stage of the mission laid upon them by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the
inauguration of which has been so long retarded while the processes
of a slowly emerging Administrative Order were being set in motion,
and which coincided with one of the darkest and most tragic periods
in human history, has been brought to a triumphant conclusion, and
added a golden page to the annals of the closing years of the first
Bahá’í century.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-146-p2"></a>
As a new phase in the painful evolution of a sorely tried and wayward
humanity opens, a new challenge summons the prosecutors of a Divine
Plan to gird up their loins, muster their resources, and prepare
themselves for the launching of the second stage of an enterprise
which, as it reveals its full potentialities, must stretch to embrace
the five continents of the globe. World turmoil, grave dangers,
severe restrictions, the lethargy of the public engrossed in its war
problems, have failed to dampen the zeal, or to undermine the
resolve, or to interfere with the successful discharge of the duty
assumed by those who have so determinedly embarked on the opening
stage of their world-encircling, divinely appointed mission. With the
return to more normal conditions, with the improvement of the means
of travel and communication, with the lifting of the deadening weight
of fear and care and the growing receptivity of the masses, schooled
in adversity and groping for the means of ultimate salvation,
opportunities without number and unprecedented in their significance
present themselves to those whose privilege and obligation it is to
pave the way for the launching of the succeeding stage of their
historic and ever-unfolding task.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-146-p3"></a>
Not until, however, normal conditions are fully restored and the
world situation is stabilized, and, above all, the prizes won through
the operation of the Seven Year Plan are adequately safeguarded and
the basis of the newly established Administrative Order sufficiently
consolidated throughout the Western Hemisphere, can the ambassadors
of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, carrying aloft the banner of His
Name in the American continent, be called upon to undertake, unitedly

Order, amidst the sorrow-stricken, war-lacerated, sorely bewildered
nations and peoples of the European continent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-146-p4"></a>
The sooner the home tasks are fully discharged, and the newly fledged
Assemblies in Central and South America enabled to function
adequately and vigorously, the sooner will the stalwart members of
the American Bahá’í community, who, during so brief a period, and
despite the prevailing darkness, achieved such wonders throughout the
Americas, extend the healing influence of their Faith, on a scale as
yet unprecedented, to the waiting masses of that agitated continent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-146-p5"></a>
As already observed, an intensification of effort is imperatively
required, aiming at a bolder proclamation of the verities of a
God-given Faith, at a systematic and continent-wide dissemination of
its authentic literature, at a closer contact with the masses as well
as the leaders of public thought, at a further consolidation and
multiplication of the administrative centers scattered throughout the
New World, and constituting the nuclei of its future World Order and
above all at a more convincing revelation of Bahá’í love, unity,
solidarity and self-sacrifice, which alone can hasten the
consummation of the preliminary undertakings required to terminate
the period of transition intervening between the first and second
stages of the greatest crusade ever launched in the history of the
Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-146-p6"></a>
Time is pressing, the work that still remains to be accomplished in
the New World is vast and urgent, the need of the suffering masses
the world over, and particularly in Europe, is pitiable, the
sustaining grace destined to be vouchsafed from on high to those who
will arise to achieve that task and fulfill this need is boundless
and assured. Its potency has been already fully experienced and
abundantly demonstrated in the years that have witnessed the most
prodigious efforts exerted by the American believers. A still more
powerful display of its miraculous force can be confidently
anticipated, if those who have felt its impact in the past arise to
carry out, in the years that lie immediately ahead, the sublime and
twofold task of the redemption of mankind and the establishment of
the world sovereignty of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>

The reports recently received from various sources, regarding the sad
conditions prevailing among the members of the sorely stricken,
long-suffering Bahá’í communities in Germany and Burma, are of
such a distressing nature as to merit the energetic, the immediate,
and collective intervention of their fellow workers in lands which
have providentially been spared the horrors of invasion and all the
evils and miseries attendant upon it.<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>
Upon the American Bahá’í community, in particular, which
throughout this prolonged and bloody conflict has, of all its sister
communities in East and West, enjoyed the greatest immunity and been
privileged not only to maintain and preserve its institutions, but to
prosecute so successfully a Plan of such magnitude and significance,
a special responsibility now rests—a responsibility which, despite
its manifold and pressing duties in the Western Hemisphere, it can
afford neither to neglect nor ignore.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-148-p2"></a>
Particularly in the heart of the European continent, where the
present turmoil, suffering and destitution are mysteriously paving
the way for the revival of a Faith which the Beloved Himself has
unequivocally prophesied, where a once flourishing community is
struggling to fulfill the high hopes entertained for it by Him, and
where the prosecutors of the Divine Plan are to lend their direct and
systematic assistance when launching the second stage of their world
mission, must the American believers contribute the major share in
the work of rehabilitation which the followers of Bahá’u’lláh
must arise to perform.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-148-p3"></a>
Through the extension of whatever financial assistance is feasible,
through the provision and distribution of adequate literature,
through the initiation of any measures, official or otherwise, which
they can undertake for the protection, reinstatement, and revival of
a greatly tested, highly promising and much loved community, the
American believers have the golden opportunity of adding a fresh
chapter to the brilliant record of their past international services
to the Cause of God.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-148-p4"></a>
Nor should the urgency of the task in faraway Burma, where a
flourishing community had furnished so shining an example of Bahá’í
fellowship and solidarity, be underestimated. The spirit which its
remnant has displayed after so many years of persecution, dispersion
and danger, merits the widest measure of encouragement and support,
both moral and financial. Pressed as the American Bahá’í
community must be by the twofold obligation of proclaiming the
verities of their Faith to the American public and of consolidating
the vast enterprises initiated throughout Latin America, the stalwart
and privileged followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in North
America cannot allow so great an opportunity to advance the vital
international interests of His Cause to slip from their grasp. I feel
confident that in the discharge of this additional task they will
exhibit those same traits that have distinguished their stewardship
for so many years to so glorious a Cause.</p>

The assistance extended by the American Bahá’í Community to the
long-suffering German believers is a further evidence of their
readiness, so abundantly demonstrated in the past, to champion the
interests, and to rehabilitate the institutions, of their sister
communities throughout the Bahá’í world. This support, so
generously extended, so consistently and faithfully offered by the
rank and file of the American believers, and particularly by their
elected national representatives, is but a subsidiary aspect of the
tremendous undertakings which, in both the North and South American
continents, the standard-bearers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
have initiated and developed, for the promotion of its interests,
during the concluding decades of the first Bahá’í century.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-153-p2"></a>
The twofold task which they have so nobly undertaken—the
proclamation of the Faith in the North American continent and the
consolidation of its nascent institutions in Latin America—must,
whatever plan is devised in the coming years for the furtherance of
their worldwide mission, be relentlessly prosecuted. That further
responsibilities, of a momentous character, will have to be
superimposed on the stalwart prosecutors of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Divine Plan, as they gird up their loins to carry a stage further
their historic labors in obedience to His Wishes, no one can for a
moment doubt. As the field of their activities, ranging over entire
continents, grows in scope and in importance, the aims and purposes
associated with the first stage of their glorious mission must, in no
wise, be either neglected or forgotten. The steady multiplication of
groups and of Spiritual Assemblies throughout the states of the Great
American Republic, the continual broadcasting of the Divine Message
to the leaders of public opinion and the masses, as well as the
establishment of the newly fledged Local Assemblies throughout Latin
America on an unassailable basis, and the dissemination of Bahá’í
literature among its people, demand, whatever the nature of the
supplementary responsibilities that will have to be assumed in the
years to come, the closest attention on the part of the entire body
of the American believers, and must continue to be regarded as the
fundamental issues facing their national representatives. The
exploits immortalizing the first stage of the Divine Plan, however
glorious their record, have yet to yield their noblest fruits.
Efforts, unremitting, systematic, and continent-wide in their scope,
can alone garner a harvest worthy of the high confidence placed in
them by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. May they prove themselves increasingly
worthy of so high a privilege, so glorious a task.</p>

The opening years of the second century of the Bahá’í Era are
witnessing the launching of yet another stage of an enterprise the
range of whose unfolding processes we can, at the present time, but
dimly visualize. However familiar we may be with its origin, however
conscious of its magnitude and bold character, however cognizant of
the signal success that has attended its initial operation, in the
Western Hemisphere, we find ourselves nevertheless incapable of
either grasping the import of its tremendous potentialities, or of
correctly appraising the significance of the present phase of its
development. Nor can we assess its reaction, as the momentum of the
mysterious forces driving it onward augments, on the fortunes of the
divers communities whose members are consciously laboring for the
achievement of purposes akin to the high aims that animate its
promoters, or estimate its impact, as its scope is further enlarged
and its fruition is accelerated, on the immediate destinies of
mankind in general.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p2"></a>
The impulse from which this historic world-embracing crusade, which,
alike in the character of its Founder and the nature of the tasks
committed to its participants, is unprecedented in religious history,
derives its creative power may be said to have in a sense originated
with the Mandate issued by the Báb in His Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, one
of His earliest and greatest works, as far back as the opening years
of the first Bahá’í century, and directed specifically to the
“peoples of the West,” to “issue forth” from their “cities”
and aid His Cause.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p3"></a>
To this initial impulse given by the Herald of our Faith, whilst
confined in the heart of faraway Asia, a still greater force was
communicated, and a more specific direction given, when the Author of
our Faith Himself, having already set foot on the fringes of the
continent of Europe, addressed, in His Kitáb-i-Aqdas, from behind
the walls of the prison-city of ‘Akká, some of the most celebrated
passages of that Book to the Chief Magistrates of the entire American
continent, bidding them “<i>bind with the hands of justice the
broken,</i>” and “<i>crush the oppressor</i>” with the “<i>rod
of the commandments</i>” of their Lord. Unlike the kings of the
earth whom He had so boldly condemned in that same Book, unlike the
European Sovereigns whom He had either rebuked, warned or denounced,
such as the French Emperor, the most powerful monarch of his time;
the Conqueror of that monarch; the Heir of the Holy Roman Empire; and
the Caliph of Islám; the Rulers of America were not only spared the
ominous and emphatic warnings which He uttered against the crowned
heads of the world, but were called upon to bring their corrective
and healing influence to bear upon the injustices perpetrated by the
tyrannical and the ungodly. To this remarkable pronouncement,
conferring such distinction upon the sovereign rulers of the Western
Hemisphere, must be added not only the passages in which the Author
of our Faith clearly foreshadows the revelation of the “<i>signs of
His dominion</i>” in the West, but also the no less significant
verbal affirmations which, according to reliable eyewitnesses, He
more than once made in regard to the glorious destiny which America
was to attain in the days to come.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p4"></a>
That same impulse was markedly accelerated when the Center of the
Covenant Himself, through a series of successive acts, chose to
disclose, to an unprecedented extent, the character of the Mission
reserved for the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in that continent,
and to delineate the tasks whereby that God-given design was to be
fulfilled. No sooner had He mounted the helm of the Faith than He
unmistakably revealed to His followers His purpose of making the
establishment of that Faith in the West, and particularly in the New
World, one of the chief objectives of His ministry. No sooner had
that great feat been accomplished than He undertook to visit those
centers which His disciples had labored to establish, and, through a
number of symbolic acts and weighty pronouncements, to pave the way
for the inauguration of the collective undertaking He was preparing
those disciples to carry out. In the Tablets of the Divine Plan,
revealed at a later stage, and in circumstances almost as critical as
those which had accompanied the inception of the Faith in the West,
and which may be designated as the Charter of the Plan with which He
was to entrust them in the evening of His life, He, in a language
still more graphic and in terms more definite than those used by
either the Báb or Bahá’u’lláh, revealed the high distinction
and the glorious work which America, and particularly the United
States and Canada, was to achieve in both the Formative and Golden
Ages of the Bahá’í Dispensation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p5"></a>
His references to the “<i>extraordinary brilliancy</i>” of the
light which His Father’s Revelation was to shed in the West; His
prediction that “<i>the West will have replaced the East</i>”
“<i>through the splendor</i>” of that Faith; His specific
prophecies regarding the future of the American continent, as the
“<i>land wherein the splendors of His light shall be revealed</i>”
and “<i>the mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled,</i>” and
which “<i>will lead all nations spiritually</i>”; His even more
specific tribute to the Great Republic of the West which He proclaims
to be “<i>worthy of being the first to build the Tabernacle of the
Most Great Peace and proclaim the oneness of mankind,</i>” to be
“<i>equipped and empowered to accomplish that which will adorn the
pages of history, to become the envy of the world, and be blest in
both the East and the West</i>”; His yet more startling words
addressed to the followers of the Faith in that Republic, referring
to them as “<i>apostles of Bahá’u’lláh,</i>” characterizing
their mission as “<i>unspeakably glorious,</i>” and assuring them
that “<i>should success crown your enterprise … the throne of the
Kingdom of God will, in the plenitude of its majesty and glory, be
firmly established</i>”; and finally, His soul-stirring assertion
that “<i>the moment this Divine Message is carried forward by the
American believers from the shores of America, and is propagated
through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of
Australasia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community
will find itself securely established upon the throne of an
everlasting dominion,</i>” and that “<i>the whole earth</i>”
will “<i>resound with the praises of its majesty and greatness</i>”—all
these, in conjunction with the explicit and detailed instructions
embodied in His Tablets, in connection with the execution of their
mission, may be regarded as having fixed the pattern, and revealed a
measure of the glory, of the Plan itself, which, after His ascension,
was to be collectively and formally prosecuted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p6"></a>
The creation of the administrative machinery of the Faith, according
to the precepts laid down in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and
Testament, and on which, during the opening years of its Formative
Age, the resources and attention of the trustees of the Plan were
chiefly concentrated, provided, after several years of assiduous
labor, the agencies for its proper and systematic execution. The
first stage of that enterprise, which had been held in abeyance, for
well-nigh twenty years, while the administrative institutions of the
Faith were slowly taking shape and were being perfected, was finally
launched during the last decade of that same century whose opening
years will be associated with the earliest though veiled intimation
of the phenomenal destiny which the followers of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh in the New World are to fulfill. The successful
consummation of the first stage of that long-deferred Mission, made
possible through the brilliant execution of a Seven Year Plan,
embracing the entire Western Hemisphere, synchronized with, and was
befittingly commemorated through, the historic celebrations that
marked the termination of that century.<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p7"></a>
The opening decade of the second Bahá’í century coincides with
the launching of the second Seven Year Plan,<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-82"><sup>[82]</sup></a>
destined alike to consolidate the exploits that have shed such luster
on the last years of the preceding century, and to carry the Plan a
stage further across the ocean to the shores of the Old World, and to
communicate, through the operation of its regenerative power, its
healing influence to the peoples of the most afflicted, impoverished
and agitated continent of the globe. We who stand on the threshold of
this gigantic and twofold undertaking are unable to discern the exact
course which its immediate operation, both on the home front and in
fields far from the scene of its earliest victories, is destined to
take, the setbacks it may suffer, or the triumphs it must ultimately
achieve. The objectives, however, which must orientate its
prosecutors, and arouse them to a higher pitch of concerted endeavor,
are clearly defined, and by no means beyond their collective power to
achieve.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p8"></a>
The double task already undertaken to enlarge the basis of the
administrative structure of the Faith throughout the states and
provinces of the North American continent and throughout Latin
America, and to proclaim its truths and principles to the masses,
should be relentlessly pursued, whilst the range of the operation of
the Plan is being steadily enlarged. The administrative centers—foci
at which the ever-expanding activities of a rising Order must
converge—whose total number had not exceeded forty at the time of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to America, which at the inception of the
first Seven Year Plan had risen to three hundred, and had swelled to
over a thousand ere the expiry of the first Bahá’í century,
should, through resolute effort and careful planning, be continually
and speedily multiplied. Particular care should be constantly
exercised to enable the groups scattered throughout the length and
breadth of the states and provinces of the United States and Canada
to attain Assembly status, and assume gradually the responsibilities
and functions assigned to them in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Tablets
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. A corresponding increase in the number of such
centers throughout both Central and South America should likewise be
aimed at. Bolder measures designed to proclaim the verities of the
Faith, its tenets, its claims and the purpose of its institutions,
through the press and radio, through displays, exhibits and
conferences, and through a wider dissemination of its literature in
English, Spanish and Portuguese, as well as a more convincing
presentation of its aims and teachings to the leaders of public
opinion, should, moreover, be seriously and systematically undertaken
not only in the mother country but also throughout the Latin
republics where the structural basis of Bahá’u’lláh’s
embryonic Order has already been established.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p9"></a>
Collateral with this process of consolidation in North, Central and
South America, a special effort should be exerted to bring to a final
conclusion the construction of the most holy Temple which will ever
be erected by the followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, and
whose inception, forty-three years ago, synchronized with the
erection in the city of ‘I<u>sh</u>qábád of the first
Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the Bahá’í world. The
completion of the interior ornamentation of the Temple, following
upon its exterior decoration, and fitting it for the purposes for
which it was ordained, and coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary
of its inception, will, in itself, pave the way for the gradual
erection of those dependencies which are designed to supplement the
functions which the Central Edifice is destined to perform, and whose
future development must needs be provided for during successive
stages in the unfoldment of the Divine Plan itself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p10"></a>
Parallel with this double process of consolidation and construction
particular attention should be devoted to the provision of the
necessary means whereby the newly fledged centers in the Dominion of
Canada and throughout the republics of Latin America can be
coordinated and further consolidated, through the formation of three
National Spiritual Assemblies, designed to participate in time in the
international elections that must precede the constitution of the
First Universal House of Justice. The erection of these three
pillars, raising to eleven the number of existing National Spiritual
Assemblies, which are to be designated in future as Secondary Houses
of Justice, and are designed to support the highest legislative body
in the administrative hierarchy of the Faith, will, as the Divine
Plan continues to unfold, be supplemented by the formation of similar
bodies which, as they multiply, will, of necessity, broaden the
basis, and reinforce the representative character, of the supreme
elective Institution which, in conjunction with the institution of
Guardianship, must direct and coordinate the activities of a
world-encircling Faith. Through the formation of these National
Spiritual Assemblies, as the implications of the Divine Plan
gradually unfold in the coming years, the American Bahá’í
community will, in addition to its missionary activities throughout
five continents and the islands of the seven seas, be contributing
directly to the laying of the foundation, and hastening the
formation, of an institution which, when constituted, will have
consummated the threefold process involved in the erection of the
total structure of the Administrative Order of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p11"></a>
In conjunction with these aforementioned objectives, and, in a sense,
more far-reaching in its repercussions and of greater urgency, is the
task of extending the ramifications of the Divine Plan to a continent
which not only stands in dire need of the ennobling, the
reinvigorating, and spiritualizing influence of a world-redeeming
Faith, but must serve as a stepping-stone to the spiritual conquest
of the vast and numerous territories, lying as yet beyond the scope
of the Plan, in both the Asiatic and African continents, and which
must, in the course of successive epochs, be warmed and illuminated
by the rays of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation as prescribed in the
Tablets revealed by the Center of His Covenant and the Authorized
Interpreter of His teachings.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p12"></a>
In the western extremity of that continent, in the Iberian Peninsula,
the parent land and fountainhead of the culture of those republics
which have already been quickened by the first stirrings of the Plan
conceived by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; in the extreme North, among the
Scandinavian peoples, and further south, amidst their Flemish and
French neighbors, whose conversion will considerably enrich the
diversity of the races to be included within the orbit of its
operation; in the extreme South, in the Italian Peninsula, the cradle
of a far-famed civilization and the seat and stronghold of the most
powerful Church in Christendom; in the very heart of that continent,
amidst a freedom-loving, peace-pursuing, high-minded people, the
prosecutors of the second Seven Year Plan must, preferably in the
capitals of these countries, arise to establish, on an unassailable
foundation, the structural basis of the nascent institutions of their
Faith, which future promoters of the Divine Plan must, in the course
of succeeding epochs, enlarge, and thereon erect the mightiest
edifices of that Faith. Any assistance which the National Spiritual
Assemblies of the Bahá’ís of the British Isles and of Germany
can, through the instrumentality of their Publishing Committees and
other agencies, extend, any facilities which the establishment of an
office, acting as an adjunct to the International Bahá’í Bureau
in Geneva can provide, should be promptly and fully utilized for the
speedy accomplishment of the initial tasks to be undertaken in Europe
under the present Seven Year Plan.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p13"></a>
Through the prompt settlement of nine wholly dedicated souls, aglow
with enthusiasm and keenly aware of the plight of the peoples for
whose sake they are abandoning the comfort and security of their
homeland, and who will head the Roll of Honor as the curtain rises on
this new and glorious phase of American Bahá’í enterprise;
through the dispatch of itinerant teachers who, either delegated by
the American National Spiritual Assembly or of their own accord, will
cross and recross the vast distances, now providentially shrunk,
which separate the Old and New Worlds, who will assiduously water the
seeds sown by these pioneers, consolidate the work already started by
isolated believers, and act as intermediaries between the various
groups which, as the present Plan develops, must evolve into
Spiritual Assemblies; through the vigorous dissemination of
literature, properly translated, promptly printed, and comprehensive
in range, in French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Dutch and
each of the Scandinavian languages; through a steady process of
concentration on a few receptive souls, who can be relied upon to
embrace, wholeheartedly and with alacrity, the truth of the Faith,
identify themselves unreservedly with its tenets, actively support
its institutions, and join in forming its initial Assemblies; through
the persistent efforts, at a later stage, of a considerable number of
settlers who, joining forces with the original pioneers and the
native and newly enrolled believers, will provide the necessary
requisites for the constitution of properly functioning Local
Assemblies; through the participation, as the situation on the
continent improves and the restrictions are relaxed, of these
settlers, itinerant teachers, native and isolated believers in
conferences and organizations, humanitarian, educational and
otherwise, designed to promote ends akin to our own; through the
liberal supply of funds to those who have forsaken their homes and
kindred in the New World, and journeyed so far afield in the service
of both their Faith and their fellowmen; through the exertion of a
special effort, as the present Plan approaches its close and the
general condition in most European countries improves, aimed at
securing, through the radio and the press, the widest possible
publicity for the Faith, its tenets and institutions, to serve as a
means of reinforcing the number of its avowed promoters and of
consolidating the basis of its evolving institutions—through these,
and similar measures which the American National Spiritual Assembly
and its European Teaching Committee may initiate and promote, the
American Bahá’í Community must demonstrate, in this new field of
their intercontinental enterprise, an initiative, a tenacity, a
resourcefulness, a self-sacrifice and an audacity comparable to, and
even exceeding, the qualities evinced by those who, ever since the
inception of the Faith in the West, have, haphazardly, single-handed
and with no organization to sustain them, labored with such fidelity
and devotion in various countries throughout that continent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p14"></a>
The first century of the Bahá’í Era witnessed in darkest Persia
the birth of the Faith, as well as the establishment of the
Administrative Order—the Child of that Faith—an Order which,
cradled in the heart of the North American continent, has already
succeeded, in less than a decade and in direct consequence of the
initial operation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Plan, and through the
concerted, the sustained, and richly blessed efforts of the
champion-builders of that Order, in spreading out its roots and in
rearing its institutions in no less than twenty republics throughout
the length and breadth of the Western Hemisphere. The second century
is destined to witness a tremendous deployment and a notable
consolidation of the forces working towards the worldwide development
of that Order, as well as the first stirrings of that World Order, of
which the present Administrative System is at once the precursor, the
nucleus and pattern—an Order which, as it slowly crystallizes and
radiates its benign influence over the entire planet, will proclaim
at once the coming of age of the whole human race, as well as the
maturity of the Faith itself, the progenitor of that Order. As the
Plan bequeathed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá unfolds, through successive
decades of the present century, its measureless potentialities, and
gathers within the field of its operations nation after nation in
successive continents of the globe, it will be increasingly
recognized not only as the most potent agency for the development of
the world Administrative System, but also as a primary factor in the
birth and efflorescence of the World Order itself in both the East
and the West.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p15"></a>
The first Seven Year Plan, ushered in on the eve of the greatest
conflict that has ever shaken the human race, has, despite six years
of chaos and tribulation, been crowned with a success far exceeding
the most sanguine hopes of its ardent promoters. Within so short a
period, during such troublous years, such exploits were achieved as
will forever illuminate the pages of Bahá’í history. The exterior
ornamentation of the House of Worship was completed sixteen months
before the appointed time. The administrative basis of the Faith was
laid in every virgin state and province of the North American
continent. The number of Spiritual Assemblies in the United States
and Canada was almost doubled. No less than fourteen republics of
Latin America were provided with such Assemblies. Active groups began
to function in the remaining republics, raising thereby the number of
sovereign states within the pale of the Faith to sixty. Extension
work in which the newly constituted Assemblies were vigorously
participating was initiated. Two of the newly fledged Assemblies in
Latin America, as well as a considerable number in the United States,
were incorporated. An international school to provide training for
Bahá’í teachers in Central and South America was founded.
Considerable literature in Spanish and Portuguese was disseminated.
Newspaper and radio publicity, teacher training courses, and Bahá’í
youth symposiums were inaugurated. A distributing center of Bahá’í
literature for Latin America was established in the capital of
Argentina, and the outposts of the Faith, in the Western Hemisphere,
were pushed as far north as Anchorage in Alaska, in the vicinity of
the Artic Circle, and as far as the extremity of Chile, to
Magallanes, the world’s southernmost city.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p16"></a>
The second Seven Year Plan, set in motion on the morrow of that
universal and cataclysmic upheaval, must, despite the great confusion
that still prevails, the spiritual torpor, the disillusionment, the
embitterment, the political and social restlessness that still
afflict the human race, meet, as it gathers momentum and multiplies
its agencies across the ocean, in lands and amidst races that have
borne, for the most part, the brunt of this dire and bloody contest,
with a success no less startling and complete than that which
rewarded the self-sacrifice, the vigilance and the strenuous labors
of those who inaugurated the initial phase of this glorious Mission.
Might not this second and still greater adventure, undertaken by the
trustees of a God-given Mandate, demonstrate in both hemispheres,
despite the prodigious scale on which it is launched, such prodigies
of service as will carry its prosecutors far beyond their avowed
objectives, and eclipse, through the wisdom, the valor and the
exploits of those pioneers and administrators immediately responsible
for its planning and execution, the splendor of every previous
collective enterprise undertaken by the followers of Bahá’u’lláh
in the West?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p17"></a>
Let them as they gird up their loins, as they deliberate in their
council chambers, as they embark on their bold and holy Mission, as
they encounter the hazards, and suffer the setbacks, and are
confronted with the formidable obstacles, which so vast, so complex,
so arduous an enterprise must necessarily involve, call to mind the
illuminating, the comforting, the sustaining words enshrined for all
time in those epoch-making Tablets wherein the unerring pen of their
Master has traced the course of their Mission: “<i>May America
become the distributing center of spiritual enlightenment, and all
the world receive this heavenly blessing! For America has developed
powers and capacities greater and more wonderful than other nations …
May the inhabitants of this country … rise from their present
material attainments to such a height that heavenly illumination may
stream from this center to all the peoples of the world.</i>” And
again: “<i>O ye Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh! May my life be
sacrificed for you! … Behold the portals which Bahá’u’lláh
hath opened before you. Consider how exalted and lofty is the station
you are destined to attain; how unique the favors with which you have
been endowed</i>” … “<i>The full measure of your success is as
yet unrevealed, its significance still unapprehended. Erelong ye
will, with your own eyes, witness how brilliantly every one of you,
even as a shining star, will radiate in the firmament of your country
the light of Divine Guidance, and will bestow upon its people the
glory of an everlasting life … The range of your future
achievements still remains undisclosed. I fervently hope that in the
near future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the results
of your achievements.</i>” “<i>The Almighty will no doubt grant
you the help of His grace, will invest you with the tokens of His
might, and will endue your souls with the sustaining power of His
holy Spirit.</i>” And again: “<i>Be not concerned with the
smallness of your numbers, neither be oppressed by the multitude of
an unbelieving world</i>” … “<i>Exert yourselves; your mission
is unspeakably glorious. Should success crown your enterprise,
America will assuredly evolve into a center from which waves of
spiritual power will emanate, and the throne of the Kingdom of God
will, in the plenitude of its majesty and glory, be firmly
established</i>” … “<i>The hope which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
cherishes for you is that the same success which has attended your
efforts in America may crown your endeavors in other parts of the
world, that through you the fame of the Cause of God may be diffused
throughout the East and the West and the advent of the Kingdom of the
Lord of Hosts be proclaimed in all the five continents of the globe …
Thus far ye have been untiring in your labors. Let your exertions
henceforth increase a thousandfold. Summon the people in these
countries, capitals, islands, assemblies and churches to enter the
Abhá Kingdom. The scope of your exertions must needs be extended.
The wider its range, the more striking will be the evidence of Divine
assistance.</i>” And finally, this apocalyptic vision of the
consummation of the task entrusted to the American Bahá’í
Community, as evoked by that same Pen in those same Tablets: “<i>The
moment this Divine Message is carried forward by the American
believers from the shores of America, and is propagated through the
continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of Australasia, and as
far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself
securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion. Then
will all the peoples of the world witness that this community is
spiritually illumined and divinely guided. Then will the whole earth
resound with the praises of its majesty and greatness.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p18"></a>
What greater reward can crown the labors of that community, now
launched on the second stage of its world mission, than that the
consummation of the second Seven Year Plan should coincide with the
celebrations commemorating the centenary of the “<i>Year Nine,</i>”
the year which alike marked the termination of the Bábí
Dispensation, and signalized the birth of Bahá’u’lláh’s
prophetic Mission? It was at a time when the Faith for which the Báb
had suffered and died was hovering on the brink of extinction, when
Bahá’u’lláh lay wrapped in the gloom of the Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál
of Ṭihrán, His feet in stocks, His neck freighted with chains, and
surrounded by vile and wretched criminals, that the auspicious year
1269 A.H., acclaimed by the Báb as the “<i>Year Nine,</i>”
dawned upon the world, ushering in the most glorious and momentous
stage in the Heroic Age of the greatest religious Dispensation in the
spiritual history of mankind. To that year He had referred as the
year in which “<i>the realities of the created things</i>” will
“<i>be made manifest,</i>” the year in which mankind “<i>will
attain unto all good,</i>” in which the “<i>Bayán,</i>” as yet
“<i>in the stage of seed,</i>” will manifest “<i>its ultimate
perfection,</i>” in which the “<i>embryo of the Faith will attain
the station of ‘the most comely of forms,’</i>” and in which “<i>a
new creation</i>” will be beheld. It was in that same year that the
“<i>third woe,</i>” as anticipated by St. John the Divine,
quickly succeeded the second. To that same year <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>
Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í, who had heralded the Faith of the Báb, had
alluded as the year “after Ḥín” (68), when, according to his
written testimony, the “mystery” of the Cause of God would be
“manifested,” and the “secret” of His Message “divulged.”
It was in that same year that, according to Bahá’u’lláh
Himself, “<i>the requisite number of pure, of wholly consecrated,
and sanctified souls</i>” had been “<i>most secretly

It was in such dramatic circumstances, recalling the experience of
Moses when face to face with the Burning Bush in the wilderness of
Sinai, the successive visions of Zoroaster, the opening of the
heavens and the descent of the Dove upon Christ in the Jordan, the
cry of Gabriel heard by Muḥammad in the Cave of Híra, and the
dream of the Báb in which the blood of the Imám Ḥusayn touched
and sanctified His lips, that Bahá’u’lláh, He “around Whom
the Point of the Bayán hath revolved,” and the Vehicle of the
greatest Revelation the world has yet seen, received the first
intimation of His sublime Mission, and that a ministry which, alike
in its duration and fecundity, is unsurpassed in the religious
history of mankind, was inaugurated. It was on that occasion that the
“<i>Most Great Spirit,</i>” as designated by Bahá’u’lláh
Himself, revealed itself to Him, in the form of a “<i>Maiden,</i>”
and bade Him “<i>lift up</i>” His “<i>voice between earth and
heaven</i>”—that same Spirit which, in the Zoroastrian, the
Mosaic, the Christian, and Muḥammadan Dispensations, had been
respectively symbolized by the “Sacred Fire,” the “Burning
Bush,” the “Dove,” and the “Angel Gabriel.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p20"></a>
“<i>One night, in a dream,</i>” Bahá’u’lláh Himself,
recounting His soul-shaking experience of the first stirrings of His
prophetic Mission, in the Year Nine, in that abominable pit, has
written, “<i>these exalted words were heard on every side: ‘Verily,
We shall render Thee victorious by Thyself and by Thy Pen. Grieve
Thou not for that which hath befallen Thee, neither be Thou afraid,
for Thou art in safety. Erelong will God raise up the treasures of
the earth—men who will aid Thee through Thyself and through Thy
Name, wherewith God hath revived the hearts of such as have
recognized Him.’</i>” And again, “<i>During the days I lay in
the prison of Ṭihrán, though the galling weight of the chains and
the stench-filled air allowed Me but little sleep, still in those
infrequent moments of slumber I felt as if something flowed from the
crown of My head over My breast, even as a mighty torrent that
precipitateth itself upon the earth from the summit of a lofty
mountain. Every limb of My body would, as a result, be set afire. At
such moments My tongue recited what no man could bear to hear.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p21"></a>
What still greater reward could await those who, inspired by the
success achieved by the prosecutors of the second Seven Year Plan,
will have arisen to carry forward to a triumphant conclusion the
third phase of the Mission entrusted to them by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
than that their prodigious labors, having embraced territories far
beyond the confines of the continents of Europe and of America,
should climax in, and be worthily commemorated through, the worldwide
celebrations of the “Most Great Festival,” the “King of
Festivals,” the “Festival of God” Himself—the Festival
associated with the accession of Him Who is the Lord of the Kingdom
to the throne of everlasting glory, and with the formal assumption by
Him of His prophetic office? What greater reward than that the
consummation of the third Seven Year Plan, marking the close of the
first, and signalizing the opening of the second, epoch in the
evolution of the Divine Plan, should synchronize with that greatest
of all Jubilees, related to the year 1335, mentioned by Daniel in the
last chapter of His Book, and associated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with
the world triumph of His Father’s Faith? What greater glory than
that those who have brought this initial epoch in the resistless
march of a world-embracing Plan to a triumphant termination should be
made to feel that they, and those gone before them, have, through
their collective, their sustained, and heroic endeavors, organized
through three successive stages, and covering a span of almost a
quarter of a century, been vouchsafed by the Almighty the privilege
of contributing, more than any other community consciously laboring
in the service of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, to this blissful
consummation, and to have played a preponderating role in the world
triumph of its institutions?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p22"></a>
Dearly beloved friends! It is not for us, at this crucial hour, to
delve into the future, to speculate on the possibilities of the Plan
and its orientation, to conjecture on its impact on the unfoldment of
an embryonic World Order, or to dwell on the glories and triumphs
which it may hold in store, or to seek to delineate the mysterious
course which a God-given Mission, impelled by forces beyond our power
to predict or appraise, may pursue. To try to obtain a clear view of
the shape of things to come would be premature, inasmuch as the
glittering prizes to be won are directly dependent on the measure of
success which the combined efforts that are now being exerted must
yield. Ours is the duty to fix our gaze with undeviating attention on
the duties and responsibilities confronting us at this present hour,
to concentrate our resources, both material and spiritual, on the
tasks that lie immediately ahead, to ensure that no time is wasted,
that no opportunity is missed, that no obligation is evaded, that no
task is half-heartedly performed, that no decision is procrastinated.
The task summoning us to a challenge, unprecedented in its gravity
and force, is too vast and sacred, the time too short, the hour too
perilous, the workers too few, the call too insistent, the resources
too inadequate, for us to allow these precious and fleeting hours to
slip from our grasp, and to suffer the prizes within our reach to be
endangered or forfeited. So much depends upon us, so pregnant with
possibilities is the present stage in the evolution of the Plan, that
great and small, individuals, groups and Assemblies, white and
colored, young and old, neophytes and veterans, settlers, pioneers,
itinerant teachers and administrators, as isolated believers, as
organizers of groups, and as contributors to the formation of Local
or National Assemblies, as builders of the Temple, as laborers on the
home teaching front, or in Latin America, or in the new transatlantic
field of service—all, without exception and in every sphere of
activity, however modest, restricted or inconspicuous, must
participate and labor, assiduously and continually, until every ounce
of our energy is spent, until, tired but blissful, our promised
harvest is brought in, and our pledge to our Beloved fully redeemed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p23"></a>
However dark the outlook, however laborious the task, however strange
and inhospitable the environment, however vast the distances that
must be traversed, however scarce the amenities of life, however
irksome the means of travel, however annoying the restrictions,
however listless and confused the minds of the peoples and races
contacted, however trying the setbacks that may be suffered, we must,
under no circumstances, either falter or flinch. Our reliance on the
unfailing grace of an all-loving, all-preserving, ever-sustaining,
ever-watchful Providence, must, however much we may be buffeted by
circumstances, remain unshaken until the very end. Shall we not, when
hardships seethe about us, and our hearts momentarily quail, recall
the ardent desire so poignantly voiced by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in those
immortal Tablets that enshrine forever His last wishes for His chosen
disciples: “O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the
utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of ‘Yá
Bahá’u’l-Abhá’ in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and
oceans, promote the Divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How
intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p24"></a>
To be privileged to render, in His stead, on so colossal a scale, at
such a challenging hour, and in the service of so sublime a Plan, so
great and enduring a service, is a bounty which we can never
adequately appraise. We stand too close to the noble edifice our
hands are rearing, the din and tumult into which a war-devastated
world is now plunged are too distracting, our own share in the
furtherance of those global aims, tasks and problems that are
increasingly absorbing the attention of mankind and its leaders is as
yet too circumscribed, for us to be in a position to evaluate the
contribution which we, as the executors of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Mandate, as the champion-builders of Bahá’u’lláh’s Order, as
the torchbearers of a civilization of which that Order is the
mainspring and precursor, are now being led, through the inscrutable
dispensations of an almighty Providence, to make to the world triumph
of our Faith, as well as to the ultimate redemption of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p25"></a>
Great have been the blessings, and divers the bestowals, vouchsafed
to this community ever since the compelling will of a loving Master
called it into being, and raised it up for the glory and honor of His
Father’s Faith. Unnumbered have been the marks of solicitude which,
down the years, He showered upon it, as He nursed it in its infancy,
as He fostered its growth, as He sent forth His messengers and
communicated His written instructions, to initiate it into the
mysteries of His Cause, as He vitalized it through personal contact
with His own dynamic and vibrant personality, as He consecrated,
through a series of significant acts, the initial activities which He
Himself had enabled it to inaugurate, as He invested it, at a later
stage, in the evening of His life, with that primacy that was to
empower it to launch the Plan which He had conceived for its future
development, as He, through the sustaining power of His spirit from
on high, assisted it to erect the framework of those institutions
that were to safeguard its unfoldment and canalize its energies, as
He led it forward to embark upon the first stage of His own revealed
Plan which was to enable it to achieve such exploits and garner such
a harvest in the virgin territories of the New World, and as He, with
that same watchful and loving care, is now marshaling its forces and
sounding the signal for a still greater and more brilliant deployment
of those forces, at a time of great commotion and distress, in one of
the most agitated storm-centers of the world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p26"></a>
Strange, indeed, as we look back over the last fifty years that have
witnessed the creation and unfoldment of so powerful an agency for
the execution of Bahá’u’lláh’s purpose for mankind, that he
who had first raised his voice in public on behalf of so mighty a
Faith should have sprung from the ranks, and been recognized as one
of the leading representatives, of that narrow and hostile
ecclesiastical order which, as the Faith advances and storms still
greater heights, will increasingly launch against it its determined
attacks. Stranger still that he whom posterity will recognize to have
been the founder of that Faith in the Western Hemisphere, whom the
Center of the Covenant, in recognition of so signal a service, had
acclaimed as “Bahá’s Peter” and “the Second Columbus,”<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-83"><sup>[83]</sup></a>
should have, in his vanity and ambition, deserted the Fold he had
labored to gather, should have allied himself with the Archbreaker of
the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, and remained, until the end of his
life, a sworn and bitter enemy of the One Who had entrusted him with
such a holy and historic errand, and conferred upon him such glowing
tributes. More extraordinary still that he who had been instrumental
in carrying the Tablets of the Divine Plan from the One Who had
revealed them to those into whose care they were to be committed, who
had enjoyed, for so long and so intimately, near access to his Master
as amanuensis, companion and interpreter,<a href="#endnote-tdh_en-84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>
should have been blinded by his inordinate ambition, and should have
arisen, with all the resources at his disposal, to attack and
undermine the institutions of an Order which, springing from the
authentic Will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, had been designed by Him to be
the chief instrument for the vigorous prosecution of that Plan and
the fulfillment of its ultimate purpose.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p27"></a>
Such reflections, far from engendering in our minds and hearts the
slightest trace of perplexity, of discouragement or doubt, should
reinforce the basis of our convictions, demonstrate to us the
incorruptibility, the strange workings and the invincibility of a
Faith which, despite the assaults which malignant and redoubtable
enemies from the ranks of kings, princes and ecclesiastics have
repeatedly launched against it, and the violent internal tests that
have shaken it for more than a century, and the relative obscurity of
its champions, and the unpropitiousness of the times and the
perversity of the generations contemporaneous with its rise and
growth, has gone from strength to strength, has preserved its unity
and integrity, has diffused its light over five continents, reared
the institutions of its Administrative Order and spread its
ramifications to the four corners of the earth, and launched its
systematic campaigns in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-158-p28"></a>
For such benefits, for such an arresting and majestic vindication of
the undefeatable powers inherent in our precious Faith, we can but
bow our heads in humility, awe and thanksgiving, renew our pledge of
fealty to it, and, each covenanting in his own heart, resolve to
prove faithful to that pledge, and persevere to the very end, until
our earthly share of servitude to so transcendent and priceless a
Cause has been totally and completely fulfilled.</p>

The new Plan on which the American Bahá’í community has embarked,
in the course of the opening years of the second Bahá’í century,
is of such vastness and complexity as to require the utmost vigor,
vigilance, and consecration on the part of both the general body of
its prosecutors and those who are called upon, as their national
elected representatives, to conduct its operation, define its
processes, watch over its execution, and ensure its ultimate success.
The obstacles confronting both its participants and organizers,
particularly in the European field, are formidable, and call for the
utmost courage, perseverance, fortitude and self-sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-160-p2"></a>
The precarious international situation in both Hemispheres, the
distress and preoccupation of the masses, in most of the countries to
which pioneers will soon be proceeding, with the cares of everyday
life, the severe restrictions which are still imposed on visitors and
travelers in foreign lands, the religious conservatism and spiritual
lethargy which characterize the population in most of the lands where
the new pioneers are to labor, add to the challenge of the task, and
render all the more glorious the labors, of the valiant community
that has arisen to achieve what posterity will regard as the greatest
collective enterprise, not only in the history of the community
itself, but in the annals of the Faith with which it stands
identified.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-160-p3"></a>
The initial success of the enterprise which has been so auspiciously
launched, the enthusiasm which it has already engendered throughout
Latin America, the hopes it has aroused amid the suffering and
scattered believers in war-torn Europe, the feelings of admiration
and envy it has excited throughout several communities in the Bahá’í
world in both the East and the West, augur well for the future course
of its operation, and foreshadow the splendor of the victories which
its consummation must witness. The forces that have been released
through the birth of the Plan must be directed into the most
effective channels, the spirit that has been kindled must be
continually nourished, the facilities at the disposal of its
organizers must be fully utilized, each and every barrier that may
obstruct its expansion must be determinedly removed, every assistance
which Bahá’í communities in various lands may wish, or be able,
to offer, should be wholeheartedly welcomed, every measure that will
serve to reinforce the bonds uniting the newly fledged communities in
the Latin world, and to stimulate the movement, and raise the
spirits, of itinerant teachers and settlers laboring in the continent
of Europe, must be speedily undertaken, if the colossal task, which
in the course of seven brief years must be carried out, is to be
befittingly consummated.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-160-p4"></a>
The sterner the task, the graver the responsibilities, the wider the
field of exertion, the more persistently must the privileged members
of this enviable community strive, and the loftier must be the
heights to which they should aspire, in the course of their God-given
Mission, and throughout every stage in the irresistible and divinely
guided evolution of their community life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-160-p5"></a>
Setbacks may well surprise them; trials and disappointments may tax
their patience and resourcefulness; the forces of darkness, either
from within or from without, may seek to dampen their ardor, to
disrupt their unity and break their spirit; pitfalls may surround the
little band that must act as a vanguard to the host which must, in
the years to come, spiritually raise up the sorely ravaged continent
of Europe. None of these, however fierce, sinister or unyielding they
may appear, must be allowed to deflect the protagonists of a
God-impelled Plan from the course which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has chosen
for them, and which the agencies of a firmly established, laboriously
erected Administrative Order are now enabling them to effectively
pursue.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-160-p6"></a>
That they may press forward with undiminished fervor, with undimmed
vision, with unfaltering steps, with indivisible unity, with
unflinching determination until the shining goal is attained is my
constant prayer, my ardent hope, and the dearest wish of my heart.</p>

As the opening phase of the Second Seven Year Plan draws inexorably
to a close, the American Bahá’í community, which has already
abundantly demonstrated its capacity to carry to a triumphant
conclusion the initial stage of the Plan conceived by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
must equally—nay even more convincingly—prove to the entire
Bahá’í world its inflexible determination and undoubted ability
to discharge befittingly whatever responsibilities the constant
evolution of the Plan may impose upon its members under any
circumstances and in whatever continent of the globe. As the field of
their historic labors steadily widens, as the implications of their
high mission become more apparent, as the complexity of their task
increases, as the agencies designed to facilitate and accelerate its
execution multiply, the members of this community must, individually
as well as collectively, redouble their efforts, evince a nobler
spirit of self-sacrifice, display greater resourcefulness, unity,
initiative, steadfastness and enterprise, rise to loftier heights of
heroism and self-abnegation, and establish, more convincingly than
ever, their right to be regarded as the worthy champions of a
glorious Cause, the principal builders of a unique Order, and the
chosen trustees and executors of a divinely conceived Plan.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-162-p2"></a>
Theirs is the duty, at once urgent, inescapable and sacred, to
scatter more widely and as far as the extremities of both the North
and South American continents; to cross the ocean in ever-increasing
numbers, and reinforce, rapidly and systematically, the outposts of
the Faith in Western Europe; lay, on a definite and unassailable
basis, the foundations of new and flourishing communities;
disseminate, energetically, and on a far more extensive scale, the
literature of the Faith in all the languages which the execution of
the Plan, at its present stage, demands; collaborate more closely
with the two National Assemblies and their subsidiary agencies
already functioning in that continent; initiate, wisely and
patiently, whatever measures may be required to further the purposes
of the Plan; and surmount, at whatever cost, every obstacle they may
encounter in their path.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-162-p3"></a>
As to those who, owing to circumstances beyond their control, are
unavoidably prevented from participating in this national and
intercontinental crusade, and are denied the privilege of struggling
in the forefront of battle, either at home or abroad, theirs is the
no less meritorious task, to aid by every means in their power,
whether through financial assistance, constant support and
encouragement, the supply of literature or the appointment of
deputies, the little band of their heroic brethren, who have assumed
so preponderating a share of the responsibilities now facing the
entire community: all, without exception, without reservation,
without further delay, must participate. Each and every one, to the
fullest extent of his or her ability, and however distracting the
prevailing circumstances, or circumscribed the means, must arise to
contribute to the success of this new enterprise that will at once
safeguard the fruits already garnered through the successful
conclusion of the first stage of the Divine Plan, and enable its
prosecutors to launch, at the appointed time, the third and a still
more glorious stage in its evolution.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-162-p4"></a>
There is no time to lose. The task, though prodigious, is not beyond
the capacity of those who, in so short a time, in such distant
fields, over so wide an area, and in the midst of a people so alien
in temperament, language and custom, have won such conspicuous
victories for their beloved Faith, and laid so enduring a foundation
for its nascent institutions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-162-p5"></a>
This gallant community is now summoned to undertake, further afield
amidst a diversity of races and nations, and in circumstances
admittedly more adverse and challenging, a task infinitely more
meritorious, and considerably richer in its potentialities. To fail,
at this critical juncture, to rise to the height of the occasion,
would jeopardize the colossal work so painstakingly achieved in the
course of many long years, and irretrievably shatter the hopes for
the early opening of the third and most shining phase of the Divine
Plan—a stage whose completion must mark the closing of the initial
Epoch in the Plan’s progressive unfoldment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="tdh_en-162-p6"></a>
May this community, faithful to its pledge, and obedient to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s mandate, arise as one man, and carry out, in
its entirety and within the stipulated time, the task on which it has
so spontaneously embarked.</p>

	This appears to be an allusion to the first of five successive steps
	Shoghi Effendi had outlined for the successful completion of the
	Temple enterprise. The five steps, announced in <i>Bahá’í News</i>,
	no. 110 (Sept. 1937), were as follows: (1) Preliminary
	investigations were to be expedited. (2) A generous donation of
	$100,000 by Siegfried Schopflocher was to be used to facilitate the
	immediate signature of a contract for the next unit of exterior
	ornamentation. (3) The National Spiritual Assembly was to make a
	nationwide appeal to the entire community to ensure the
	uninterrupted completion of the first unit of exterior ornamentation
	and the accumulation of sufficient funds to place the final contract
	without delay. (4) The final contract was to be signed as soon as
	half of the required sum for its fulfillment was available in the
	national treasury. (5) The National Assembly was to reemphasize the
	supreme obligation of the triumphant conclusion of so vital a part
	of the American believers’ twofold task by May 1944.<a href="#tdh_en-31-p1"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif">

	Bahá’ís in many parts of the world were experiencing severe
	hardships and persecution at the time this message was written. In
	Iran, Bahá’í marriages were not recognized as legitimate, yet
	the Bahá’ís were given no acceptable means to legitimize their
	unions in the eyes of the law without compromising their faith.
	Those who were married according to Bahá’í law were often
	arrested and either fined or imprisoned. There were also
	restrictions against holding Bahá’í meetings, Bahá’í records
	were occasionally confiscated by government officials, and some
	believers were banished from their hometowns. In Iraq, some Bahá’ís
	were accused of being communists and were arrested and tried, then
	acquitted. In ‘I<u>sh</u>qábád Bahá’ís were arrested, their
	homes were searched, and Bahá’í records and literature were
	confiscated. Furthermore, the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of
	that city was confiscated for government use. Many of the believers
	were exiled and sought refuge in Iran, only to be denied work. In
	the Caucasus, all Bahá’í administrative institutions had to be
	disbanded, and many Bahá’ís were exiled to Siberia. Bahá’ís
	in Egypt had recently experienced outbreaks of public violence in
	connection with their efforts to give proper Bahá’í burial to
	their dead. In Nazi Germany, the Faith was officially banned and its
	activities were forbidden.<a href="#tdh_en-58-p3"><font face="Arial Unicode MS, serif">
