It would be difficult indeed to adequately express the feelings of
irrepressible joy and exultation that flood my heart every time I
pause to contemplate the ceaseless evidences of the dynamic energy
which animates the stalwart pioneers of the World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh in the execution of the Plan committed to their
charge. The signature of the contract, by your elected national
representatives, signalizing the opening of the final phase of the
greatest enterprise ever launched by the followers of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh in the West, no less than the extremely heartening
progress recorded in the successive reports of their National
Teaching Committee, attest, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the
fidelity, the vigor, and the thoroughness with which you are
conducting the manifold operations which the evolution of the Seven
Year Plan must necessarily involve. In both of its aspects, and in
all its details, it is being prosecuted with exemplary regularity and
precision, with undiminished efficiency, and commendable dispatch.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-2"></a><a name="adj_en-p2"></a>
The resourcefulness which the national representatives of the
American believers have, in recent months, so strikingly
demonstrated, as evidenced by the successive measures they have
adopted, has been matched by the loyal, the unquestioning and
generous support accorded them by all those whom they represent, at
every critical stage, and with every fresh advance, in the discharge
of their sacred duties. Such close interaction, such complete
cohesion, such continual harmony and fellowship between the various
agencies that contribute to the organic life, and constitute the
basic framework, of every properly functioning Bahá’í community,
is a phenomenon which offers a striking contrast to the disruptive
tendencies which the discordant elements of present-day society so
tragically manifest. Whereas every apparent trial with which the
unfathomable wisdom of the Almighty deems it necessary to afflict His
chosen community serves only to demonstrate afresh its essential
solidarity and to consolidate its inward strength, each of the
successive crises in the fortunes of a decadent age exposes more
convincingly than the one preceding it the corrosive influences that
are fast sapping the vitality and undermining the basis of its
declining institutions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p3"></a>
For such demonstrations of the interpositions of an ever-watchful
Providence they who stand identified with the Community of the Most
Great Name must feel eternally grateful. From every fresh token of
His unfailing blessing on the one hand, and of His visitation on the
other, they cannot but derive immense hope and courage. Alert to
seize every opportunity which the revolutions of the wheel of destiny
within their Faith offers them, and undismayed by the prospect of
spasmodic convulsions that must sooner or later fatally affect those
who have refused to embrace its light, they, and those who will labor
after them, must press forward until the processes now set in motion
will have each spent its force and contributed its share towards the
birth of the Order now stirring in the womb of a travailing age.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-3"></a><a name="adj_en-p4"></a>
These recurrent crises which, with ominous frequency and resistless
force, are afflicting an ever-increasing portion of the human race
must of necessity continue, however impermanently, to exercise, in a
certain measure, their baleful influence upon a world community which
has spread its ramifications to the uttermost ends of the earth. How
can the beginnings of a world upheaval, unleashing forces that are so
gravely deranging the social, the religious, the political, and the
economic equilibrium of organized society, throwing into chaos and
confusion political systems, racial doctrines, social conceptions,
cultural standards, religious associations, and trade
relationships—how can such agitations, on a scale so vast, so
unprecedented, fail to produce any repercussions on the institutions
of a Faith of such tender age whose teachings have a direct and vital
bearing on each of these spheres of human life and conduct?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p5"></a>
Little wonder, therefore, if they who are holding aloft the banner of
so pervasive a Faith, so challenging a Cause, find themselves
affected by the impact of these world-shaking forces. Little wonder
if they find that in the midst of this whirlpool of contending
passions their freedom has been curtailed, their tenets contemned,
their institutions assaulted, their motives maligned, their authority
jeopardized, their claim rejected.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p6"></a>
In the heart of the European continent a community which, as
predicted by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, is destined, by virtue of its
spiritual potentialities and geographical situation, to radiate the
splendor of the light of the Faith on the countries that surround it,
has been momentarily eclipsed through the restrictions which a regime
that has sorely misapprehended its purpose and function has chosen to
impose upon it. Its voice, alas, is now silenced, its institutions
dissolved, its literature banned, its archives confiscated, and its
meetings suspended.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p7"></a>
In central Asia, in the city enjoying the unique distinction of
having been chosen by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá as the home of the
first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the Bahá’í world, as
well as in the towns and villages of the province to which it
belongs, the sore-pressed Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, as a result of
the extraordinary and unique vitality which, in the course of several
decades, it has consistently manifested, finds itself at the mercy of
forces which, alarmed at its rising power, are now bent on reducing
it to utter impotence. Its Temple, though still used for purposes of
Bahá’í worship, has been expropriated, its Assemblies and
committees disbanded, its teaching activities crippled, its chief
promoters deported, and not a few of its most enthusiastic
supporters, both men and women, imprisoned.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p8"></a>
In the land of its birth, wherein reside the immense majority of its
followers—a country whose capital has been hailed by Bahá’u’lláh
as the “<i>mother of the world</i>” and the “<i>dayspring of
the joy of mankind</i>”—a civil authority, as yet undivorced
officially from the paralyzing influences of an antiquated, a
fanatical, and outrageously corrupt clergy, pursues relentlessly its
campaign of repression against the adherents of a Faith which it has
for well-nigh a century striven unsuccessfully to suppress.
Indifferent to the truth that the members of this innocent and
proscribed community can justly claim to rank as among the most
disinterested, the most competent, and the most ardent lovers of
their native land, contemptuous of their high sense of world
citizenship which the advocates of an excessive and narrow
nationalism can never hope to appreciate, such an authority refuses
to grant to a Faith which extends its spiritual jurisdiction over
well-nigh six hundred local communities, and which numerically
outnumbers the adherents of either the Christian, the Jewish, or the
Zoroastrian Faiths in that land, the necessary legal right to enforce
its laws, to administer its affairs, to conduct its schools, to
celebrate its festivals, to circulate its literature, to solemnize
its rites, to erect its edifices, and to safeguard its endowments.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p9"></a>
And now recently in the Holy Land itself, the heart and nerve-center
of a world-embracing Faith, the fires of racial animosity, of
fratricidal strife, of unabashed terrorism, have lit a conflagration
that gravely interferes, on the one hand, with that flow of pilgrims
that constitutes the lifeblood of that center, and suspends, on the
other, the various projects that had been initiated in connection
with the preservation and extension of the areas surrounding the
sacred Spots it enshrines. The safety of the small community of
resident believers, faced by the rising tide of lawlessness, has been
imperiled, its status as a neutral and distinct community indirectly
challenged, and its freedom to carry out certain of its observances
curtailed. A series of murderous assaults, alternating with outbursts
of bitter fanaticism, both racial and religious, involving the
leaders as well as the followers of the three leading Faiths in that
distracted country, have, at times, threatened to sever all normal
communications both within its confines as well as with the outside
world. Perilous though the situation has been, the Bahá’í Holy
Places, the object of the adoration of a world-encircling Faith,
have, notwithstanding their number and exposed position, and though
to outward seeming deprived of any means of protection, been
vouchsafed a preservation little short of miraculous.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p10"></a>
A world, torn with conflicting passions, and perilously
disintegrating from within, finds itself confronted, at so crucial an
epoch in its history, by the rising fortunes of an infant Faith, a
Faith that, at times, seems to be drawn into its controversies,
entangled by its conflicts, eclipsed by its gathering shadows, and
overpowered by the mounting tide of its passions. In its very heart,
within its cradle, at the seat of its first and venerable Temple, in
one of its hitherto flourishing and potentially powerful centers, the
as-yet unemancipated Faith of Bahá’u’lláh seems indeed to have
retreated before the onrushing forces of violence and disorder to
which humanity is steadily falling a victim. The strongholds of such
a Faith, one by one and day after day, are to outward seeming being
successively isolated, assaulted and captured. As the lights of
liberty flicker and go out, as the din of discord grows louder and
louder every day, as the fires of fanaticism flame with increasing
fierceness in the breasts of men, as the chill of irreligion creeps
relentlessly over the soul of mankind, the limbs and organs that
constitute the body of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh appear, in
varying measure, to have become afflicted with the crippling
influences that now hold in their grip the whole of the civilized
world.

How clearly and strikingly the following words of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá
are being demonstrated at this hour: “<i>The darkness of error that
has enveloped the East and the West is, in this most great cycle,
battling with the light of Divine Guidance. Its swords and its spears
are very sharp and pointed; its army keenly bloodthirsty.</i>”
“<i>This day,</i>” He, in another passage has written, “<i>the
powers of all the leaders of religion are directed towards the
dispersion of the congregation of the All-Merciful, and the
shattering of the Divine Edifice. The hosts of the world, whether
material, cultural or political are from every side launching their
assault, for the Cause is great, very great. Its greatness is, in
this day, clear and manifest to men’s eyes.</i>”</p>

The one chief remaining citadel, the mighty arm which still raises
aloft the standard of an unconquerable Faith, is none other than the
blessed community of the followers of the Most Great Name in the
North American continent. By its works, and through the unfailing
protection vouchsafed to it by an almighty Providence, this
distinguished member of the body of the constantly interacting Bahá’í
communities of East and West, bids fair to be universally regarded as
the cradle, as well as the stronghold, of that future New World
Order, which is at once the promise and the glory of the Dispensation
associated with the name of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p13"></a>
Let anyone inclined to either belittle the unique station conferred
upon this community, or to question the role it will be called upon
to play in the days to come, ponder the implication of these pregnant
and highly illuminating words uttered by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, and
addressed to it at a time when the fortunes of a world groaning
beneath the burden of a devastating war had reached their lowest ebb.
“<i>The continent of America,</i>” He so significantly wrote,
“<i>is, in the eyes of the one true God, the land wherein the
splendors of His light shall be revealed, where the mysteries of His
Faith shall be unveiled, where the righteous will abide, and the free
assemble.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-5"></a><a name="adj_en-p14"></a>
Already, the community of the believers of the North American
continent—at once the prime mover and pattern of the future
communities which the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh is destined to raise
up throughout the length and breadth of the Western Hemisphere—has,
despite the prevailing gloom, shown its capacity to be recognized as
the torchbearer of that light, the repository of those mysteries, the
exponent of that righteousness and the sanctuary of that freedom. To
what other light can these above-quoted words possibly allude, if not
to the light of the glory of the Golden Age of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh? What mysteries could ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá have
contemplated except the mysteries of that embryonic World Order now
evolving within the matrix of His Administration? What righteousness
if not the righteousness whose reign that Age and that Order can
alone establish? What freedom but the freedom which the proclamation
of His sovereignty in the fullness of time must bestow?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-6"></a><a name="adj_en-p15"></a>
The community of the organized promoters of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
in the American continent—the spiritual descendants of the
dawn-breakers of an heroic Age, who by their death proclaimed the
birth of that Faith—must, in turn, usher in, not by their death but
through living sacrifice, that promised World Order, the shell
ordained to enshrine that priceless jewel, the world civilization, of
which the Faith itself is the sole begetter. While its sister
communities are bending beneath the tempestuous winds that beat upon
them from every side, this community, preserved by the immutable
decrees of the omnipotent Ordainer and deriving continual sustenance
from the mandate with which the Tablets of the Divine Plan have
invested it, is now busily engaged in laying the foundations and in
fostering the growth of those institutions which are to herald the
approach of the Age destined to witness the birth and rise of the
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p16"></a>
A community, relatively negligible in its numerical strength;
separated by vast distances from both the focal-center of its Faith
and the land wherein the preponderating mass of its fellow-believers
reside; bereft in the main of material resources and lacking in
experience and in prominence; ignorant of the beliefs, concepts and
habits of those peoples and races from which its spiritual Founders
have sprung; wholly unfamiliar with the languages in which its sacred
Books were originally revealed; constrained to place its sole
reliance upon an inadequate rendering of only a fragmentary portion
of the literature embodying its laws, its tenets, and its history;
subjected from its infancy to tests of extreme severity, involving,
at times, the defection of some of its most prominent members; having
to contend, ever since its inception, and in an ever-increasing
measure, with the forces of corruption, of moral laxity, and
ingrained prejudice—such a community, in less than half a century,
and unaided by any of its sister communities, whether in the East or
in the West, has, by virtue of the celestial potency with which an
all-loving Master has abundantly endowed it, lent an impetus to the
onward march of the Cause it has espoused which the combined
achievements of its coreligionists in the West have failed to rival.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-7"></a><a name="adj_en-p17"></a>
What other community, it can confidently be asked, has been
instrumental in fixing the pattern, and in imparting the original
impulse, to those administrative institutions that constitute the
vanguard of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh? What other
community has been capable of demonstrating, with such consistency,
the resourcefulness, the discipline, the iron determination, the zeal
and perseverance, the devotion and fidelity, so indispensable to the
erection and the continued extension of the framework within which
those nascent institutions can alone multiply and mature? What other
community has proved itself to be fired by so noble a vision, or
willing to rise to such heights of self-sacrifice, or ready to
achieve so great a measure of solidarity, as to be able to raise, in
so short a time and in the course of such crucial years, an edifice
that can well deserve to be regarded as the greatest contribution
ever made by the West to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh? What other
community can justifiably lay claim to have succeeded, through the
unsupported efforts of one of its humble members, in securing the
spontaneous allegiance of Royalty to its Cause, and in winning such
marvelous and written testimonies to its truth? What other community
has shown the foresight, the organizing ability, the enthusiastic
eagerness, that have been responsible for the establishment and
multiplication, throughout its territory, of those initial schools
which, as time goes by, will, on the one hand, evolve into powerful
centers of Bahá’í learning, and, on the other, provide a fertile
recruiting ground for the enrichment and consolidation of its
teaching force? What other community has produced pioneers combining
to such a degree the essential qualities of audacity, of
consecration, of tenacity, of self-renunciation, and unstinted
devotion, that have prompted them to abandon their homes, and forsake
their all, and scatter over the surface of the globe, and hoist in
its uttermost corners the triumphant banner of Bahá’u’lláh? Who
else but the members of this community have won the eternal
distinction of being the first to raise the call of <i>Yá
Bahá’u’l-Abhá</i> in such highly important and widely scattered
centers and territories as the hearts of both the British and French
empires, Germany, the Far East, the Balkan States, the Scandinavian
countries, Latin America, the Islands of the Pacific, South Africa,
Australia and New Zealand, and now more recently the Baltic States?
Who else but those same pioneers have shown themselves ready to
undertake the labor, to exercise the patience, and to provide the
funds, required for the translation and publication, in no less than
forty languages, of their sacred literature, the dissemination of
which is an essential prerequisite to any effectively organized
campaign of teaching? What other community can lay claim to have had
a decisive share in the worldwide efforts that have been exerted for
the safeguarding and the extension of the immediate surroundings of
its holy shrines, as well as for the preliminary acquisition of the
future sites of its international institutions at its world center?
What other community can to its eternal credit claim to have been the
first to frame its national and local constitutions, thereby laying
down the fundamental lines of the twin charters designed to regulate
the activities, define the functions, and safeguard the rights, of
its institutions? What other community can boast of having
simultaneously acquired and legally secured the basis of its national
endowments, thus paving the way for a similar action on the part of
its local communities? What other community has achieved the supreme
distinction of having obtained, long before any of its sister
communities had envisaged such a possibility, the necessary documents
assuring the recognition, by both the federal and state authorities,
of its Spiritual Assemblies and national endowments? And finally what
other community has had the privilege, and been granted the means, to
succor the needy, to plead the cause of the downtrodden, and to
intervene so energetically for the safeguarding of Bahá’í
edifices and institutions in countries such as Persia, Egypt, ‘Iráq,
Russia, and Germany, where, at various times, its fellow-believers
have had to suffer the rigors of both religious and racial
persecution?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p18"></a>
Such a matchless and brilliant record of service, extending over a
period of well-nigh twenty years, and so closely interwoven with the
interest and fortunes of such a large section of the worldwide Bahá’í
community, deserves to rank as a memorable chapter in the history of
the Formative Period of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Reinforced
and enriched as it is by the memory of the American believers’
earlier achievements, such a record is in itself convincing testimony
to their ability to befittingly shoulder the responsibilities which
any task may impose upon them in the future. To overrate the
significance of these manifold services would be well-nigh
impossible. To appraise correctly their value, and dilate on their
merits and immediate consequences, is a task which only a future
Bahá’í historian can properly discharge. I can only for the
present place on record my profound conviction that a community
capable of showing forth such deeds, of evincing such a spirit, of
rising to such heights, cannot but be already possessed of such
potentialities as will enable it to vindicate, in the fullness of
time, its right to be acclaimed as the chief creator and champion of
the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-8"></a><a name="adj_en-p19"></a>
Magnificent as has been this record, reminiscent as it is, in some of
its aspects, of the exploits with which the dawn-breakers of an
heroic Age have proclaimed the birth of the Faith itself, the task
associated with the name of this privileged community is, far from
approaching its climax, only beginning to unfold. What the American
believers have, within the space of almost fifty years, achieved is
infinitesimal when compared to the magnitude of the tasks ahead of
them. The rumblings of that catastrophic upheaval, which is to
proclaim, at one and the same time, the death-pangs of the old order
and the birth-pangs of the new, indicate both the steady approach, as
well as the awe-inspiring character, of those tasks.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p20"></a>
The virtual establishment of the Administrative Order of their Faith,
the erection of its framework, the fashioning of its instruments, and
the consolidation of its subsidiary institutions, was the first task
committed to their charge, as an organized community called into
being by the Will, and under the instructions, of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá.
Of this initial task they have acquitted themselves with marvelous
promptitude, fidelity, and vigor. No sooner had they created and
correlated the various and necessary agencies for the efficient
conduct of any policy they might subsequently wish to initiate, than
they addressed themselves, with equal zest and consecration, to the
next more arduous task of erecting the superstructure of an edifice
the cornerstone of which ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá Himself had laid.
And when that feat was achieved, this community, alive to the
passionate pleas, exhortations, and promises recorded in the Tablets
of the Divine Plan, resolved to undertake yet another task, which in
its scope and spiritual potentialities is sure to outshine any of the
works they have already accomplished. Launching with unquenchable
enthusiasm and dauntless courage the Seven Year Plan, as the first
and practical step towards the fulfillment of the mission prescribed
in those epoch-making Tablets, they entered, with a spirit of renewed
consecration, upon their dual task, the consummation of which, it is
hoped, will synchronize with the celebration of the centenary of the
birth of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Well aware that every
advance made in the external ornamentation of their majestic edifice
would directly react on the progress of the teaching campaign
initiated by them in both the northern and southern American
continents, and realizing that every victory gained in the teaching
field would, in its turn, facilitate the work, and hasten the
completion, of their Temple, they are now pressing on, with courage
and faith, in their efforts to discharge, in both of its phases,
their obligations under the Plan they have dedicated themselves to
execute.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p21"></a>
Let them not, however, imagine that the carrying out of the Seven
Year Plan, coinciding as it does with the termination of the first
century of the Bahá’í era, signifies either the termination of,
or even an interruption in, the work which the unerring Hand of the
Almighty is directing them to perform. The opening of the second
century of the Bahá’í era must needs disclose greater vistas,
usher in further stages, and witness the initiation of plans more
far-reaching than any as yet conceived. The Plan on which is now
focused the attention, the aspirations, and the resources of the
entire community of the American believers should be viewed as a mere
beginning, as a trial of strength, a stepping-stone to a crusade of
still greater magnitude, if the duties and responsibilities with
which the Author of the Divine Plan has invested them are to be
honorably and entirely fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-9"></a><a name="adj_en-p22"></a>
For the consummation of the present Plan can result in no more than
the formation of at least one center in each of the Republics of the
Western Hemisphere, whereas the duties prescribed in those Tablets
call for a wider diffusion, and imply the scattering of a far greater
and more representative number of the members of the North American
Bahá’í community over the entire surface of the New World. It is
the undoubted mission of the American believers, therefore, to carry
forward into the second century the glorious work initiated in the
closing years of the first. Not until they have played their part in
guiding the activities of these isolated and newly fledged centers,
and in fostering their capacity to initiate in their turn
institutions, both local and national, modeled on their own, can they
be satisfied to have adequately discharged their immediate
obligations under ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá’s divinely revealed Plan.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-10"></a><a name="adj_en-p23"></a>
Nor should it for a moment be supposed that the completion of a task
which aims at the multiplication of Bahá’í centers and the
provision of the assistance and guidance necessary for the
establishment of the Administrative Order of the Bahá’í Faith in
the countries of Latin America realizes in its entirety the scheme
visualized for them by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá. A perusal, however
perfunctory, of those Tablets embodying His Plan will instantly
reveal a scope for their activities that stretches far beyond the
confines of the Western Hemisphere. With their inter-American tasks
and responsibilities virtually discharged, their intercontinental
mission enters upon its most glorious and decisive phase. “<i>The
moment this Divine Message,</i>” ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá Himself
has written, “<i>is carried forward by the American believers from
the shores of America and is propagated through the continents of
Europe, of Asia, of Africa, and of Australasia, and as far as the
islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself securely
established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-11"></a><a name="adj_en-p24"></a>
And who knows but that when this colossal task has been accomplished
a greater, a still more superb mission, incomparable in its splendor,
and foreordained for them by Bahá’u’lláh, may not be thrust
upon them? The glories of such a mission are of such dazzling
splendor, the circumstances attending it so remote, and the
contemporary events with the culmination of which it is so closely
knit in such a state of flux, that it would be premature to attempt,
at the present time, any accurate delineation of its features.
Suffice it to say that out of the turmoil and tribulations of these
“latter years” opportunities undreamt of will be born, and
circumstances unpredictable created, that will enable, nay impel, the
victorious prosecutors of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá’s Plan, to add,
through the part they will play in the unrolling of the New World
Order, fresh laurels to the crown of their servitude to the threshold
of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-12"></a><a name="adj_en-p25"></a>
Nor should any of the manifold opportunities, of a totally different
order, be allowed to pass unnoticed which the evolution of the Faith
itself, whether at its world center, or in the North American
continent, or even in the most outlying regions of the earth, must
create, calling once again upon the American believers to play a
part, no less conspicuous than the share they have previously had in
their collective contributions to the propagation of the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh. I can only for the moment cite at random certain
of these opportunities which stand out preeminently, in any attempt
to survey the possibilities of the future: The election of the
International House of Justice and its establishment in the Holy
Land, the spiritual and administrative center of the Bahá’í
world, together with the formation of its auxiliary branches and
subsidiary institutions; the gradual erection of the various
dependencies of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the
West, and the intricate issues involving the establishment and the
extension of the structural basis of Bahá’í community life; the
codification and promulgation of the ordinances of the Most Holy
Book, necessitating the formation, in certain countries of the East,
of properly constituted and officially recognized courts of Bahá’í
law; the building of the third Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of
the Bahá’í world in the outskirts of the city of Ṭihrán, to be
followed by the rise of a similar House of Worship in the Holy Land
itself; the deliverance of Bahá’í communities from the fetters of
religious orthodoxy in such Islamic countries as Persia, ‘Iráq,
and Egypt, and the consequent recognition, by the civil authorities
in those states, of the independent status and religious character of
Bahá’í National and Local Assemblies; the precautionary and
defensive measures to be devised, coordinated, and carried out to
counteract the full force of the inescapable attacks which the
organized efforts of ecclesiastical organizations of various
denominations will progressively launch and relentlessly pursue; and,
last but not least, the multitudinous issues that must be faced, the
obstacles that must be overcome, and the responsibilities that must
be assumed, to enable a sore-tried Faith to pass through the
successive stages of unmitigated obscurity, of active repression, and
of complete emancipation, leading in turn to its being acknowledged
as an independent Faith, enjoying the status of full equality with
its sister religions, to be followed by its establishment and
recognition as a State religion, which in turn must give way to its
assumption of the rights and prerogatives associated with the Bahá’í
state, functioning in the plenitude of its powers, a stage which must
ultimately culminate in the emergence of the worldwide Bahá’í
Commonwealth, animated wholly by the spirit, and operating solely in
direct conformity with the laws and principles of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p26"></a>
The challenge offered by these opportunities the American believers,
I feel confident, will, in addition to their answer to the teaching
call voiced by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá in His Tablets, unhesitatingly
take up, and will, with their traditional fearlessness, tenacity, and
efficiency, so respond to it as to confirm, before all the world,
their title and rank as the champion-builders of the mightiest
institutions of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-13"></a><a name="adj_en-p27"></a>
Dearly beloved friends! Though the task be long and arduous, yet the
prize which the All-Bountiful Bestower has chosen to confer upon you
is of such preciousness that neither tongue nor pen can befittingly
appraise it. Though the goal towards which you are now so strenuously
striving be distant, and as yet undisclosed to men’s eyes, yet its
promise lies firmly embedded in the authoritative and unalterable
utterances of Bahá’u’lláh. Though the course He has traced for
you seems, at times, lost in the threatening shadows with which a
stricken humanity is now enveloped, yet the unfailing light He has
caused to shine continually upon you is of such brightness that no
earthly dusk can ever eclipse its splendor. Though small in numbers,
and circumscribed as yet in your experiences, powers, and resources,
yet the Force which energizes your mission is limitless in its range
and incalculable in its potency. Though the enemies which every
acceleration in the progress of your mission must raise up be fierce,
numerous, and unrelenting, yet the invisible Hosts which, if you
persevere, must, as promised, rush forth to your aid, will, in the
end, enable you to vanquish their hopes and annihilate their forces.
Though the ultimate blessings that must crown the consummation of
your mission be undoubted, and the Divine promises given you firm and
irrevocable, yet the measure of the goodly reward which every one of
you is to reap must depend on the extent to which your daily
exertions will have contributed to the expansion of that mission and
the hastening of its triumph.

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Dearly beloved friends! Great as is my love and admiration for you,
convinced as I am of the paramount share which you can, and will,
undoubtedly have in both the continental and international spheres of
future Bahá’í activity and service, I feel it nevertheless
incumbent upon me to utter, at this juncture, a word of warning. The
glowing tributes, so repeatedly and deservedly paid to the capacity,
the spirit, the conduct, and the high rank, of the American
believers, both individually and as an organic community, must, under
no circumstances, be confounded with the characteristics and nature
of the people from which God has raised them up. A sharp distinction
between that community and that people must be made, and resolutely
and fearlessly upheld, if we wish to give due recognition to the
transmuting power of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, in its impact on
the lives and standards of those who have chosen to enlist under His
banner. Otherwise, the supreme and distinguishing function of His
Revelation, which is none other than the calling into being of a new
race of men, will remain wholly unrecognized and completely obscured.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p29"></a>
How often have the Prophets of God, not excepting Bahá’u’lláh
Himself, chosen to appear, and deliver their Message in countries and
amidst peoples and races, at a time when they were either fast
declining, or had already touched the lowest depths of moral and
spiritual degradation. The appalling misery and wretchedness to which
the Israelites had sunk, under the debasing and tyrannical rule of
the Pharaohs, in the days preceding their exodus from Egypt under the
leadership of Moses; the decline that had set in in the religious,
the spiritual, the cultural, and the moral life of the Jewish people,
at the time of the appearance of Jesus Christ; the barbarous cruelty,
the gross idolatry and immorality, which had for so long been the
most distressing features of the tribes of Arabia and brought such
shame upon them when Muḥammad arose to proclaim His Message in
their midst; the indescribable state of decadence, with its attendant
corruption, confusion, intolerance, and oppression, in both the civil
and religious life of Persia, so graphically portrayed by the pen of
a considerable number of scholars, diplomats, and travelers, at the
hour of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh—all demonstrate this
basic and inescapable fact. To contend that the innate worthiness,
the high moral standard, the political aptitude, and social
attainments of any race or nation is the reason for the appearance in
its midst of any of these Divine Luminaries would be an absolute
perversion of historical facts, and would amount to a complete
repudiation of the undoubted interpretation placed upon them, so
clearly and emphatically, by both Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p30"></a>
How great, then, must be the challenge to those who, belonging to
such races and nations, and having responded to the call which these
Prophets have raised, to unreservedly recognize and courageously
testify to this indubitable truth, that not by reason of any racial
superiority, political capacity, or spiritual virtue which a race or
nation might possess, but rather as a direct consequence of its
crying needs, its lamentable degeneracy, and irremediable perversity,
has the Prophet of God chosen to appear in its midst, and with it as
a lever has lifted the entire human race to a higher and nobler plane
of life and conduct. For it is precisely under such circumstances,
and by such means that the Prophets have, from time immemorial,
chosen and were able to demonstrate their redemptive power to raise
from the depths of abasement and of misery, the people of their own
race and nation, empowering them to transmit in turn to other races
and nations the saving grace and the energizing influence of their
Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p31"></a>
In the light of this fundamental principle it should always be borne
in mind, nor can it be sufficiently emphasized, that the primary
reason why the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh chose to appear in Persia,
and to make it the first repository of their Revelation, was because,
of all the peoples and nations of the civilized world, that race and
nation had, as so often depicted by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, sunk to
such ignominious depths, and manifested so great a perversity, as to
find no parallel among its contemporaries. For no more convincing
proof could be adduced demonstrating the regenerating spirit
animating the Revelations proclaimed by the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh
than their power to transform what can be truly regarded as one of
the most backward, the most cowardly, and perverse of peoples into a
race of heroes, fit to effect in turn a similar revolution in the
life of mankind. To have appeared among a race or nation which by its
intrinsic worth and high attainments seemed to warrant the
inestimable privilege of being made the receptacle of such a
Revelation would in the eyes of an unbelieving world greatly reduce
the efficacy of that Message, and detract from the self-sufficiency
of its omnipotent power. The contrast so strikingly presented in the
pages of Nabíl’s Narrative between the heroism that immortalized
the life and deeds of the Dawn-Breakers and the degeneracy and
cowardice of their defamers and persecutors is in itself a most
impressive testimony to the truth of the Message of Him Who had
instilled such a spirit into the breasts of His disciples. For any
believer of that race to maintain that the excellence of his country
and the innate nobility of its people were the fundamental reasons
for its being singled out as the primary receptacle of the
Revelations of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh would be untenable in
the face of the overwhelming evidence afforded so convincingly by
that Narrative.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p32"></a>
To a lesser degree this principle must of necessity apply to the
country which has vindicated its right to be regarded as the cradle
of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. So great a function, so
noble a role, can be regarded as no less inferior to the part played
by those immortal souls who, through their sublime renunciation and
unparalleled deeds, have been responsible for the birth of the Faith
itself. Let not, therefore, those who are to participate so
predominantly in the birth of that world civilization, which is the
direct offspring of their Faith, imagine for a moment that for some
mysterious purpose or by any reason of inherent excellence or special
merit Bahá’u’lláh has chosen to confer upon their country and
people so great and lasting a distinction. It is precisely by reason
of the patent evils which, notwithstanding its other admittedly great
characteristics and achievements, an excessive and binding
materialism has unfortunately engendered within it that the Author of
their Faith and the Center of His Covenant have singled it out to
become the standard-bearer of the New World Order envisaged in their
writings. It is by such means as this that Bahá’u’lláh can best
demonstrate to a heedless generation His almighty power to raise up
from the very midst of a people, immersed in a sea of materialism, a
prey to one of the most virulent and long-standing forms of racial
prejudice, and notorious for its political corruption, lawlessness
and laxity in moral standards, men and women who, as time goes by,
will increasingly exemplify those essential virtues of
self-renunciation, of moral rectitude, of chastity, of
indiscriminating fellowship, of holy discipline, and of spiritual
insight that will fit them for the preponderating share they will
have in calling into being that World Order and that World
Civilization of which their country, no less than the entire human
race, stands in desperate need. Theirs will be the duty and
privilege, in their capacity first as the establishers of one of the
most powerful pillars sustaining the edifice of the Universal House
of Justice, and then as the champion-builders of that New World Order
of which that House is to be the nucleus and forerunner, to
inculcate, demonstrate, and apply those twin and sorely needed
principles of Divine justice and order—principles to which the
political corruption and the moral license, increasingly staining the
society to which they belong, offer so sad and striking a contrast.</p>

Observations such as these, however distasteful and depressing they
may be, should not, in the least, blind us to those virtues and
qualities of high intelligence, of youthfulness, of unbounded
initiative, and enterprise which the nation as a whole so
conspicuously displays, and which are being increasingly reflected by
the community of the believers within it. Upon these virtues and
qualities, no less than upon the elimination of the evils referred
to, must depend, to a very great extent, the ability of that
community to lay a firm foundation for the country’s future role in
ushering in the Golden Age of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-17"></a><a name="adj_en-p34"></a>
How great, therefore, how staggering the responsibility that must
weigh upon the present generation of the American believers, at this
early stage in their spiritual and administrative evolution, to weed
out, by every means in their power, those faults, habits, and
tendencies which they have inherited from their own nation, and to
cultivate, patiently and prayerfully, those distinctive qualities and
characteristics that are so indispensable to their effective
participation in the great redemptive work of their Faith. Incapable
as yet, in view of the restricted size of their community and the
limited influence it now wields, of producing any marked effect on
the great mass of their countrymen, let them focus their attention,
for the present, on their own selves, their own individual needs,
their own personal deficiencies and weaknesses, ever mindful that
every intensification of effort on their part will better equip them
for the time when they will be called upon to eradicate in their turn
such evil tendencies from the lives and the hearts of the entire body
of their fellow-citizens. Nor must they overlook the fact that the
World Order, whose basis they, as the advance-guard of the future
Bahá’í generations of their countrymen, are now laboring to
establish, can never be reared unless and until the generality of the
people to which they belong has been already purged from the divers
ills, whether social or political, that now so severely afflict it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-18"></a><a name="adj_en-p35"></a>
Surveying as a whole the most pressing needs of this community,
attempting to estimate the more serious deficiencies by which it is
being handicapped in the discharge of its task, and ever bearing in
mind the nature of that still greater task with which it will be
forced to wrestle in the future, I feel it my duty to lay special
stress upon, and draw the special and urgent attention of the entire
body of the American believers, be they young or old, white or
colored, teachers or administrators, veterans or newcomers, to what I
firmly believe are the essential requirements for the success of the
tasks which are now claiming their undivided attention. Great as is
the importance of fashioning the outward instruments, and of
perfecting the administrative agencies, which they can utilize for
the prosecution of their dual task under the Seven Year Plan; vital
and urgent as are the campaigns which they are initiating, the
schemes and projects which they are devising, and the funds which
they are raising, for the efficient conduct of both the Teaching and
Temple work, the imponderable, the spiritual, factors, which are
bound up with their own individual and inner lives, and with which
are associated their human and social relationships, are no less
urgent and vital, and demand constant scrutiny, continual
self-examination and heart-searching on their part, lest their value
be impaired or their vital necessity be obscured or forgotten.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p36"></a>
Of these spiritual prerequisites of success, which constitute the
bedrock on which the security of all teaching plans, Temple projects,
and financial schemes, must ultimately rest, the following stand out
as preeminent and vital, which the members of the American Bahá’í
community will do well to ponder. Upon the extent to which these
basic requirements are met, and the manner in which the American
believers fulfill them in their individual lives, administrative
activities, and social relationships, must depend the measure of the
manifold blessings which the All-Bountiful Possessor can vouchsafe to
them all. These requirements are none other than a high sense of
moral rectitude in their social and administrative activities,
absolute chastity in their individual lives, and complete freedom
from prejudice in their dealings with peoples of a different race,
class, creed, or color.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p37"></a>
The first is specially, though not exclusively, directed to their
elected representatives, whether local, regional, or national, who,
in their capacity as the custodians and members of the nascent
institutions of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, are shouldering the
chief responsibility in laying an unassailable foundation for that
Universal House of Justice which, as its title implies, is to be the
exponent and guardian of that Divine Justice which can alone insure
the security of, and establish the reign of law and order in, a
strangely disordered world. The second is mainly and directly
concerned with the Bahá’í youth, who can contribute so decisively
to the virility, the purity, and the driving force of the life of the
Bahá’í community, and upon whom must depend the future
orientation of its destiny, and the complete unfoldment of the
potentialities with which God has endowed it. The third should be the
immediate, the universal, and the chief concern of all and sundry
members of the Bahá’í community, of whatever age, rank,
experience, class, or color, as all, with no exception, must face its
challenging implications, and none can claim, however much he may
have progressed along this line, to have completely discharged the
stern responsibilities which it inculcates. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-19"></a><a name="adj_en-p38"></a>
A rectitude of conduct, an abiding sense of undeviating justice,
unobscured by the demoralizing influences which a corruption-ridden
political life so strikingly manifests; a chaste, pure, and holy
life, unsullied and unclouded by the indecencies, the vices, the
false standards, which an inherently deficient moral code tolerates,
perpetuates, and fosters; a fraternity freed from that cancerous
growth of racial prejudice, which is eating into the vitals of an
already debilitated society—these are the ideals which the American
believers must, from now on, individually and through concerted
action, strive to promote, in both their private and public lives,
ideals which are the chief propelling forces that can most
effectively accelerate the march of their institutions, plans, and
enterprises, that can guard the honor and integrity of their Faith,
and subdue any obstacles that may confront it in the future.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p39"></a>
This rectitude of conduct, with its implications of justice, equity,
truthfulness, honesty, fair-mindedness, reliability, and
trustworthiness, must distinguish every phase of the life of the
Bahá’í community. “<i>The companions of God,</i>” Bahá’u’lláh
Himself has declared, “<i>are, in this day, the lump that must
leaven the peoples of the world. They must show forth such
trustworthiness, such truthfulness and perseverance, such deeds and
character that all mankind may profit by their example.</i>” “<i>I
swear by Him Who is the Most Great Ocean!</i>” He again affirms,
“<i>Within the very breath of such souls as are pure and sanctified
far-reaching potentialities are hidden. So great are these
potentialities that they exercise their influence upon all created
things.</i>” “<i>He is the true servant of God,</i>” He, in
another passage has written, “<i>who, in this day, were he to pass
through cities of silver and gold, would not deign to look upon them,
and whose heart would remain pure and undefiled from whatever things
can be seen in this world, be they its goods or its treasures. I
swear by the Sun of Truth! The breath of such a man is endowed with
potency, and his words with attraction.</i>” “<i>By Him Who
shineth above the Dayspring of sanctity!</i>” He, still more
emphatically, has revealed, “<i>If the whole earth were to be
converted into silver and gold, no man who can be said to have truly
ascended into the heaven of faith and certitude would deign to regard
it, much less to seize and keep it.… They who dwell within the
Tabernacle of God, and are established upon the seats of everlasting
glory, will refuse, though they be dying of hunger, to stretch their
hands, and seize unlawfully the property of their neighbor, however
vile and worthless he may be. The purpose of the one true God in
manifesting Himself is to summon all mankind to truthfulness and
sincerity, to piety and trustworthiness, to resignation and
submissiveness to the will of God, to forbearance and kindliness, to
uprightness and wisdom. His object is to array every man with the
mantle of a saintly character, and to adorn him with the ornament of
holy and goodly deeds.</i>” “<i>We have admonished all the loved
ones of God,</i>” He insists, “<i>to take heed lest the hem of
Our sacred vesture be smirched with the mire of unlawful deeds, or be
stained with the dust of reprehensible conduct.</i>” “<i>Cleave
unto righteousness, O people of Bahá,</i>” He thus exhorts them,
“<i>This, verily, is the commandment which this wronged One hath
given unto you, and the first choice of His unrestrained will for
every one of you.</i>” “<i>A good character,</i>” He explains,
“<i>is, verily, the best mantle for men from God. With it He
adorneth the temples of His loved ones. By My life! The light of a
good character surpasseth the light of the sun and the radiance
thereof.</i>” “<i>One righteous act,</i>” He, again, has
written, “<i>is endowed with a potency that can so elevate the dust
as to cause it to pass beyond the heaven of heavens. It can tear
every bond asunder, and hath the power to restore the force that hath
spent itself and vanished.… Be pure, O people of God, be pure; be
righteous, be righteous.… Say: O people of God! That which can
insure the victory of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, His hosts and
helpers on earth, have been set down in the sacred Books and
Scriptures, and are as clear and manifest as the sun. These hosts are
such righteous deeds, such conduct and character, as are acceptable
in His sight. Whoso ariseth, in this Day, to aid Our Cause, and
summoneth to his assistance the hosts of a praiseworthy character and
upright conduct, the influence from such an action will, most
certainly, be diffused throughout the whole world.</i>” “<i>The
betterment of the world,</i>” is yet another statement, “<i>can
be accomplished through pure and goodly deeds, through commendable
and seemly conduct.</i>” “<i>Be fair to yourselves and to
others,</i>” He thus counseleth them, “<i>that the evidences of
justice may be revealed through your deeds among Our faithful
servants.</i>” “<i>Equity,</i>” He also has written, “<i>is
the most fundamental among human virtues. The evaluation of all
things must needs depend upon it.</i>” And again, “<i>Observe
equity in your judgment, ye men of understanding heart! He that is
unjust in his judgment is destitute of the characteristics that
distinguish man’s station.</i>” “<i>Beautify your tongues, O
people,</i>” He further admonishes them, “<i>with truthfulness,
and adorn your souls with the ornament of honesty. Beware, O people,
that ye deal not treacherously with anyone. Be ye the trustees of God
amongst His creatures, and the emblems of His generosity amidst His
people.</i>” “<i>Let your eye be chaste,</i>” is yet another
counsel, “<i>your hand faithful, your tongue truthful, and your
heart enlightened.</i>” “<i>Be an ornament to the countenance of
truth,</i>” is yet another admonition, “<i>a crown to the brow of
fidelity, a pillar of the temple of righteousness, a breath of life
to the body of mankind, an ensign of the hosts of justice, a luminary
above the horizon of virtue.</i>” “<i>Let truthfulness and
courtesy be your adorning,</i>” is still another admonition;
“<i>suffer not yourselves to be deprived of the robe of forbearance
and justice, that the sweet savors of holiness may be wafted from
your hearts upon all created things. Say: Beware, O people of Bahá,
lest ye walk in the ways of them whose words differ from their deeds.
Strive that ye may be enabled to manifest to the peoples of the earth
the signs of God, and to mirror forth His commandments. Let your acts
be a guide unto all mankind, for the professions of most men, be they
high or low, differ from their conduct. It is through your deeds that
ye can distinguish yourselves from others. Through them the
brightness of your light can be shed upon the whole earth. Happy is
the man that heedeth My counsel, and keepeth the precepts prescribed
by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p40"></a>
“<i>O army of God!</i>” writes ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, “<i>Through
the protection and help vouchsafed by the Blessed Beauty—may my
life be a sacrifice to His loved ones—ye must conduct yourselves in
such a manner that ye may stand out distinguished and brilliant as
the sun among other souls. Should any one of you enter a city, he
should become a center of attraction by reason of his sincerity, his
faithfulness and love, his honesty and fidelity, his truthfulness and
loving-kindness towards all the peoples of the world, so that the
people of that city may cry out and say: ‘This man is
unquestionably a Bahá’í, for his manners, his behavior, his
conduct, his morals, his nature, and disposition reflect the
attributes of the Bahá’ís.’ Not until ye attain this station
can ye be said to have been faithful to the Covenant and Testament of
God.</i>” “<i>The most vital duty, in this day,</i>” He,
moreover, has written, “<i>is to purify your characters, to correct
your manners, and improve your conduct. The beloved of the Merciful
must show forth such character and conduct among His creatures, that
the fragrance of their holiness may be shed upon the whole world, and
may quicken the dead, inasmuch as the purpose of the Manifestation of
God and the dawning of the limitless lights of the Invisible is to
educate the souls of men, and refine the character of every living
man.…</i>” “<i>Truthfulness,</i>” He asserts, “<i>is the
foundation of all human virtues. Without truthfulness progress and
success, in all the worlds of God, are impossible for any soul. When
this holy attribute is established in man, all the divine qualities
will also be acquired.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p41"></a>
Such a rectitude of conduct must manifest itself, with
ever-increasing potency, in every verdict which the elected
representatives of the Bahá’í community, in whatever capacity
they may find themselves, may be called upon to pronounce. It must be
constantly reflected in the business dealings of all its members, in
their domestic lives, in all manner of employment, and in any service
they may, in the future, render their government or people. It must
be exemplified in the conduct of all Bahá’í electors, when
exercising their sacred rights and functions. It must characterize
the attitude of every loyal believer towards nonacceptance of
political posts, nonidentification with political parties,
nonparticipation in political controversies, and nonmembership in
political organizations and ecclesiastical institutions. It must
reveal itself in the uncompromising adherence of all, whether young
or old, to the clearly enunciated and fundamental principles laid
down by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá in His addresses, and to the laws and
ordinances revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in His Most Holy Book. It
must be demonstrated in the impartiality of every defender of the
Faith against its enemies, in his fair-mindedness in recognizing any
merits that enemy may possess, and in his honesty in discharging any
obligations he may have towards him. It must constitute the brightest
ornament of the life, the pursuits, the exertions, and the utterances
of every Bahá’í teacher, whether laboring at home or abroad,
whether in the front ranks of the teaching force, or occupying a less
active and responsible position. It must be made the hallmark of that
numerically small, yet intensely dynamic and highly responsible body
of the elected national representatives of every Bahá’í
community, which constitutes the sustaining pillar, and the sole
instrument for the election, in every community, of that Universal
House whose very name and title, as ordained by Bahá’u’lláh,
symbolizes that rectitude of conduct which is its highest mission to
safeguard and enforce.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p42"></a>
So great and transcendental is this principle of Divine justice, a
principle that must be regarded as the crowning distinction of all
Local and National Assemblies, in their capacity as forerunners of
the Universal House of Justice, that Bahá’u’lláh Himself
subordinates His personal inclination and wish to the all-compelling
force of its demands and implications. “<i>God is My witness!</i>”
He thus explains, “<i>were it not contrary to the Law of God, I
would have kissed the hand of My would-be murderer, and would cause
him to inherit My earthly goods. I am restrained, however, by the
binding Law laid down in the Book, and am Myself bereft of all
worldly possessions.</i>” “<i>Know thou, of a truth,</i>” He
significantly affirms, “<i>these great oppressions that have
befallen the world are preparing it for the advent of the Most Great
Justice.</i>” “<i>Say,</i>” He again asserts, “<i>He hath
appeared with that Justice wherewith mankind hath been adorned, and
yet the people are, for the most part, asleep.</i>” “<i>The light
of men is Justice,</i>” He moreover states, “<i>Quench it not
with the contrary winds of oppression and tyranny. The purpose of
justice is the appearance of unity among men.</i>” “<i>No
radiance,</i>” He declares, “<i>can compare with that of justice.
The organization of the world and the tranquillity of mankind depend
upon it.</i>” “<i>O people of God!</i>” He exclaims, “<i>That
which traineth the world is Justice, for it is upheld by two pillars,
reward and punishment. These two pillars are the sources of life to
the world.</i>” “<i>Justice and equity,</i>” is yet another
assertion, “<i>are two guardians for the protection of man. They
have appeared arrayed in their mighty and sacred names to maintain
the world in uprightness and protect the nations.</i>” “<i>Bestir
yourselves, O people,</i>” is His emphatic warning, “<i>in
anticipation of the days of Divine justice, for the promised hour is
now come. Beware lest ye fail to apprehend its import, and be
accounted among the erring.</i>” “<i>The day is approaching,</i>”
He similarly has written, “<i>when the faithful will behold the
daystar of justice shining in its full splendor from the dayspring of
glory.</i>” “<i>The shame I was made to bear,</i>” He
significantly remarks, “<i>hath uncovered the glory with which the
whole of creation had been invested, and through the cruelties I have
endured, the daystar of justice hath manifested itself, and shed its
splendor upon men.</i>” “<i>The world,</i>” He again has
written, “<i>is in great turmoil, and the minds of its people are
in a state of utter confusion. We entreat the Almighty that He may
graciously illuminate them with the glory of His Justice, and enable
them to discover that which will be profitable unto them at all times
and under all conditions.</i>” And again, “<i>There can be no
doubt whatever that if the daystar of justice, which the clouds of
tyranny have obscured, were to shed its light upon men, the face of
the earth would be completely transformed.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p43"></a>
“<i>God be praised!</i>” ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, in His turn,
exclaims, “<i>The sun of justice hath risen above the horizon of
Bahá’u’lláh. For in His Tablets the foundations of such a
justice have been laid as no mind hath, from the beginning of
creation, conceived.</i>” “<i>The canopy of existence,</i>” He
further explains, “<i>resteth upon the pole of justice, and not of
forgiveness, and the life of mankind dependeth on justice and not on
forgiveness.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p44"></a>
Small wonder, therefore, that the Author of the Bahá’í Revelation
should have chosen to associate the name and title of that House,
which is to be the crowning glory of His administrative institutions,
not with forgiveness but with justice, to have made justice the only
basis and the permanent foundation of His Most Great Peace, and to
have proclaimed it in His Hidden Words as “<i>the best beloved of
all things</i>” in His sight. It is to the American believers,
particularly, that I feel urged to direct this fervent plea to ponder
in their hearts the implications of this moral rectitude, and to
uphold, with heart and soul and uncompromisingly, both individually
and collectively, this sublime standard—a standard of which justice
is so essential and potent an element.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-20"></a><a name="adj_en-p45"></a>
As to a chaste and holy life, it should be regarded as no less
essential a factor that must contribute its proper share to the
strengthening and vitalization of the Bahá’í community, upon
which must in turn depend the success of any Bahá’í plan or
enterprise. In these days when the forces of irreligion are weakening
the moral fiber, and undermining the foundations of individual
morality, the obligation of chastity and holiness must claim an
increasing share of the attention of the American believers, both in
their individual capacities and as the responsible custodians of the
interests of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. In the discharge of such
an obligation, to which the special circumstances resulting from an
excessive and enervating materialism now prevailing in their country
lend particular significance, they must play a conspicuous and
predominant role. All of them, be they men or women, must, at this
threatening hour when the lights of religion are fading out, and its
restraints are one by one being abolished, pause to examine
themselves, scrutinize their conduct, and with characteristic
resolution arise to purge the life of their community of every trace
of moral laxity that might stain the name, or impair the integrity,
of so holy and precious a Faith.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p46"></a>
A chaste and holy life must be made the controlling principle in the
behavior and conduct of all Bahá’ís, both in their social
relations with the members of their own community, and in their
contact with the world at large. It must adorn and reinforce the
ceaseless labors and meritorious exertions of those whose enviable
position is to propagate the Message, and to administer the affairs,
of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. It must be upheld, in all its
integrity and implications, in every phase of the life of those who
fill the ranks of that Faith, whether in their homes, their travels,
their clubs, their societies, their entertainments, their schools,
and their universities. It must be accorded special consideration in
the conduct of the social activities of every Bahá’í summer
school and any other occasions on which Bahá’í community life is
organized and fostered. It must be closely and continually identified
with the mission of the Bahá’í youth, both as an element in the
life of the Bahá’í community, and as a factor in the future
progress and orientation of the youth of their own country.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p47"></a>
Such a chaste and holy life, with its implications of modesty,
purity, temperance, decency, and clean-mindedness, involves no less
than the exercise of moderation in all that pertains to dress,
language, amusements, and all artistic and literary avocations. It
demands daily vigilance in the control of one’s carnal desires and
corrupt inclinations. It calls for the abandonment of a frivolous
conduct, with its excessive attachment to trivial and often
misdirected pleasures. It requires total abstinence from all
alcoholic drinks, from opium, and from similar habit-forming drugs.
It condemns the prostitution of art and of literature, the practices
of nudism and of companionate marriage, infidelity in marital
relationships, and all manner of promiscuity, of easy familiarity,
and of sexual vices. It can tolerate no compromise with the theories,
the standards, the habits, and the excesses of a decadent age. Nay
rather it seeks to demonstrate, through the dynamic force of its
example, the pernicious character of such theories, the falsity of
such standards, the hollowness of such claims, the perversity of such
habits, and the sacrilegious character of such excesses.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p48"></a>
“<i>By the righteousness of God!</i>” writes Bahá’u’lláh,
“<i>The world, its vanities and its glory, and whatever delights it
can offer, are all, in the sight of God, as worthless as, nay even
more contemptible than, dust and ashes. Would that the hearts of men
could comprehend it. Wash yourselves thoroughly, O people of Bahá,
from the defilement of the world, and of all that pertaineth unto it.
God Himself beareth Me witness! The things of the earth ill beseem
you. Cast them away unto such as may desire them, and fasten your
eyes upon this most holy and effulgent Vision.</i>” “<i>O ye My
loved ones!</i>” He thus exhorts His followers, “<i>Suffer not
the hem of My sacred vesture to be smirched and mired with the things
of this world, and follow not the promptings of your evil and corrupt
desires.</i>” And again, “<i>O ye the beloved of the one true
God! Pass beyond the narrow retreats of your evil and corrupt
desires, and advance into the vast immensity of the realm of God, and
abide ye in the meads of sanctity and of detachment, that the
fragrance of your deeds may lead the whole of mankind to the ocean of
God’s unfading glory.</i>” “<i>Disencumber yourselves,</i>”
He thus commands them, “<i>of all attachment to this world and the
vanities thereof. Beware that ye approach them not, inasmuch as they
prompt you to walk after your own lusts and covetous desires, and
hinder you from entering the straight and glorious Path.</i>”
“<i>Eschew all manner of wickedness,</i>” is His commandment,
“<i>for such things are forbidden unto you in the Book which none
touch except such as God hath cleansed from every taint of guilt, and
numbered among the purified.</i>” “<i>A race of men,</i>” is
His written promise, “<i>incomparable in character, shall be raised
up which, with the feet of detachment, will tread under all who are
in heaven and on earth, and will cast the sleeve of holiness over all
that hath been created from water and clay.</i>” “<i>The
civilization,</i>” is His grave warning, “<i>so often vaunted by
the learned exponents of arts and sciences, will, if allowed to
overleap the bounds of moderation, bring great evil upon men.… If
carried to excess, civilization will prove as prolific a source of
evil as it had been of goodness when kept within the restraints of
moderation.</i>” “<i>He hath chosen out of the whole world the
hearts of His servants,</i>” He explains, “<i>and made them each
a seat for the revelation of His glory. Wherefore, sanctify them from
every defilement, that the things for which they were created may be
engraven upon them. This indeed is a token of God’s bountiful
favor.</i>” “<i>Say,</i>” He proclaims, “<i>He is not to be
numbered with the people of Bahá who followeth his mundane desires,
or fixeth his heart on things of the earth. He is My true follower
who, if he come to a valley of pure gold will pass straight through
it aloof as a cloud, and will neither turn back, nor pause. Such a
man is assuredly of Me. From his garment the Concourse on high can
inhale the fragrance of sanctity.… And if he met the fairest and
most comely of women, he would not feel his heart seduced by the
least shadow of desire for her beauty. Such an one indeed is the
creation of spotless chastity. Thus instructeth you the Pen of the
Ancient of Days, as bidden by your Lord, the Almighty, the
All-Bountiful.</i>” “<i>They that follow their lusts and corrupt
inclinations,</i>” is yet another warning, “<i>have erred and
dissipated their efforts. They indeed are of the lost.</i>” “<i>It
behooveth the people of Bahá,</i>” He also has written, “<i>to
die to the world and all that is therein, to be so detached from all
earthly things that the inmates of Paradise may inhale from their
garment the sweet smelling savor of sanctity.… They that have
tarnished the fair name of the Cause of God by following the things
of the flesh—these are in palpable error!</i>” “<i>Purity and
chastity,</i>” He particularly admonishes, “<i>have been, and
still are, the most great ornaments for the handmaidens of God. God
is My Witness! The brightness of the light of chastity sheddeth its
illumination upon the worlds of the spirit, and its fragrance is
wafted even unto the Most Exalted Paradise.</i>” “<i>God,</i>”
He again affirms, “<i>hath verily made chastity to be a crown for
the heads of His handmaidens. Great is the blessedness of that
handmaiden that hath attained unto this great station.</i>” “<i>We,
verily, have decreed in Our Book,</i>” is His assurance, “<i>a
goodly and bountiful reward to whosoever will turn away from
wickedness, and lead a chaste and godly life. He, in truth, is the
Great Giver, the All-Bountiful.</i>” “<i>We have sustained the
weight of all calamities,</i>” He testifies, “<i>to sanctify you
from all earthly corruption and ye are yet indifferent.… We,
verily, behold your actions. If We perceive from them the sweet
smelling savor of purity and holiness, We will most certainly bless
you. Then will the tongues of the inmates of Paradise utter your
praise and magnify your names amidst them who have drawn nigh unto
God.</i>”

“<i>The drinking of wine,</i>” writes ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá,
“<i>is, according to the text of the Most Holy Book, forbidden; for
it is the cause of chronic diseases, weakeneth the nerves, and
consumeth the mind.</i>” “<i>Drink ye, O handmaidens of God,</i>”
Bahá’u’lláh Himself has affirmed, “<i>the Mystic Wine from
the cup of My words. Cast away, then, from you that which your minds
abhor, for it hath been forbidden unto you in His Tablets and His
Scriptures. Beware lest ye barter away the River that is life indeed
for that which the souls of the pure-hearted detest. Become ye
intoxicated with the wine of the love of God, and not with that which
deadeneth your minds, O ye that adore Him! Verily, it hath been
forbidden unto every believer, whether man or woman. Thus hath the
sun of My commandment shone forth above the horizon of My utterance,
that the handmaidens who believe in Me may be illumined.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p50"></a>
It must be remembered, however, that the maintenance of such a high
standard of moral conduct is not to be associated or confused with
any form of asceticism, or of excessive and bigoted puritanism. The
standard inculcated by Bahá’u’lláh seeks, under no
circumstances, to deny anyone the legitimate right and privilege to
derive the fullest advantage and benefit from the manifold joys,
beauties, and pleasures with which the world has been so plentifully
enriched by an All-Loving Creator. “<i>Should a man,</i>”
Bahá’u’lláh Himself reassures us, “<i>wish to adorn himself
with the ornaments of the earth, to wear its apparels, or partake of
the benefits it can bestow, no harm can befall him, if he alloweth
nothing whatever to intervene between him and God, for God hath
ordained every good thing, whether created in the heavens or in the
earth, for such of His servants as truly believe in Him. Eat ye, O
people, of the good things which God hath allowed you, and deprive
not yourselves from His wondrous bounties. Render thanks and praise
unto Him, and be of them that are truly thankful.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-21"></a><a name="adj_en-p51"></a>
As to racial prejudice, the corrosion of which, for well-nigh a
century, has bitten into the fiber, and attacked the whole social
structure of American society, it should be regarded as constituting
the most vital and challenging issue confronting the Bahá’í
community at the present stage of its evolution. The ceaseless
exertions which this issue of paramount importance calls for, the
sacrifices it must impose, the care and vigilance it demands, the
moral courage and fortitude it requires, the tact and sympathy it
necessitates, invest this problem, which the American believers are
still far from having satisfactorily resolved, with an urgency and
importance that cannot be overestimated. White and Negro, high and
low, young and old, whether newly converted to the Faith or not, all
who stand identified with it must participate in, and lend their
assistance, each according to his or her capacity, experience, and
opportunities, to the common task of fulfilling the instructions,
realizing the hopes, and following the example, of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá.
Whether colored or noncolored, neither race has the right, or can
conscientiously claim, to be regarded as absolved from such an
obligation, as having realized such hopes, or having faithfully
followed such an example. A long and thorny road, beset with
pitfalls, still remains untraveled, both by the white and the Negro
exponents of the redeeming Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. On the
distance they cover, and the manner in which they travel that road,
must depend, to an extent which few among them can imagine, the
operation of those intangible influences which are indispensable to
the spiritual triumph of the American believers and the material
success of their newly launched enterprise.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p52"></a>
Let them call to mind, fearlessly and determinedly, the example and
conduct of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá while in their midst. Let them
remember His courage, His genuine love, His informal and
indiscriminating fellowship, His contempt for and impatience of
criticism, tempered by His tact and wisdom. Let them revive and
perpetuate the memory of those unforgettable and historic episodes
and occasions on which He so strikingly demonstrated His keen sense
of justice, His spontaneous sympathy for the downtrodden, His
ever-abiding sense of the oneness of the human race, His overflowing
love for its members, and His displeasure with those who dared to
flout His wishes, to deride His methods, to challenge His principles,
or to nullify His acts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p53"></a>
To discriminate against any race, on the ground of its being socially
backward, politically immature, and numerically in a minority, is a
flagrant violation of the spirit that animates the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh. The consciousness of any division or cleavage in
its ranks is alien to its very purpose, principles, and ideals. Once
its members have fully recognized the claim of its Author, and, by
identifying themselves with its Administrative Order, accepted
unreservedly the principles and laws embodied in its teachings, every
differentiation of class, creed, or color must automatically be
obliterated, and never be allowed, under any pretext, and however
great the pressure of events or of public opinion, to reassert
itself. If any discrimination is at all to be tolerated, it should be
a discrimination not against, but rather in favor of the minority, be
it racial or otherwise. Unlike the nations and peoples of the earth,
be they of the East or of the West, democratic or authoritarian,
communist or capitalist, whether belonging to the Old World or the
New, who either ignore, trample upon, or extirpate, the racial,
religious, or political minorities within the sphere of their
jurisdiction, every organized community enlisted under the banner of
Bahá’u’lláh should feel it to be its first and inescapable
obligation to nurture, encourage, and safeguard every minority
belonging to any faith, race, class, or nation within it. So great
and vital is this principle that in such circumstances, as when an
equal number of ballots have been cast in an election, or where the
qualifications for any office are balanced as between the various
races, faiths or nationalities within the community, priority should
unhesitatingly be accorded the party representing the minority, and
this for no other reason except to stimulate and encourage it, and
afford it an opportunity to further the interests of the community.
In the light of this principle, and bearing in mind the extreme
desirability of having the minority elements participate and share
responsibility in the conduct of Bahá’í activity, it should be
the duty of every Bahá’í community so to arrange its affairs that
in cases where individuals belonging to the divers minority elements
within it are already qualified and fulfill the necessary
requirements, Bahá’í representative institutions, be they
Assemblies, conventions, conferences, or committees, may have
represented on them as many of these divers elements, racial or
otherwise, as possible. The adoption of such a course, and faithful
adherence to it, would not only be a source of inspiration and
encouragement to those elements that are numerically small and
inadequately represented, but would demonstrate to the world at large
the universality and representative character of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh, and the freedom of His followers from the taint of
those prejudices which have already wrought such havoc in the
domestic affairs, as well as the foreign relationships, of the
nations.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p54"></a>
Freedom from racial prejudice, in any of its forms, should, at such a
time as this when an increasingly large section of the human race is
falling a victim to its devastating ferocity, be adopted as the
watchword of the entire body of the American believers, in whichever
state they reside, in whatever circles they move, whatever their age,
traditions, tastes, and habits. It should be consistently
demonstrated in every phase of their activity and life, whether in
the Bahá’í community or outside it, in public or in private,
formally as well as informally, individually as well as in their
official capacity as organized groups, committees and Assemblies. It
should be deliberately cultivated through the various and everyday
opportunities, no matter how insignificant, that present themselves,
whether in their homes, their business offices, their schools and
colleges, their social parties and recreation grounds, their Bahá’í
meetings, conferences, conventions, summer schools and Assemblies. It
should, above all else, become the keynote of the policy of that
august body which, in its capacity as the national representative,
and the director and coordinator of the affairs of the community,
must set the example, and facilitate the application of such a vital
principle to the lives and activities of those whose interests it
safeguards and represents.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p55"></a>
“<i>O ye discerning ones!</i>” Bahá’u’lláh has written,
“<i>Verily, the words which have descended from the heaven of the
Will of God are the source of unity and harmony for the world. Close
your eyes to racial differences, and welcome all with the light of
oneness.</i>” “<i>We desire but the good of the world and the
happiness of the nations,</i>” He proclaims, “<i>…that all
nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the
bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should be
strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease, and
differences of race be annulled.</i>” “<i>Bahá’u’lláh hath
said,</i>” writes ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, “<i>that the various
races of humankind lend a composite harmony and beauty of color to
the whole. Let all associate, therefore, in this great human garden
even as flowers grow and blend together side by side without discord
or disagreement between them.</i>” “<i>Bahá’u’lláh,</i>”
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá moreover has said, “<i>once compared the
colored people to the black pupil of the eye surrounded by the white.
In this black pupil is seen the reflection of that which is before
it, and through it the light of the spirit shineth forth.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p56"></a>
“<i>God,</i>” ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá Himself declares, “<i>maketh
no distinction between the white and the black. If the hearts are
pure both are acceptable unto Him. God is no respecter of persons on
account of either color or race. All colors are acceptable unto Him,
be they white, black, or yellow. Inasmuch as all were created in the
image of God, we must bring ourselves to realize that all embody
divine possibilities.</i>” “<i>In the estimation of God,</i>”
He states, “<i>all men are equal. There is no distinction or
preference for any soul, in the realm of His justice and equity.</i>”
“<i>God did not make these divisions,</i>” He affirms; “<i>these
divisions have had their origin in man himself. Therefore, as they
are against the plan and purpose of God they are false and
imaginary.</i>” “<i>In the estimation of God,</i>” He again
affirms, “<i>there is no distinction of color; all are one in the
color and beauty of servitude to Him. Color is not important; the
heart is all-important. It mattereth not what the exterior may be if
the heart is pure and white within. God doth not behold differences
of hue and complexion. He looketh at the hearts. He whose morals and
virtues are praiseworthy is preferred in the presence of God; he who
is devoted to the Kingdom is most beloved. In the realm of genesis
and creation the question of color is of least importance.</i>”
“<i>Throughout the animal kingdom,</i>” He explains, “<i>we do
not find the creatures separated because of color. They recognize
unity of species and oneness of kind. If we do not find color
distinction drawn in a kingdom of lower intelligence and reason, how
can it be justified among human beings, especially when we know that
all have come from the same source and belong to the same household?
In origin and intention of creation mankind is one. Distinctions of
race and color have arisen afterward.</i>” “<i>Man is endowed
with superior reasoning power and the faculty of perception</i>”;
He further explains, “<i>he is the manifestation of divine
bestowals. Shall racial ideas prevail and obscure the creative
purpose of unity in his kingdom?</i>” “<i>One of the important
questions,</i>” He significantly remarks, “<i>which affect the
unity and the solidarity of mankind is the fellowship and equality of
the white and colored races. Between these two races certain points
of agreement and points of distinction exist which warrant just and
mutual consideration. The points of contact are many.… In this
country, the United States of America, patriotism is common to both
races; all have equal rights to citizenship, speak one language,
receive the blessings of the same civilization, and follow the
precepts of the same religion. In fact numerous points of partnership
and agreement exist between the two races, whereas the one point of
distinction is that of color. Shall this, the least of all
distinctions, be allowed to separate you as races and individuals?</i>”
“<i>This variety in forms and coloring,</i>” He stresses, “<i>which
is manifest in all the kingdoms is according to creative Wisdom and
hath a divine purpose.</i>” “<i>The diversity in the human
family,</i>” He claims, “<i>should be the cause of love and
harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together
in the making of a perfect chord.</i>” “<i>If you meet,</i>” is
His admonition, “<i>those of a different race and color from
yourself, do not mistrust them, and withdraw yourself into your shell
of conventionality, but rather be glad and show them kindness.</i>”
“<i>In the world of being,</i>” He testifies, “<i>the meeting
is blessed when the white and colored races meet together with
infinite spiritual love and heavenly harmony. When such meetings are
established, and the participants associate with each other with
perfect love, unity and kindness, the angels of the Kingdom praise
them, and the Beauty of Bahá’u’lláh addresseth them, ‘Blessed
are ye! Blessed are ye!’</i>” “<i>When a gathering of these two
races is brought about,</i>” He likewise asserts, “<i>that
assemblage will become the magnet of the Concourse on high, and the
confirmation of the Blessed Beauty will surround it.</i>” “<i>Strive
earnestly,</i>” He again exhorts both races, “<i>and put forth
your greatest endeavor toward the accomplishment of this fellowship
and the cementing of this bond of brotherhood between you. Such an
attainment is not possible without will and effort on the part of
each; from one, expressions of gratitude and appreciation; from the
other, kindliness and recognition of equality. Each one should
endeavor to develop and assist the other toward mutual advancement.…
Love and unity will be fostered between you, thereby bringing about
the oneness of mankind. For the accomplishment of unity between the
colored and white will be an assurance of the world’s peace.</i>”
“<i>I hope,</i>” He thus addresses members of the white race,
“<i>that ye may cause that downtrodden race to become glorious, and
to be joined with the white race, to serve the world of man with the
utmost sincerity, faithfulness, love, and purity. This opposition,
enmity, and prejudice among the white race and the colored cannot be
effaced except through faith, assurance, and the teachings of the
Blessed Beauty.</i>” “<i>This question of the union of the white
and the black is very important,</i>” He warns, “<i>for if it is
not realized, erelong great difficulties will arise, and harmful
results will follow.</i>” “<i>If this matter remaineth without
change,</i>” is yet another warning, “<i>enmity will be increased
day by day, and the final result will be hardship and may end in
bloodshed.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p57"></a>
A tremendous effort is required by both races if their outlook, their
manners, and conduct are to reflect, in this darkened age, the spirit
and teachings of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Casting away once
and for all the fallacious doctrine of racial superiority, with all
its attendant evils, confusion, and miseries, and welcoming and
encouraging the intermixture of races, and tearing down the barriers
that now divide them, they should each endeavor, day and night, to
fulfill their particular responsibilities in the common task which so
urgently faces them. Let them, while each is attempting to contribute
its share to the solution of this perplexing problem, call to mind
the warnings of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, and visualize, while there
is yet time, the dire consequences that must follow if this
challenging and unhappy situation that faces the entire American
nation is not definitely remedied.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p58"></a>
Let the white make a supreme effort in their resolve to contribute
their share to the solution of this problem, to abandon once for all
their usually inherent and at times subconscious sense of
superiority, to correct their tendency towards revealing a
patronizing attitude towards the members of the other race, to
persuade them through their intimate, spontaneous and informal
association with them of the genuineness of their friendship and the
sincerity of their intentions, and to master their impatience of any
lack of responsiveness on the part of a people who have received, for
so long a period, such grievous and slow-healing wounds. Let the
Negroes, through a corresponding effort on their part, show by every
means in their power the warmth of their response, their readiness to
forget the past, and their ability to wipe out every trace of
suspicion that may still linger in their hearts and minds. Let
neither think that the solution of so vast a problem is a matter that
exclusively concerns the other. Let neither think that such a problem
can either easily or immediately be resolved. Let neither think that
they can wait confidently for the solution of this problem until the
initiative has been taken, and the favorable circumstances created,
by agencies that stand outside the orbit of their Faith. Let neither
think that anything short of genuine love, extreme patience, true
humility, consummate tact, sound initiative, mature wisdom, and
deliberate, persistent, and prayerful effort, can succeed in blotting
out the stain which this patent evil has left on the fair name of
their common country. Let them rather believe, and be firmly
convinced, that on their mutual understanding, their amity, and
sustained cooperation, must depend, more than on any other force or
organization operating outside the circle of their Faith, the
deflection of that dangerous course so greatly feared by
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, and the materialization of the hopes He
cherished for their joint contribution to the fulfillment of that
country’s glorious destiny.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-22"></a><a name="adj_en-p59"></a>
Dearly beloved friends! A rectitude of conduct which, in all its
manifestations, offers a striking contrast to the deceitfulness and
corruption that characterize the political life of the nation and of
the parties and factions that compose it; a holiness and chastity
that are diametrically opposed to the moral laxity and licentiousness
which defile the character of a not inconsiderable proportion of its
citizens; an interracial fellowship completely purged from the curse
of racial prejudice which stigmatizes the vast majority of its
people—these are the weapons which the American believers can and
must wield in their double crusade, first to regenerate the inward
life of their own community, and next to assail the long-standing
evils that have entrenched themselves in the life of their nation.
The perfection of such weapons, the wise and effective utilization of
every one of them, more than the furtherance of any particular plan,
or the devising of any special scheme, or the accumulation of any
amount of material resources, can prepare them for the time when the
Hand of Destiny will have directed them to assist in creating and in
bringing into operation that World Order which is now incubating
within the worldwide administrative institutions of their Faith.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p60"></a>
In the conduct of this twofold crusade the valiant warriors
struggling in the name and for the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh must,
of necessity, encounter stiff resistance, and suffer many a setback.
Their own instincts, no less than the fury of conservative forces,
the opposition of vested interests, and the objections of a corrupt
and pleasure-seeking generation, must be reckoned with, resolutely
resisted, and completely overcome. As their defensive measures for
the impending struggle are organized and extended, storms of abuse
and ridicule, and campaigns of condemnation and misrepresentation,
may be unloosed against them. Their Faith, they may soon find, has
been assaulted, their motives misconstrued, their aims defamed, their
aspirations derided, their institutions scorned, their influence
belittled, their authority undermined, and their Cause, at times,
deserted by a few who will either be incapable of appreciating the
nature of their ideals, or unwilling to bear the brunt of the
mounting criticisms which such a contest is sure to involve. “<i>Because
of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá,</i>” the beloved Master has prophesied,
“<i>many a test will be visited upon you. Troubles will befall you,
and suffering afflict you.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p61"></a>
Let not, however, the invincible army of Bahá’u’lláh, who in
the West, and at one of its potential storm centers is to fight, in
His name and for His sake, one of its fiercest and most glorious
battles, be afraid of any criticism that might be directed against
it. Let it not be deterred by any condemnation with which the tongue
of the slanderer may seek to debase its motives. Let it not recoil
before the threatening advance of the forces of fanaticism, of
orthodoxy, of corruption, and of prejudice that may be leagued
against it. The voice of criticism is a voice that indirectly
reinforces the proclamation of its Cause. Unpopularity but serves to
throw into greater relief the contrast between it and its
adversaries, while ostracism is itself the magnetic power that must
eventually win over to its camp the most vociferous and inveterate
amongst its foes. Already in the land where the greatest battles of
the Faith have been fought, and its most rapacious enemies have
lived, the march of events, the slow yet steady infiltration of its
ideals, and the fulfillment of its prophecies, have resulted not only
in disarming and in transforming the character of some of its most
redoubtable enemies, but also in securing their firm and unreserved
allegiance to its Founders. So complete a transformation, so
startling a reversal of attitude, can only be effected if that chosen
vehicle which is designed to carry the Message of Bahá’u’lláh
to the hungry, the restless, and unshepherded multitudes is itself
thoroughly cleansed from the defilements which it seeks to remove.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p62"></a>
It is upon you, therefore, my best-beloved friends, that I wish to
impress not only the urgency and imperative necessity of your holy
task, but also the limitless possibilities which it possesses of
raising to such an exalted level not only the life and activities of
your own community, but the motives and standards that govern the
relationships existing among the people to which you belong.
Undismayed by the formidable nature of this task, you will, I am
confident, meet as befits you the challenge of these times, so
fraught with peril, so full of corruption, and yet so pregnant with
the promise of a future so bright that no previous age in the annals
of mankind can rival its glory.

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Dearly beloved friends! I have attempted, in the beginning of these
pages, to convey an idea of the glorious opportunities as well as the
tremendous responsibilities which, as a result of the persecution of
the far-flung Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, now face the community of
the American believers, at so critical a stage in the Formative
Period of their Faith, and in so crucial an epoch in the world’s
history. I have dwelt sufficiently upon the character of the mission
which in a not too distant future that community must, through the
impelling force of circumstances, arise and carry out. I have uttered
the warning which I felt would be necessary to a clearer
understanding, and a better discharge, of the tasks lying ahead of
it. I have set forth, and stressed as far as it was in my power,
those exalted and dynamic virtues, those lofty standards, which,
difficult as they are to attain, constitute nonetheless the essential
requirements for the success of those tasks. A word, I believe,
should now be said in connection with the material aspect of their
immediate task, upon the termination of which, at its appointed time,
must depend not only the unfoldment of the subsequent stages in the
Divine Plan envisaged by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, but also the
acquisition of those capacities which will qualify them to discharge,
in the fullness of time, the duties and responsibilities demanded by
that greater mission which it is their privilege to perform.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-24"></a><a name="adj_en-p64"></a>
The Seven Year Plan, with its twofold aspects of Temple ornamentation
and extension of teaching activity, embracing both the Northern and
Southern American continents, is now well advanced into its second
year, and offers to anyone who has observed its progress in recent
months signs that are extremely heartening and which augur well for
the attainment of its objectives within the allotted time. The
successive steps designed to facilitate, and covering the entire
field of, the work to be achieved in connection with the exterior
ornamentation of the Temple have for the most part been taken. The
final phase which is to mark the triumphant conclusion of a
thirty-year old enterprise has at long last been entered. The initial
contract connected with the first and main story of that historic
edifice has been signed. The Fund associated with the beloved name of
the Greatest Holy Leaf has been launched. The uninterrupted
continuation to its very end of so laudable an enterprise is now
assured. The poignant memories of one whose heart so greatly rejoiced
at the rearing of the superstructure of this sacred House will so
energize the final exertions required to complete it as to dissipate
any doubt that may yet linger in any mind as to the capacity of its
builders to worthily consummate their task.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-25"></a><a name="adj_en-p65"></a>
The teaching aspect of the Plan must now be pondered. Its challenge
must be met, and its requirements studied, weighed, and fulfilled.
Superb and irresistible as is the beauty of the first
Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the West, majestic as are its
dimensions, unique as is its architecture, and priceless as are the
ideals and the aspirations which it symbolizes, it should be
regarded, at the present time, as no more than an instrument for a
more effective propagation of the Cause and a wider diffusion of its
teachings. In this respect it should be viewed in the same light as
the administrative institutions of the Faith which are designed as
vehicles for the proper dissemination of its ideals, its tenets, and
its verities.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-26"></a><a name="adj_en-p66"></a>
It is, therefore, to the teaching requirements of the Seven Year Plan
that the community of the American believers must henceforth direct
their careful and sustained attention. The entire community must, as
one man, arise to fulfill them. To teach the Cause of God, to
proclaim its truths, to defend its interests, to demonstrate, by
words as well as by deeds, its indispensability, its potency, and
universality, should at no time be regarded as the exclusive concern
or sole privilege of Bahá’í administrative institutions, be they
Assemblies, or committees. All must participate, however humble their
origin, however limited their experience, however restricted their
means, however deficient their education, however pressing their
cares and preoccupations, however unfavorable the environment in
which they live. “<i>God,</i>” Bahá’u’lláh, Himself, has
unmistakably revealed, “<i>hath prescribed unto everyone the duty
of teaching His Cause.</i>” “<i>Say,</i>” He further has
written, “<i>Teach ye the Cause of God, O people of Bahá, for God
hath prescribed unto everyone the duty of proclaiming His Message,
and regardeth it as the most meritorious of all deeds.</i>”</p>

A high and exalted position in the ranks of the community, conferring
as it does on its holder certain privileges and prerogatives, no
doubt invests him with a responsibility that he cannot honorably
shirk in his duty to teach and promote the Faith of God. It may, at
times, though not invariably, create greater opportunities and
furnish better facilities to spread the knowledge of that Faith, and
to win supporters to its institutions. It does not, however, under
any circumstances, necessarily carry with it the power of exercising
greater influence on the minds and hearts of those to whom that Faith
is presented. How often—and the early history of the Faith in the
land of its birth offers many a striking testimony—have the
lowliest adherents of the Faith, unschooled and utterly
inexperienced, and with no standing whatever, and in some cases
devoid of intelligence, been capable of winning victories for their
Cause, before which the most brilliant achievements of the learned,
the wise, and the experienced have paled.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p68"></a>
“<i>Peter,</i>” ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá has testified, “<i>according
to the history of the Church, was also incapable of keeping count of
the days of the week. Whenever he decided to go fishing, he would tie
up his weekly food into seven parcels, and every day he would eat one
of them, and when he had reached the seventh, he would know that the
Sabbath had arrived, and thereupon would observe it.</i>” If the
Son of Man was capable of infusing into apparently so crude and
helpless an instrument such potency as to cause, in the words of
Bahá’u’lláh, “<i>the mysteries of wisdom and of utterance to
flow out of his mouth,</i>” and to exalt him above the rest of His
disciples, and render him fit to become His successor and the founder
of His Church, how much more can the Father, Who is Bahá’u’lláh,
empower the most puny and insignificant among His followers to
achieve, for the execution of His purpose, such wonders as would
dwarf the mightiest achievements of even the first apostle of Jesus
Christ!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p69"></a>
“<i>The Báb,</i>” ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, moreover, has
written, “<i>hath said: ‘Should a tiny ant desire, in this day,
to be possessed of such power as to be able to unravel the abstrusest
and most bewildering passages of the Qur’án, its wish will no
doubt be fulfilled, inasmuch as the mystery of eternal might vibrates
within the innermost being of all created things.’ If so helpless a
creature can be endowed with so subtle a capacity, how much more
efficacious must be the power released through the liberal effusions
of the grace of Bahá’u’lláh!</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-27"></a><a name="adj_en-p70"></a>
The field is indeed so immense, the period so critical, the Cause so
great, the workers so few, the time so short, the privilege so
priceless, that no follower of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, worthy
to bear His name, can afford a moment’s hesitation. That God-born
Force, irresistible in its sweeping power, incalculable in its
potency, unpredictable in its course, mysterious in its workings, and
awe-inspiring in its manifestations—a Force which, as the Báb has
written, “<i>vibrates within the innermost being of all created
things,</i>” and which, according to Bahá’u’lláh, has through
its “<i>vibrating influence,</i>” “<i>upset the equilibrium of
the world and revolutionized its ordered life</i>”—such a Force,
acting even as a two-edged sword, is, under our very eyes, sundering,
on the one hand, the age-old ties which for centuries have held
together the fabric of civilized society, and is unloosing, on the
other, the bonds that still fetter the infant and as yet
unemancipated Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. The undreamt-of
opportunities offered through the operation of this Force—the
American believers must now rise, and fully and courageously exploit
them. “<i>The holy realities of the Concourse on high,</i>”
writes ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, “<i>yearn, in this day, in the Most
Exalted Paradise, to return unto this world, so that they may be
aided to render some service to the threshold of the Abhá Beauty,
and arise to demonstrate their servitude to His sacred Threshold.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p71"></a>
A world, dimmed by the steadily dying-out light of religion, heaving
with the explosive forces of a blind and triumphant nationalism;
scorched with the fires of pitiless persecution, whether racial or
religious; deluded by the false theories and doctrines that threaten
to supplant the worship of God and the sanctification of His laws;
enervated by a rampant and brutal materialism; disintegrating through
the corrosive influence of moral and spiritual decadence; and
enmeshed in the coils of economic anarchy and strife—such is the
spectacle presented to men’s eyes, as a result of the sweeping
changes which this revolutionizing Force, as yet in the initial stage
of its operation, is now producing in the life of the entire planet.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p72"></a>
So sad and moving a spectacle, bewildering as it must be to every
observer unaware of the purposes, the prophecies, and promises of
Bahá’u’lláh, far from casting dismay into the hearts of His
followers, or paralyzing their efforts, cannot but deepen their
faith, and excite their enthusiastic eagerness to arise and display,
in the vast field traced for them by the pen of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá,
their capacity to play their part in the work of universal redemption
proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh. Every instrument in the
administrative machinery which, in the course of several years, they
have so laboriously erected must be fully utilized, and subordinated
to the end for which it was created. The Temple, that proud
embodiment of so rare a spirit of self-sacrifice, must likewise be
made to play its part, and contribute its share to the teaching
campaign designed to embrace the entire Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p73"></a>
The opportunities which the turmoil of the present age presents, with
all the sorrows which it evokes, the fears which it excites, the
disillusionment which it produces, the perplexities which it creates,
the indignation which it arouses, the revolt which it provokes, the
grievances it engenders, the spirit of restless search which it
awakens, must, in like manner, be exploited for the purpose of
spreading far and wide the knowledge of the redemptive power of the
Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, and for enlisting fresh recruits in the
ever-swelling army of His followers. So precious an opportunity, so
rare a conjunction of favorable circumstances, may never again recur.
Now is the time, the appointed time, for the American believers, the
vanguard of the hosts of the Most Great Name, to proclaim, through
the agencies and channels of a specially designed Administrative
Order, their capacity and readiness to rescue a fallen and sore-tried
generation that has rebelled against its God and ignored His
warnings, and to offer it that complete security which only the
strongholds of their Faith can provide.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p74"></a>
The teaching campaign, inaugurated throughout the states of the North
American Republic and the Dominion of Canada, acquires, therefore, an
importance, and is invested with an urgency, that cannot be
overestimated. Launched on its course through the creative energies
released by the Will of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, and sweeping across
the Western Hemisphere through the propelling force which it is
generating, it must, I feel, be carried out in conformity with
certain principles, designed to insure its efficient conduct, and to
hasten the attainment of its objective.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-28"></a><a name="adj_en-p75"></a>
Those who participate in such a campaign, whether in an organizing
capacity, or as workers to whose care the execution of the task
itself has been committed, must, as an essential preliminary to the
discharge of their duties, thoroughly familiarize themselves with the
various aspects of the history and teachings of their Faith. In their
efforts to achieve this purpose they must study for themselves,
conscientiously and painstakingly, the literature of their Faith,
delve into its teachings, assimilate its laws and principles, ponder
its admonitions, tenets and purposes, commit to memory certain of its
exhortations and prayers, master the essentials of its
administration, and keep abreast of its current affairs and latest
developments. They must strive to obtain, from sources that are
authoritative and unbiased, a sound knowledge of the history and
tenets of Islám—the source and background of their Faith—and
approach reverently and with a mind purged from preconceived ideas
the study of the Qur’án which, apart from the sacred scriptures of
the Bábí and Bahá’í Revelations, constitutes the only Book
which can be regarded as an absolutely authenticated Repository of
the Word of God. They must devote special attention to the
investigation of those institutions and circumstances that are
directly connected with the origin and birth of their Faith, with the
station claimed by its Forerunner, and with the laws revealed by its
Author.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-29"></a><a name="adj_en-p76"></a>
Having acquired, in their essentials, these prerequisites of success
in the teaching field, they must, whenever they contemplate
undertaking any specific mission in the countries of Latin America,
endeavor, whenever feasible, to acquire a certain proficiency in the
languages spoken by the inhabitants of those countries, and a
knowledge of their customs, habits, and outlook. “<i>The teachers
going to those parts,</i>” ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, referring in
one of the Tablets of the Divine Plan to the Central American
Republics, has written, “<i>must also be familiar with the Spanish
language.</i>” “<i>A party speaking their languages …,</i>”
He, in another Tablet, has written, “<i>must turn their faces to
and travel through the three great Island groups of the Pacific
Ocean.</i>” “<i>The teachers traveling in different directions,</i>”
He further states, “<i>must know the language of the country in
which they will enter. For example, a person being proficient in the
Japanese language may travel to Japan, or a person knowing the
Chinese language may hasten to China, and so forth.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-30"></a><a name="adj_en-p77"></a>
No participator in this inter-American campaign of teaching must feel
that the initiative for any particular activity connected with this
work must rest solely with those agencies, whether Assemblies or
committees, whose special concern is to promote and facilitate the
attainment of this vital objective of the Seven Year Plan. It is the
bounden duty of every American believer, as the faithful trustee of
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá’s Divine Plan, to initiate, promote, and
consolidate, within the limits fixed by the administrative principles
of the Faith, any activity he or she deems fit to undertake for the
furtherance of the Plan. Neither the threatening world situation, nor
any consideration of lack of material resources, of mental equipment,
of knowledge, or of experience—desirable as they are—should deter
any prospective pioneer teacher from arising independently, and from
setting in motion the forces which, ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá has
repeatedly assured us, will, once released, attract even as a magnet
the promised and infallible aid of Bahá’u’lláh. Let him not
wait for any directions, or expect any special encouragement, from
the elected representatives of his community, nor be deterred by any
obstacles which his relatives, or fellow-citizens may be inclined to
place in his path, nor mind the censure of his critics or enemies.
“<i>Be unrestrained as the wind,</i>” is Bahá’u’lláh’s
counsel to every would-be teacher of His Cause, “<i>while carrying
the Message of Him Who hath caused the dawn of Divine Guidance to
break. Consider how the wind, faithful to that which God hath
ordained, bloweth upon all regions of the earth, be they inhabited or
desolate. Neither the sight of desolation, nor the evidences of
prosperity, can either pain or please it. It bloweth in every
direction, as bidden by its Creator.</i>” “<i>And when he
determineth to leave his home, for the sake of the Cause of his
Lord,</i>” Bahá’u’lláh, in another passage, referring to such
a teacher, has revealed, “<i>let him put his whole trust in God, as
the best provision for his journey, and array himself with the robe
of virtue.… If he be kindled with the fire of His love, if he
forgoeth all created things, the words he uttereth shall set on fire
them that hear him.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-31"></a><a name="adj_en-p78"></a>
Having on his own initiative, and undaunted by any hindrances with
which either friend or foe may, unwittingly or deliberately, obstruct
his path, resolved to arise and respond to the call of teaching, let
him carefully consider every avenue of approach which he might
utilize in his personal attempts to capture the attention, maintain
the interest, and deepen the faith, of those whom he seeks to bring
into the fold of his Faith. Let him survey the possibilities which
the particular circumstances in which he lives offer him, evaluate
their advantages, and proceed intelligently and systematically to
utilize them for the achievement of the object he has in mind. Let
him also attempt to devise such methods as association with clubs,
exhibitions, and societies, lectures on subjects akin to the
teachings and ideals of his Cause such as temperance, morality,
social welfare, religious and racial tolerance, economic cooperation,
Islám, and Comparative Religion, or participation in social,
cultural, humanitarian, charitable, and educational organizations and
enterprises which, while safeguarding the integrity of his Faith,
will open up to him a multitude of ways and means whereby he can
enlist successively the sympathy, the support, and ultimately the
allegiance of those with whom he comes in contact. Let him, while
such contacts are being made, bear in mind the claims which his Faith
is constantly making upon him to preserve its dignity, and station,
to safeguard the integrity of its laws and principles, to demonstrate
its comprehensiveness and universality, and to defend fearlessly its
manifold and vital interests. Let him consider the degree of his
hearer’s receptivity, and decide for himself the suitability of
either the direct or indirect method of teaching, whereby he can
impress upon the seeker the vital importance of the Divine Message,
and persuade him to throw in his lot with those who have already
embraced it. Let him remember the example set by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá,
and His constant admonition to shower such kindness upon the seeker,
and exemplify to such a degree the spirit of the teachings he hopes
to instill into him, that the recipient will be spontaneously
impelled to identify himself with the Cause embodying such teachings.
Let him refrain, at the outset, from insisting on such laws and
observances as might impose too severe a strain on the seeker’s
newly awakened faith, and endeavor to nurse him, patiently,
tactfully, and yet determinedly, into full maturity, and aid him to
proclaim his unqualified acceptance of whatever has been ordained by
Bahá’u’lláh. Let him, as soon as that stage has been attained,
introduce him to the body of his fellow-believers, and seek, through
constant fellowship and active participation in the local activities
of his community, to enable him to contribute his share to the
enrichment of its life, the furtherance of its tasks, the
consolidations of its interests, and the coordination of its
activities with those of its sister communities. Let him not be
content until he has infused into his spiritual child so deep a
longing as to impel him to arise independently, in his turn, and
devote his energies to the quickening of other souls, and the
upholding of the laws and principles laid down by his newly adopted
Faith.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-32"></a><a name="adj_en-p79"></a>
Let every participator in the continent-wide campaign initiated by
the American believers, and particularly those engaged in pioneer
work in virgin territories, bear in mind the necessity of keeping in
close and constant touch with those responsible agencies designed to
direct, coordinate, and facilitate the teaching activities of the
entire community. Whether it be the body of their elected national
representatives, or its chief auxiliary institution, the National
Teaching Committee, or its subsidiary organs, the regional teaching
committees, or the local Spiritual Assemblies and their respective
teaching committees, they who labor for the spread of the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh should, through constant interchange of ideas,
through letters, circulars, reports, bulletins and other means of
communication with these established instruments designed for the
propagation of the Faith, insure the smooth and speedy functioning of
the teaching machinery of their Administrative Order. Confusion,
delay, duplication of efforts, dissipation of energy will, thereby,
be completely avoided, and the mighty flood of the grace of
Bahá’u’lláh, flowing abundantly and without the least
obstruction through these essential channels will so inundate the
hearts and souls of men as to enable them to bring forth the harvest
repeatedly predicted by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-33"></a><a name="adj_en-p80"></a>
Upon every participator in this concerted effort, unprecedented in
the annals of the American Bahá’í community, rests the spiritual
obligation to make of the mandate of teaching, so vitally binding
upon all, the all-pervading concern of his life. In his daily
activities and contacts, in all his journeys, whether for business or
otherwise, on his holidays and outings, and on any mission he may be
called upon to undertake, every bearer of the Message of Bahá’u’lláh
should consider it not only an obligation but a privilege to scatter
far and wide the seeds of His Faith, and to rest content in the
abiding knowledge that whatever be the immediate response to that
Message, and however inadequate the vehicle that conveyed it, the
power of its Author will, as He sees fit, enable those seeds to
germinate, and in circumstances which no one can foresee enrich the
harvest which the labor of His followers will gather. If he be member
of any Spiritual Assembly let him encourage his Assembly to
consecrate a certain part of its time, at each of its sessions, to
the earnest and prayerful consideration of such ways and means as may
foster the campaign of teaching, or may furnish whatever resources
are available for its progress, extension, and consolidation. If he
attends his summer school—and everyone without exception is urged
to take advantage of attending it—let him consider such an occasion
as a welcome and precious opportunity so to enrich, through lectures,
study, and discussion, his knowledge of the fundamentals of his Faith
as to be able to transmit, with greater confidence and effectiveness,
the Message that has been entrusted to his care. Let him, moreover,
seek, whenever feasible, through intercommunity visits to stimulate
the zeal for teaching, and to demonstrate to outsiders the zest and
alertness of the promoters of his Cause and the organic unity of its
institutions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-34"></a><a name="adj_en-p81"></a>
Let anyone who feels the urge among the participators in this
crusade, which embraces all the races, all the republics, classes and
denominations of the entire Western Hemisphere, arise, and,
circumstances permitting, direct in particular the attention, and win
eventually the unqualified adherence, of the Negro, the Indian, the
Eskimo, and Jewish races to his Faith. No more laudable and
meritorious service can be rendered the Cause of God, at the present
hour, than a successful effort to enhance the diversity of the
members of the American Bahá’í community by swelling the ranks of
the Faith through the enrollment of the members of these races. A
blending of these highly differentiated elements of the human race,
harmoniously interwoven into the fabric of an all-embracing Bahá’í
fraternity, and assimilated through the dynamic processes of a
divinely appointed Administrative Order, and contributing each its
share to the enrichment and glory of Bahá’í community life, is
surely an achievement the contemplation of which must warm and thrill
every Bahá’í heart. “<i>Consider the flowers of a garden,</i>”
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá has written, “<i>though differing in kind,
color, form, and shape, yet, inasmuch as they are refreshed by the
waters of one spring, revived by the breath of one wind, invigorated
by the rays of one sun, this diversity increaseth their charm, and
addeth unto their beauty. How unpleasing to the eye if all the
flowers and plants, the leaves and blossoms, the fruits, the branches
and the trees of that garden were all of the same shape and color!
Diversity of hues, form and shape, enricheth and adorneth the garden,
and heighteneth the effect thereof. In like manner, when divers
shades of thought, temperament and character, are brought together
under the power and influence of one central agency, the beauty and
glory of human perfection will be revealed and made manifest. Naught
but the celestial potency of the Word of God, which ruleth and
transcendeth the realities of all things, is capable of harmonizing
the divergent thoughts, sentiments, ideas, and convictions of the
children of men.</i>” “<i>I hope,</i>” is the wish expressed by
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, “<i>that ye may cause that downtrodden
race</i> [Negro] <i>to become glorious, and to be joined with the
white race to serve the world of man with the utmost sincerity,
faithfulness, love and purity.</i>” “<i>One of the important
questions,</i>” He also has written, “<i>which affect the unity
and the solidarity of mankind is the fellowship and equality of the
white and colored races.</i>” “<i>You must attach great
importance,</i>” writes ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá in the Tablets of
the Divine Plan, “<i>to the Indians, the original inhabitants of
America. For these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants
of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Revelation of Muḥammad,
were like savages. When the Muḥammadan Light shone forth in their
midst, they became so enkindled that they shed illumination upon the
world. Likewise, should these Indians be educated and properly
guided, there can be no doubt that through the Divine teachings they
will become so enlightened that the whole earth will be illumined.</i>”
“<i>If it is possible,</i>” ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá has also
written, “<i>send ye teachers to other portions of Canada;
likewise, dispatch ye teachers to Greenland and the home of the
Eskimos.</i>” “<i>God willing,</i>” He further has written in
those same Tablets, “<i>the call of the Kingdom may reach the ears
of the Eskimos.… Should you display an effort, so that the
fragrances of God may be diffused among the Eskimos, its effect will
be very great and far-reaching.</i>” “<i>Praise be to God,</i>”
writes ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, “<i>that whatsoever hath been
announced in the Blessed Tablets unto the Israelites, and the things
explicitly written in the letters of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, are all
being fulfilled. Some have come to pass; others will be revealed in
the future. The Ancient Beauty hath in His sacred Tablets explicitly
written that the day of their abasement is over. His bounty will
overshadow them, and this race will day by day progress, and be
delivered from its age-long obscurity and degradation.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-35"></a><a name="adj_en-p82"></a>
Let those who are holding administrative positions in their capacity
as members of either the National Spiritual Assembly, or of the
national, the regional, or local teaching committees, continually
bear in mind the vital and urgent necessity of insuring, within as
short a time as possible, the formation, in the few remaining states
of the North American Republic and the provinces of the Dominion of
Canada, of groups, however small and rudimentary, and of providing
every facility within their power to enable these newly formed nuclei
to evolve, swiftly and along sound lines, into properly functioning,
self-sufficient, and recognized Assemblies. To the laying of such
foundations, the erection of such outposts—a work admittedly
arduous, yet sorely needed and highly inspiring—the individual
members of the American Bahá’í community must lend their
unstinted, continual, and enthusiastic support. Wise as may be the
measures which their elected representatives may devise, however
practical and well conceived the plans they formulate, such measures
and plans can never yield any satisfactory results unless a
sufficient number of pioneers have determined to make the necessary
sacrifices, and to volunteer to carry these projects into effect. To
implant, once and for all, the banner of Bahá’u’lláh in the
heart of these virgin territories, to erect the structural basis of
His Administrative Order in their cities and villages, and to
establish a firm and permanent anchorage for its institutions in the
minds and hearts of their inhabitants, constitute, I firmly believe,
the first and most significant step in the successive stages through
which the teaching campaign, inaugurated under the Seven Year Plan,
must pass. Whereas the external ornamentation of the
Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, under this same Plan, has now
entered the final phase in its development, the teaching campaign is
still in its initial stages, and is far from having extended
effectively its ramifications to either these virgin territories, or
to those Republics that are situated in the South American continent.
The effort required is prodigious, the conditions under which these
preliminary establishments are to be made are often unattractive and
unfavorable, the workers who are in a position to undertake such
tasks limited, and the resources they can command meager and
inadequate. And yet, how often has the pen of Bahá’u’lláh
assured us that “<i>should a man, all alone, arise in the name of
Bahá, and put on the armor of His love, him will the Almighty cause
to be victorious, though the forces of earth and heaven be arrayed
against him.</i>” Has He not written: “<i>By God, besides Whom is
none other God! Should anyone arise for the triumph of our Cause, him
will God render victorious though tens of thousands of enemies be
leagued against him. And if his love for me wax stronger, God will
establish his ascendancy over all the powers of earth and heaven.</i>”
“<i>Consider the work of former generations,</i>” ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá
has written; “<i>During the lifetime of Jesus Christ the believing,
firm souls were few and numbered, but the heavenly blessings
descended so plentifully that in a number of years countless souls
entered beneath the shadow of the Gospel. God has said in the Qur’án:
‘One grain will bring forth seven sheaves, and every sheaf shall
contain one hundred grains.’ In other words, one grain will become
seven hundred; and if God so wills He will double these also. It has
often happened that one blessed soul has become the cause of the
guidance of a nation. Now we must not consider our ability and
capacity, nay rather we must fix our gaze upon the favors and
bounties of God, in these days, Who has made of the drop a sea, and
of the atom a sun.</i>” Let those who resolve to be the first to
hoist the standard of such a Cause, under such conditions, and in
such territories, nourish their souls with the sustaining power of
these words, and, “<i>putting on the armor of His love,</i>” a
love which must “<i>wax stronger</i>” as they persevere in their
lonesome task, arise to adorn with the tale of their deeds the most
brilliant pages ever written in their country’s spiritual history.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p83"></a>
“<i>Although,</i>” ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, in the Tablets of the
Divine Plan, has written, “<i>in most of the states and cities of
the United States, praise be to God, His fragrances are diffused, and
souls unnumbered are turning their faces and advancing toward the
Kingdom of God, yet in some of the states the Standard of Unity is
not yet upraised as it should be, nor are the mysteries of the Holy
Books, such as the Bible, the Gospel, and the Qur’án, unraveled.
Through the concerted efforts of all the friends the Standard of
Unity must needs be unfurled in those states, and the Divine
teachings promoted, so that these states may also receive their
portion of the heavenly bestowals and a share of the Most Great
Guidance.</i>” “<i>The future of the Dominion of Canada,</i>”
He, in another Tablet of the Divine Plan, has asserted, “<i>is very
great, and the events connected with it infinitely glorious. The eye
of God’s loving-kindness will be turned towards it, and it shall
become the manifestation of the favors of the All-Glorious.</i>”
“<i>Again I repeat,</i>” He, in that same Tablet reaffirms His
previous statement, “<i>that the future of Canada, whether from a
material or a spiritual standpoint, is very great.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-36"></a><a name="adj_en-p84"></a>
No sooner is this initial step taken, involving as it does the
formation of at least one nucleus in each of these virgin states and
provinces in the North American continent, than the machinery for a
tremendous intensification of Bahá’í concerted effort must be set
in motion, the purpose of which should be the reinforcement of the
noble exertions which only a few isolated believers are now making
for the awakening of the nations of Latin America to the Call of
Bahá’u’lláh. Not until this second phase of the teaching
campaign, under the Seven Year Plan, has been entered can the
campaign be regarded as fully launched, or the Plan itself as having
attained the most decisive stage in its evolution. So powerful will
be the effusions of Divine grace that will be poured forth upon a
valiant community that has already in the administrative sphere
erected, in all the glory of its exterior ornamentation, its chief
Edifice, and in the teaching field raised aloft, in every state and
province, in the North American continent the banner of its Faith—so
great will be these effusions that its members will find themselves
overpowered by the evidences of their regenerative power.

The Inter-America Committee must, at such a stage, nay even before it
is entered, rise to the level of its opportunities, and display a
vigor, a consecration, and enterprise as will be commensurate with
the responsibilities it has shouldered. It should not, for a moment,
be forgotten that Central and Southern America embrace no less than
twenty independent nations, constituting approximately one-third of
the entire number of the world’s sovereign states, and are destined
to play an increasingly important part in the shaping of the world’s
future destiny. With the world contracting into a neighborhood, and
the fortunes of its races, nations and peoples becoming inextricably
interwoven, the remoteness of these states of the Western Hemisphere
is vanishing, and the latent possibilities in each of them are
becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p86"></a>
When this second stage in the progressive unfoldment of teaching
activities and enterprises, under the Seven Year Plan, is reached,
and the machinery required for its prosecution begins to operate, the
American believers, the stout-hearted pioneers of this mighty
movement, must, guided by the unfailing light of Bahá’u’lláh,
and in strict accordance with the Plan laid out by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá,
and acting under the direction of their National Spiritual Assembly,
and assured of the aid of the Inter-America Committee, launch an
offensive against the powers of darkness, of corruption, and of
ignorance, an offensive that must extend to the uttermost end of the
Southern continent, and embrace within its scope each of the twenty
nations that compose it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-38"></a><a name="adj_en-p87"></a>
Let some, at this very moment, gird up the loins of their endeavor,
flee their native towns, cities, and states, forsake their country,
and, “<i>putting their whole trust in God as the best provision for
their journey,</i>” set their faces, and direct their steps towards
those distant climes, those virgin fields, those unsurrendered
cities, and bend their energies to capture the citadels of men’s
hearts—hearts, which, as Bahá’u’lláh has written, “<i>the
hosts of Revelation and of utterance can subdue.</i>” Let them not
tarry until such time as their fellow-laborers will have passed the
first stage in their campaign of teaching, but let them rather, from
this very hour, arise to usher in the opening phase of what will come
to be regarded as one of the most glorious chapters in the
international history of their Faith. Let them, at the very outset,
“<i>teach their own selves, that their speech may attract the
hearts of their hearers.</i>” Let them regard the triumph of their
Faith as their “<i>supreme objective.</i>” Let them not “<i>consider
the largeness or smallness of the receptacle</i>” that carries the
measure of grace that God poureth forth in this age. Let them
“<i>disencumber themselves of all attachment to this world and the
vanities thereof,</i>” and, with that spirit of detachment which
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá exemplified and wished them to emulate, bring
these diversified peoples and countries to the remembrance of God and
His supreme Manifestation. Let His love be a “<i>storehouse of
treasure for their souls,</i>” on the day when “<i>every pillar
shall tremble, when the very skins of men shall creep, when all eyes
shall stare up with terror.</i>” Let their “<i>souls be aglow
with the flame of the undying Fire that burneth in the midmost heart
of the world, in such wise that the waters of the universe shall be
powerless to cool down its ardor.</i>” Let them be “<i>unrestrained
as the wind</i>” which “<i>neither the sight of desolation nor
the evidences of prosperity can either pain or please.</i>” Let
them “<i>unloose their tongues and proclaim unceasingly His Cause.</i>”
Let them “<i>proclaim that which the Most Great Spirit will inspire
them to utter in the service of the Cause of their Lord.</i>” Let
them “<i>beware lest they contend with anyone, nay strive to make
him aware of the truth with kindly manner and most convincing
exhortation.</i>” Let them “<i>wholly for the sake of God
proclaim His Message, and with that same spirit accept whatever
response their words may evoke in their hearers.</i>” Let them not,
for one moment, forget that the “<i>Faithful Spirit shall
strengthen them through its power,</i>” and that “<i>a company of
His chosen angels shall go forth with them, as bidden by Him Who is
the Almighty, the All-Wise.</i>” Let them ever bear in mind “<i>how
great is the blessedness that awaiteth them that have attained the
honor of serving the Almighty,</i>” and remember that “<i>such a
service is indeed the prince of all goodly deeds, and the ornament of
every goodly act.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-39"></a><a name="adj_en-p88"></a>
And, finally, let these soul-stirring words of Bahá’u’lláh, as
they pursue their course throughout the length and breadth of the
southern American continent, be ever ready on their lips, a solace to
their hearts, a light on their path, a companion in their loneliness,
and a daily sustenance in their journeys: “<i>O wayfarer in the
path of God! Take thou thy portion of the ocean of His grace, and
deprive not thyself of the things that lie hidden in its depths.… A
dewdrop out of this ocean would, if shed upon all that are in the
heavens and on earth, suffice to enrich them with the bounty of God,
the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. With the hands of
renunciation draw forth from its life-giving waters, and sprinkle
therewith all created things, that they may be cleansed from all
man-made limitations, and may approach the mighty seat of God, this
hallowed and resplendent Spot. Be not grieved if thou performest it
thyself alone. Let God be all-sufficient for thee.… Proclaim the
Cause of thy Lord unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth.
Should any man respond to thy call, lay bare before him the pearls of
the wisdom of the Lord, thy God, which His Spirit hath sent down upon
thee, and be thou of them that truly believe. And should anyone
reject thy offer, turn thou away from him, and put thy trust and
confidence in the Lord of all worlds. By the righteousness of God!
Whoso openeth his lips in this day, and maketh mention of the name of
his Lord, the hosts of Divine inspiration shall descend upon him from
the heaven of my name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. On him shall
also descend the Concourse on high, each bearing aloft a chalice of
pure light. Thus hath it been foreordained in the realm of God’s
Revelation, by the behest of Him Who is the All-Glorious, the Most
Powerful.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p89"></a>
Let these words of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, gleaned from the Tablets
of the Divine Plan, ring likewise in their ears, as they go forth,
assured and unafraid, on His mission: “<i>O ye apostles of
Bahá’u’lláh! May my life be sacrificed for you!… Behold the
portals which Bahá’u’lláh hath opened before you! Consider how
exalted and lofty is the station you are destined to attain; how
unique the favors with which you have been endowed.</i>” “<i>My
thoughts are turned towards you, and my heart leaps within me at your
mention. Could ye know how my soul gloweth with your love, so great a
happiness would flood your hearts as to cause you to become enamored
with each other.</i>” “<i>The full measure of your success is as
yet unrevealed, its significance still unapprehended. Erelong ye
will, with your own eyes, witness how brilliantly every one of you,
even as a shining star, will radiate in the firmament of your country
the light of Divine Guidance, and will bestow upon its people the
glory of an everlasting life.</i>” “<i>I fervently hope that in
the near future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the
results of your achievements.</i>” “<i>The Almighty will no doubt
grant you the help of His grace, will invest you with the tokens of
His might, and will endue your souls with the sustaining power of His
holy Spirit.</i>” “<i>Be not concerned with the smallness of your
numbers, neither be oppressed by the multitude of an unbelieving
world.… Exert yourselves; your mission is unspeakably glorious.
Should success crown your enterprise, America will assuredly evolve
into a center from which waves of spiritual power will emanate, and
the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plenitude of its
majesty and glory, be firmly established.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-40"></a><a name="adj_en-p90"></a>
It should be remembered that the carrying out of the Seven Year Plan
involves, insofar as the teaching work is concerned, no more than the
formation of at least one center in each of the Central and South
American Republics. The hundredth anniversary of the birth of the
Faith of Bahá’u’lláh should witness, if the Plan already
launched is to meet with success, the laying, in each of these
countries, of a foundation, however rudimentary, on which the rising
generation of the American believers may, in the opening years of the
second century of the Bahá’í era, be able to build. Theirs will
be the task, in the course of successive decades, to extend and
reinforce those foundations, and to supply the necessary guidance,
assistance, and encouragement that will enable the widely scattered
groups of believers in those countries to establish independent and
properly constituted local Assemblies, and thereby erect the
framework of the Administrative Order of their Faith. The erection of
such a framework is primarily the responsibility of those whom the
community of the North American believers have converted to the
Divine Message. It is a task which must involve, apart from the
immediate obligation of enabling every group to evolve into a local
Assembly, the setting up of the entire machinery of the
Administrative Order in conformity with the spiritual and
administrative principles governing the life and activities of every
established Bahá’í community throughout the world. No departure
from these cardinal and clearly enunciated principles, embodied and
preserved in Bahá’í national and local constitutions, common to
all Bahá’í communities, can under any circumstances be tolerated.
This, however, is a task that concerns those who, at a later period,
must arise to further a work which, to all intents and purposes, has
not yet been effectively started.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p91"></a>
To pave the way, in a more systematic manner, for the laying of the
necessary foundation on which such permanent national and local
institutions can be reared and securely established is a task that
will very soon demand the concentrated attention of the prosecutors
of the Seven Year Plan. No sooner has their immediate obligation in
connection with the opening up of the few remaining territories in
the United States and Canada been discharged, than a carefully
laid-out plan should be conceived, aiming at the establishment of
such a foundation. As already stated, the provision for these vast,
preliminary undertakings, the scope of which must embrace the entire
area occupied by the Central and South American Republics,
constitutes the very core, and must ultimately decide the fate, of
the teaching campaign conducted under the Seven Year Plan. Upon this
campaign must depend not only the effectual discharge of the solemn
obligations undertaken in connection with the present Plan, but also
the progressive unfoldment of the subsequent stages essential to the
realization of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá’s vision of the part the
American believers are to play in the worldwide propagation of their
Cause. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p92"></a>
These undertakings, preliminary as they are to the strenuous and
organized labors by which future generations of believers in the
Latin countries must distinguish themselves, require, in turn,
without a moment’s delay, on the part of the National Spiritual
Assembly and of both the National Teaching and Inter-America
Committees, painstaking investigations preparatory to the sending of
settlers and itinerant teachers, whose privilege will be to raise the
call of the New Day in a new continent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p93"></a>
I can only, in my desire to be of some service to those who are to
assume such tremendous responsibilities, and to suffer such
self-denial, attempt to offer a few helpful suggestions which, I
trust, will facilitate the accomplishment of the great work to be
achieved in the very near future. To this work, that must constitute
an historical landmark of first-class importance when completed, the
energies of the entire community must be resolutely consecrated. The
number of Bahá’í teachers, be they settlers or travelers, must be
substantially increased. The material resources to be placed at their
disposal must be multiplied, and efficiently administered. The
literature with which they should be equipped must be vastly
augmented. The publicity that should aid them in the distribution of
such literature should be extended, centrally organized, and
vigorously conducted. The possibilities latent in these countries
should be diligently exploited, and systematically developed. The
various obstacles raised by the widely varying political and social
conditions obtaining in these countries should be closely surveyed
and determinedly surmounted. In a word, no opportunity should be
neglected, and no effort spared, to lay as broad and solid a basis as
possible for the progress and development of the greatest teaching
enterprise ever launched by the American Bahá’í community.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-41"></a><a name="adj_en-p94"></a>
The careful translation of such important Bahá’í writings as are
related to the history, the teachings, or the Administrative Order of
the Faith, and their wide and systematic dissemination, in vast
quantities, and throughout as many of these Republics as possible,
and in languages that are most suitable and needed, would appear to
be the chief and most urgent measure to be taken simultaneously with
the arrival of the pioneer workers in those fields. “<i>Books and
pamphlets,</i>” writes ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá in one of the
Tablets of the Divine Plan, “<i>must be either translated or
composed in the languages of these countries and islands, to be
circulated in every part and in all directions.</i>” In countries
where no objections can be raised by the civil authorities or any
influential circles, this measure should be reinforced by the
publication, in various organs of the Press, of carefully worded
articles and letters, designed to impress upon the general public
certain features of the stirring history of the Faith, and the range
and character of its teachings.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-42"></a><a name="adj_en-p95"></a>
Every laborer in those fields, whether as traveling teacher or
settler, should, I feel, make it his chief and constant concern to
mix, in a friendly manner, with all sections of the population,
irrespective of class, creed, nationality, or color, to familiarize
himself with their ideas, tastes, and habits, to study the approach
best suited to them, to concentrate, patiently and tactfully, on a
few who have shown marked capacity and receptivity, and to endeavor,
with extreme kindness, to implant such love, zeal, and devotion in
their hearts as to enable them to become in turn self-sufficient and
independent promoters of the Faith in their respective localities.
“<i>Consort with all men, O people of Bahá,</i>” is
Bahá’u’lláh’s admonition, “<i>in a spirit of friendliness
and fellowship. If ye be aware of a certain truth, if ye possess a
jewel, of which others are deprived, share it with them in a language
of utmost kindliness and goodwill. If it be accepted, if it fulfill
its purpose, your object is attained. If anyone should refuse it,
leave him unto himself, and beseech God to guide him. Beware lest ye
deal unkindly with him. A kindly tongue is the lodestone of the
hearts of men. It is the bread of the spirit, it clotheth the words
with meaning, it is the fountain of the light of wisdom and
understanding.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p96"></a>
An effort, moreover, can and should be made, not only by
representative Bahá’í bodies, but also by prospective teachers,
as well as by other individual believers, deprived of the privilege
of visiting those shores or of settling on that continent, to seize
every opportunity that presents itself to make the acquaintance, and
awaken the genuine interest, of such people who are either citizens
of these countries, or are in any way connected with them, whatever
be their interests or profession. Through the kindness shown them, or
any literature which may be given them, or any connection which they
may establish with them, the American believers can thereby sow such
seeds in their hearts as might, in future circumstances, germinate
and yield the most unexpected results. Care, however, should, at all
times, be exercised, lest in their eagerness to further the
international interests of the Faith they frustrate their purpose,
and turn away, through any act that might be misconstrued as an
attempt to proselytize and bring undue pressure upon them, those whom
they wish to win over to their Cause.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-43"></a><a name="adj_en-p97"></a>
I would particularly direct my appeal to those American believers,
sore-pressed as they are by the manifold, the urgent, and
ever-increasing issues that confront them at the present hour, who
may find it possible, whatever be their calling or employment,
whether as businessmen, school teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers,
office workers, and the like, to establish permanently their
residence in such countries as may offer them a reasonable prospect
of earning the means of livelihood. They will by their action be
relieving the continually increasing pressure on their Teaching Fund,
which in view of its restricted dimensions must provide, when not
otherwise available, the traveling and other expenses to be incurred
in connection with the development of this vast undertaking. Should
they find it impossible to take advantage of so rare and sacred a
privilege, let them, mindful of the words of Bahá’u’lláh,
determine, each according to the means at his or her disposal, to
appoint a deputy who, on that believer’s behalf, will arise and
carry out so noble an enterprise. “<i>Center your energies,</i>”
are Bahá’u’lláh’s words, “<i>in the propagation of the
Faith of God. Whoso is worthy of so high a calling, let him arise and
promote it. Whoso is unable, it is his duty to appoint him who will,
in his stead, proclaim this Revelation, whose power hath caused the
foundations of the mightiest structures to quake, every mountain to
be crushed into dust, and every soul to be dumbfounded.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-44"></a><a name="adj_en-p98"></a>
As to those who have been able to leave their homes and country, and
to serve in those regions, whether temporarily or permanently, a
special duty, which must continually be borne in mind, devolves upon
them. It should be one of their chief aims to keep, on the one hand,
in constant touch with the National Committee specifically entrusted
with the promotion of their work, and to cooperate, on the other, by
every possible means and in the utmost harmony, with their
fellow-believers in those countries, whatever the field in which they
labor, whatever their standing, ability, or experience. Through the
performance of their first duty they will derive the necessary
stimulus and obtain the necessary guidance that will enable them to
prosecute effectively their mission, and will also, through their
regular reports to that committee, be imparting to the general body
of their fellow-believers the news of the latest developments in
their activities. By fulfilling their other duty, they will insure
the smooth efficiency, facilitate the progress, and avert any
untoward incidents that might handicap the development of their
common enterprise. The maintenance of close contact and harmonious
relationships between the Inter-America Committee, entrusted with the
immediate responsibility of organizing such a far-reaching
enterprise, and the privileged pioneers who are actually executing
that enterprise, and extending its ramifications far and wide, as
well as among these pioneers themselves, would set, apart from its
immediate advantages, a worthy and inspiring example to generations
still yet to be born who are to carry on, with all its increasing
complexities, the work which is being initiated at present.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-45"></a><a name="adj_en-p99"></a>
It would, no doubt, be of exceptional importance and value,
particularly in these times when the various restrictions imposed in
those countries make it difficult for a considerable number of Bahá’í
pioneers to establish their residence and earn their livelihood in
those states, if certain ones among the believers, whose income,
however slender, provides them with the means of an independent
existence, would so arrange their affairs as to be able to reside
indefinitely in those countries. The sacrifices involved, the
courage, faith, and perseverance it demands, are no doubt very great.
Their value, however, can never be properly assessed at the present
time, and the limitless reward which they who demonstrate them will
receive can never be adequately depicted. “<i>They that have
forsaken their country,</i>” is Bahá’u’lláh’s own
testimony, “<i>for the purpose of teaching Our Cause—these shall
the Faithful Spirit strengthen through its power.… By My life! No
act, however great, can compare with it, except such deeds as have
been ordained by God, the All-Powerful, the Most Mighty. Such a
service is indeed the prince of all goodly deeds, and the ornament of
every goodly act.</i>” Such a reward, it should be noted, is not to
be regarded as purely an abstract blessing confined to the future
life, but also as a tangible benefit which such courage, faith and
perseverance can alone confer in this material world. The solid
achievements, spiritual as well as administrative, which in the
far-away continent of Australasia, and more recently in Bulgaria,
representative believers from both Canada and the United States have
accomplished, proclaim in terms unmistakable the nature of those
prizes which, even in this world, such sterling heroism is bound to
win. “<i>Whoso,</i>” Bahá’u’lláh, in a memorable passage,
extolling those of His loved ones who have “<i>journeyed through
the countries in His Name and for His praise,</i>” has written,
“<i>hath attained their presence will glory in their meeting, and
all that dwell in every land will be illumined by their memory.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-46"></a><a name="adj_en-p100"></a>
I am moved, at this juncture, as I am reminded of the share which,
ever since the inception of the Faith in the West, the handmaidens of
Bahá’u’lláh, as distinguished from the men, have had in opening
up, single-handed, so many, such diversified, and widely scattered
countries over the whole surface of the globe, not only to pay a
tribute to such apostolic fervor as is truly reminiscent of those
heroic men who were responsible for the birth of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh, but also to stress the significance of such a
preponderating share which the women of the West have had and are
having in the establishment of His Faith throughout the whole world.
“<i>Among the miracles,</i>” ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá Himself has
testified, “<i>which distinguish this sacred Dispensation is this,
that women have evinced a greater boldness than men when enlisted in
the ranks of the Faith.</i>” So great and splendid a testimony
applies in particular to the West, and though it has received thus
far abundant and convincing confirmation must, as the years roll
away, be further reinforced, as the American believers usher in the
most glorious phase of their teaching activities under the Seven Year
Plan. The “<i>boldness</i>” which, in the words of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá,
has characterized their accomplishments in the past must suffer no
eclipse as they stand on the threshold of still greater and nobler
accomplishments. Nay rather, it must, in the course of time and
throughout the length and breadth of the vast and virgin territories
of Latin America, be more convincingly demonstrated, and win for the
beloved Cause victories more stirring than any it has as yet
achieved.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-47"></a><a name="adj_en-p101"></a>
To the Bahá’í youth of America, moreover, I feel a word should be
addressed in particular, as I survey the possibilities which a
campaign of such gigantic proportions has to offer to the eager and
enterprising spirit that so powerfully animates them in the service
of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. Though lacking in experience and
faced with insufficient resources, yet the adventurous spirit which
they possess, and the vigor, the alertness, and optimism they have
thus far so consistently shown, qualify them to play an active part
in arousing the interest, and in securing the allegiance, of their
fellow youth in those countries. No greater demonstration can be
given to the peoples of both continents of the youthful vitality and
the vibrant power animating the life, and the institutions of the
nascent Faith of Bahá’u’lláh than an intelligent, persistent,
and effective participation of the Bahá’í youth, of every race,
nationality, and class, in both the teaching and administrative
spheres of Bahá’í activity. Through such a participation the
critics and enemies of the Faith, watching with varying degrees of
skepticism and resentment, the evolutionary processes of the Cause of
God and its institutions, can best be convinced of the indubitable
truth that such a Cause is intensely alive, is sound to its very
core, and its destinies in safe keeping. I hope, and indeed pray,
that such a participation may not only redound to the glory, the
power, and the prestige of the Faith, but may also react so
powerfully on the spiritual lives, and galvanize to such an extent
the energies of the youthful members of the Bahá’í community, as
to empower them to display, in a fuller measure, their inherent
capacities, and to unfold a further stage in their spiritual
evolution under the shadow of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-48"></a><a name="adj_en-p102"></a>
Faithful to the provisions of the Charter laid down by the pen of
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, I feel it my duty to draw the special
attention of those to whom it has been entrusted to the urgent needs
of, and the special position enjoyed by, the Republic of Panama, both
in view of its relative proximity to the heart and center of the
Faith in North America, and of its geographical position as the link
between two continents. “<i>All the above countries,</i>”
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, referring to the Latin States in one of the
Tablets of the Divine Plan, has written, “<i>have importance, but
especially the Republic of Panama, wherein the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans come together through the Panama Canal. It is a center for
travel and passage from America to other continents of the world, and
in the future it will gain most great importance.</i>” “<i>Likewise,</i>”
He again has written, “<i>ye must give great attention to the
Republic of Panama, for in that point the Occident and the Orient
find each other united through the Panama Canal, and it is also
situated between the two great oceans. That place will become very
important in the future. The teachings, once established there, will
unite the East and the West, the North and the South.</i>” So
privileged a position surely demands the special and prompt attention
of the American Bahá’í community. With the Republic of Mexico
already opened up to the Faith, and with a Spiritual Assembly
properly constituted in its capital city, the southward penetration
of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh into a neighboring country is but a
natural and logical step, and should, it is to be hoped, prove to be
not a difficult one. No efforts should be spared, and no sacrifice be
deemed too great, to establish even though it be a very small group
in a Republic occupying, both spiritually and geographically, so
strategic a position—a group which, in view of the potency with
which the words of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá have already endowed it,
cannot but draw to itself, as soon as it is formed, the outpouring
grace of the Abhá Kingdom, and evolve with such marvelous swiftness
as to excite the wonder and the admiration of even those who have
already witnessed such stirring evidences of the force and power of
the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Preference, no doubt, should be given
by all would-be pioneers, as well as by the members of the
Inter-America Committee, to the spiritual needs of this privileged
Republic, though every effort should, at the same time, be exerted to
introduce the Faith, however tentatively, to the Republics of
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica which
would link it, in an unbroken chain, with its mother Assemblies in
the North American continent. Obstacles, however formidable, should
be surmounted, the resources of the Bahá’í treasury should be
liberally expended on its behalf, and the ablest and most precious
exertions should be consecrated to the cause of its awakening. The
erection of yet another outpost of the Faith, in its heart, will
constitute, I firmly believe, a landmark in the history of the
Formative Period of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the New World.
It will create limitless opportunities, galvanize the efforts, and
reinvigorate the life, of those who will have accomplished this feat,
and infuse immense courage and boundless joy into the hearts of the
isolated groups and individuals in the neighboring and distant
Republics, and exert intangible yet powerful spiritual influences on
the life and future development of its people.

Such, dearly beloved friends, is the vista that stretches before the
eyes, and challenges the resources, of the American Bahá’í
community in these, the concluding years of the First Century of the
Bahá’í Era. Such are the qualities and qualifications demanded of
them for the proper discharge of their responsibilities and duties.
Such are the requirements, the possibilities, and the objectives of
the Plan that claims every ounce of their energy. Who knows but that
these few remaining, fast-fleeting years, may not be pregnant with
events of unimaginable magnitude, with ordeals more severe than any
that humanity has as yet experienced, with conflicts more devastating
than any which have preceded them. Dangers, however sinister, must,
at no time, dim the radiance of their new-born faith. Strife and
confusion, however bewildering, must never befog their vision.
Tribulations, however afflictive, must never shatter their resolve.
Denunciations, however clamorous, must never sap their loyalty.
Upheavals, however cataclysmic, must never deflect their course. The
present Plan, embodying the budding hopes of a departed Master, must
be pursued, relentlessly pursued, whatever may befall them in the
future, however distracting the crises that may agitate their country
or the world. Far from yielding in their resolve, far from growing
oblivious of their task, they should, at no time, however much
buffeted by circumstances, forget that the synchronization of such
world-shaking crises with the progressive unfoldment and fruition of
their divinely appointed task is itself the work of Providence, the
design of an inscrutable Wisdom, and the purpose of an all-compelling
Will, a Will that directs and controls, in its own mysterious way,
both the fortunes of the Faith and the destinies of men. Such
simultaneous processes of rise and of fall, of integration and of
disintegration, of order and chaos, with their continuous and
reciprocal reactions on each other, are but aspects of a greater
Plan, one and indivisible, whose Source is God, whose author is
Bahá’u’lláh, the theater of whose operations is the entire
planet, and whose ultimate objectives are the unity of the human race
and the peace of all mankind.</p>

Reflections such as these should steel the resolve of the entire
Bahá’í community, should dissipate their forebodings, and arouse
them to rededicate themselves to every single provision of that
Divine Charter whose outline has been delineated for them by the pen
of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá. The Seven Year Plan, as already stated,
is but the initial stage, a stepping-stone to the unfoldment of the
implications of this Charter. The impulse, originally generated
through the movement of that pen, and which is now driving forward,
with increasing momentum, the machinery of the Seven Year Plan, must,
in the opening years of the next century, be further accelerated, and
impel the American Bahá’í community to launch further stages in
the unfoldment of the Divine Plan, stages that will carry it far
beyond the shores of the Northern Hemisphere, into lands and among
peoples where that community’s noblest acts of heroism are to be
performed.</p>

Let anyone inclined to doubt the course which this enviable community
is destined to follow, turn to and meditate upon these words of
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, enshrined, for all time, in the Tablets of
the Divine Plan, and addressed to the entire community of the
believers of the United States and Canada: “<i>The full measure of
your success,</i>” He informs them, “<i>is as yet unrevealed, its
significance still unapprehended. Erelong, ye will, with your own
eyes, witness how brilliantly every one of you, even as a shining
star, will radiate, in the firmament of your country, the light of
Divine Guidance, and will bestow upon its people the glory of an
everlasting life.… The range of your future achievements still
remains undisclosed. I fervently hope that in the near future the
whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the results of your
achievements. The hope, therefore, which ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá
cherishes for you is that the same success which has attended your
efforts in America may crown your endeavors in other parts of the
world, that through you the fame of the Cause of God may be diffused
throughout the East and the West, and the advent of the Kingdom of
the Lord of Hosts be proclaimed in all the five continents of the
globe.</i>” “<i>The moment,</i>” He most significantly adds,
“<i>this Divine Message is carried forward by the American
believers from the shores of America, and is propagated throughout
the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa, and of Australasia, and
as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself
securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion. Then
will all the peoples of the world witness that this community is
spiritually illumined and divinely guided. Then will the whole earth
resound with the praises of its majesty and greatness.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p106"></a>
No reader of these words, so vibrant with promises that not even the
triumphant consummation of the Seven Year Plan can fulfill, can
expect a community that has been raised so high, and endowed so
richly, to remain content with any laurels it may win in the
immediate future. To rest upon such laurels would indeed be
tantamount to a betrayal of the trust placed in that community by
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá. To cut short the chain of victories that
must lead it on to that supreme triumph when “<i>the whole earth
may be stirred and shaken</i>” by the results of its achievements
would shatter His hopes. To vacillate, and fail to “<i>propagate
through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa, and of
Australasia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific</i>” a
Message so magnificently proclaimed by it in the American continent
would deprive it of the privilege of being “<i>securely established
upon the throne of an everlasting dominion.</i>” To forfeit the
honor of proclaiming “<i>the advent of the Kingdom of the Lord of
Hosts</i>” in “<i>all the five continents of the globe</i>”
would silence those “<i>praises of its majesty and greatness</i>”
that otherwise would echo throughout “<i>the whole earth.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-contents-51"></a><a name="adj_en-p107"></a>
Such vacillation, failure, or neglect, the American believers, the
ambassadors of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, will, I am firmly
convinced, never permit. Such a trust will never be betrayed, such
hopes can never be shattered, such a privilege will never be
forfeited, nor will such praises remain unuttered. Nay rather the
present generation of this blessed, this repeatedly blessed,
community will go from strength to strength, and will hand on, as the
first century draws to a close, to the generations that must succeed
it in the second the torch of Divine Guidance, undimmed by the
tempestuous winds that must blow upon it, that they in turn, faithful
to the wish and mandate of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, may carry that
torch, with that self-same vigor, fidelity, and enthusiasm, to the
darkest and remotest corners of the earth.</p>

Dearly beloved friends! I can do no better, eager as I am to extend
to every one of you any assistance in my power that may enable you to
discharge more effectively your divinely appointed, continually
multiplying duties, than to direct your special attention, at this
decisive hour, to these immortal passages, gleaned in part from the
great mass of Bahá’u’lláh’s unpublished and untranslated
writings. Whether in His revelation of the station and functions of
His loved ones, or His eulogies of the greatness of His Cause, or His
emphasis on the paramount importance of teaching, or the dangers
which He foreshadows, the counsels He imparts, the warnings He
utters, the vistas He discloses, and the assurances and promises He
gives, these dynamic and typical examples of Bahá’u’lláh’s
sublime utterance, each having a direct bearing on the tasks which
actually face or lie ahead of the American Bahá’í community,
cannot fail to produce on the minds and hearts of any one of its
members, who approaches them with befitting humility and detachment,
such powerful reactions as to illuminate his entire being and
intensify tremendously his daily exertions.</p>

“<i>O friends! Be not careless of the virtues with which ye have
been endowed, neither be neglectful of your high destiny.… Ye are
the stars of the heaven of understanding, the breeze that stirreth at
the break of day, the soft-flowing waters upon which must depend the
very life of all men, the letters inscribed upon His sacred scroll.</i>”
“<i>O people of Bahá! Ye are the breezes of spring that are wafted
over the world. Through you We have adorned the world of being with
the ornament of the knowledge of the Most Merciful. Through you the
countenance of the world hath been wreathed in smiles, and the
brightness of His light shone forth. Cling ye to the Cord of
steadfastness, in such wise that all vain imaginings may utterly
vanish. Speed ye forth from the horizon of power, in the name of your
Lord, the Unconstrained, and announce unto His servants, with wisdom
and eloquence, the tidings of this Cause, whose splendor hath been
shed upon the world of being. Beware lest anything withhold you from
observing the things prescribed unto you by the Pen of Glory, as it
moved over His Tablet with sovereign majesty and might. Great is the
blessedness of him that hath hearkened to its shrill voice, as it was
raised, through the power of truth, before all who are in heaven and
all who are on earth.… O people of Bahá! The river that is Life
indeed hath flowed for your sakes. Quaff ye in My name, despite them
that have disbelieved in God, the Lord of Revelation. We have made
you to be the hands of Our Cause. Render ye victorious this Wronged
One, Who hath been sore-tried in the hands of the workers of
iniquity. He, verily, will aid everyone that aideth Him, and will
remember everyone that remembereth Him. To this beareth witness this
Tablet that hath shed the splendor of the loving-kindness of your
Lord, the All-Glorious, the All-Compelling.</i>” “<i>Blessed are
the people of Bahá! God beareth Me witness! They are the solace of
the eye of creation. Through them the universes have been adorned,
and the Preserved Tablet embellished. They are the ones who have
sailed on the ark of complete independence, with their faces set
towards the Dayspring of Beauty. How great is their blessedness that
they have attained unto what their Lord, the Omniscient, the
All-Wise, hath willed. Through their light the heavens have been
adorned, and the faces of those that have drawn nigh unto Him made to
shine.</i>” “<i>By the sorrows which afflict the beauty of the
All-Glorious! Such is the station ordained for the true believer that
if to an extent smaller than a needle’s eye the glory of that
station were to be unveiled to mankind, every beholder would be
consumed away in his longing to attain it. For this reason it hath
been decreed that in this earthly life the full measure of the glory
of his own station should remain concealed from the eyes of such a
believer.</i>” “<i>If the veil be lifted, and the full glory of
the station of those who have turned wholly towards God, and in their
love for Him renounced the world, be made manifest, the entire
creation would be dumbfounded.</i>”</p>

“<i>Verily I say! No one hath apprehended the root of this Cause.
It is incumbent upon everyone, in this day, to perceive with the eye
of God, and to hearken with His ear. Whoso beholdeth Me with an eye
besides Mine own will never be able to know Me. None among the
Manifestations of old, except to a prescribed degree, hath ever
completely apprehended the nature of this Revelation.</i>” “<i>I
testify before God to the greatness, the inconceivable greatness of
this Revelation. Again and again have We, in most of Our Tablets,
borne witness to this truth, that mankind may be roused from its
heedlessness.</i>” “<i>How great is the Cause, how staggering the
weight of its Message!</i>” “<i>In this most mighty Revelation
all the Dispensations of the past have attained their highest, their
final consummation.</i>” “<i>That which hath been made manifest
in this preeminent, this most exalted Revelation, stands unparalleled
in the annals of the past, nor will future ages witness its like.</i>”
“<i>The purpose underlying all creation is the revelation of this
most sublime, this most holy Day, the Day known as the Day of God, in
His Books and Scriptures—the Day which all the Prophets, and the
Chosen Ones, and the holy ones, have wished to witness.</i>” “<i>The
highest essence and most perfect expression of whatsoever the peoples
of old have either said or written hath, through this most potent
Revelation, been sent down from the heaven of the Will of the
All-Possessing, the Ever-Abiding God.</i>” “<i>This is the Day in
which God’s most excellent favors have been poured out upon men,
the Day in which His most mighty grace hath been infused into all
created things.</i>” “<i>This is the Day whereon the Ocean of
God’s mercy hath been manifested unto men, the Day in which the
Daystar of His loving-kindness hath shed its radiance upon them, the
Day in which the clouds of His bountiful favor have overshadowed the
whole of mankind.</i>” “<i>By the righteousness of Mine own Self!
Great, immeasurably great is this Cause! Mighty, inconceivably mighty
is this Day!</i>” “<i>Every Prophet hath announced the coming of
this Day, and every Messenger hath groaned in His yearning for this
Revelation—a revelation which, no sooner had it been revealed than
all created things cried out saying, ‘The earth is God’s, the
Most Exalted, the Most Great!’</i>” “<i>The Day of the Promise
is come, and He Who is the Promised One loudly proclaimeth before all
who are in heaven and all who are on earth, ‘Verily there is none
other God but He, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting!’ I swear
by God! That which had been enshrined from eternity in the knowledge
of God, the Knower of the seen and unseen, is revealed. Happy is the
eye that seeth, and the face that turneth towards, the Countenance of
God, the Lord of all being.</i>” “<i>Great indeed is this Day!
The allusions made to it in all the sacred Scriptures as the Day of
God attest its greatness. The soul of every Prophet of God, of every
Divine Messenger, hath thirsted for this wondrous Day. All the divers
kindreds of the earth have, likewise, yearned to attain it.</i>”
“<i>This Day a door is open wider than both heaven and earth. The
eye of the mercy of Him Who is the Desire of the worlds is turned
towards all men. An act, however infinitesimal, is, when viewed in
the mirror of the knowledge of God, mightier than a mountain. Every
drop proffered in His path is as the sea in that mirror. For this is
the Day which the one true God, glorified be He, hath announced in
all His Books, unto His Prophets and His Messengers.</i>” “<i>This
is a Revelation, under which, if a man shed for its sake one drop of
blood, myriads of oceans will be his recompense.</i>” “<i>A
fleeting moment, in this Day, excelleth centuries of a bygone age.…
Neither sun nor moon hath witnessed a day such as this Day.</i>”
“<i>This is the Day whereon the unseen world crieth out, ‘Great
is thy blessedness, O earth, for thou hast been made the footstool of
thy God, and been chosen as the seat of His mighty throne.’</i>”
“<i>The world of being shineth, in this Day, with the resplendency
of this Divine Revelation. All created things extol its saving grace,
and sing its praises. The universe is wrapt in an ecstasy of joy and
gladness. The Scriptures of past Dispensations celebrate the great
Jubilee that must needs greet this most great Day of God. Well is it
with him that hath lived to see this Day, and hath recognized its
station.</i>” “<i>This Day a different Sun hath arisen, and a
different Heaven hath been adorned with its stars and its planets.
The world is another world, and the Cause another Cause.</i>” “<i>This
is the Day which past ages and centuries can never rival. Know this,
and be not of the ignorant.</i>” “<i>This is the Day whereon
human ears have been privileged to hear what He Who conversed with
God</i> [Moses] <i>heard upon Sinai, what He Who is the Friend of God</i>
[Muḥammad] <i>heard when lifted up towards Him, what He Who is the
Spirit of God</i> [Jesus] <i>heard as He ascended unto Him, the Help
in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</i>” “<i>This Day is God’s Day,
and this Cause His Cause. Happy is he who hath renounced this world,
and clung to Him Who is the Dayspring of God’s Revelation.</i>”
“<i>This is the King of Days, the Day that hath seen the coming of
the Best Beloved, He Who through all eternity hath been acclaimed the
Desire of the World.</i>” “<i>This is the Chief of all days and
the King thereof. Great is the blessedness of him who hath attained,
through the sweet savor of these days, unto everlasting life, and
who, with the most great steadfastness, hath arisen to aid the Cause
of Him Who is the King of Names. Such a man is as the eye to the body
of mankind.</i>” “<i>Peerless is this Day, for it is as the eye
to past ages and centuries, and as a light unto the darkness of the
times.</i>” “<i>This Day is different from other days, and this
Cause different from other causes. Entreat ye the one true God that
He may deprive not the eyes of men from beholding His signs, nor
their ears from hearkening unto the shrill voice of the Pen of
Glory.</i>” “<i>These days are God’s days, a moment of which
ages and centuries can never rival. An atom, in these days, is as the
sun, a drop as the ocean. One single breath exhaled in the love of
God and for His service is written down by the Pen of Glory as a
princely deed. Were the virtues of this Day to be recounted, all
would be thunderstruck, except those whom thy Lord hath exempted.</i>”
“<i>By the righteousness of God! These are the days in which God
hath proved the hearts of the entire company of His Messengers and
Prophets, and beyond them those that stand guard over His sacred and
inviolable Sanctuary, the inmates of the celestial Pavilion and
dwellers of the Tabernacle of Glory.</i>” “<i>Should the
greatness of this Day be revealed in its fullness, every man would
forsake a myriad lives in his longing to partake, though it be for
one moment, of its great glory—how much more this world and its
corruptible treasures!</i>” “<i>God the true One is My Witness!
This is the Day whereon it is incumbent upon everyone that seeth to
behold, and every ear that hearkeneth to hear, and every heart that
understandeth to perceive, and every tongue that speaketh to proclaim
unto all who are in heaven and on earth, this holy, this exalted, and
all-highest Name.</i>” “<i>Say, O men! This is a matchless Day.
Matchless must, likewise, be the tongue that celebrateth the praise
of the Desire of all nations, and matchless the deed that aspireth to
be acceptable in His sight. The whole human race hath longed for this
Day, that perchance it may fulfill that which well beseemeth its
station and is worthy of its destiny.</i>”</p>

Word, revealed by His Pen—a Pen moved by His directing Finger—His
Finger itself sustained by the power of God’s Truth.</i>” “<i>By

share, shall be so honored in the world to come that the Concourse on
high would envy his glory. No pen can depict the loftiness of his
station, neither can any tongue describe its splendor.</i>” “<i>Please
God ye may all be strengthened to carry out that which is the Will of
God, and may be graciously assisted to appreciate the rank conferred
upon such of His loved ones as have arisen to serve Him and magnify
His name. Upon them be the glory of God, the glory of all that is in
the heavens and all that is on earth, and the glory of the inmates of
the most exalted Paradise, the heaven of heavens.</i>” “<i>O
people of Bahá! That there is none to rival you is a sign of mercy.
Quaff ye of the Cup of Bounty the wine of immortality, despite them
that have repudiated God, the Lord of names and Maker of the
heavens.</i>”

“<i>I swear by the one true God! This is the day of those who have
detached themselves from all but Him, the day of those who have
recognized His unity, the day whereon God createth, with the hands of
His power, divine beings and imperishable essences, every one of whom
will cast the world and all that is therein behind him, and will wax
so steadfast in the Cause of God that every wise and understanding
heart will marvel.</i>” “<i>There lay concealed within the Holy
Veil, and prepared for the service of God, a company of His chosen
ones who shall be manifested unto men, who shall aid His Cause, who
shall be afraid of no one, though the entire human race rise up and
war against them. These are the ones who, before the gaze of the
dwellers on earth and the denizens of heaven, shall arise and,
shouting aloud, acclaim the name of the Almighty, and summon the
children of men to the path of God, the All-Glorious, the
All-Praised.</i>” “<i>The day is approaching when God will have,
by an act of His Will, raised up a race of men the nature of which is
inscrutable to all save God, the All-Powerful, the Self-Subsisting.</i>”
“<i>He will, erelong, out of the Bosom of Power, draw forth the
Hands of Ascendancy and Might—Hands who will arise to win victory
for this Youth, and who will purge mankind from the defilement of the
outcast and the ungodly. These Hands will gird up their loins to
champion the Faith of God, and will, in My name, the Self-Subsistent,
the Mighty, subdue the peoples and kindreds of the earth. They will
enter the cities, and will inspire with fear the hearts of all their
inhabitants. Such are the evidences of the might of God; how fearful,
how vehement is His might!</i>”

One more word in conclusion. Among some of the most momentous and
thought-provoking pronouncements ever made by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá,
in the course of His epoch-making travels in the North American
continent, are the following: “<i>May this American Democracy be
the first nation to establish the foundation of international
agreement. May it be the first nation to proclaim the unity of
mankind. May it be the first to unfurl the Standard of the Most Great
Peace.</i>” And again: “<i>The American people are indeed worthy
of being the first to build the Tabernacle of the Great Peace, and
proclaim the oneness of mankind.… For America hath developed powers
and capacities greater and more wonderful than other nations.… The
American nation is equipped and empowered to accomplish that which
will adorn the pages of history, to become the envy of the world, and
be blest in both the East and the West for the triumph of its
people.… The American continent gives signs and evidences of very
great advancement. Its future is even more promising, for its
influence and illumination are far-reaching. It will lead all nations
spiritually.</i>”</p>

The creative energies, mysteriously generated by the first stirrings
of the embryonic World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, have, as soon as
released within a nation destined to become its cradle and champion,
endowed that nation with the worthiness, and invested it with the
powers and capacities, and equipped it spiritually, to play the part
foreshadowed in these prophetic words. The potencies which this
God-given mission has infused into its people are, on the one hand,
beginning to be manifested through the conscious efforts and the
nationwide accomplishments, in both the teaching and administrative
spheres of Bahá’í activity, of the organized community of the
followers of Bahá’u’lláh in the North American continent. These
same potencies, apart from, yet collateral with these efforts and
accomplishments, are, on the other hand, insensibly shaping, under
the impact of the world political and economic forces, the destiny of
that nation, and are influencing the lives and actions of both its
government and its people.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p118"></a>
To the efforts and accomplishments of those who, aware of the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, are now laboring in that continent,
to their present and future course of activity, I have, in the
foregoing pages sufficiently referred. A word, if the destiny of the
American people, in its entirety, is to be correctly apprehended,
should now be said regarding the orientation of that nation as a
whole, and the trend of the affairs of its people. For no matter how
ignorant of the Source from which those directing energies proceed,
and however slow and laborious the process, it is becoming
increasingly evident that the nation as a whole, whether through the
agency of its government or otherwise, is gravitating, under the
influence of forces that it can neither comprehend nor control,
towards such associations and policies, wherein, as indicated by
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, her true destiny must lie. Both the
community of the American believers, who are aware of that Source,
and the great mass of their countrymen, who have not as yet
recognized the Hand that directs their destiny, are contributing,
each in its own way, to the realization of the hopes, and the
fulfillment of the promises, voiced in the above-quoted words of
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p119"></a>
The world is moving on. Its events are unfolding ominously and with
bewildering rapidity. The whirlwind of its passions is swift and
alarmingly violent. The New World is being insensibly drawn into its
vortex. The potential storm centers of the earth are already casting
their shadows upon its shores. Dangers, undreamt of and
unpredictable, threaten it both from within and from without. Its
governments and peoples are being gradually enmeshed in the coils of
the world’s recurrent crises and fierce controversies. The Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans are, with every acceleration in the march of
science, steadily shrinking into mere channels. The Great Republic of
the West finds itself particularly and increasingly involved. Distant
rumblings echo menacingly in the ebullitions of its people. On its
flanks are ranged the potential storm centers of the European
continent and of the Far East. On its southern horizon there looms
what might conceivably develop into another center of agitation and
danger. The world is contracting into a neighborhood. America,
willingly or unwillingly, must face and grapple with this new
situation. For purposes of national security, let alone any
humanitarian motive, she must assume the obligations imposed by this
newly created neighborhood. Paradoxical as it may seem, her only hope
of extricating herself from the perils gathering around her is to
become entangled in that very web of international association which
the Hand of an inscrutable Providence is weaving. ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá’s
counsel to a highly placed official in its government comes to mind,
with peculiar appropriateness and force: You can best serve your
country if you strive, in your capacity as a citizen of the world, to
assist in the eventual application of the principle of federalism,
underlying the government of your own country, to the relationships
now existing between the peoples and nations of the world. The ideals
that fired the imagination of America’s tragically unappreciated
President, whose high endeavors, however much nullified by a
visionless generation, ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, through His own pen,
acclaimed as signalizing the dawn of the Most Great Peace, though now
lying in the dust, bitterly reproach a heedless generation for having
so cruelly abandoned them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p120"></a>
That the world is beset with perils, that dangers are now
accumulating and are actually threatening the American nation, no
clear-eyed observer can possibly deny. The earth is now transformed
into an armed camp. As much as fifty million men are either under
arms or in reserve. No less than the sum of three billion pounds is
being spent, in one year, on its armaments. The light of religion is
dimmed and moral authority disintegrating. The nations of the world
have, for the most part, fallen a prey to battling ideologies that
threaten to disrupt the very foundations of their dearly won
political unity. Agitated multitudes in these countries seethe with
discontent, are armed to the teeth, are stampeded with fear, and
groan beneath the yoke of tribulations engendered by political
strife, racial fanaticism, national hatreds, and religious
animosities. “<i>The winds of despair,</i>” Bahá’u’lláh has
unmistakably affirmed, “<i>are, alas, blowing from every direction,
and the strife that divides and afflicts the human race is daily
increasing. The signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be
discerned.…</i>” “<i>The ills,</i>” ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá,
writing as far back as two decades ago, has prophesied, “<i>from
which the world now suffers will multiply; the gloom which envelops
it will deepen. The Balkans will remain discontented. Its
restlessness will increase. The vanquished Powers will continue to
agitate. They will resort to every measure that may rekindle the
flame of war. Movements, newly born and worldwide in their range,
will exert their utmost for the advancement of their designs. The
Movement of the Left will acquire great importance. Its influence
will spread.</i>” As to the American nation itself, the voice of
its own President, emphatic and clear, warns his people that a
possible attack upon their country has been brought infinitely closer
by the development of aircraft and by other factors. Its Secretary of
State, addressing at a recent Conference the assembled
representatives of all the American Republics, utters no less ominous
a warning. “These resurgent forces loom threateningly throughout
the world—their ominous shadow falls athwart our own Hemisphere.”
As to its Press, the same note of warning and of alarm at an
approaching danger is struck. “We must be prepared to defend
ourselves both from within and without.… Our defensive frontier is
long. It reaches from Alaska’s Point Barrow to Cape Horn, and
ranges the Atlantic and the Pacific. When or where Europe’s and
Asia’s aggressors may strike at us no one can say. It could be
anywhere, any time.… We have no option save to go armed ourselves.…
We must mount vigilant guard over the Western Hemisphere.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p121"></a>
The distance that the American nation has traveled since its formal
and categoric repudiation of the Wilsonian ideal, the changes that
have unexpectedly overtaken it in recent years, the direction in
which world events are moving, with their inevitable impact on the
policies and the economy of that nation, are to every Bahá’í
observer, viewing the developments in the international situation, in
the light of the prophecies of both Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, most significant, and highly instructive and
encouraging. To trace the exact course which, in these troubled times
and pregnant years, this nation will follow would be impossible. We
can only, judging from the direction its affairs are now taking,
anticipate the course she will most likely choose to pursue in her
relationships with both the Republics of America and the countries of
the remaining continents. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p122"></a>
A closer association with these Republics, on the one hand, and an
increased participation, in varying degrees, on the other, in the
affairs of the whole world, as a result of recurrent international
crises, appear as the most likely developments which the future has
in store for that country. Delays must inevitably arise, setbacks
must be suffered, in the course of that country’s evolution towards
its ultimate destiny. Nothing, however, can alter eventually that
course, ordained for it by the unerring pen of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá.
Its federal unity having already been achieved and its internal
institutions consolidated—a stage that marked its coming of age as
a political entity—its further evolution, as a member of the family
of nations, must, under circumstances that cannot at present be
visualized, steadily continue. Such an evolution must persist until
such time when that nation will, through the active and decisive part
it will have played in the organization and the peaceful settlement
of the affairs of mankind, have attained the plenitude of its powers
and functions as an outstanding member, and component part, of a
federated world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p123"></a>
The immediate future must, as a result of this steady, this gradual,
and inevitable absorption in the manifold perplexities and problems
afflicting humanity, be dark and oppressive for that nation. The
world-shaking ordeal which Bahá’u’lláh, as quoted in the
foregoing pages, has so graphically prophesied, may find it swept, to
an unprecedented degree, into its vortex. Out of it it will probably
emerge, unlike its reactions to the last world conflict, consciously
determined to seize its opportunity, to bring the full weight of its
influence to bear upon the gigantic problems that such an ordeal must
leave in its wake, and to exorcise forever, in conjunction with its
sister nations of both the East and the West, the greatest curse
which, from time immemorial, has afflicted and degraded the human
race.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="adj_en-p124"></a>
Then, and only then, will the American nation, molded and purified in
the crucible of a common war, inured to its rigors, and disciplined
by its lessons, be in a position to raise its voice in the councils
of the nations, itself lay the cornerstone of a universal and
enduring peace, proclaim the solidarity, the unity, and maturity of
mankind, and assist in the establishment of the promised reign of
righteousness on earth. Then, and only then, will the American
nation, while the community of the American believers within its
heart is consummating its divinely appointed mission, be able to
fulfill the unspeakably glorious destiny ordained for it by the
Almighty, and immortally enshrined in the writings of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá.
Then, and only then, will the American nation accomplish “<i>that
which will adorn the pages of history,</i>” “<i>become the envy
of the world and be blest in both the East and the West.</i>”</p>
