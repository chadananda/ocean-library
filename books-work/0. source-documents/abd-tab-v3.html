<p id='1' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art firm in <span data-pg='485'></span> the Covenant! </p>

<p id='1.2' class='dropcap'> Thou hast asked regarding the phrase, “He is God!” written above the Tablets. By this word it is intended that no one hath any access to the Invisible Essence. The way is barred and the road is impassable. In this world all men must turn their faces toward “Him-whom God-shall-Manifest.” He is the “Dawning-place of Divinity” and the “Manifestation of Deity.” He is the “Ultimate Goal,” the “Adored One” of all and the “Worshipped One” of all. Otherwise, whatever flashes through the mind is not that Essence of essences and the Reality of realities; nay, rather it is pure imagination <a data-fnid='1'></a> woven by man and is surrounded, not the surrounding. Consequently, it returns finally to the realm and conjectures. </p>

<p id='2' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O God! O thou Attracted of the hearts of the favored ones toward the Manifest Horizon! </p>

<p id='2.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, Thou art witnessing that the fire is ablaze in the breasts, the tears are streaming from the eyes and the period of patience and silence hath come to an end. The eyes of the beloved ones, O my God, are swimming in tears; the hearts of the yearning ones, O my Beloved, are wandering in the wilderness of Thy mercifulness; and the souls of the attracted ones, O my Desire, are afflicted with anguish on account of Thy separation! </p>

<p id='2.3'> Verily, they have heard Thy universal <span data-pg='486'></span> proclamation, </p>

<p id='2.4'> O my God, and what Thou hast revealed in the Qur’án: “Say! Travel ye on the earth, so that ye may behold the signs of the mercy of God.” Thereupon, after Thy ascension, the people of faithfulness have arisen, traveling to distant lands and hastening to far and remote regions of the world, in order to cry out Thy Name, to remind the souls of the arrival of Thy days, to lead the minds to the fountain of Thy signs, to demonstrate to all the inhabitants of the world Thy proof and Thy religion, to guide the truth seekers to the right path and to indicate the straight highway to the strivers. From among them is Thy servant ______ who is firm in the Ancient Covenant, fleeing from the people of darkness, drinking from the water of eternal life and intoxicated with the wine which is overflowing from the divine cup. Verily, he hath left his native abode, waved the hand of farewell to his relatives, forsaken ease and comfort, hastened to strange and unknown kingdoms and accepted hardship and adversities while heralding Thy Name, commemorating Thy glorification, attracted to Thy beauty, stirred by the fragrances of Thy holiness, speaking Thy praises, voicing Thy Cause, guiding others to Thee, proving Thy religion, demonstrating Thy irrefutable truth, becoming an answerer to every questioning one and a guide to every one held in error! </p>

<p id='2.5'> O my Lord! O my Lord! Verily, he endured every affliction in Thy path and bore patiently every hardship and adversity in Thy love. A breath of rest hath he not breathed, neither hath he sought after any favor, abode or habitation in this world; nay, rather hath he walked in the footsteps of Thy most exalted Word, His <span data-pg='487'></span> Highness Christ, for he hath taken the stars for his lamp, the earth for his bed and the herbs for his food. Notwithstanding this, his cry was raised in the assemblages and his voice was heard in the meetings. The seekers flowed toward him and the thirsty ones hastened to drink from the water of his utterance. O my God! This in no other than through Thy generosity, Thy beneficence, Thy mercy, and Thy favors. O my God! Help him by the hosts of the approximate angels, assist him by the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse amid Thy creatures, make him a lamp of guidance in that distant part of the earth and a luminary shining and sparkling from the dawning-place of faithfulness, in order that he may serve Thy holy threshold, falling prostrate upon the ground thanking and praising for Thy bounty, liberality and gifts to him; girding up his loins of endeavor in Thy service and becoming reinforced and empowered in Thy adoration! </p>

<p id='2.6'> O my Lord! O my Lord! Assign for him every bounty and suffer him to become the sign of Thy gifts amid Thy people. then have pity upon me, forgive me, show me Thy mercy and make me a sharer in his services, a partner in his adversities and a companion in his loneliness. </p>

<p id='2.7'> Verily Thou art the Confirmer, the Assister, the Mighty, the Generous, the Compassionate and the Merciful! </p>

<p id='3' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='3.2' class='dropcap'> Your letters have been received. God willing, answer will be given very soon, but as a matter of great importance is on foot (afloat), therefore I write it to <span data-pg='488'></span> you in brief and it is this, that his honor Mr. ______ must compose a letter of thanks on behalf of the believers of America in general and that letter of thanks should be addressed to a very eminent and lofty personage. (The contents of that letter must be of this nature:) “That excellent news hath reached American countries that His Royal Highness, the noble Prince, hath dealt with utmost justice with the subjects and the people and hath treated all the subjects with perfect equality. He hath protected the rights of all and forbidden the exhortations of the tyrants. He is dealing with utmost kindness and affinity and is an asylum for every oppressed one and an open treasury to every indigent one. He decides with justice the case of every pleader and is a refuge and protection to the helpless. Consequently, we in general, who are the well-wishers of the government and Persian nation, with utmost gratification are praising and commending the justice of His Royal Highness, the Prince, and are content and glad; and in order to manifest our thanks we present this petition; and whatever in the line of service is commanded us, we are ready to comply with the most extreme diligence. We ask earnestly from God that the Imperial Government become everlasting, His Imperial Majesty, the just <u>Sh</u>áh, remain and live long, and His Royal Highness, the Prince, become to every subject a divine gift and that he may become confirmed and helped in all affairs.” </p>

<p id='3.3'> Let there be two copies of this petition and the more the believers sign each of these two copies, the better it is. Each person must sign personally. Then (when they are finished) you must forward them here. We will <span data-pg='489'></span> write them the address and forward to that destination. Wisdom does not permit the mentioning of the name of these two distinguished personages; therefore, it is better to be left unknown. </p>

<p id='3.4'> His honor Mr. ______ must compose these two petitions in English with utmost eloquence and perfect style. You, likewise, must translate them and forward them here with translations. </p>

<p id='3.5'> Upon thee be greeting and praise! </p>

  </div>

<p id='4' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='4.2'> Now I have found the opportunity to answer the petitions recently received and forward them to you in this mail. </p>

<p id='4.3' class='dropcap'> Regarding the subject of Persia: Praise be to God! she became the East of the Sun of Truth in this age. The Light of Eternity dawned, the Everlasting Glory unveiled her countenance and the Reality of Mercifulness became manifest. This is the prosperity of Persia. Undoubtedly she will progress day by day under the shade of the Blessed Tree until her illumination shall penetrate throughout the wide expanse of the earth. </p>

<p id='4.4'> Regarding the question of the establishment of the National Assembly: This National Assembly <a data-fnid='2'></a> will not bring any rapid results. Now some of the agitators are harboring evil intentions and do not let agreement and union be realized between the nations and the government. They are instigating the hopeless ones at every moment and sending them to the British Legation, while on the other hand they ask private assistance and protection <span data-pg='490'></span> from the government so that they may procure wealth. Each and all of the clergy are thinking in this line. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn2'> Established Sept. 12, 1906 </aside>

<p id='4.5'> However, we have nothing to do with these proceedings and counter-proceedings. We are commanded to quicken the souls, to train the characters, to illumine the realm of man, to guide all the inhabitants of the earth, to create concord and unity among all men and to lead the world of humanity to the Fountain of the Everlasting Glory. The reformation of one empire is not our aim; nay, rather we invoke from God that all the regions of the world be reformed and cultivated; the republic of men become the manifestors of the bounty of the most glorious Lord; the East and the West be brought nearer together; and that the Turk and Tajik, Írán and America, India and Arabia, Japan and Persia, China and Germany; in brief, all the nations and peoples of the world become as one soul and one spirit, in order that strife and warfare be entirely removed and the rancor and hostility disappear so that all become as the waves of one ocean, the drops of one sea, the flowers of one rose-garden, the trees of one orchard, the grains of one harvest and the plants of one meadow. </p>

<p id='4.6'> Regarding the statement that hath been given out as the saying of His Majesty the <u>Sh</u>áh: This hath no connection whatever with the Bahá’ís; nay, rather it hath meant the Bábís. Mírzá Yaḥyá, the son of Mírzá Hádí of Dawlih Ábád, and a few souls of Azalís <a data-fnid='3'></a> who are living in Ṭihrán and were at one time secret friends of Jamáli’d-Dín of Af<u>gh</u>án, have allied themselves with the party, which is working against the government,<span data-pg='491'></span> and is engaged in the work of instigating and inciting the people. His Imperial Majesty did mean these souls, that is, the Bábís, not the Bahá’ís. But it is an established fact that the Bahá’ís are the well-wishers of the nation and the government; are showing forth obedience and displaying good intentions; are not interfering in political matters; are engaged in the education and spiritualization of characters and are occupied with the training of the ignorant ones. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn3'> Followers of Ṣubḥ-i-Azal who disturbed the Bábís by claiming to be the One promised by the Báb. </aside>

<p id='4.7'> O thou who art firm in the Covenant! The general historical report about the Cause of God in that country,<a data-fnid='4'></a> that thou hast forwarded to Man<u>sh</u>ádí,<a data-fnid='5'></a> became very acceptable. Undoubtedly you must, every few months, write a report about the general conditions and attitudes of the Cause of God in America and forward it to ‘Akká, so that we may send it to Persia to be printed and spread among the people. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn4'> America. </aside>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn5'> One of the well-known Bahá’ís of Egypt. </aside>

<p id='4.8'> O thou yearning servant of the Beauty of Abhá! In the time that all the ulemas and sages, leaders, merchants and traders, nay, even the public itself from the highest to the lowest have taken refuge in the British Legation and began to complain and clamor that they are oppressed, His royal highness <u>Sh</u>u‘á’s-Sulṭánih, the son of the <u>Sh</u>áh, cried in the Assembly of Nobles: “These ‘ulamás and <u>Sh</u>í‘ahs leaders are always stigmatizing the Bahá’ís, saying, ‘They are the ill-wishers of the government and the corruptors of nations!’ Now consider ye with the eye of justice! Sixty years have rolled by and the Bahá’ís have been the object of the sword of affliction and the target of the arrows of oppression. Thousands of houses have been destroyed, <span data-pg='492'></span> children became captives, women became prisoners, property was pillaged and not even a small child remained safe; yet, notwithstanding all of this, not one single Bahá’í took refuge under the flag of a foreign power! Now these <u>Sh</u>í‘ahs, though they have always been treated with the utmost favor and benefit by the government, yet without the slightest reason they went under the protection of a foreign power and brought down such humiliation and dishonor upon the nation and the government! If they presented primarily their petitions to the government, their wishes would be complied with in a better and more effective way. This is the difference between the <u>Sh</u>í‘ahs and the Bahá’ís!” </p>

  </div>

<p id='5' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='5.2' class='dropcap'> I have received the eloquent article which thou hast written at the moment of the arrival of the most great glad-tidings regarding the establishment of the National Assembly and organization of the constitutional and judicial government of Persia according to the evident command of the Book of Aqdas, and the spontaneous joy and the genuine sympathy demonstrated by the people of science and discernment in America at hearing this soul-refreshing news, and the utmost happiness to the members of the Legation. I read it and it became the cause of the utmost joy and fragrance. </p>

<p id='5.3'> The Constitutional Government, according to the irrefutable text of the Religion of God, is the cause of the glory and prosperity of the nation and the civilization and freedom of the people. However, according to what is known, the hands of the selfish leaders from among the ulemas (Muḥammadan clergy) are in this <span data-pg='493'></span> affair. Outwardly they are desiring the establishment of the National Assembly and at every moment they are crying and clamoring (for its immediate realization), but inwardly they are sowing the seeds of corruption and agitation and try to put at naught the noble intention of the government. In the secret of their hearts and souls they do not favor the upbuilding of the National Assembly, the civilization of Persia, the awakening of the people, the advancement of the age, the spreading of knowledge and public instruction, Thieves like to lurk in darkness; fishers desire disturbed water; the bat shuns the rays of the sun; the black beetle dislikes the fragrance of the rose-garden; the ferocious wolf is in expectation of the sleet and snow; and the wine seller sees his advantage in the inebriate, irrational drinker. These leaders of religion also desire to behold the nation thrown into a weltering chaos of ignorance so that the rein of affairs remain in the hands of the arrogant ulemas. They know that if the nation began to adore wisdom, truthfulness, progression and fidelity, it would bring about their (the ulemas) degradation. </p>

<p id='5.4'> However, rest ye assured upon the favor and bounty of His Highness the Almighty; for the Imperial throne of Persia is confirmed and the Crown of the Sovereignty of the East is protected. Undoubtedly the noble purpose of His Imperial Majesty will play an important role in the development of Persia. May God help and send victory from the Supreme Kingdom, the heavenly powers become supporters and the mercy and bestowal of His Highness the Merciful One become the helpers! Be ye engaged in prayer that with the utmost good-pleasure <span data-pg='494'></span> the nation obey the government, comply with the wise counsels of the attendants of the central dominion, give no heed to the hearsay of the agitators and rise not to quarrel with to protest against the government like unto the Russian Douma, so as to throw the whole empire, the nation and the kingdom into a sea of anarchy and lawlessness. Much prayer is needed so that God may help and protect. </p>

<p id='5.5'> The marks of kindness that thou hast shown to his honor Mr. ______ became highly acceptable. You must treat the strangers, at all times, in this manner and help, as far as possible, all the nations of the world. </p>

<p id='5.6'> O thou who art firm in the Covenant! Truly, I say, thou art firm and have risen to perform the conditions of firmness. This very matter of his honor Mr. ______ is a sign of wonder to all men and the greatest proof of the power of the Word of God and the penetration of the servitude of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. As thou art walking in this road and art steadfast in this path, know thou of a certainty that the assistance of Providence will descend upon thee and the confirmation of the Kingdom unveil herself to thee. </p>

  </div>

<p id='6' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art firm in the covenant! </p>

<p id='6.2' class='dropcap'> An article in the Broadway Magazine of September, 1906, written by G. A. Dobson and published in New York, was read. It is entitled, “The Strangest Religion in New York.” Unquestionably, you get that magazine and read it. The writer complains of the Ottoman government and its treatment toward the Bahá’í community. There is no doubt that this article will be read by His Excellency the Turkish Minister or the <span data-pg='495'></span> members of the Legation. The truth is that His Imperial Majesty the Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd <u>Kh</u>án hath exercised the utmost justice towards ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Although the internal and external enemies entered into an alliance, wrote reports full of pure calumnies and baseless impositions, became themselves the complainers and witnesses, a body of examiners came from Constantinople for the investigation of the true situation and that committee of commissioners became united with the outside and inside enemies, ratifying all the impositions and adding to those some more important matters, yet His Imperial Majesty ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd <u>Kh</u>án — may God assist him! — acted with deliberation until it became known and evident that all these calumnies were founded upon rancor and hostility. Therefore, he hath treated us, until this present time, with the utmost justice and because of this treatment we are exceedingly happy. If there were any other king beside His Imperial Majesty Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd <u>Kh</u>án, he would exercise his authority in another way in the face of these unjust imputations and conspiracies of the external and internal foes. Nevertheless, the justice and equity of the Sulṭán prevented the attacks of the enemies and the reports of the people of oppositions and falsehood from producing any effect. Therefore, all the friends must pray from their hearts in behalf of their Imperial Majesties the Padeshah of the Ottomans and the <u>Sh</u>áh of Persia. As in these days His Imperial Majesty Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd <u>Kh</u>án is in a state of illness and indisposition, therefore the believers of God, in meetings and assemblages, in private and public, must invoke from the Threshold of Oneness <span data-pg='496'></span> swift recovery for him. The friends and strangers must know and realize that all the believers of God have the utmost love for His Majesty the Padeshah of the Ottoman empire and that they are entreating for him protection and confirmation. </p>

<p id='7' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='7.2' class='dropcap'> The International Congress of Religions was organized this year <a data-fnid='6'></a> in the capital of Japan. Many souls hastened to that empire from different parts of the world, in order that they might talk of and discuss the principles of their own religions, each one longing to convert that assembly to his own religion and establish the validity of his own particular belief. This congress had under discussion the politics of the religions. In truth, it is not a political affair and not the attraction of the heart, faith, advancement toward God nor enkindlement with the fire of the love of God. This congress will not produce a lasting effect, for it is essentially politico-religious. What is effective and conducive to the penetration of the Word of God and the attraction of hearts is the fragrances of holiness and the divine glad-tidings, which the members of the congress do not in the least comprehend. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn6'> During 1906. </aside>

<p id='7.3'> Consequently, if the believers of God go to that country — not to the congress — and through the power of the Word of God, the breath of the Holy Spirit, the reading of the verses of Oneness and associating with the individual inhabitants of that kingdom, undoubtedly untold and tremendous results will be realized and the sweet fragrance of the rose-garden of mysteries will <span data-pg='497'></span> perfume the nostrils of the people of those regions. It is significantly useful if some of the friends of God put forth an effort and hasten from America to those parts (Japan). </p>

<p id='7.4'> O thou servant of God! Unquestionably, through the manifestation of the Infinite Power in this glorious age, wonderful signs will appear in the world and great changes are seen in the present and promised in the future, for the Word of God is like unto the Spirit, and the contingent world like unto the embryo in the womb of the mother. Through the power of the Spirit such various changes and metamorphoses become apparent, transforming them from one form to another. Especially in Persia, through the power of the Word of God, wonderful signs will appear. </p>

<p id='7.5'> O thou servant of the True One! Though I had not the opportunity of reading one line of the paper *** yet I read it with the utmost attention. Truly, I say, it was a superior paper and the details of the reception of the two great ambassadors in the house of the favored and attracted maid-servant of God, Miss. ______, became known. Such receptions are very acceptable and praiseworthy. You must all show forth the utmost consideration to these two ambassadors, neither do ye fall short in serving them in whatever manner possible. </p>

<p id='7.6'> It is very acceptable for you to present to them the excellent praises which the Blessed Perfection hath made in behalf of these two governments, the exhortations which He hath delivered for obedience to them and the prayers He hath written for the confirmation and protection of His Imperial Majesty the <u>Sh</u>áh. <span data-pg='498'></span> Likewise, the advices and recommendations that this servant (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, himself) hath written in Tablets to Persia and America; also the irrefutable command that the Blessed Perfection hath given in Tablets that the believers must obey the kings with the utmost sincerity and fidelity, and He hath forbidden them to interfere at all with political problems. He hath even prohibited the believers from discussing political affairs. </p>

<p id='7.7'> Convey respectful greeting on my behalf to the favored maid-servant of God, Miss. ______, with the utmost kindness and announce to her: “These services and self-sacrifices of thine in the Kingdom of God are acceptable.” </p>

<p id='7.8'> O thou servant of the Blessed Perfection! Since I have found this paper very eloquent, I send it to Persia. </p>

<p id='7.9'> O thou dear friend! I entreat from His Highness the Desired One that He may grant divine confirmation to that illumined youth to such an extent that he may become the main-spring of spiritual emotions in those regions. </p>

<p id='7.10'> Convey respectful greeting with the utmost longing to all the friends of God on behalf of this servant. </p>

<p id='8'> Thy letters were received.

But <span data-pg='499'></span> to those letters which are received, God willing, no neglect will be displayed so far as there is time to answer them. </p>

<p id='8.2'> Thou hast written regarding the formation of three gatherings for spreading the Tablets; this is very acceptable. </p>

<p id='11' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye illumined friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful! <a data-fnid='7'></a> </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn7'> To the Fair Hope (Ala.) assembly. </aside>

<p id='11.2' class='dropcap'> When the darkness of ignorance and heedlessness concerning the realm of eternity and bereavement (or deprivation) from the True One had encircled the universe, then the resplendent Luminary dawned and the brilliant Light illumined the horizon of the East. Hence, the Sun of Reality shone forth, scattering the sparkling lights of the Kingdom to the East and to the West. Those who had seeing eyes found the Most Great Glad-tidings, began to cry the call, “O blessed are we! O blessed are we!” — and have beheld the reality of things in themselves, have discovered the mysteries of the Kingdom, were released from superstition and doubts, perceived the lights of Truth and became so intoxicated with the cup of the love of God, that, wholly forgetting themselves and the world while dancing, they ran with utmost joy and ecstacy to the city of Martyrdom, sacrificing their minds and their lives upon the alter of Love. </p>

<p id='11.3'> But those who were blinded became astonished and on account of these joyous acclamations were bewildered and beginning to cry, “Where is the light?” and said, “We do not behold any light, we do not see any rising sun! It is void of any truth! This is pure imagination!” </p>

<p id='11.4'> However, they have hastened bat-like in the darkness below the ground, and according to their own <span data-pg='503'></span> thoughts they have found a little comfort and tranquility. Nevertheless, it is yet the early dawn and the strength of the heat and rays of the Sun of Truth have not yet made their torrid and complete impression. When it reacheth the zenith, the heat will interpenetrate with such great intensity that it will move and spur to the greatest velocity even the insects below the earth. Although they are not able to behold the light, yet the penetration of the heat will move and agitate all of them. </p>

<p id='11.5'> Consequently, O ye friends of God, be ye thankful that in the Day of Effulgence ye have turned your faces to the Orb of the regions and beheld the Lights! Ye have received a portion from the rays of Truth and are endowed with a share from the Everlasting Outpouring. Therefore, ye must not rest one minute, but thank Him for this bestowal. </p>

<p id='11.6'> Be ye not seated and silent! Diffuse the glad-tidings of the Kingdom far and wide to the ears, promulgate the Word of God, and put into practice the advices and covenants of God; that is, arise ye with such qualities and attributes that ye may continually bestow life to the body of the world, and nurse the infants of the universe up to the station of maturity and perfection. Enkindle with all your might in every meeting the light of the love of God, gladden and cheer every heart with the utmost loving-kindness, show forth your love to strangers just as you show forth to your relations. If a soul is seeking to quarrel, ask ye for reconciliation; if he blame ye, praise [him]; if he give you a deadly poison, bestow ye an all-healing antidote; if he createth death, administer ye eternal life; if he <span data-pg='504'></span> becometh a thorn, change ye into roses and hyacinths. Perchance, through such deeds and words, this darkened world will become illuminated, this terrestrial universe will become transformed into a heavenly realm, and this satanic prison become a divine court; warfare and bloodshed be annihilated, and love and faithfulness hoist the tent of unity upon the apex of the world. </p>

<p id='11.7'> These are the results of the divine advices and exhortations, and the epitome of the teachings of the Bahá’í Cycle. </p>

<p id='13.2' class='dropcap'> The maid-servant of God, Aseyeh, hath mentioned thy name in her letter, praising and commending thee. Likewise thy letter was received. I was exceedingly happy on account of the love of the maid-servant of God, Aseyeh, for thee. The advent of the prophets and the revelation of the Holy Books is intended to create love between souls and friendship between the inhabitants of the earth. Real love is impossible unless one turn his face towards God and be attracted to His Beauty. The maid-servants of the Merciful should love each other with heart and soul; for though there be many bodies, the spirit of faith is one and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is universal. There is one Light but many lamps; there is one Wine but the glasses differ. So thou shouldst love with all thy heart and soul the maid-servants of the Merciful and associate with them in utmost affection in order that thou mayest realize divine happiness and behold the outpouring of mercy. </p>

<p id='13.3'> I beseech God that heavenly blessings may descend upon thee, guiding thy relatives, adding day by day to thy joy and happiness, so that thou mayest become a heavenly herald, leading others to the Light of <span data-pg='506'></span> Truth. </p>

<p id='27' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou seeker after Truth! </p>

<p id='27.2' class='dropcap'> The question of the Trinity, since the time of His Holiness Christ until now, is the belief of the Christians, and to the present time all the learned among them are perplexed and confounded. All have confessed that the question is beyond the grasp of reason, for three cannot become one, nor one three. To unite these is impossible; it is either one or three. If we say the Essence of Divinity is divided, even in some aspects, division is one of the necessities of the contingent world and of generation, but the Ancient is holy (i.e., whole and indivisible). If we say that the Trinity was <span data-pg='513'></span> originally one and was later divided, change and transformation will be necessarily applied to the Essence of Oneness, and change and transformation are necessities of the contingent world and not of the Essence of Divinity. If we say this number is Ancient, three Ancients become necessary, and among the three some are distinguished which are also Ancients. In this wise five Ancients are the result, and among the five are those who are distinguished and thus nine Ancients become necessary, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. </p>

<p id='27.3'> Thus considered, Trinity is made a necessity, although the falsity of Trinity is evident. Furthermore, the signs of oneness are evident and plain in all existence. If thou shouldst gather all existent beings, thou wouldst be unable to find two alike in all states and qualities; of necessity there is difference. Thus the signs of oneness are manifest and evident in all things. How much more is the Creator of all things! </p>

<p id='27.4'> But there are, in the Gospels, clear expressions indicative of Trinity; among them: “The Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father.” As Christians did not understand the meaning of this expression, their thoughts were scattered. </p>

<p id='27.5'> The reality of this question is as follows: Divine Oneness is proven and He revealeth Himself in the Holy Essences. The sun is one sun but manifesteth itself in different mirrors. If thou lookest into the mirror and seest the manifestation of the sun, thou wilt say, the sun is in the mirror and this sun manifest in the mirror is the same sun of the heavens; although two suns, yet in reality they are one. The sun hath not descended from its high and lofty station, it hath not <span data-pg='514'></span> taken up its abode in this mirror, but hath manifested itself therein. </p>

<p id='27.6'> The Christ reality was like unto a pure mirror and the Sun of Reality shone upon it from the Holy Horizon. Therefore, it became evident that the sun is one with regard to reality but manifesting itself in all mirrors. </p>

<p id='27.7'> This question was explained in full for Miss. ______, who translated it upon paper. Thou wilt soon learn thereof.<a data-fnid='14'></a>  This difficult question in its entirety was elucidated, explained and proven. </p>

<p id='28.2' class='dropcap'> The Supper of the Lord which His Highness the Spirit (Christ) ate with the apostles was a heavenly supper and not one of material bread and water, for material objects have no connection with spiritual objects. As at that time material food was also present, therefore the leaders of the religion of Christ thought that it was material food which was changed into spiritual food. </p>

<p id='28.3'> The proof that it was not material food is this: The apostles upon many occasions partook of material food with His Highness Christ, yet the supper of that night became designated as the “Lord’s Supper.” From this designation it is plain and evident that they ate heavenly food at that supper. That heavenly food consisted of the love of God, the knowledge of God, the mysteries of God and the bestowal of <span data-pg='515'></span> God. </p>

<p id='49.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read thy excellent letter and praised God, for He hath removed the veil (from thy sight), caused the light of guidance to appear, filled for thee the cup of bestowal and directed thee to His Kingdom. </p>

<p id='52' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! <a data-fnid='18'></a> </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn18'> To the Montreal (Canada) assembly. </aside>

<p id='52.2' class='dropcap'> His honor Mr. ______ wrote a letter and in that letter he mentioned your names, asking divine favor on your behalf. While reading your names I opened my tongue in thanksgiving in the Threshold of Oneness, that he hath granted such favor and bestowed such providence. He guided the souls and pointed out to them the entrance to the Kingdom. Such confirmation deserveth thanks and praise, and such guidance is the most great bounty of His Highness the One. </p>

<p id='52.3'> Likewise, you must be engaged day and night, with all your soul and heart, in thanksgiving and in the glorification of His Highness the Desired One who hath created you in such a glorious period, made you the manifestors of guidance in the Day of the Lord, imparted to you the insight and enkindled your souls and spirits with the fire of love. Today the grandeur, the majesty, the splendor and the magnitude of this station is not clear and manifest because it is the time of seed-sowing and <span data-pg='532'></span> the beginning of the planting of trees in the orchard of the Merciful One. When that seed is grown and the tree reacheth the time of its fruition, then many harvests shall be gathered and all regions and kingdoms shall be adorned with its blossoms and fruits. </p>

<p id='52.4'> Ere long the Adored One of this providence will become the Beloved of the assemblages of the world and the rays of the Sun of Truth will illumine every house, every place and corner. At that time the greatness and superiority of the friends of God will become evident and demonstrated. </p>

<p id='52.5'> Consider ye! In the day of His Highness Christ, the grandeur and majesty of their Holiness the Apostles, was not known. After three-hundred years the loftiness of the station and the exaltation of their attainment became manifest. Ere long the result of the deeds in this cycle of Bahá’u’lláh will appear and every one of the friends and the maid-servants will be crowned with a diadem whose splendid gems will radiate brilliancy and effulgence throughout cycles and ages. </p>

<p id='52.6'> Therefore, O ye servants of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful One, do ye not rest for one moment! Do ye not seek any composure! Do ye not wish for any rest and ease! endeavor and make ye an effort with all your heart and soul to spread the fragrances of Paradise, to raise the eternal melody of the Kingdom of Abhá, to establish the gathering of fellowship, to become assisted with the confirmations of the Holy Spirit; to clothe the temple of existence with a new garment; to bestow eternal life upon the reality of souls; to become a cause of the civilization of the <span data-pg='533'></span> human world; to characterize the bloodthirsty animals with the heavenly attributes and divine commemorations; to pacify the world with peace and salvation, and to adorn man with the favors of His Highness the Merciful One; that perchance ignorance, animosity and strangeness may be removed entirely from among the denizens of the world, and the Banner of Reconciliation, Freedom, Nobleness and Oneness be hoisted; for the chains of existence contain countless links, each connected with the other. This connection is the cause of the appearance of the invisible powers of the world of the visible. </p>

<p id='52.7'> O ye real friends! Make ye an effort that this universe may become another universe and this darkened world find a ray of the Sun of Truth and become luminous and refulgent. </p>

<p id='52.8'> I entreat God that this favor may be realized and this unending outpouring become manifest and apparent, and the friends of God be confirmed by every bounty. </p>

The spring of this year is the same as the spring of last year. The origins and ends are the same. The sun of today is the sun of yesterday. In the coming of Christ, the divine teachings were given in accordance with the infancy of the human race. The teachings of Bahá’u’lláh have the same basic principles, but are according to the stage of the maturity of the world and the requirements of this illumined age. O thou seeker of the Kingdom!

  </div>

<p id='58' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou wooer of Truth and attracted one toward the Kingdom of God! </p>

<p id='58.2' class='dropcap'> Thy detailed letter was received and its reading produced the utmost joy, for it was a glorious proof of the loftiness of thy aim and the exaltation of thine intention. Praise be to God! that thou art the well-wisher of the human world, art attracted to the Kingdom of Abhá and art aspiring for the advancement of the realm of humanity. I hope that, through the instrumentality of these lofty thoughts, attractions of <span data-pg='537'></span> heart and heavenly glad-tidings, thou mayest become so illumined that, through the mildly beaming splendor of the love of God, thou mayest shine and gleam throughout centuries and cycles. </p>

<p id='58.3'> Thou hast written that thou art a student in the progressive spiritual school. Happy is thy condition! If the various progressive schools join themselves to the universal university of the Kingdom, such knowledge and sciences will be brought into light that man will see that the potentialities of the “Open Tablet” of existence are infinite; will realize that all the created things are as letters and words; will be instructed in the lessons of the degrees of significances; will perceive the signs of oneness in the primordial atoms of the earth; will hear the voice of the Lord of the Kingdom; will behold the confirmations of the Holy Spirit and will find such ecstasy and joy that, being unable to contain himself in the vast area of existence, he will prepare himself for the journey toward the Kingdom and will hasten to the immensity of the Realm of Might. As soon as a bird is fledged, it cannot keep itself on the ground; nay, rather it soareth up toward the Supreme Apex — except the birds whose feet are tied, whose wings are clipped and feathers broken and who are soiled with water and clay. </p>

<p id='58.4'> O seeker of Truth! The realm of the Kingdom is a unit. The only difference lies in this: That when the season of spring dawneth, a new and wonderful motion and rejuvenation is witnessed in all the existing things; the mountains and the meadows are revived; the trees find freshness and delicacy and are clothed with radiant and bright leaves, blossoms and fruits. In a <span data-pg='538'></span> like manner the preceding Manifestations form an inseparable link with the subsequent dispensations; nay, rather they are identical with each other. Since the world is constantly developing itself, the rays become stronger, the outpourings becometh greater and the sun appeareth in the meridian orbit. </p>

<p id='58.5'> O thou yearner after the Kingdom! Each Manifestation is the heart of the world and the proficient Physician of every patient. The world of humanity is sick, but the skilled Physician hath the healing remedy and He bestoweth divine teachings, exhortations and advices which are the remedy of every ailment and the dressing for every wound. Undoubtedly, the wise physician discovereth the needs of the patient at every season and prescribeth medicine. Therefore, when thou wilt compare the teachings of the Beauty of Abhá with the requisitions and necessities of the present time, thou wilt conclude that they are to the sick body of the world the swift healing antidote; nay, rather they are the remedy of everlasting health. The prescription of the proficient physicians of the past and the future will not be the same; nay, rather they will be in accord with the ailment of the patient. Although the medicine is changed, yet all of these are for the sole purpose of the healing of the sick. In former dispensations the sick body of the world could not bear the strong and overpowering remedies. That is why His Highness the Christ said: “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when He, the Spirit of the Comforter, who is sent by the Father, is come, He will guide you into all truth.” Therefore, in this age of lights, specific teachings have become universal, <span data-pg='539'></span> in order that the outpouring of the Merciful One environ both the East and the West, the oneness of the Kingdom of humanity become visible and the luminosity of truth enlighten the world of consciousness. The descent of the New Jerusalem is the heavenly religion which secures the prosperity of the human world and is the effulgence of the illumination of the realm of God. In reality Emmanuel was the forerunner of the second coming of His Highness the Christ and the herald of the path of the Kingdom. </p>

<p id='58.6'> This is self-evident that the letter is an organic member of the world. This membership denotes subordination; that is, the letter draws its life from the word and hath spiritual relationship with it and is accounted a part of it. The apostles were the Letters and His Highness Christ the Essence of the Word; and the significance of the Word, which is the Everlasting Outpouring, cast a splendor upon those Letters. Since a Letter is a part of the Word itself, it is intrinsically identical with the Word. </p>

<p id='58.7'> I hope that thou shalt arise to perform all that which His highness Emmanuel hath predicted. Know thou this of a certainty that thou shalt become assisted. The confirmations of the Holy Spirit are descending uninterruptedly. The power of the Word shall penetrate in such wise that the Letter will become the reflective mirror of the Sun of the Word, and the radiation of the lights of the Word shall illumine the whole earth. But the heavenly Jerusalem, which is established upon the Apex of the world and the Holy of Holies of the Almighty, which hath hoisted its banner, comprehendeth and includeth in it all the perfections and teachings of <span data-pg='540'></span> the former dispensations. Likewise, it is the herald of the oneness of the world of humanity, the ensign of universal peace, the spirit of eternal life, the lights of divine perfections, the surrounding bestowal of the realm of existence, the adornment and grandeur of the world of creation and the cause of the tranquility of human-kind. </p>

<p id='58.8'> Turn thy attention toward the holy Tablets. Read and reflect upon the Tablets of I<u>sh</u>ráqát, Tajallíyát, the Words of Paradise, the Glad-tidings, Ṭarázát and the Book of Aqdas.<a data-fnid='21'></a> These divine teachings in this day are the remedy of the ailments of the world of man and the dressing for the wounded body of existence; they are the Spirit of Life, the Ark of Salvation, the Magnet of the Everlasting glory and the penetrative power in the reality of man! </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn21'> All revealed by Bahá’u’lláh. </aside>

  <div class='section_header toc2' id='tab3-59_'>
    <h3 class='sectionnum'> — 59 — </h3>
  </div>

<p id='59' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou dear wise man! </p>

<p id='59.2'> Thy letter *** was considered. Its contents were in the utmost of beauty and great joy was realized therefrom. </p>

<p id='59.3' class='dropcap'> Thou hast asked “Is it possible that this new and living Cause is to take the place of the dead religion of England when there hath been organized certain sects who have arrived at high stations of spiritual knowledge and to exalted degrees of merciful powers, and have become distinguished in virtue from all predecessors; notwithstanding this, it is possible that this new Cause will attract the attention of such people to such a degree as to unite their hearts, and gather them under its over-shadowing <span data-pg='541'></span> protection?” </p>

<p id='59.4'> O thou dear friend! Know thou that the Distinguished Individual of every age is according to the virtues of that age. The distinguished Personage who was in the former cycle, His power and virtues were according to the former age, but in this brilliant age and divine cycle, the Noble Personage, the Radiant Star, the Distinguished One, will manifest with virtues which will eventually amaze the peoples, for He is in spiritual virtues and divine perfections loftier than all the Individuals; nay, rather He is the Source of Divine Benediction and the Center of the Radiant Circle. He is certainly comprehensive. There is no doubt that He will reveal Himself to such a degree as to bring all under His over-shadowing shelter. </p>

<p id='59.5'> When thou considereth carefully thou wilt find this order and system to be established in all things. The whole attracteth the part, and the center of the circle is the axis of the compass. Consider His Holiness the Spirit (Christ): Since He was the Center of spiritual power and the Origin of divine benediction, although in the beginning He gathered but a few under His power, yet later through that conquering power, He ushered all sects under the shadow of the Christian tabernacle. Compare the present with the past, see the great difference. By this thou canst measure and reach the reality and know for a certainty that the difference among the sects of the world is due to the difference of comprehensions. As long as the perceptive powers differ, surely the opinions and thoughts also differ. But if One Great Perceptive Power which comprehendeth all, cometh to the Center, the differing opinions become united, and ideal unity and oneness are revealed. <span data-pg='542'></span> For example: when His Holiness, the Spirit (Jesus Christ) appeared, the comprehensions of the creatures, the susceptibilities and minds of the sects then present, such as the Romans, the Greeks, Assyrians and Israelites were different. When the universal power of the Spirit of God appeared in the Center, eventually after three-hundred years, all the differing minds gathered under the protection of the One Center. The same spiritual susceptibilities were attained. </p>

<p id='59.6'> For the sake of illustration (literally, <i>likeness</i>), I will say: When an army is under the command of generals who have differing opinions, certainly it will disagree in regard to maneuvers and in the order of marching to the battlefields. But when the great commander-in-chief who is expert in the arts of warfare cometh to the front, all the differing opinions will be erased and one opinion will prevail; the commander-in-chief will bring all under his own direction. This is an instance and not a likeness. </p>

<p id='59.7'> Now if thou shouldest say, the generals of this army are every one artists in the art of warfare, expert and experienced, why should they obey one person, even though he may have accomplished a great feat — this saying does not deserve attention, for this matter is certain and there is no doubt therein. </p>

<p id='59.8'> Likewise the Holy Manifestations, especially the reality of the Greatest Name, the Beauty of Abhá, when unveiled amid the assemblage of the world, like unto Joseph of Canaan, in the divine Egypt, will appear with such Beauty and Sweetness as to make the lovers of the world His captives. <span data-pg='543'></span> As to the souls who are born into this world radiant entities and who through excessive difficulty are deprived of great benefits and thus leave the world — they are worthy of all sympathy, for in reality this is worthy of regret. It is for this purpose (that is, it is with regard to this wisdom) that the great Manifestations (of God) unveil themselves in this world, bear every difficulty and ordeal — to make these ready souls dawnings of light and confer upon them eternal life. This is the real atonement that His holiness Christ made-He sacrificed Himself for the life of the world. </p>

<p id='59.9'> As to the question that the holy and spiritual souls influence, help and guide the creatures after they have cast off this elemental mould — this is an established truth of the Bahá’ís. Nay even the Holy Manifestations of God extend a great Bounty and an evident Light after their ascent from this world. For His Holiness Christ there was more and greater promotion of the Word, manifestation of divine power, conversion of holy souls, and the giving of eternal life, after [His] martyrdom. Likewise for the Blessed Beauty (Bahá’u’lláh) there was greater bounty and dawning of light, manifestation of divine power, and effectiveness of the Word after His Ascent; and ere long the Sun of His Reality will encircle the world with its motion, heat, radiation and bounty. </p>

<p id='59.10'> Be not sorry on account of the limited extent of the progress of the Bahá’í Cause in that country.<a data-fnid='22'></a>  This is the beginning of the dawn. Consider the Cause of His Holiness Christ, which took three-hundred years to produce great effect. Now sixty years have not passed <span data-pg='544'></span> since the beginning of this Cause, and Its Lights are shed upon all horizons. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn22'> England. </aside>

<p id='59.11'> Regarding the Society for healing of which thou art of a member; when it comes under the protection of the Cause, its power will be a hundred fold. </p>

<p id='59.12'> Thou hast observed how extensive is the love of the Bahá’ís and that the foundation is love. As the power of love among the Bahá’ís is in the utmost degree and superior to that in other religions, it is even the same on other relations, for the cause of all is Love. </p>

<p id='59.13'> As to the question of translating the Books and Tablets of the Blessed Beauty; it will soon be done in all languages with the utmost eloquence and excellence. When the Tablets of His Holiness (Bahá’u’lláh) are translated in accordance with the original, with excellence and eloquence, then the Lights of Significances will dawn and brighten all the eyes. Endeavor thou with all thy power to make the translation as the original. </p>

<p id='59.14'> The Blessed Beauty went to Haifa many times, and thou hast seen Him.<a data-fnid='23'></a>  I hope thou mayest attain the real meeting and that is the witnessing with the eye of insight and not of sight. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn23'> While in Haifa, some years ago, before he became a believer, the recipient of this Tablet saw Bahá’u’lláh and some of the followers and was attracted to Him, but owing to circumstances had no means of communicating with Him at that time. </aside>

<p id='59.15'> The essence of the teachings of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh is Universal Love, which comprehendeth all the virtues of the world of humanity, is the cause of eternal life and of the progress of all the individuals of the human race. Soon thou wilt see that these <span data-pg='545'></span> heavenly teachings, like unto the light of reality, will envelope and enlighten the world. </p>

<p id='59.16'> The short prayer which thou hast written at the end of thy letter is in reality original, beautiful, sweet and effective. Chant it always. </p>

<p id='63' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou servant of God! </p>

<p id='63.2' class='dropcap'> What thou hast written was perused. Be thou rejoiced on account of hearing the glad-tidings of the Kingdom. To render thanks for such a bounty is to show forth praiseworthy deeds. </p>

<p id='63.3'> Sacrifice thyself for the well-being of the people and be thou a kind comforter to all the inhabitants of the world. Ask and pray to God that thou mayest become an enkindled lamp, to shed light upon the assembly, to become a lover of men and a well-wisher of human kind; nay, rather, thou mayest become the manifestation of the divine providence, finding out the heavenly gifts, enlisting thyself among the soldiers of the kingdom of peace and reconciliation, delivering the people as far as possible from war and carnage, spreading righteousness and friendship and becoming the cause of tranquillity and composure to the world of humanity. </p>

<p id='64' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou seeker of Truth! </p>

<p id='64.2' class='dropcap'> The letter which thou hast written to ______ was received and its contents became known. If thou <span data-pg='547'></span> ask my name and title, it is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and any name beside this is unknown here. Whosoever calleth me by this name, accept from him — otherwise reject. </p>

<p id='64.3'> But about the three questions which thou hast asked for thyself: The first is true. Undoubtedly, when a soul engages in commemoration of the True One, he will naturally feel the rest of soul and tranquility of heart. </p>

<p id='64.4'> The second question about the supernatural power: Without advancing toward the Kingdom of Abhá, it is impossible and inaccessible. But should a soul enter under the shadow of the Blessed Perfection, step into the divine Kingdom, act according to the councils and exhortations of God and practice the New Teachings, unquestionably he will become endowed with a supernatural power. </p>

<p id='64.5'> But about thy third question: “Have I been subjected to such troubles and vicissitudes before?” and the indisputable answer, “No!” — this is also true. </p>

<p id='64.6'> For any soul who walketh in the path of guidance, there is no doubt he shall endure hardships. Consider thou their Highness the Apostles; likewise the Assembly of Christians, who were sanctified souls; what calamities and persecutions hailed them in the Cause during the first and second century and even up to the third century! </p>

<p id='64.7'> Look thou around the world of existence: A little worldly transaction cannot be brought about except through surmounting many an obstacle. How much more important are the objects of the Supreme World! Certainly there existeth troubles, trials, afflictions, persecution, censure and contempt. When thou didst occupy <span data-pg='548'></span> thy time in the past to give out religious exhortations and advices, thou experienced some persecutions and trouble. But thou canst not realize in this present moment what great ordeals are in store and what unbearable calamities, affliction and adversity exist, and that to give up life is the easiest of all those calamities. But the end of all these is bliss, overflowing joy, everlasting exultation, happiness and supreme contentment. It is eternal life, never ending glory, a lordly gift and divine sovereignty! </p>

<p id='64.8'> In brief, thou hast asked concerning my desire for thee: I wish, if thou art worldly, to become heavenly; if thou art of the world of possession, become thou celestial; if thou art of the material sphere, become an inhabitant of the realm of Light; hasten from the world of darkness to the world of illumination and become the manifestor of the exhortations, advices and instructions of the Blessed Perfection. This is my greatest desire for thee. </p>

  </div>

<p id='66' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou dear friend! </p>

<p id='66.2' class='dropcap'> Although a person of good deeds is acceptable at the Threshold of the Almighty, yet it is first “to know,” and then “to do.” Although a blind man produceth a most wonderful and exquisite art, yet he is deprived of seeing it. Consider how most animals labor for man, draw loads and facilities travel; yet, as they are ignorant, they receive no reward for this toil and labor. The cloud raineth, roses and hyacinths grow; the plain and meadow, the garden and trees become green and blossom; yet they do not realize the results and outcome of all these. The lamp is lighted, but as it hath not a conscious knowledge of itself, no one hath become glad because of it. Moreover, a soul of excellent deeds and good manners will undoubtedly advance from whatever horizon he beholdeth the lights radiating. Herein lies the difference: By the faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds. </p>

<p id='66.3'> Thou hast asked concerning reincarnation: Reincarnation as understood by the people, is untrue; but in the Gospel, “return” is referred to, and that is the return of qualities <a data-fnid='25'></a> and not the return of entities. This <span data-pg='550'></span> matter is explained in detail in the Book of Íqán, which is translated and published. Study that Book. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn25'> i.e., the return of the qualities, powers, and attributes in another human being. </aside>

<p id='66.4'> But the difference between Christ and others is this: Christ was the Spirit, others were bodies; Christ was the Sun, others were mirrors; Christ was the Truth and was bestowing eternal life, others were dead and imparting deadness and negligence. </p>

<p id='66.5'> Thou hast asked concerning the spirits of men: They are not at all annihilated — they are immortal.<a data-fnid='26'></a> The spirits of heavenly souls will find eternal life, that is, they will attain the highest and most great stations of perfection; but the spirits of the heedless souls, although they are eternal, yet they are in a world of imperfection, concealment and ignorance. This is a concise answer. Contemplate and meditate upon it, in order that thou mayest comprehend the reality of the mysteries in detail. For instance: No matter how much the mineral has an existence and life, yet in comparison to man, it is entirely non-existent and deprived of life. For where man is translated from life to death, his comparative station will be that of a mineral existence. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn26'> i.e., in the sense of continued existence after the death of the body. </aside>

<p id='83' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art the single one of Japan and the unique one of that extreme Orient! </p>

<p id='83.2' class='dropcap'> That country hath been deprived of the divine breath until this time; now, God be praised! thou art initiated <span data-pg='561'></span> in the mysteries and conscious of the secrets of the lights. </p>

<p id='83.3'> Thou hast been earthly, I hope that thou wilt become heavenly; thou hast been gloomy, I desire that thou wilt become luminous. Thou wert wandering in the wilderness, thou hast found a way to the abode of the Beloved One; thou wert a thirsty fish, thou hast attained to the endless Ocean; thou wert a roving bird, thou hast reached the divine Rose-garden; thou wert spiritually sick and thou hast found real health! </p>

<p id='83.4'> Now is the time that thou shouldest entirely abandon the comfort, ease, enjoyment and life of this transient world, and wholly arise to guide the people of Japan, illuminating faces, perfuming nostrils and conquering, through the heavenly hosts and divine reinforcements, the hearts of the people of that region. </p>

<p id='83.5'> Do not wonder at the favor and bounty of the Lord. By the favor of God, how often a drop hath become undulating like a sea, and an atom hath become shining like the sun! </p>

<p id='83.6'> The Sun of Truth hath enlightened the divine world and illumined the universe. The rays of His grace have shone upon the East and West, and His heat hath caused vegetation in all countries. So the lights and the heat of the Sun of Truth being help and assistance, what more dost thou need? </p>

<p id='83.7'> Thou must warble, like the nightingale of significances, in the rose-garden, so that thou mayest inspire all the birds of the meadow to chant and to sing. </p>

  </div>

<p id='84' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou youth of God! </p>

<p id='84.2' class='dropcap'> Thank God that thou hast found thy way to the <span data-pg='562'></span> Radiant Kingdom, torn asunder the veil of superstition and learned the reality of the mysteries. </p>

<p id='84.3'> All the people have formed a god in the world of thought, and that form of their own imagination they worship; when the fact is that the imagined form is finite and the human mind is infinite.<a data-fnid='36'></a> Surely the infinite is greater than the finite, for imagination is accidental (or non-essential) while the mind is essential; surely the essential is greater than the accidental. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn36'> Infinite in regard to imagination, for without the mind there would be no imagination. Another translation of this paragraph is as follows: “All the people have formed a god in the world of thought and they worship that form of their own imagination, while the fact is that the imagined concept is comprehended by the mind which is comprehensive. Surely that which comprehends is greater than the comprehended for imagination is accidental (non-essential), while the mind is essential. Surely the essential is greater than the accidental.” </aside>

<p id='84.4'> Therefore consider: All the sects and peoples worship their own thought; they create a god in their own minds and acknowledge him to be the creator of all things, when that form is a superstition — thus people adore and worship imagination (or illusion). </p>

<p id='84.5'> That Essence of the Divine Entity and the Unseen of the unseen is holy above imagination and is beyond thought. Consciousness doth not reach It. Within the capacity of comprehension of a produced (or created) reality that Ancient Reality cannot be contained. It is a different world; from it there is no information; arrival thereat is impossible; attainment thereto is prohibited and inaccessible. This much is known: It exists and Its existence is certain and proven — but the condition is unknown. </p>

<p id='84.6'> All the philosophers and the doctors knew that It is, but they were perplexed in the comprehension of Its existence and were at last discouraged, and in great <span data-pg='563'></span> despair they left this world. For the comprehension of the condition and mysteries of that Reality of realities and Mystery of mysteries there is need for another power and another sense. That power and sense is not possessed by mankind, therefore they have not found any information. For example: If a man possess the power of hearing, the power of tasting, the power of smelling and the power of feeling, but no power of seeing, he cannot see. Hence, through the powers and senses present in man the realization of the Unseen Reality, which is pure and holy above the reach of doubts, is impossible. Other powers are needed and other senses required. If those powers and senses are obtained, then information can be had; otherwise, not. </p>

<p id='84.7'> As to the question of marriage, according to the law of God: First you must select one, and them it depends upon the consent of the father and mother. Before your selection they have no right of interference. </p>

<p id='84.8'> Endeavor as much as thou canst to acquire the English language with the utmost of eloquence and excellence, so that thou mayest be enabled to translate the Tablets into the Japanese tongue. This is my advice. Certainly exert thy utmost endeavor to attain this bounty. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn37'> Addressed to a Japanese residing in the United States — a friend of the recipient of the four preceding Tablets. </aside>

<p id='86.2' class='dropcap'> Japan hath made wonderful progress in material civilization, but she will become perfect when she also becometh spiritually developed and the power of the Kingdom becometh manifest in her. </p>

<p id='86.3'> One will encounter a little difficulty in the beginning of the establishment of the Cause of God in that country, but later it will become very easy, for the inhabitants of Japan are intelligent, sagacious and have the power of rapid assimilation. </p>

<p id='86.4'> For the present, a perfect youth like thee is favored by the bounty of the Kingdom and hath attained to the knowledge of the Lord of the Kingdom. Show thou forth an effort that thou mayest finish that which is necessary in the acquisition and study of science and art; then travel thou toward countries of Japan, so that thou mayest hoist the Ensign of Truth waving from the apex of the Supreme Concourse. Look thou not upon thine own capability; the invisible divine confirmations <span data-pg='565'></span> are great and the protection and providence of the Beauty of Abhá is the helper and the assistant. When a drop draws help from the ocean, it is an ocean in itself, and a little seed, through the outpouring of rain, the favor of the sun and the soul-refreshing breeze, will become a tree with the utmost freshness, full of leaves, blossoms and fruits. Therefore, do not consider thy capacity and merit, but rely upon the infinite bounty and trust to His Highness the Almighty. Do not delay. Undertake soon that which thou art intending. </p>

<p id='86.5'> There are prophecies concerning this Manifestation in the Buddhistic books, but they are in symbols and metaphors, and some spiritual conditions are mentioned therein, but the leaders of religion do not understand. They think these prophecies are material things; yet those signs are foreshadowing spiritual occurrences. </p>

<p id='86.8'> “Unless man maketh spiritual progress in the world of spirit, intellect and heart, he cannot gather universal results from material advancements. Now you must gird up the loins of endeavor and reflect duly, so that you may quicken the people of Japan through the Spirit of <span data-pg='566'></span> God.” </p>

<p id='87' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O ye spiritual friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! <a data-fnid='40'></a> </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn40'> The following Tablets up to and including page 585, are “General Tablets” revealed for all the friends throughout the world. </aside>

<p id='87.2'> “Perfume Thou the East! Illumine Thou the West! Bestow Thou light to the North! Grant Thou life to the South! </p>

<p id='87.3' class='dropcap'> This verse hath been revealed from the lips of the Center of the Covenant one year after the departure <a data-fnid='41'></a> of Bahá’u’lláh. But the náqiḍín (not understanding its spiritual purport) wondered and derided. Praise be to God! that now its signs have become manifest, its power evident, and its proof plain. Thanks be unto Him! that the East and the West are stirred into cheerfulness, and through the Holy Fragrances all directions are perfumed. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn41'> Departure, i.e., death — which occurred May 29, 1892. </aside>

<p id='87.4'> The Blessed Perfection, in a clear text, hath promised us in the Book: “Verily I behold you from the Horizon of Abhá and will make victorious whomsoever will arise in the service of my cause with the hosts of the Supreme Concourse and the cohorts of the favored angels!” Praise be to God! that this victory and confirmation became visible and manifest and hath shone forth from the horizon of the world like unto the sun. </p>

<p id='87.5'> Therefore, O ye friends of God! Show ye forth an earnest endeavor and display ye a resolute effort, so that ye may become assisted in the adoration of the Ancient Beauty and the Manifest Light; to be the cause of spreading the light of the Sun of Truth; to infuse into the dead, antiquated body of the world a new spirit; to cast in the fields of the hearts pure seeds; to arise in the service of the Cause; to speak with eloquent <span data-pg='567'></span> tongues; to become candles of guidance in the assemblage of the world; to become shining stars in the horizon of existent being; to become merciful birds in the rose-garden of oneness; to sing the melodies of realities and significances; to spend every breath of your lives in the most great Cause; and to devote the period of your existence to the service of this conspicuous Light; so that in the end ye may be freed from loss and failure and attain to the inexhaustible treasury of the Kingdom. For the life of man is wholly subject to danger and impermanency. A person cannot put his assurance even in one moment’s continuity. Notwithstanding this, the nations of the world, deceived by the mirage of superstition, imagine themselves secure in the heavenly way. Alas! Alas! Former communities in bygone ages entertained the same perishing thoughts; but by one of those periodical fluctuations they were all hidden under ground and afflicted with deprivation and loss, except those souls who had become pure evanescence and had arisen with great self-abnegation in the path of God. Such souls shine forth as brilliant stars from the Horizon of the Ancient Glory, and the results which emanated from their lives in succeeding ages and cycles are the proofs of this statement. Therefore, do ye not rest, neither day nor night; seek ye not for composure; talk ye not of the mystery of servitude, and seek ye the path of thralldom; so that through the promised confirmations ye may become assisted from the Kingdom of Oneness. </p>

<p id='87.6'> O ye friends! Dense and gloomy clouds have covered the horizon of the world, and the darkness of hatred, malignity, persecution, tyranny, and the greatest <span data-pg='568'></span> cruelty is spreading. All the people are drunk with the wine of heedlessness; and blood-thirstiness and rapaciousness are considered the noblest excellencies of the world of men. </p>

<p id='87.7'> His Highness the Almighty hath chosen the friends from among the concourse of men and hath especialized them with the most eminent guidance and the highest gift; so that we may with our souls and hearts exert ourselves, sacrifice our lives, be engaged in the guidance of the people and the training of souls; so that the wild beasts may become the gazelles of the meadows on unity; the wolves the sheep of God; the blood-thirsty ones the heavenly angels; the fire of malice be extinguished and the flame of safety in the blessed tabernacle bestow illumination; the odor of the nether realm of infidelity be dispelled and the fragrances of the rose-garden of faithfulness be diffused in all parts; the weak draw light from the Universal Reason and evil souls seek to be purified with the holy and divine Breath. There are needed manifestors for this gift; farmers for this field; gardeners for this rose-garden; fishers for this sea; luminous stars for this heaven; spiritual physicians for these ill ones, and loving guides for these wanderers; so that they may bestow a share to those who are deprived, grant a portion to those who are shareless, give unmeasured treasure to the indigent ones, and show forth the power of proof to the seekers. </p>

<p id='87.8'> Glory be unto Thee, O my God! I supplicate unto Thee, O Thou my Helper! I invoke Thee, O Thou my Refuge! I utter to Thee my agonies, O Thou my Physician, entreat Thee with all my heart, my soul and my spirit, <span data-pg='569'></span> saying: </p>

<p id='87.9'> O my God! O my God! Verily, the gloomy night hath fallen upon all regions and the clouds of ignorance have extended in all directions; the people are immersed in the darkness of surmise and the tyrants are sunk in the depths of brutality and lawlessness; the red glare of the burning fire is flashing forth from the neither world; roaring, ominous voices are rising from the cruel, destructive and terrible armaments; every region is crying out with its dumb secret tongue: “Nothing that I possess hath benefitted me and power and strength are taken away from me!” Verily, O my God, the lamps of guidance are extinguished; the fire of animosity is enkindled; wrath and antipathy are spread abroad and provocation and maliciousness are disseminated upon the face of the earth. Yet I see only Thy wronged followers who are crying at the tops of their voices and summoning the people: </p>

<p id='87.10' class='blockquote verse italic'> “Hasten ye toward affinity!
	Hasten ye toward faithfulness!
	Hasten ye toward generosity!
	Hasten ye toward guidance!
	Hasten ye toward union!
	Hasten ye to behold the Light of the World!
	Hasten ye toward love and prosperity!
	Hasten ye toward peace and reconciliation!
	Hasten ye toward the law of disarmament!
	Hasten ye toward harmony and success!
	Hasten ye toward co-operation and mutual help in the path of guidance!” </p>

<p id='87.21'> Verily, these wronged ones do sacrifice themselves with infinite joy and happiness for the sake of the people, with all their souls and spirits throughout all regions. <span data-pg='570'></span> Verily, thou beholdest them weeping at the misfortunes of every one of Thy creatures and becoming grieved at the distress of Thy children; they are kind to all the people and pained at the sight of the calamities of the inhabitants of the world. O my Lord! make the wings prosperity to grow upon their shoulders, so that they may ever soar toward the apex of their aspirations; strengthen their loins in the service of Thy people, and confirm them in the thralldom and adoration of the threshold of Thy Holiness. </p>

<p id='87.22'> Verily, Thou art the Merciful! Thou art the Clement, and there is no God but Thee, the Powerful, the Compassionate, and the Ancient! </p>

<p id='88' class='nodropcap italic larger'> Glory be unto Thee, O my God! </p>

<p id='88.2' class='dropcap'> Thou seest me rolling my face in the dust of humility and contrition, supplicating toward the Kingdom of Thy Might, yearning for the contemplation of Thy Greatness, entreating Thy Grandeur, invoking at the Threshold of Thy Mercifulness, beseeching the realm of Thy Singleness, acknowledging my shortcomings, longing for Thy bounty, desiring Thy concealing veil and expecting the outpouring of the rain of Thy favor upon all the meadows and mountains! </p>

<p id='88.3'> O my Lord! Verily, Thy power hath enveloped all things, Thy dominion, Thy glory and Thy sovereignty have become manifest as the manifestation of the sun in mid-day; Thy Word hath penetrated the reality of the contingent beings; Thy voice hath been raised on the apex of the world; Thy beaming lights have radiated from the dawning-places of all the horizons and Thy wonderful refulgent signs have become known in <span data-pg='571'></span> all directions; consequently the sights and insights have become dazzled by beholding these manifestations of truth! There is no land in which the fame of Thy Merciful Cause hath not been spread, and there is no region in which Thy manifest ensign hath not been hoisted! Verily, Thy voice hath reached the ears of all inhabitants of the globe, and the attracted ones have become exhilarated by its holy and divine fragrances! </p>

<p id='88.4'> Praise be to Thee, O my God! for the bestowal of this most great bounty upon Thy chosen ones; and thanks be to Thee, O my Lord! for this most eminent favor upon Thy righteous servants in suffering them to become the signs of Thy Oneness in this glorious age and the standards of Thy sanctity in this new cycle! </p>

<p id='88.5'> O my Lord! O my Lord! Assist the weak ones with the Supreme Energy; shelter the indigent ones near the asylum of Thy Greatest Majesty; strengthen the loins of those souls whose faces radiate with Thy lights and whose tongues become eloquent in the glorification and commemoration of Thy Name; make them the plants of Thy luminous orchard, the blossoms of Thy blessed tree, the leaves of Thy Sadratu’l-Muntahá <a data-fnid='42'></a> and the flowers of Thy exalted rose-garden! Verily, Thou art the Clement, the Lofty, the Magnificent, the Omnipresent and the Omniscient and Thou art the Protector, the Guardian, the Helper, the Powerful, the Merciful and the Generous! </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn42'> Sadratu’l-Muntahá — The name of a tree planted by the Arabs in ancient times at the end of a road, to serve as a guide. As a symbol it denotes a Manifestation in His day. </aside>

<p id='88.6'> O ye beloved ones of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! This servant longeth to write a special Tablet to each one of the <span data-pg='572'></span> friends of God — but what can be done! For there is neither opportunity nor time. The affairs are like unto the waves, and the requirements are like unto the vernal showers. I do not rest a moment, neither do I have leisure for an instant. Letters are received every day from all the regions and it is impossible and impracticable to answer one among ten; yet there is no other mode than to answer the letters which are the most important, for the urgent affairs must be attended to. Therefore, I request the pardon and ask the forgiveness of the friends, that they may overlook these shortcomings and be content and happy with that which is possible. </p>

<p id='88.7'> O ye friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! The East is illumined, the West is perfumed and the world is in motion and acceleration. Such a tumult is visible in the regions; and such a spiritual commotion is perceived in the pillars of the earth! The fame of the grandeur of the Word of God hath reached the ears of the inhabitants of the world, and the voice of the Cause of God holdeth universal sway! It is the time for joy and happiness and the moment of exhilaration and ecstasy. One must live in accord with the exhortations and advices of the Blessed Perfection and behave with such deeds and actions as to become conducive to the illumination of the world and the manifestation of mercifulness among the nations. </p>

<p id='88.8'> All the denizens of the earth, the communities and the people have taken an axe in their hands to uproot the life-tree of each other; they are blood-thirsty and the instigators of corruption; they are armed to the teeth with destructive implements; each seeketh the <span data-pg='573'></span> death and annihilation of the other. But the heavenly power, the divine energy and the celestial hand of strength, hath raised the canopy of the oneness of the realm of humanity on the pinnacle of the contingent being and hoisted the standard of the most great peace, friendship, love, uprightness and the adoration of truth. The friends are the servants of this canopy and the beloved are the hosts of this standard. Therefore they must with one accord arise to that which is the requirement and the merit of this day, become overflowing with joy and beatitude, perfume the nostrils with fragrances, sweeten the tastes with the honey and delicacy of love, become the signs of guidance, be the glad-tidings of the Supreme Concourse and the army of the Kingdom of Abhá; so that they may destroy the edifice of war and bloodshed, efface the traces of battle and strife from the face of the earth, uproot the tree of foreignness and plant the tree of unity in the rose-garden of the regions, extinguish the fire of hatred and animosity and set in motion the sea of love and affinity, erase the traces of discord from the Tablet of the earth and register thereon the verses of concord, clear the field of existence from the thorns and brambles of hostilities and ill-feeling and adorn it with the hyacinths and anemones of harmony, train and educate the souls and loosen the tongue in the delivery of the instructions and teachings of the Blessed Perfection! </p>

<p id='88.9'> O ye beloved ones! It is the moment of the ecstasy of the soul and consciousness and the season of running in the arena of sacrifice! Show ye kindness to all; be ye engaged in the refinement of the souls. Become ye as ignited lamps and adorn ye the orchard of <span data-pg='574'></span> being! These days are swiftly passing and this mortal life will remain fruitless and without result. Therefore, while there is yet time and the arrow is in the bow, enter ye the chase and strike ye the game. This game is the good-pleasure of God, and this chase is the merciful Providence; that is, living accord with the divine instructions. </p>

<p id='89' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O Thou Pure God! </p>

<p id='89.2' class='dropcap'> Thou art the Seer and the Hearer! Thou art the Powerful and the Mighty! The fame of Thy Most Great Cause hath traveled forth and radiated from all the horizons! The believers have the utmost joy and fragrance, and the friends are attracted to the Face of that Brilliant Orb. The tongues are engaged in Thy Commemoration and the hearts are at all times dilated with the Fragrances of Thy Holiness. The faces are all turned toward Thee; the hearts are captive of Thy Abode, and the souls are athirst for the Salubrious Water of Thy River. The call of Thy Greatest Name hath caused a mighty reverberation throughout all the kingdoms, and the Power of Thy Consummate Word hath unfurled Thy Ensign to the East and to the West! The favored ones supplicate with the utmost humility, and the righteous ones are in an attitude of soulful invocation to the Kingdom of Beauty. </p>

<p id='89.3'> O my God! Assist Thou all of them and pour upon them the showers of Thy Supreme Confirmations; so that they may become the cause of the tranquility of the world of creation; to be the servants of the human race; to become, with all their hearts and souls, the real friends of all nations; to become with the utmost joy <span data-pg='575'></span> and fragrance, the spiritual companions of the adherents of all religions; to dispel the darkness of strangeness and to spread the lights of friendship in this transitory world! </p>

<p id='89.4'> O God! Grant Thou to all them an Asylum in Thy Neighborhood and gladden their hearts and impart to them rejoicing through Thine Incomparable Bounties! Thou are the Omnipotent and the Mighty! Thou art the Seer and the Hearer! </p>

<p id='89.5'> O ye real companions! Day and night ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is engaged in the remembrances of the friends, and time after time doth he associate with them and behold their blessed faces. I entreat in the Threshold of the Lord of Existence to confirm them in a befitting manner and assist them to follow wholly the Commands of God! </p>

<p id='89.6'> O ye friends of God! According to what is heard, some of the friends have celebrated my birthday in some countries on the fifth of Zamádí-Avval (23rd day of May). Although their intention is no other than good, their aim be to promote the Word of God and to commemorate the True One among the people in this manner, yet, according to the text of the Religion of God and the irrefutable command, the fifth of Zamádí-Avval (May 23rd) is the day of the Declaration of His Highness the Supreme (the Báb) — may my life be a sacrifice to Him! Consequently, they must celebrate and adorn that Blessed Day in the name of the Declaration of that Orb of regions; make rejoicing and happiness, and impart the glad-tidings of heavenly beatitude to each other. For that holy essence was the Herald <span data-pg='576'></span> of the Most great Name. Therefore, no one must mention that day of the fifth of Zamádí-Avval (May 23rd) except as the Day of the Declaration of His Highness the Báb. This is the unquestionable text of the Religion of God. </p>

<p id='89.7'> Regarding the birth of this servant, which also happened on that day, this a proof of the favors and bounties of God toward this servant. However, this Blessed Day must be known as the Day of the Declaration of His Highness the Supreme (Báb) and the beginning of the effulgence of the Sun of Reality. You must on this account be engaged in rejoicing, happiness and gladness. This is the truth! Beware! Beware! that you avoid that which is mentioned; otherwise, it will cause the utmost grief to the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>

<p id='89.8'> I ask from the inexhaustible bounties of His Highness the Almighty, that the righteous ones become assisted to live in accord with the Religion of God; neither do they deviate a hair’s breadth therefrom; and spread this Tablet throughout all regions, so that all the friends may comprehend the truth and act accordingly. </p>

  </div>

<p id='90' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye beloved of God and maid-servants of the Merciful! </p>

<p id='90.2' class='dropcap'> The republic of wise men believes that the difference in minds and opinions is due to the difference of education and the acquisition of ethics. That is, that minds are equal in origin, but education and the acquisition of ethics cause minds to differ and comprehensions to be at variance; that this difference is not in entity but in education and teaching; that there is no individual distinction <span data-pg='577'></span> for any soul. Hence, the members of the human race all possess the capacity of attaining to the highest station, and the proof they adduce therefor is this: “The inhabitants of a country like Africa are all as wandering savages and wild animals; they lack intelligence and knowledge; all are uncivilized; not one civilized and wise man is to be found among them. On the contrary, consider the civilized countries, the inhabitants of which are living in the highest state of culture and ethics, solidarity and inter-dependence; possessing, with few exceptions, acute power of comprehensions and sound mind. Therefore, it is made clear and evident that the superiority and inferiority of minds and comprehensions arises from education and cultivation, or from their lack and absence. A bent branch is straightened by training the wild fruit of the jungle is made the product of the orchard. An ignorant man by learning becomes knowing, and the world of savagery, through the bounty of a wise educator, is changed into a civilized kingdom. The sick is healed by medication, and the poor man, by learning the arts of commerce, is made rich. The follower, by attaining the virtues of the leader, becomes great, and the lowly man, by the education of the teacher, rises from the nadir of oblivion to the zenith of celebrity.” These are the proofs of the wise men. </p>

<p id='90.3'> The prophets also acknowledge this opinion, to wit: That education hath a great effect upon the human race, but they declare that minds and comprehensions are originally different. And this matter is self-evident; it cannot be refuted. We see that certain children of the same age, nativity and race, nay, from the same <span data-pg='578'></span> household, under the tutorship of one teacher, differ in their minds and comprehensions. One advanceth rapidly, another is slow in catching the rays of culture, still another remaineth in the lowest degree of stupidity. </p>

<p id='90.4'> No matter how much the shell is educated (or polished), it can never become the radiant pearl. The black stone will not become the world illuming gem. The calocynth <a data-fnid='43'></a> and the thorny cactus can never by training and development become the blessed tree. That is to say, training doth not change the human gem (i.e., human nature or entity), but it produceth a marvelous effect. By this effective power all that is registered latent of virtues and capacities in the human reality will be revealed. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn43'> Cucumis calocynthis. </aside>

<p id='90.5'> Cultivation by the farmer maketh of the grain the harvest, and the effort of the gardener maketh of the seed a noble tree. The gentle teacher promoteth the children of the school to the lofty altitude and the bestowal of the trainer placeth the little child upon the throne of ether. Therefore, it is demonstrated and proven that minds are different in the original entity or nature, and that education commandeth a decided and great influence. Were there no educator, all souls would remain savage, and were it not for the teacher, the children would be ignorant creatures. </p>

<p id='90.6'> It is for this reason that, in this New Cycle, education and training are recorded in the Book of God as obligatory and not voluntary. That is, it is enjoined upon the father and mother, as a duty, to strive with all effort to train the daughter and the son, to nurse them from the breast of knowledge and to rear them in <span data-pg='579'></span> the bosom of sciences and arts. Should they neglect this matter, they shall, be held responsible and worthy of reproach in the presence of the stern Lord. </p>

<p id='90.7'> This is a sin unpardonable, for they have made that poor babe a wanderer in the Sahara of ignorance, unfortunate and tormented; to remain during a lifetime a captive of ignorance and pride, negligent and without discernment. Verily, if that babe depart from this world at the age of infancy, it is sweeter and better. In this sense, death is better than life; deprivation than salvation; non-existence lovelier than existence; the grave better than the palace; and the narrow, dingy tomb better than the spacious, regal home; for in the sight of mankind that child is abased and degraded and in the sight of God weak and defective. In gatherings it is ashamed and humiliated and in the arena of examination subdued and defeated by young and old. What a mistake is this! What an everlasting humiliation! </p>

<p id='90.8'> Therefore, the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful must train their children with life and heart and teach them in the school of virtue and perfection. They must not be lax in this matter; they must not be inefficient. Truly, if a babe did not live at all it were better than to let it grow ignorant, for that innocent babe, in later life, would become afflicted with innumerable defects, responsible to and questioned by God, reproached and rejected by the people. What a sin this would be and what an omission! </p>

<p id='90.9'> The first duty of the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful is this: They must strive by all possible means to educate both sexes, male and female; <span data-pg='580'></span> girls like boys; there is no difference whatsoever between them. The ignorance of both is blameworthy, and negligence in both cases is reprovable. “Are they who know and they who do not know equal?” (Qur’án) </p>

<p id='90.10'> The command is decisive concerning both. If it be considered through the eye of reality, the training and culture of daughters is more necessary than that of sons, for these girls will come to the station of motherhood and will mould the lives of the children. The first trainer of the child is the mother. The babe, like unto a green and tender branch, will grow according to the way it is trained. If the training be right, it will grow right, and if crooked, the growth likewise, and unto the end of life it will conduct itself accordingly. </p>

<p id='90.11'> Hence, it is firmly established that an untrained and uneducated daughter, on becoming a mother, will be the prime factor in the deprivation, ignorance, negligence and the lack of training of many children. </p>

<p id='90.12'> O ye beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful! Teaching and learning, according to the decisive texts of the Blessed Beauty (Bahá’u’lláh), is a duty. Whosoever is indifferent therein depriveth himself of the great bounty. </p>

<p id='90.13'> Beware! Beware! that ye fail not in this matter. Endeavor with heart, with life, to train your children, especially the daughters. No excuse is acceptable in this matter. </p>

<p id='90.14'> Thus may eternal glory and everlasting supremacy, like unto the mid-day sun, shine forth in the assemblage of the people of Bahá, and the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá become happy and <span data-pg='581'></span> thankful. </p>

<section class='content tablet' id='tab3-91' data-sectionnum='91' data-author='abd'>
  <div class='section_header toc2' id='tab3-91_'>
    <h3 class='sectionnum'> — 91 — </h3>
  </div>

<p id='91' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O pure friends of God! </p>

<p id='91.2' class='dropcap'> Cleanliness and sanctity in all conditions are characteristics of pure beings and necessities of free souls. The first perfection consists in cleanliness and sanctity and in purity from every defect. When man in all conditions is pure and immaculate, he will become the center of the reflection of the manifest Light. In all his actions and conduct there must first be purity, then beauty and independence. The channel must be cleansed before it is filled with sweet water. The pure eye comprehendeth the sight and the meeting of God; the pure nostril inhaleth the perfumes of the rose-garden of bounty; the pure heart becometh the mirror of the beauty of truth. this is why, in the heavenly Books, the divine counsels and commands have been compared to water. So, in the Qur’án it is said, “and we have caused a pure water to descend from heaven;” and in the Gospel, “Except a man hath received the baptism of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.” Then it is evident that the divine teachings are the heavenly grace and the showers of the mercy of God, which purify the hearts of men. </p>

<p id='91.3'> The meaning is, in all conditions, cleanliness and sanctity, purity, and delicacy exalt humanity and make the contingent beings progress. Even when applied to physical things, delicacy causeth the attainment of spirituality, as it is established in the Holy Scriptures. </p>

<p id='91.4'> External cleanliness, although it is but a physical thing, hath a great influence upon spirituality. For example, although sound is but the vibrations of the air which affect the tympanum of the ear, and vibrations <span data-pg='582'></span> of the air are but an accident among the accidents which depend upon the air, consider how much marvelous notes or a charming song influence the spirits! A wonderful song giveth wings to the spirit and filleth the heart with exaltation. To return to the subject, the fact of having a pure and spotless body likewise exerciseth an influence upon the spirit of man. </p>

<p id='91.5'> Now, see how much purity is approved in the Court of God, that it should be especially mentioned in the Holy Books of the Prophets. So the Holy Books forbid the eating of any unclean thing, or the use of anything which is not pure. Certain prohibitions are absolute and imperative for all: he who commits that which is forbidden is detested by God and excluded from the number of the elect. This applieth to the things forbidden by an absolute prohibition and of which the perpetration is a grave sin; they are so vile that even to mention them is shameful. There are other forbidden things which do not cause an immediate evil and of which the pernicious effect is only gradually produced. They are also abhorred, blamed and rejected by God, but their prohibition is not recorded in an absolute way, although cleanliness and sanctity, spotlessness and purity, the preservation of health and independence are required by these interdictions. </p>

<p id='91.6'> One of these last prohibitions is the smoking of tobacco, which is unclean, malodorous, disagreeable and vulgar and of which the gradual harmfulness is universally recognized. All clever physicians have judged, and have also shown by experiment, that one of the constituents of tobacco is a mortal poison and that smokers are exposed to different indispositions and <span data-pg='583'></span> maladies. That is why cleanly people have a marked aversion for its use. </p>

<p id='91.7'> His supreme Highness (the Báb) — may my soul be His sacrifice! — in the beginning of His Cause, openly forbade it and all the friends abandoned its use. But, as it was a time for caution and he who abstained from smoking was ill treated, persecuted and even killed, therefore the friends were obliged, as a matter of prudence, to smoke. Later, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas was revealed and as the prohibition of tobacco was not clearly stated in it, the friends did not renounce it. But the Blessed Perfection had always a marked aversion for its use. At the beginning of the Cause, for certain reasons, he smoked a little, but later he abandoned it completely, and the holy souls who obeyed him is all circumstances, also entirely gave up smoking. I wish to say that, in the sight of God, the smoking of tobacco is a thing which is blamed and condemned, very unclean, and of which is the result is by degrees injurious. Besides it is a cause of expense and of loss of time and it is a harmful habit. So, for those who are firm in the Covenant, it is a thing reprobated by the reason and by tradition, the renouncement of which giveth gradual repose and tranquility, permitteth one to have stainless hands and a clean mouth, and hair which is not pervaded by a bad odor. </p>

<p id='91.8'> Without any doubt, the friends of God on receiving this epistle will renounce this injurious habit by all means, even if it be necessary to do so by degrees. This is my hope. </p>

<p id='91.9'> As to the question of opium, disgusting and execrated, I resign myself to God for its punishment. The formal <span data-pg='584'></span> text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas forbids and reproves it and, according to reason, its use leads to madness. Experience hath shown that he who giveth himself up to it is completely excluded from the world of humanity. Let us take refuge in God against the perpetration of so shameful a thing, which is the destruction of the foundations of humanity and which causeth a perpetual unhappiness. It taketh possession of the soul of man, killeth the reason, weakeneth the intelligence, maketh a living man dead and extinguisheth the natural heat. It is impossible to imagine anything more pernicious. Happy is he who never mentioneth the word opium! But what is the fate of those who make use of it! </p>

<p id='91.10'> O friends of God! Force and violence, constraint and oppression are condemned in this divine cycle, but to prevent the use of opium, all means must be employed, so that the human species may be delivered and freed from this great calamity. Otherwise, alas! for all the negligent before God. </p>

<p id='91.11'> O Lord! Give to the people of Bahá cleanliness and holiness in all conditions, purify and free them from all defilement, deliver them from the use of all that is execrated, liberate them from the chains of habits, so that they may be pure and free, clean and spotless, that they may be worthy servants of the Sacred Threshold and may deserve to enter into relation with God. Deliver them from alcohol and tobacco, and save them from opium, the purveyor of madness! Make them companions of the holy breezes, in order that they may know the pleasures of the wine of the love of God, and that they may attain to the joy and the happiness of attraction to the Kingdom of <span data-pg='585'></span> Abhá! </p>

<p id='91.12'> Hast Thou not said, “All that thou hast in thy cellar will not appease the thirst of my love — bring me, O cup-bearer, of the wine of the spirit, a cup full as the sea!” </p>

<p id='91.13'> O friends of God! Experience hath shown how much the renouncing of tobacco, wine and opium, giveth health, strength and intellectual enjoyments, penetration of judgement and physical vigor. There exists today a tribe <a data-fnid='44'></a> which refrains and abstains from tobacco, alcohol and opium and it completely excels all others in power, in bravery, in health, beauty and grace. A single one of these men can withstand ten men of other tribes, and this hath been universally proved; that is to say, generally, the individuals of this tribe are superior to the individuals of the other tribes. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn44'> The Druse’. </aside>

<p id='91.14'> Therefore strive that the greatest cleanliness and sanctity, which is the great desire of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, should be resplendent among the Bahá’ís, and that the companions of God should surpass the rest of mankind in all conditions and perfections; that they may be physically and morally superior to others; that through cleanliness and purity, refinement and health, they may be the chief of wise men, and that by their affranchisement, their prudence, and the control of their desires, they may be the princes of the pure, the free and the wise. </p>

<p id='91.15'> Upon you be the glory of Abhá! </p>

<p id='94' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O seeker for the Truth! </p>

<p id='94.2' class='dropcap'> There are two ways of healing sickness, material means and spiritual means. The first is by the use of remedies, of medicines; the second consists in praying to God and in turning to Him. Both means should be used and practiced. </p>

<p id='94.3'> Illness caused by physical accident should be treated with medical remedies; those which are due to spiritual causes disappear through spiritual means. Thus an illness caused by affliction, fear, nervous impressions, will be healed by spiritual rather than by physical treatment. Hence, both kinds of remedies should be considered. Moreover, they are not contradictory, and thou shouldst accept the physical remedies as coming from the mercy and favor of God, who hath revealed and made manifest medical science so that His servants may profit from this kind of treatment also. Thou shouldst give equal attention to spiritual treatments, for they produce marvellous effects. </p>

<p id='94.4'> Now, if thou wishest to know the divine remedy which will heal man from all sickness and will give him the health of the divine kingdom, know that it is the precepts and teachings of God. Guard them <span data-pg='588'></span> sacredly. </p>

In this solar system the source of light is the sun and every light is acquired from it; even the lamps of the night are ignited through the sun, for if there were no sun the trees would not grow nor the mines develop, so that the oil be extracted from those trees and mines, and the lamps of the night be lit by it. Is it possible that one attain to the light in this globular sphere without <span data-pg='593'></span> the mediation of the sun? No, by the life of God! To suppose it, is pure imagination.

  </div>

<p id='108' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou who art attracted by the brilliant lights of the Merciful One, shining from the Supreme Kingdom! </p>

<p id='108.2' class='dropcap'> I opened thy letter with the greatest happiness and considered the meaning of thine address; but sadness became most intense within me when I learned about the dissensions among the brethren <a data-fnid='53'></a> in those countries. By the life of God! “This is a wonderful thing!” </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn53'> During the year 1899. </aside>

<p id='108.3'> Verily, the mission of all the prophets, the relation of all the scriptures, the diffusion of the instructions of God and the descent of His law, were all in order to establish agreement and union and to strengthen love and harmony among nations of different customs and thoughts, of diverse beliefs, doctrines, rites and habits; of various classes, tribes and races. So likewise, as thou seest in this beautiful religion, verily, men of different beliefs, creeds and religions, of contrary ideas and thoughts, of various races, languages and natal <span data-pg='597'></span> land — whether from East, West, North or South-all have entered under the shade of this Blessed Tree, planted, grown and reared in the midst of Paradise, and are formed into a single nation and religion in mutual union and agreement, ready to sacrifice their souls and bodies, each to the other. This harmony is not effected but through the influence of the Word of God and is circulated and spread in all directions among the believers of God, who are firm in the Covenant. </p>

<p id='108.4'> The dissensions prevailing in those parts (America) is altogether to surprising and strange; and I entreat God to purge it out through the power of unity and oneness and unite the congregations and gather together the dispersed multitude. Verily, He is powerful in all things! </p>

<p id='108.5'> But for thee, leave such matters and disturbances and withdraw from those districts and places and turn thy face sincerely to God; take His instructions and be expanded through the breaths of God. The Spirit of God shall assist thee and His angels will confirm thee; the life of holiness of God will be breathed into thy mouth and thou wilt find thyself in a position free from these ideas and thoughts resulting from worldly grades. (Verily, these are disgraces to all who are in the habit of reading the verses of unity in the assemblies of existence!) Seize the opportunity, use every effort and depend not upon circumstances which produce no fruits. Spend thy days, with all joy and fragrance, in speaking to the praise of God, being gladdened through His good tidings, in rejoicing through His graces and in spreading His breaths. Then thou shalt, with the eye of joy, see the banners of the Covenant fluttering above <span data-pg='598'></span> all stately mansions. Verily, God effecteth that which He pleaseth; naught can annul His Covenant; naught can obstruct His favor nor oppose His Cause! He doeth with His will that which pleaseth Him and He is powerful over all things! At that time thou wilt find the waverers in manifest loss. </p>

<p id='108.6'> As for the instructions: They will be revealed to thee and spread all through those regions by the translation of the divine verses. </p>

<p id='108.7'> As for the symbol of the cross, appointed in former times: Know verily, that the cross form is a wonderful figure and consists of two right lines placed crosswise-one perpendicular to the other — and this figure exists in all things. </p>

<p id='108.8'> Meditate upon these words and pay attention to the tissue in all existing substances, either plant, animal or man, and thou wilt see that they all are formed of the cross figure or two crosswise lines. Consider this intently with true meditation. Then thou wilt be taught by the Holy Ghost that it is for this reason that God hath chosen this symbol to be displayed as the token of sacrifice in all periods of ages. </p>

<p id='108.9'> I will explain to thee, in future time, the mystery of sacrifice. There is nothing more beautiful than this tree united with the cross. Verily, this tree is a type of the Tree of Life in conjunction with the cross; in this, the mystery of sacrifice. </p>

<p id='108.10'> As for the crescent: It hath reference to the beginning of the religion of God which shall grow to be a full moon. </p>

<p id='108.11'> As for the stars: They are types of the guides; for, verily, the star is a guide to people, even in the <span data-pg='599'></span> most gloomy darkness, on both land and sea. In former centuries, people were guided by the pole-star in whatever direction they went. </p>

<p id='108.12'> Verily, I supplicate God to raise the instrument of sacrifice in those regions and to reveal there the mystery of sacrifice; to cause the crescent of the religion of God to rise until it groweth into a shining full moon; it brighten the stars of guidance and guide all through it; and I beseech Him to assist those brethren to promote His Word in those most distant places, cause them to be servants to His precious olive-garden, keepers of His inaccessible fortress and guides to His straight path! </p>

<p id='108.13'> May glory be unto thee and unto them! </p>

<p id='110.5'> Address thou the maid-servants of the Merciful One, and say: “Verily, Mary Magdalene was a villager, but

Verily, my Merciful Lord is gracious under all aspects! </p>

<p id='112.4'> As to thy question concerning Christ: Know thou, He was perfect in respect to spirit as well as body. His material (body) was a perfect body in every respect; none of His material conditions were imperfect at all, inasmuch as imperfection is contrary to perfection. His heavenly condition was also a perfect one, comprising all the divine perfections. Reflect thou upon these words, so that the door of knowledge may be opened before thy face. </p>

<p id='116' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art speaking the praise of God in that vast and extensive region! </p>

<p id='116.2' class='dropcap'> Thank God, who hath raised such women from the essences of the love of God in that distant place and hath made them as fountains of knowledge, sources of assurance and dawning-places of the commemoration of thy Lord, the Merciful! I beg of God to strengthen them through the most strong power, by the hosts rushing forth from the Kingdom of Abhá and by the angels successively coming from heaven. Verily, He is the Assister, the Beneficent! </p>

<p id='116.3'> As to thy question concerning the husband and wife, the tie between them and the children given to them by God: Know thou, verily, the husband is one who hath sincerely turned unto God, is awakened by the call of the Beauty of Bahá and chanteth the verses of Oneness in the great assemblies; the wife is a being who wisheth to be overflowing with and seeketh after the attributes of God and His names; and the tie between them is none other than the Word of God. Verily, it [the Word of God] causeth the multitudes to assemble together and the remote ones to be united. Thus the husband and wife are brought into affinity, are united and harmonized, even as though they were <span data-pg='606'></span> one person. Through their mutual union, companionship and love great results are produced in the world, both material and spiritual. The spiritual result is the appearance of divine bounties. The material result is the children who are born in the cradle of love of God, who are nurtured by the breast of the knowledge of God, and who are brought up in the bosom of the gift of God, and who are fostered in the lap of the training of God. Such children are those of whom it was said by Christ, “Verily, they are the children of the Kingdom!” </p>

<p id='116.4'> Consequently, O thou maid-servant of God, go unto the maid-servant of the Merciful One and tell them from the tongue of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “O maid-servants of the Merciful! It is incumbent upon you to train the children from their earliest babyhood! It is incumbent upon you to beautify their morals! It is incumbent upon you to attend to them under all aspects and circumstances, inasmuch as God — glorified and exalted is He! — hath ordained mothers to be the primary trainers of children and infants. This is a great and important affair and a high and exalted position, and it is not allowable to slacken therein at all!” </p>

<p id='116.5'> If thou walkest in this right path, thou wouldst become a real mother to the children, both spiritually and materially. I beg God to make thee severed from this world, attracted to the fragrances of sanctity which are being diffused from the garden of the Kingdom of Abhá, and a servant of the Cause of God in the vineyard of God. </p>

<p id='116.6'> Greeting and high respects to the maid-servant of God Miss. ______, who is attracted, enkindled, hath <span data-pg='607'></span> spoken and called out, and hath stripped herself from the garment of dependence of this mortal world and its concerns and is clothed with the embroidered garments of separation (from the world) in this great Paradise. </p>

<p id='117.4'> As to thee and thy daughter who is devoted to God, who presented herself, saw and heard: Know ye, verily, (one possessing) a pure insight is a servant to the people of Bahá, but only the prudent can understand this. </p>

<p id='117.5'> Know thou, verily, insight (or mental perception) seeth that which sight (or physical perception) seeth not and apprehendeth that which the body perceiveth not, inasmuch as the sight seeth the mirage as water, the images pictured in the mirror as a reality and genuine, and it seeth the earth as stationary, the great stars as small. But the insight correcteth the mistake of the sight and apprehendeth the reality and seeth that the mirage is not water, that the images pictured in mirrors are naught else save mere reflections, that the earth is moving and the distant stars are great. Consequently, <span data-pg='608'></span> the truth of insight, its effectiveness and power is proven, as well as the weakness of sight, its inefficiency and defects. </p>

<p id='117.6'> Then, know thou that the power of the Word of God is effective, both in the spirit and the body, and the influence of the Spirit of God is predominant over the material as well as the essential and spiritual. And that, verily, God is powerful in all things, and that the signs (or verses) have exoteric and esoteric meaning, and neither their outward preventeth their inward, nor doth their inward prevent their outward meaning. </p>

<p id='117.7'> Greeting and praise to the maid-servant of God, thy revered daughter, and to all who commemorate the praise of God, long for the Kingdom of God and are cheerfully moved by the fragrances of God! </p>

This is the day of Life, the day of Salvation and the day of the Bestowal; it is not the day of death, unless it be martyrdom in the path of God, or embracing the cross in the love of God. </p>

<p id='119' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God! </p>

<p id='119.2' class='dropcap'> As to thy question, “If the husband preventeth his wife from entering into the Light, or the wife preventeth the husband from entering into the Kingdom of God.” In reality neither one of them preventeth the other from entering into the Kingdom of God, except when the husband hath a great attachment to the wife, or the wife to the husband. When either one of the two adoreth the other to the exclusion of God, then each will prevent the other from entering into the Kingdom of God. </p>

<p id='119.3'> As to thy question concerning the additions to the Old and New Testament: Know thou, verily, as people could not understand the words, nor could they apprehend the realities therein, therefore they have translated them according to their own understanding and interpreted the verses after their own ideas and thus the text fell into confusion. This is undoubtedly true. As to an intentional addition: This is something uncertain. But they have made great mistakes as to the understanding of the texts and the comprehending of the references and have therefore fallen into doubts, especially in regard to the symbolical verses. </p>

<p id='119.4'> As to thy question, “That ‘Abdu’l-Bahá hath said to some of the believers that evil never exists, nay rather, it is a non-existent thing:” This is but truth, inasmuch as the greatest evil is (man’s) going astray and being <span data-pg='610'></span> veiled from Truth. Error is lack of guidance; darkness is absence of light; ignorance is lack of knowledge; falsehood is lack of truthfulness; blindness is lack of sight; and deafness is lack of hearing. Therefore, error, blindness, deafness and ignorance are non-existent things. If we say that according to the text of the Bible, “God hardened Pharaoh’s heart” that he might not believe in Moses, this signifies that, verily, He did not soften his heart. And when we wish to say that God hath not guided a certain one of His servants, this would be interpreted (by people) that God led him astray. The darkness spoken of in the Bible as being created by God, signifieth that, verily, God hath not caused light to shine; inasmuch as where there is no light, there will be darkness; when there is no sight, there will be blindness; when there is no life, there will be death; when there is no riches, there will be poverty; and when there is no knowledge, there will be ignorance. </p>

<p id='119.5'> Consequently, it is proven by indisputable argument and clear explanation that, verily, evils are non-existent, but people have not understood the meaning of the verses of the Bible. </p>

<p id='119.6'> I beg of God to make thee a faithful servant in His great vineyard, enable thee to speak His praise, to diffuse His fragrances, to chant His verses and to herald His name at every moment. </p>

  </div>

<p id='120' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art rejoiced at the explanation of the maid-servant of God ______! </p>

<p id='120.2' class='dropcap'> Thank thou God that He hath sent forth unto thee such a spiritual and loving sister, who is preserved from egotism an desires and is rejoiced at the glad-tidings <span data-pg='611'></span> of God. Can there be imagined any greater mercy than this? No! by the One who hath created the heaven and earth! Blessed thou art, for thou hast inhaled the fragrances of life from the garden of the Kingdom of Bahá before thine ears had heard the call! </p>

<p id='120.3'> As to ______ whom thou hast mentioned, it behooveth him to seek only the divine bounties and subjects which lead to the real knowledge of the invisible (world of God), through the mediation of the Holy Spirit. Then he will perceive the reality of the triune powers in man, through his innate perception. For, verily, the sign of these triune powers which exist in mankind are spirit, mind, and soul. The spirit is the power of life, the mind is the power which apprehendeth the reality of things, and the soul is an intermediary between the Supreme Concourse (or Spiritual World) and the lower concourse (or material world). It, i.e., the soul, hath two phases: The higher aspireth to the Kingdom of Bahá, and the light of the mind shine forth from the horizon (or kingdom) unto its higher sphere; the other phase inclineth to the lower concourse of the material world and its lowest sphere is enveloped in the darkness of ignorance. But when light is poured upon this phase, and if this phase of the soul is capable of receiving it, then “truth hath come and falsehood vanisheth, for falsehood is of short duration” — otherwise, darkness will surround it from all directions and it will be deprived of association with the Supreme Concourse and will remain in the lowest depths. </p>

<p id='120.4'> As to the ‘voice:” There are two kinds of voices. One is the physical voice and it is expressed by atmospheric <span data-pg='612'></span> vibrations which affect the nerves of the ear; the other is the breath of the Merciful and this is a call which is continually heard from the Supreme Concourse and cheereth the pure and holy souls. May it be beneficial to those who have heard the Call! </p>

<p id='120.5'> Know thou that the Ancient Light and the Manifest Beauty (God) hath sown seeds in the soil of existence and hath irrigated it through His spiritual bounties. This soil will surely bring forth good plants of divine gifts; the leaves of this growth are love and union, its stem is the teachings of the True One and His supreme laws, and the grain pods are the heavenly blessings which giveth life to the souls. Depend thou on these! Depend thou on these! Depend thou on this, and abandon every imagination and be attracted to the light of reality and discover both the divine truths and physical truths! </p>

<p id='120.6'> Also, know thou that the greatest spiritual divine “chaplet” is the Word of God and the Sun of Truth which penetrateth the reality of the created things and attracteth the entire soul of man in the world of existence and shineth forth unto all horizons (or regions). Hast thou ever perceived a greater “chaplet” than this? No! by the Splendor of Bahá! </p>

<p id='120.7'> Verily, I yearn for the visit of those souls who are cheered, dilated and moved by and attracted to the Holy Spirit and the Word of God. </p>

<p id='121' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art awakened to the Cause of God! </p>

<p id='121.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, I read thy letter and my heart was rejoiced at thine interesting words; and I thanked God for He hath favored those souls who earnestly desire to <span data-pg='613'></span> guard His strongly fortified fortress and His inaccessible cave and who love unity, affinity, harmony and accord and who agree on one opinion, one idea and one word. This behooveth the sincere souls! This behooveth such as believe in the divine unity! This behooveth such as are firm and steadfast in the Covenant, which is throbbing within the heart of the whole creation! </p>

<p id='121.3'> Be ye guardians of the throne of the Kingdom of God and armies of defense for the Religion of God. Whenever ye find someone desiring to separate himself from the flock, it is incumbent upon you to treat him with fragrance and kindness and persuade and encourage him, so that this secluded sheep may return to the flock. </p>

<p id='121.4'> Verily, thy Lord loveth union and hateth discord; for the appearance of the Holy Manifestations and divine laws is only for the sake of affinity, union and concord, so that the remote, contradictory and different nations and creeds may enter under the shadow of the Blessed Tree in unanimous love and agreement. </p>

<p id='121.5'> I beg of God to confirm all of His dearly beloved ones in one opinion, one belief, one movement, one path and one manner. This is that by which the station of the beloved ones will be elevated, the Word of God will be promoted, the fragrances of God will be diffused and the faces of the sincere ones will be illumined in the path of God. It is incumbent upon you to practice these [instructions] under all aspects and circumstances. </p>

<p id='121.6'> As to the manifestation of the Greatest Name (Bahá’u’lláh): This was the Divine Manifestation <span data-pg='614'></span> which appeared upon the earthly world. This is He whom God promised in all His Books and Scriptures, such as the Bible, the Gospels and the Qur’án. All of these Books indicate this fact, and the least doubt cannot possibly occur to the minds concerning this clear fact, as is recorded in detail in the heavenly Books, especially in the brilliant and holy Tablets. But notwithstanding this fact, if there is anyone who hesitates therein, do not dispute with him, nay rather prove this to him with all joy and fragrance, lest he may be obstinately compelled to rebellion. </p>

<p id='137' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou seeker of Truth! </p>

<p id='137.2' class='dropcap'> Praise be to God! the essence of severance is manifest from this world and the star of love of God is shining, and kindness towards mankind is clear and evident. These divine gifts became manifest, spread and known in the world through the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. I hope thou mayest abundantly partake of all these three benefits, so that thou mayest appear among people in the utmost spirituality and illumination. </p>

<p id='139' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou daughter of the Kingdom! </p>

<p id='139.2' class='dropcap'> Thy excellent letter was full of spiritual significance. It was an indication of the loftiness of thy nature, the grandeur of thy aspiration, the sincerity of thy aim and the confirmation of the bounty of His Highness the Single One. Moreover, it proved that thou shalt be purified and sanctified from attachment to material conditions, be freed from every restriction and thou shalt dedicate thy life to the spreading of the glad-tidings of the Kingdom. </p>

<p id='139.3'> Whenever this longing and desire is attained, that maid-servant of God [i.e., thyself] will become a lighted candle in the assemblage of the world, receiving the lights of the Kingdom and reflecting them in turn upon the souls. </p>

<p id='139.4'> This trip thou hast in mind is blessed and acceptable and the cause of the attainment of everlasting glory in the world of existence, but thou shouldest have a companion to go with thee. Therefore, start thou with a firm resolution, pure intention, heavenly glad-tidings, divine gift and supreme confirmation toward the East, i.e., Japan, China, India, Russia, Greece, Bulgaria, Roumania, Austria, Germany, France and the English empires, perchance thou mayest spread the fragrances of God in those parts and receive the lights of confirmation from the Kingdom of Holiness. But it is not necessary, for the present, to travel in the Turkish, Egyptian and Persian territories, for internal troubles <span data-pg='625'></span> make the traveling of women very difficult. It is hoped, from the eminent bounty and favor of God, that thou mayest be quickened in such wise, from the fragrances of the Kingdom of Abhá, that thou mayest bestow upon dead souls eternal life. </p>

<p id='139.5'> Convey, on my behalf, respectful greetings to the attracted Miss. ______, who is favored and enkindled with the fire of the love of her Lord. That blessed leaf is mentioned and known in the Kingdom of God. *** </p>

<p id='139.6'> As Persia hath many nomadic tribes and they are now <a data-fnid='56'></a> rebellious and insurgent and infesting the highways, the maid-servants of the Merciful cannot travel there, but the men can. However, after that maid-servant hath traveled in Japan, China, Russia, Germany, France, England, Austria, Greece, Roumania, Bulgaria and India, perhaps peace and security will be established in Persia and then thou canst also travel there. </p>

  </div>

<p id='141' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou favored maid-servant of the Kingdom of God! </p>

<p id='141.2' class='dropcap'> The letter, which thou hast written, was received. Its contents evinced high aspiration and rare magnanimity; and that thou hast the intention to travel to the far-eastern countries and bear great trouble, so that thou mayest become the cause of the guidance of the souls and spread the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of God. This desire indicateth that that beloved maid-servant of God hath a very high aim. However, thou mayest deliver the glad-tidings in the following manner: </p>

<p id='141.3'> “The Promised One of all the nations of the world hath become apparent and manifest! Each community and religion expecteth the coming of their Promised One, and His Highness Bahá’u’lláh is the Promised One of all! Therefore, the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh is conductive to harmony, raiseth the canopy of the oneness of the kingdom of humanity upon the apex of the contingent beings and unfurleth the ensign of universal brotherhood and ideal commonwealth upon the summit of the hills and mountains!” </p>

<p id='141.4'> When thou openest thy tongue with such glad-tidings, it will become conductive to the teachings of others. But this trip is indeed very remote and unless there are several [teachers], the delivery of the glad-tidings will not produce the desired results in those parts. Shouldst thou deem it advisable, thou mayest take a trip to Persia and on thy return pass by Japan and China. This plan seems much better and more pleasant. Otherwise, thou mayest act according to thy judgment and it will be acceptable. </p>

<p id='141.5'> The contribution that thou hast made to the Temple is beloved. The Temple is the most great foundation <span data-pg='627'></span> of the world of humanity and it hath many branches. Although the Temple is the place of worship, with it is connected a hospital, pharmacy, pilgrims’ house, school for the orphans, and a university for the study of high sciences. Every Temple is connected with these five things. I hope that now in America they will build a Temple and gradually add to it the hospital, school, university, pharmacy and pilgrims’ house with the utmost efficiency and thoroughness. Thou shouldst make known to the believers these details, so that they may realize how important the Temple is. The Temple is not only a place for worship; nay, it is perfect in every way. </p>

<p id='141.6'> O thou beloved maid-servant of God! Didst thou know what station is destined and appointed, under the protection of His Highness Bahá’u’lláh, for those souls who are severed, attracted and teachers of truth, undoubtedly thou shouldst find the utmost joy and happiness, and, by reason of exultation and rejoicing, soar toward the heaven of peace, inasmuch as thou art walking in this road and advancing toward such a Kingdom. </p>

<p id='141.7'> Regarding the statement that I have written thee, about dedicating thyself to the service of the Cause of God, it means this: Center thy thoughts in the teachings of the Cause, day and night, and act according to the teachings and behests of His Highness Bahá’u’lláh. This is not contrary to marriage. It is possible for thee to be married and be engaged in the service of the Cause of God. The first does not interfere with the latter. </p>

<p id='141.8'> Briefly, avail thyself of the opportunity and do not let it slip from the grasp; i.e., supplicate God that in this darkened world thou mayest become an ignited candle and the cause of the guidance of many <span data-pg='628'></span> souls. </p>

That holy Messenger is eternal and perennial and His messages come to the heart successively and the verses of oneness are read therein. Likewise, this imprisoned one is greatly attached with his heart and soul to the beloved ones and this very attachment is the faithful Messenger and the manifest Tablet. Therefore, my request is this: Should ye send a hundred letters and no answers be received, do ye not feel at all sad; nay, rather think of this occurrence as a glorious proof of the power of love, as it will demonstrate that there is no incumbency (or formality) between us. Were there any opportunity, undoubtedly answers would be forwarded. In brief, I beg of God that each one of you become the sign of guidance, a manifest book from the Supreme Concourse, attracted with the fragrances of God and enkindled with the fire of the love of God. </p>

It was a tent which they pitched in the desert, wherever they abode, and worshipped in it. Likewise, after His Holiness Christ — may the spirit of the world be a sacrifice to Him! — the first institute by the disciples was a Temple. They planned a church in every country. Consider the Gospel (read it) and the importance of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár will become <span data-pg='634'></span> evident. </p>

<p id='157' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O maid-servant of God! </p>

<p id='157.2' class='dropcap'> Thank thy Lord for confirming thee unto this wonderful day and new century and giving thee to drink the cup of His love with the hand of His providence. Verily, this is a great favor. </p>

<p id='157.3'> Be not sorrowful on account of the maid-servant of God, Madam ______. This is a test on the part of God and its wisdom (or reason) is concealed. We ask God to gaze on her with the eye of mercy. Verily, He is the Merciful, the Clement! </p>

<p id='158' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who hath advanced to the Kingdom of his Lord, the Glorious! </p>

<p id='158.2' class='dropcap'> Know thou that the Kingdom of God hath pitched its tents, hoisted its banner and uplifted its pavilions in this extensive space. The hosts of the angels of God have come down with standards of signs; marched off towards all horizons; opened the cities of the hearts of the servants by the power of thy Lord, the Generous; and have blown the great trumpet. The Holy spirit hath freely given eternal life to every pure heart, and the souls became attracted through the effulgence of the Beauty of the Glorious Kingdom and through the brilliancy of the Light of Truth over all regions. The clamor of the spiritual people hath risen with praise and glory to God, the All-glorious! </p>

<p id='158.3'> As to thee, thank thou thy Lord for that He hath <span data-pg='638'></span> enabled thee to see the signs of His Kingdom in this wonderful day. Arise to serve the Cause of thy Lord and devote thyself to God’s service as a penitent servant. </p>

<p id='159' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou servant of God! </p>

<p id='159.2' class='dropcap'> I was assuredly informed of thy confessing the unity of God and that thou hast drawn from the ocean of the gift of God and thine insight hath brightened by the light of guidance and by the dependence of thine heart upon the lights of the Beauty of God. Then, glad-tidings be unto thee for this bounty which God hath assigned unto every holy and spiritual being in the Kingdom of God. </p>

<p id='159.3'> By the life of God! verily, the gift of guidance, during this great century and this age of lights, is greater than reining over the earth and all that is in it; because the earthly reign is mortal, vanishing, imaginary and of no permanence, but this gift is permanent, eternal, everlasting and endless. Consequently, it is confirmed that this (gift of guidance) is greater than the sovereignty of the world. </p>

<p id='159.4'> O servant of God! Rejoice, announce glad-tidings and be filled with the Spirit and preach and call in the Name of God in that region and hear the good-tidings of God in that land! </p>

<p id='159.5'> Thou shalt hear the sound of this glorious bell in every near and distant region, and the call of the True One will be elevated in the monasteries of the world of mankind, just as it was elevated in the assemblies of the divine world, and the earthly people will be combined with the divine and heavenly <span data-pg='639'></span> concourse.</p>

<p id='159.6'> Thereupon thy heart shall rejoice, thy soul shall become pure, thine eye shall brighten and thou shalt be inwardly revived. Praise be upon thee! </p>

<p id='160.3'> Draw nigh unto God and persevere in (thy) communion with (or prayer to) thy Lord, so that the fire of God’s love may glow more luminously in the heart, its heat grow stronger and give warmth to that region and its sound reach the Supreme Concourse. </p>

<p id='161' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou maid-servant of God! </p>

<p id='161.2' class='dropcap'> Truly, I say, complete capacity and ability is the cause of the appearance of the divine gifts. Souls are many who in the years gone by have listened to the glad-tidings, but up to this time they have remained veiled, deprived and unmoved. But, through the bounty of the Beauty of Abhá, as soon as thou didst hear the call, thou didst turn thy face toward the Lord of Hosts and became a believer in God and assured of His divine verses. Immediately the Most Great Name made an impression upon thee. Therefore, I hope thy breath may become also effective and in a short time, like unto dry wood, become enkindled and ignited. </p>

<p id='161.3'> Do not wonder at the mercy and bounty of God. <span data-pg='640'></span> Consider thou how one spark sets on fire a great forest. Therefore, there is great hope, and the favor and grace of the Almighty is limitless. </p>

The love that she hath shown you, its value is not known at present, but after departing from this transient world, its value will become known and evident in the divine Kingdom, and even in this mortal world its value shall appear in future.

  <div class='section_header toc2' id='tab3-164_'>
    <h3 class='sectionnum'> — 164 — </h3>
  </div>

<p id='164' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou servant of the Threshold of God! <a data-fnid='63'></a> </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn63'> To a believer in Baku, Russia. </aside>

<p id='164.2' class='dropcap'> I read what flowed from thy pen in the love of God, and found charming meanings from the contents (of thy letter). I hope, through the gift of the glorious Lord, that thou wilt be always refreshed and revived by the fragrances of the Merciful. </p>

<p id='164.3'> As to what thou hast written concerning “Reincarnation”: Believing in reincarnation is one of the old tenets held by most nations and creeds, as well as by the Greek and Roman philosophers and wise men, the old Egyptian and the chief Assyrians. But all these sayings and superstitions are vanity in the sight of God. </p>

<p id='164.4'> The greatest [argument] produced by those who held to reincarnation has been this: “That it is necessary to the justice of God to give every one his due. Now everybody who is afflicted by any calamity is said to have sinned; but when a little child, which is still in the womb of its mother and hath just been formed, is found to be blind, deaf or imperfect, how could it have committed <span data-pg='643'></span> any sin that we might say this imperfection is given to it as a punishment therefor — so, though such a child hath no done outwardly any sin in the womb of its mother, yet [they say] it must have sinned when it was in its former body, which hath caused it to suffer this punishment.” </p>

<p id='164.5'> Indeed, these people have been negligent of the fact that had the creation been carried out in a uniform fashion, how could the statement be true, that “God doeth whatever He wisheth and God doeth whatever he desireth!” <a data-fnid='64'></a> </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn64'> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá elucidated Jesus’ teaching against the theory of “blindness from birth” and the defects being caused by the sin of the individual in a former state (see St. John 9:1-3), thus: “Jesus states that this defect exists in order to prove and show that the gift of sight is from God alone and is one of his bounties. Because were all created with sight the people would consider it a mere natural fact that they must be so made, and not give God thanks for His great gift.” — Translator. </aside>

<p id='164.6'> Though the fact of “Return” is mentioned in the Divine Books, by this is intended the return of the qualities, characters, perfections, truths and lights (of the past age), which re-appear in every age, and not (the return) of certain persons and souls. For example: If we say this lamp is the return of that of last night, or that the last year’s flower hath returned in the garden (this year), in this sense the return of the individual, or identity, or personality is not meant; nay, rather, it is intended that the same qualities and states existing in that lamp or flower, which are now seen in this lamp or flower, have returned. That is, the same perfections and virtues and properties which existed in the past springtime have returned during this present springtime. For instance: When one says, these fruits are the same as those of last year; in this sense, he hath reference to the freshness and delicacy of the fruit, which hath returned, <span data-pg='644'></span> although there is no doubt that the identical fruit of last year hath not returned. </p>

<p id='164.7'> Have the friends of God found such enjoyments and repose during their existence on this visible earth, that they might wish to have their return renewed and repeated constantly? Are all these calamities, injuries, trials and difficulties of the once coming not sufficient for them that they should wish a repeated life in this world? Hath this cup been of such sweetness that they should long for it successively and repeatedly? No! the friends of the Beauty of Bahá never seek any recompense or reward except the meeting and the visit (of God) in the Kingdom of Bahá; and they never walk but in the valley of desire to attain the Supreme Height. They only wish the immortal blessing and the eternal gift, which are sanctified above the worldly understanding. </p>

<p id='164.8'> Because, when thou lookest with the iron sight, thou wilt find that all mankind is suffering in this earthly world; there is no one in such tranquility that this (state) might have been a reward for his good deeds in a former life and there is no soul so happy that this might be the fruit of his past pain! Had the life of a man in his spiritual being been only confined to his life in this world, the creation would have proved useless; the divine qualities would have no result and effect; nay, all things, created beings and the world of creation would have proved abortive. I ask pardon of God for such false imaginations and for such errors! </p>

<p id='164.9'> As the usefulness and powers of the life (of a child) were not seen in that dark and narrow world (of the womb), but when it is brought into this vast world, all <span data-pg='645'></span> the use of its growth and development becometh manifest and obvious in it, so likewise, reward and punishment, paradise and hell, and the requital of deeds and actions done by it in the present life become manifest and evident when it is transferred to the world to come — which is far from this world! Had the life and growth of the child in the womb been confined to that condition, then the existence of the child in the womb would have proved utterly abortive and unintelligible; as would the life of this world, were its deeds, actions and their results not to appear in the world to come. </p>

<p id='164.10'> Therefore, know thou that the True One possesseth invisible worlds which human meditation is unable to comprehend and the intellect of man hath no power to imagine. When thou wilt purify and clarify thy spiritual nostrils from every worldly moisture, then thou wilt inhale the holy fragrances diffusing from the merciful gardens of these worlds. </p>

<p id='164.11'> Bahá be upon thee and upon all those who are gazing and turning unto the Kingdom of Bahá, which God hath sanctified above the understand of the heedless souls and from being perceived by the eye of those who deny! </p>

<p id='165' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O my spiritual friends! <a data-fnid='65'></a> </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn65'> To the Cincinnati (O.) assembly. </aside>

<p id='165.2' class='dropcap'> What you have written is perused, all of which was an entreaty and invocation unto God and a desire for devotion unto the Most High. I hope through the bounty of God, day by day, your assurance, belief and faith will increase; moment by moment the flame of the love of God will be intensified; louder and louder <span data-pg='646'></span> will the proclamation of the Word of God be heard in that country; the breeze of sanctity will begin to blow; the attraction of the inner consciousness will cause these districts to be animated; the mercy and aid of God will be your associates and the assistance from the Kingdom of compassion will be momentarily bestowed. Now is the time for those spiritual friends, (i.e., yourselves,) to adorn the divine meetings, endeavor to spread the Cause of God, arise to diffuse His breaths and stand for the promotion of His Word; that the breath of the Holy Spirit may bestow life to the hearts, causing the spirits to attain the Beloved. </p>

<p id='165.3'> The letter you have previously written is not yet received; if it were you may be sure it would be answered, because this servant hath great love and attachment for the believers in that city and will always communicate with them. </p>

<p id='165.4' class='blockquote italic'> O Thou pitiful God! These friends are perfectly infatuated with Thy nearness; they have given their hearts for the beauty of Thy face; are devoted to Thy Kingdom and are intoxicated by the wine of belief. In the meeting of the covenant they are bearing in their hands the cup of anxiety, needing Thy benevolence and yearning for the heavenly blessings. </p>

<p id='165.5' class='blockquote italic'> O Mighty Creator! Cause these souls to be the receptacle of Thy mercy, regarded by divine attention, and render each one as a lighted candle, that they may illuminate that region with the light of righteousness. Make them the companions of and partaker with this servant [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] in the devotion of Thy Threshold. O my God! Strengthen the weak ones and open the eyes of those who are anxious to behold the <span data-pg='647'></span> beauty of the Kingdom, that they may arise with divine strength, heavenly bounty, spiritual blessing, ethereal breaths and mighty assistance for Thy service, dispelling the superstitions of the doubters, elucidating the proofs and evidences before all seekers, healing the sick, being kind to the poor, a refuge and home for the helpless and a light for the hopeless. </p>

<p id='165.6' class='blockquote italic'> Thou art the Powerful and the Able, the Pitiful and Compassionate God! </p>

<p id='165.7'> O my friends! Endeavor to your utmost ability that, day by day, unity and harmony will increase and the love of God will so firmly capture the hearts that they will forget all save Him and be engrossed, night and day, in mentioning the Kingdom, the heavenly signs and the divine verses. If love, friendship, association and unity be established among the believers, the door of all significances will be opened and each believer of God will be able to explain and interpret all of the holy Books. </p>

<p id='165.8'> O believers! The tests of God are very severe; you should beseech and cry unto Him that you may be firm and steadfast during all temptations. </p>

<p id='166'> As to [what thou hast heard concerning] the child born from Russian parentage, this is pure imagination. Yea, certain persons shall in this divine dispensation produce heavenly children and such children shall promulgate the teachings of the Beauty of Abhá and serve His great Cause. Through a heavenly power and spiritual confirmation they shall be enabled to promote <span data-pg='648'></span> the Word of God and to diffuse the fragrances of God. These children are neither Oriental nor Occidental, neither Asiatic nor American, neither European nor African, but they are of the Kingdom; their native home is heaven and their resort is the Kingdom of Abhá. This is but truth and there is naught after truth save superstitions (or fancy). </p>

<p id='168.2' class='dropcap'> I already received thy letter which announced thy receipt of the loving letter sent to thee by the pen of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. By God the True One! Verily, those letters are as gifts of God to thee, to thy noble wife and to thine honorable daughter. I beg of God to enable thee to perfectly endeavor to practice according to their contents. </p>

<p id='168.3'> Yea, some of the intellectually cultured people in those countries exert themselves to reach the loftiest summits of prosperity in worldly affairs and most of them are desiring wealth and are making an effort to attain it somehow. But they are unmindful of the treasury of the Kingdom, the spiritual affluence and the wealth of mind; therefore, thou findest them subject to the rage of lusts and under the influence of egotistic and selfish desires, sinking into intemperance and engaged <span data-pg='649'></span> in drinking the cup of lust. Were they to become mindful of their heedlessness and awakened from the sleep of ignorance, they would become intoxicated by the cup of the love of God and exhilarated by the good cheer of the wine of the knowledge of God. </p>

<p id='168.4'> I beg of God to shine forth unto you with the lights of His sanctity and send to you divine souls, that they may fully reveal to you the divine teachings. </p>

<p id='168.5'> The letters which I sent to you are as the fragrant breezes of the garden of the knowledge of God, which can be smelled by every one whose sense of smelling is clean and purified from any rheum, because they are glad-tidings proceeding from pure lips which are fluent in explaining the mysteries of God. I beg of God to ordain for us to meet one another. </p>

<p id='176.2' class='dropcap'> What thou hast written is understood. In reply I will elucidate briefly, the purport of which you, with your intelligence, will surely comprehend: </p>

<p id='176.3'> The world of humanity is encompassed by the darkness of conventionalities, disagreements, discords, avoidance, animosity, enmity, ignorance, folly, lustful desires and animal tendencies; the gloomy night had darkened the horizon of the world in such manner that all had forgotten the light and deemed the darkness inevitable in the world of humanity, and its solution impossible; when, unexpectedly, the Light of Reality appeared and enlightened the horizon of the world, diffusing its rays throughout the East and West, the beholding of which instantly delighted the perfect and perceiving eyes; but the imperfect eyes, afflicted by the darkness, were dazzled by the radiance, while the negligent closed theirs and turned away entirely. That light is the Love of God, the Spirit of God, unity, concord, science and knowledge, bounty and perfection, redemption of life spiritual perception, universal peace, alliance of the nations, unification of all peoples and <span data-pg='654'></span> the reality of the attributes of the Merciful One, which I hope thou wilt fully attain. </p>

<p id='177' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O seeker of the truth! </p>

<p id='177.2' class='dropcap'> There are two ways of healing diseases, the material and the spiritual way. The first is the remedies of the physicians; the second prayers and turning one’s self to God. Both must be practiced and followed. The diseases that happen to be caused by physical accident are cured by medical aid; others, which are due to spiritual causes, will disappear by spiritual means. For instance: For a disease due to grieving, fear, nervous impressions, the spiritual remedies will take more effect than the physical. Therefore, these two kinds of remedies must be followed; neither is an obstacle to the other. You must take care of the physical remedies. These also came from the bounty and mercy of God who revealed and made evident the science of medicine, so that His servants may also be benefited by this mode of healing. In the same way take care of the spiritual healing, because it giveth wonderful results. </p>

<p id='177.3'> And if thou art looking for the divine remedy which will cure the spirit of man of all diseases and make him obtain the health of the divine Kingdom, know that it is the precepts and teachings of God. Take the greatest care of them. </p>

  </div>

<p id='178'> Thy letter was received and its contents noted. In truth, thou hast been thrown amid dire ordeals, enduring agonizing afflictions. These trials were according <span data-pg='655'></span> to the consummate wisdom, therefore they were for the best. It is good for man to endure (in such moments). </p>

<p id='178.2'> Reflect upon his holiness Job: What trials, calamities and perplexities did he not endure! But these tests were like unto the fire and his holiness Job was like unto pure gold. Assuredly gold is purified by being submitted to the fire and if it contain any alloy or imperfection, it will disappear. That is the reason why violent tests become the cause of the everlasting glory of the righteous and are conducive to the destruction and disappearance of the unrighteous. </p>

<p id='178.3'> The wisdom of all these tribulations that poured successively upon thee was this, that thou shouldst be prepared and made ready for this Cause, that thou mightest expect the attainment to the greatest guidance, for all these trials were but a preparation for thine entrance into the Most Exalted Paradise and the beginning of obtaining this most great benefit. </p>

<p id='178.4'> Unless the season of winter appear, thunder roll, lightning flash, snow and rain fall, hail and frost descend and the intensity of cold execute its command, the season of the soul-refreshing spring would not come, the fragrant breeze would not waft, the moderation of temperature would not be realized, the roses and hyacinths would not grow, the surface of the earth would not become a delectable paradise, the trees would not bloom, neither would they bring forth fruits and leaves. That fierce inclemency of cold, snow, frost and tempest was the beginning of the manifestation of these roses, hyacinths, buds, blossoms and fruits. </p>

<p id='178.5'> Therefore, be not distressed on account of those adversities which fell upon thee; nay, rather, arise and <span data-pg='656'></span> render thanks that the ultimate goal is the attainment to this eminent bounty and the enjoyment of this highest gift of the Almighty God. Consequently gird up the loins of thine endeavor, that thereby some results might be produced, some fruits gathered, the lamp of everlasting life ignited and the gifts of the Lord of the Kingdom be manifest, so that thou mayest accomplish again, with great yearning and exaltation, the worship of the Lord of Hosts. </p>

<p id='179' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='179.2' class='dropcap'> Thy last letter, sent by Mírzá ______, hath arrived. It is not a very long time since I wrote thee a letter in which I said how contented I was with thee and I explained to thee the importance of thy visit to India and showed thee the results and fruits of that visit. </p>

<p id='179.3'> At this moment hath arrived a letter in which thou hast praised the believers in Rangoon, especially Siyyid ______, Mírzá ______, Mírzá ______ and Kay-<u>Kh</u>usraw <a data-fnid='67'></a> who sacrificed his life for thine; yea, this is the truth! Consider what a difference exists between his country and thine and what a great effect this Bahá’í spirit hath manifested that an Oriental sacrificeth his life for an Occidental! What attraction, what love, what relationship is this! Blessed are those who are able to arrive at an understanding of the reality of the power of this love! </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn67'> Kay-<u>Kh</u>usraw was a Zoroastrian Bahá’í of Bombay, India, who left his home and went to Lahore to nurse Mr. Sydney Sprague who was sick of a fever. Mr. Sprague recovered, while the great Kay-<u>Kh</u>usraw died. He was the first Oriental friend to give his life for a Western Bahá’í brother. </aside>

<p id='179.4'> Concerning Mr. ______, one of the Hindus of <span data-pg='657'></span> whom thou hast written: Say to him, “To me thou art not a stranger, but a friend; thou art not unknown, but known.” </p>

<p id='179.5'> Thou hast spoken of a spiritual wave. This is not a wave, but a sea; nay, the very ocean! But this is not to destroy the cities, but to purify them; and soon it will submerge them all. This does not mean destruction, but salvation; it is not death, but life; it is not enmity, but love; it is not pain; it is a remedy. The world of existence is the body, and this is its spirit; this immense world is the glass [chimney], and this is the lamp [lighted wick]; humanity is the heaven, this is its sun. The signs of this bounty are clear and visible. The proof is the changing of the characters of the friends and the perfection that the believers have made in their actions and words: They were dark, they became luminous; they were terrestrial, they became celestial; they were human, they became divine; they were diabolic, they became angelic; they were a drop, they became the sea; they were an atom, they became the sun. These are the signs of those who are entirely submerged by this wave; that is to say, this ocean. </p>

<p id='179.6'> O thou ______! I hope that thou wilt progress more and more; that thou wilt increase thy knowledge and science; and that thou wilt ever strive for gentleness and love. </p>

<p id='179.7'> Perhaps it will be possible for thee, next winter, to go to Persia. </p>

<p id='181' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God! </p>

<p id='181.2' class='dropcap'> I have read thy beautiful letter containing beautiful significances and indicating that which hath occurred to thy heart of spiritual events, and that which hath encompassed thy spirit of merciful thoughts. This is from the bounty of Thy Lord upon thee and upon every maid-servant chosen by His mercy in this new age. </p>

<p class='question'>	(Question: “Master, who art thou? Art thou the Christ?”)</p>

<p id='181.3'> As to what thou asked concerning me: Verily, I say unto thee, that I am indeed an humble, submissive and <span data-pg='659'></span> imploring servant of God; a servant of His Beloved; a messenger of the exaltation of His Word; a spreader of His Fragrances; an extoller of the banner of love and harmony; a promoter of the greatest peace among all nations and tribes; a kindler of the fire of the love of God in the hearts of the people; a runner to the place of martyrdom in the Cause of God; a yearner for every calamity in the love of God; a longer for suspension upon the cross for the love of the beloved; a herald of the Kingdom of God among the sects of all horizons. This is my station and condition; this is my blazing crown; this is my glorious throne; because my servitude to the Holy Threshold is my brilliant light, my shining star and my drawn sword; and beside this I have no other name. </p>

<p id='181.4'> Then know that for the dominion of the reality of Christ there is no beginning and there is no end. Everlastingly that luminous Entity hath been sitting on the throne of might and everlastingly It will have a penetrating dominion over the worlds of existence. This dominion is eternal and everlasting and has no abrupt end. </p>

<p class='question'>	Question: “When is the time of the millenium? Will I see it? </p>

<p id='181.5'> Concerning the one thousand years as recorded in the Book: It signifieth the beginning of this Manifestation until the end of its predominance throughout the contingent world; because this Cause is great, its powers are growing and its signs are dazzling. It shall continue in elevation, exaltation, growth, promulgation and promotion until it shall reach the apex of its glory in one thousand years — as the day of this Manifestation <span data-pg='660'></span> is one thousand years. Thou shalt see its conquering power, its manifest dominion, its eternal might and its everlasting glory. </p>

<p class='question'>	Question: “At the time of thy departure will there not be some great spiritual manifestation all over the earth?” </p>

<p id='181.6'> As to the question of “after my departure” to the neighborhood of the mercy of my Lord: Know there shall appear wonderful traces; the breath of God shall pass by; the fragrance of God shall spread and the Spirit of God shall run in the body of the contingent world both before and after my departure; but I supplicate God that He may grant the greatest spirituality in these days. Endeavor, therefore, that thou mayest have a great portion in it. </p>

<p class='question'>	Question: “What did the vision of a paper signify in my dream?” </p>

<p id='181.7'> Concerning the appearance of a paper in thy dream, before thine eyes, which thou wast unable to read: Thou shalt read it through the permission of God and thou shalt comprehend its meanings. It is a diary of the Word of God and the divine mysteries. </p>

<p id='182.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, this mundane world is as the mirage of the desert, but the Kingdom is like unto a sea of great surges and rolling waves. Those who longed for the mirage have indeed become more thirsty the more they hastened toward it and perished in grief after a drop of water. </p>

 <aside class='fn' id='fn68'> To the California maid-servants. </aside>

<p id='182.3'> Ye see, as the condition really is, that the people of <span data-pg='661'></span> the world are striving day and night for the sake of attaining perfect happiness and tranquil life, but the result is none other to them than disappointment, affliction, lamentation and destruction. </p>

<p id='182.4'> But those who have advanced to the Kingdom of God have assuredly advanced to a sea of clear and limpid water and thus have attained unto the greatest bounty, the perfect rest and the eternal life to which there is no abrupt end. Their faces have shined with joy, their souls delighted with pleasure, their hearts illumined and their cups overflowed with abundance. Their edifice hath risen high, their palaces have been adorned, their suns shone, their stars gleamed and their diadems radiated with a dazzling light. Their dominions have expanded and their lights have spread to all ages and generations. These are their set-up thrones, their high palaces, their luminous lamps and their shining moons throughout all horizons. These are their traces in the world; how much more then would be their lights in the highest of the high — consider, therefore, O ye maid-servants of the Merciful! </p>

<p id='182.5'> This being the case, care no more for the world and its desires, but cling to the spiritual world and its gifts, spread the fragrances of God, be submissive to the Word of God, establish a spiritual meeting place where from the incense of sanctity and purity will rise up to God, assemble there with fragrance and spirituality and celebrate the Name of your Lord by day and by night. At that time ye would become illumined lamps, spiritual stars: rather, eternal suns. This is a favor that was longed for by the spirits of the godly people and the hearts of the queens in the former <span data-pg='662'></span> ages. </p>

<p id='212.4'> The white garments signify holy dignity and a station sanctified from color, i.e., free from the universal <span data-pg='680'></span> conditions and material qualities. That luminous countenance, manifested in beauty, signifieth that the divine lights shone forth from the human form, which were reflected and descended upon thee, dazzling the eyes of those who were perceiving it as the sun dazzles the eyes of those who try to look upon it. That divine form manifested itself in America and entered the great Temple which shall soon be constructed therein. This glorious Temple resembles the Oriental edifices and soon thou wilt see it erected there with a most solid foundation and strongest basis. That divine face will beam upon numberless souls who will enter this Temple. </p>

<p id='212.5'> Regarding the table laid in that magnificent house: This is the heavenly table of divine knowledge, love and eternal life. As to the people gathered there, they are the beloved of God and His chosen ones whose faces shine with wonderful and heavenly beauty. The woman sitting at the side of the Temple is the law of God, which will soon dispel all veils and its beauty will appear, after which it shall be established forever and ever. The stamped coins presented to the woman sitting in that honored station, are the good deeds and actions of the beloved of God and His maid-servants, submitted with praise, greetings and great thanksgiving unto that holy law. The beautiful woman is blessed by being touched by that Merciful Being the glory of whose blessing shall suffuse the universe. Then the Merciful Being returned to His station, mounting the bird and ascended to the Supreme Horizon in the infinite realm. </p>

<p id='212.6'> This vision showeth that thou, O confirmed and attracted one, by the breezes of God will soon be acquainted with the ancient mysteries, for the Manifest <span data-pg='681'></span> Light will appear to thee. The vision also signifieth that a Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár will soon be established in America. The cries of supplication and invocation will be raised to the Highest Kingdom therefrom and, verily, the people will enter into the religion of God by troops with great enthusiasm and attraction. </p>

<p id='212.7'> Concerning thy vision of the angels surrounding the great white throne: This “throne” is the body of the Greatest Name. The beautiful and glorious person riding upon the white horse is the Greatest Name and the white horse means also His glorious body. The herald who proclaimed the written names in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who announceth the names of those who deserve salvation and are firm in the Covenant of God, and thou art one of those people, the people of salvation. Be thankful for this great favor. </p>

<p id='213' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God! </p>

<p id='213.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, thy coming, at this time, unto this shining, blessed Holy Land is not consistent with wisdom, but when the (proper) time cometh, we shall give thee permission to come to this Spot of Light. Thank thou God for that the love of God hath pervaded thee and seized the reins from thy hands. This spiritual love shall surely pervade all regions. </p>

<p id='213.3'> As to human souls (or individuals): Unless they acquire the light, they are unable to shine upon other individuals. But when a man ariseth to expound the arguments of God and invite people to enter in the religion of God, and when he uttereth those arguments and advanceth consummate proofs concerning the appearance of the great Kingdom, then intense love shall <span data-pg='682'></span> become manifest in his heart. This love causeth the development of this spirit by the grace of the beneficent Lord. Consider, O maid-servant of God, the bearer who brought the garment of Joseph to Jacob. That messenger was the bearer of the garment, but he could not inhale the fragrance of Joseph. But Jacob, whose nostrils were pure, inhaled the fragrances of Joseph from a long distance. </p>

<p id='213.4'> It may be that man can guide a blessed, holy soul into the Kingdom of God while he, himself, is deprived thereof. Consider Judas Iscariot: He invited others, while he, himself, was deprived of the Kingdom of God. But in spiritual training (or development) it is impossible for an imperfect one to perfect another or train another unless he first conquers his own self and desire and becomes purified from selfish impurities in order to become capable of merciful splendors. When he acquires divine bounties, then he is able to train another. An ignorant man hath no power to teach a seeker (of knowledge) and a poor man hath no power to succor a needy one. Consequently, be thou assured that, verily, man needs to wish for eternal life and then confer the same upon another. These human perfections and merciful bounties are that peace which was promised and spoken of by Christ. </p>

<p id='213.5'> Then know thou that, verily, the people of Bahá must needs be distinguished from others in all respects, until they become the lamps of the True One among the creatures and the stars of guidance shining from the Supreme Concourse. </p>

<p id='213.6'> Then know thou, verily, that Luminous Man, the lights of whose Face dazzle the eyes and before whom <span data-pg='683'></span> thou knelt down when thou sawest His light, is the Greatest Name, the Ancient Light, the Honorable Temple! </p>

<p id='214' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou sincere servant of Bahá’u’lláh! </p>

<p id='214.2' class='dropcap'> Thy letter was received and its content was the cause of infinite happiness, for it was an indication of thy firmness in the faith and thy steadfastness in the Covenant and Testament. Today, the greatest of all titles and praises are firmness and steadfastness, for the tests and trials are of the utmost intensity. I ask God that day by day thou mayest increase in steadfastness, so like unto a solid rock thou mayest withstand the tempestuous sea of test. </p>

<p id='214.3'> The people of the world are like unto trees (i.e., trees without roots), they are torn up by the passing of a gust of wind, but trees which are deeply rooted, strong and sturdy, are not uprooted by the most violent tempest — therefore they produce leaves, blossoms and fruits. </p>

<p id='214.4'> O thou spiritual friend! Thou hast asked the wisdom of prayer. Know thou that prayer is indispensable and obligatory, and man under no pretext whatsoever is excused from performing the prayer unless he be mentally unsound, or an insurmountable obstacle prevent him. The wisdom of prayer is this: That it causeth a connection between the servant and the True One, because in that state (i.e., prayer) man with all heart and soul turneth his face towards His Highness the Almighty, seeking His association and desiring His love and compassion. The greatest happiness for a lover is to converse with his beloved, and the greatest <span data-pg='684'></span> gift for a seeker is to become familiar with the object of his longing; that is why with every soul who is attracted to the Kingdom of God, his greatest hope is to find an opportunity to entreat and supplicate before his Beloved, appeal for His mercy and grace and be immersed in the ocean of His utterance, goodness and generosity. </p>

<p id='214.5'> Beside all this, prayer and fasting is the cause of awakening and mindfulness and conducive to protection and preservation from tests. The obligatory prayer is revealed from the Supreme Pen and is translated in America. Ask for it from the believers and use it. </p>

Thank thou God that from thy <span data-pg='691'></span> early childhood thou hast been always a seeker after salvation and hast been spending thy energy and effort in charitable affairs and the excellences of the world of humanity. However, every great Cause in this world of existence findeth a visible expression through three means; first, intention; second, confirmation; third, action. Today on this earth there are many souls who are the spreaders of peace and reconciliation and are longing for the realization of the oneness and unity of the world of man; but this intention needs a dynamic power, so that it may become manifest in the world of being. Today the divine instructions and lordly exhortations of Bahá’u’lláh promulgate this most great aim and the confirmations of the Kingdom are the supports and defenders of this eminent intention. For the power of the Word of God is penetrative and the existence of the divine Kingdom is uninterrupted. Therefore, ere long it will become evident and clear that the ensign of the Most Great Peace is the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. For the intention, the power and the action, all the three essential elements are brought together and the realization of everything in the contingent world dependeth upon these three principles. </p>

<p id='224.3'> Therefore, O thou lover of the oneness of the world of humanity! spread thou as much as thou canst the instructions and teachings of His Highness Bahá’u’lláh, so that the desired Beloved become unveiled in the assembly of humankind and cast her light upon all the people. </p>

<p id='224.4'> Likewise, some of the ancient philosophers have spoken regarding the oneness of the world of humanity, <span data-pg='692'></span> but confirmation and assistance become not their supports and helpers. Consequently their endeavors ended in being without result and the tree of their hope without fruit. </p>

<p id='224.5'> Thou hast written regarding the language of Esperanto. This language will be spread and universalized to a certain degree, but later on a language more complete than this, or the same language will undergo some changes and alterations and will be adopted and become universal. I hope that Dr. Zamenhof become assisted by the invisible confirmation and do a great service to the world of humanity. </p>

<p id='224.6'> O thou maid-servant of God! Whatsoever question thou hast in thy heart, turn thou thy heart toward the Kingdom of Abhá and entreat in the Threshold of the Almighty and reflect upon that problem, then unquestionably the light of truth shall dawn and the reality of that problem will become evident and clear to thee. For the teachings of His Highness Bahá’u’lláh are the keys to all the doors. Every hidden secret will become discovered and every hidden mystery will become manifest and apparent. *** </p>

<p id='229.2' class='dropcap'> Thy letter was received and considered. Thank God that the evidence and the proof became clear and manifest to thee. He gave thee eyes to see therewith the lights of guidance; He gave thee ears to hear the divine call; He gave thee nostrils to sense the beautiful fragrance of the rose-garden of the Kingdom; He gave thee <span data-pg='696'></span> taste to find the sweetness of the love of God; He gave thee a tongue to mention Him.

<p id='229.7'> Convey reverential greeting to Miss. ______ and say: “Know thou the value of the day of the Lord and take a portion and a share of the bounty in this glorious cycle. If a tree doth not thrive and grow in this divine springtime, in what season will it bear fruit? I hope that, through the life-nurturing breeze of the rose-garden of the Kingdom, thou mayest become a tree full of blossoms and fruit.” </p>

<p id='229.8'> Convey reverential greeting to the maid-servant of God, ______ and say: “Happy is thy condition <span data-pg='697'></span> that thou art meek and humble and directed to the Kingdom of God and looking to God.

<p id='229.11'> To be far in body is of no account. To be near in spirit is essential. Seek that from God. When thou hast attained that, thou art always with me. </p>

Thank thou God that He hath provided such a means for thee that be divine aid, heavenly confirmation, merciful intention and heavenly power thou mayest arise to serve, so that thou mayest see wonderful signs and marvelous results. </p>

<p id='240.2' class='dropcap'> I have read the texts of thy praise to God on the occasion of the arrival of my letter to thee. Know thou, that letter sent to thee by me, was only because of my perfect love for thee and my pity upon thee, for I had the desire that the fragrance of the Holy Spirit, which hath perfumed all regions and imbued the entire body of the world with the Spirit of Life, should pas over thee and abide with thee. Notwithstanding the high position it occupieth, still, with an eloquent tongue, through which the Spirit moveth, hearts are attracted and bosoms burn, it speaketh to the pure hearts and to the good and righteous souls in every spot of the earth. This is the powerful Spirit, the dazzling light, the brilliant star and the overwhelming and universal abundance. And, from its traces, spread and divulged everywhere, thou wilt know and realize its influence and comprehend its radiance. I ask God to expose thee to its fragrance, move thee by its breeze, enkindle thee by its coals of fire and illuminate thee by its brightness. Turn thyself wholly to it — thus thou shalt be enabled to ascertain its influence and power, the strength of its life and the greatness of its confirmation. Verily, I say unto thee, that if for the appearance of that Divine Essence thou desirest to have a definite proof, an indisputable testimony and a strong, convincing evidence, thou must prepare thyself to make thy heart empty and thine eye ready to look only toward the Kingdom of God. Then, at that time, the radiance of that widespread effulgence will descend upon thee successively, and that motion rendered thee by the Holy Spirit will <span data-pg='706'></span> make thee dispense with any other strong evidence that leadeth to the appearance of this Light, because the greatest and strongest proof for showing the abundance of the Spirit to the bodies is the very appearance of its power and influence in those bodies. </p>

<p id='241' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou that virtuous soul and individual who art ready for the confirmation of the Holy Spirit! </p>

<p id='241.2' class='dropcap'> I, with the utmost clemency, have read thy brilliant letter which showeth thine advancement toward the Kingdom of God and the excessive preparation for the effulgence of the lights of God and the greatest tendency for the baptism of the Spirit of God and thy pleasure at the glad-tidings of God, thine attraction by the fragrance of God and thy gladness in the love of God. May God strengthen thee so thou mayest come nearer to God, to separate thyself from aught else save Him and to assist thee in spreading His lights and uttering the abundance of His mysteries, to perfume thy nostrils with the fragrance of His holiness and to prepare for thee the heavenly table, that thou mayest taste the delight of His loving-kindness. I now assure thee, O servant of God, that, if thy mind become empty and pure from every mention and thought and thy heart attracted wholly to the Kingdom of God, forget all else besides God and come in communion with the Spirit of God, then the Holy Spirit will assist thee with a power which will enable thee to penetrate all things, and a Dazzling Spark which enlightens all sides, a Brilliant Flame in the zenith of the heavens, <span data-pg='707'></span> will teach thee that which thou dost not know of the facts of the universe and of the divine doctrine. Verily, I say unto thee, every soul which ariseth today to guide others to the path of safety and infuse in them the Spirit of Life, the Holy Spirit will inspire that soul with evidences, proofs and facts and the lights will shine upon it from the Kingdom of God. Do not forget what I have conveyed unto thee from the breath of the Spirit. Verily, it is the shining morning and the rosy dawn which will impart unto thee the lights, reveal the mysteries and make thee competent in science, and through it the pictures of the Supreme World will be printed in thy heart and facts of the secrets of the Kingdom of God will shine before thee. Christ said — glory be to Him! — “Many are called but few chosen.” Thank thou thy Lord for He hath made thee of the chosen. By my life! verily, this is a station which God giveth to whomsoever He pleaseth. Know its value and appreciate it according to its desserts! Arise with all thy power to answer [i.e., to perform] all that is necessary to obtain this grace and bounty and be strengthened in all circumstances and conditions of this existence. How many noble-minded women, who were the queens of all provinces and countries, have died and passed away and thou no longer hearest any many mention of them; but every servant of the servants of the Merciful, who were in the past decades and centuries, owing to their bright faces illumined by the lights of truth and knowledge, their stars shine until today in the horizon of the highest and their rays dazzle in the mirrors of the world and their fame is divulged in the Supreme World and their sanctification spread in <span data-pg='708'></span> the Kingdom of God; and if — God forbid! — the foot of man deviate as did that of Judas, so that he became human after he was divine and sold the blood of Christ for a small and trifling sum — verily, there is in that a great lesson to the people of understanding! </p>

<p id='241.3'> Although I am far away from thee in body, still I am near unto thee in spirit. But I ask God that the body will follow the spirit and our meeting will be facilitated. The most essential thing is the spiritual relation, the hearty friendship and the heavenly attraction. Thou must accomplish this. </p>

  </div>

<p id='242' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou gem of the Kingdom and brilliant leaf! </p>

<p id='242.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, I have read thy letter which showeth how thou art turning unto God, moved by the breath of God, drawn by the Spirit of God and how the mystery of existence, the image of the Lord of Hosts, was revealed unto thee. This indicates that God shall open before thee the doors of revelation and the Spirit of Truth shall confirm thee with evident signs. </p>

<p id='242.3'> Seeing this servant in thy prayers is a proof of the ideal nearness, of the spiritual unity and of the impression that was printed within thine own consciousness. At all times I do supplicate to the divine Kingdom to make thy heart a pure, clear and polished mirror, facing the most glorious Kingdom, Abhá, that the pictures of the Supreme Concourse may be printed in it, and this is exactly what was meant in the Bible by this text: “Let us create man after our own image and likeness.” </p>

<p id='242.4'> To see repeatedly is an evidence that the vision will take place both in the spirit and body; but separation <span data-pg='709'></span> and union, parting and meeting are things which belong to the material body. The spirit is sanctified from association, departure, nearness, remoteness, connection and separation, for these are of the properties of material bodies and of the characteristics of the elementary facts; but the Spirit is everlastingly in the station of its loftiness and supremacy in a similar way to the sun which is continually stationed in its sphere orbit; its appearance and disappearance signify the clearness of the place and the firmness of the body which is facing it, and as long as the confronting surface continues to be in a well polished condition, the lights of the sun will then appear in it; but when it becometh rough and impure, the lights disappear. </p>

<p id='242.5'> Consequently, it hath been proven that nearness and remoteness signify smoothness, clearness and fineness; or rust, impurity and roughness, respectively. </p>

<p id='242.6'> And if God wisheth, through the clearness of the heart, we will be continually in the assembly of alliance and friendship, resting permanently in the spiritual and heavenly realm, adoring and worshipping God, meeting and uniting by the holy fragrances, drawn by the magnet of the love of God and thanking Him for this great bounty and evident victory. </p>

<p id='242.7'> As to our meeting materially (i.e., face to face), I ask God that He may ordain this for us in the way He deemeth best. </p>

<p id='242.8'> Then know, O thou virtuous soul, that as soon as thou becomest separated from aught else save God and dost cut thyself from the worldly things, thy heart will shine with lights of divinity and with the effulgence of the Sun of Truth from the horizon of the Realm of <span data-pg='710'></span> Might, and then thou wilt be filed by the spirit of power from God and become capable of doing that which thou desirest. This is the confirmed truth. </p>

<p id='242.9'> As to the desire shown by thee towards serving holy and spiritual souls, it is indeed of the best desires and of the most noble qualities. Blessed is he who is strengthened and confirmed by such a desire during all his life, in the hope of attaining eternal life. </p>

<p id='242.10'> As to thee, O thou being who art attracted to God, announce the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of God through the breaths of the Holy Spirit; for He will confirm thee in similar manner to the confirmation He bestowed upon the holy souls in the past decades and former ages. </p>

<p id='243.6'> O maid-servant of God! By God the True One, verily, the crown of mighty gift is suspended betwixt heaven and earth and the angels of holiness are awaiting a lofty head which may be worthy of this great bestowal, so that it may descend upon that head, that it may wear that glorious crown, the most precious gems of which illumine the eyes of all the world. </p>

<p id='243.7'> O maid-servant of God! Many spiritual women came (into the world) and passed away in vain; no sound is heard of them and no trace is seen of them, inasmuch as their spirits were not dependent upon the Holy Spirit, nor were they attracted to the fragrances of truth; nor were they ever baptized by the water of life, by the fire of the love of God, nor by the “Spirit of Truth” which speaketh in the assemblies of the Kingdom and breatheth upon spirits the breezes which waft and eternal glory, the signs of which are everlasting. </p>

I beg of God to enable thee to diffuse the spirit of life (i.e., to teach this truth), to herald the Kingdom of God, to speak the praise of God and to be wholly attracted to the Word of God, so that thou mayest become a well-rooted tree in the garden of the Kingdom, its fruits within reach, its wide-spread branches overshadowing those regions. </p>

Thy mission now is this: Travel as much as possible to different parts of America, pass through cities and villages (or towns), guide all to the Beauty of Abhá and raise the call of the Kingdom and say: “O greatest of glad-tidings, for the Sun of Truth of the Beauty of Abhá hath dawned from the horizon of the contingent world and illumined the regions of with the lights of the mightiest guidance!

<p id='249'> The contents of thy last letter were extremely rejoicing, for they were a glorious evidence of the glowing of the fire of the love of God, of attainment to the gift of God and of the spiritual connection of the spirits. For as much as hearts are like unto mirrors, when the light of the love of God is enkindled, brilliant rays will reflect and merciful phenomena become manifest and clear. Physical nearness or remoteness is of no importance; the essential fact is the spiritual affinity <span data-pg='720'></span> and ideal nearness. Judas Iscariot was for a long time favored in the holy court of His Holiness Christ, yet he was entirely far and remote; while Paul, the apostle, was in close embrace with His Holiness. The Egyptian carrier of glad-tidings was the bearer of the garment of Joseph, yet he could not inhale the fragrance of the garment. His holiness Jacob, in Canaan, longed for meeting (Joseph), yet he was near and inhaled the fragrance of the garment. Consequently, it is evident that one can certainly and surely inhale the perfume of affinity even from a far distance. I beg of God that He may strengthen and solidify such connections between the friends (believers), so that the spiritual unity may become a manifest light and the earthly world may become a camping-place for the heavenly hosts. </p>

<p id='249.2'> O thou dear maid-servant of God! Be thou aglow and illumined and be thou enkindled in soul with the fire of the love of God in every assemblage. Be not quiet for a moment and do not seed composure even for an hour (i.e., be active in spreading the light). Be thou a cause for the illumining of hearts and spiritualizing of souls. Always communicate about this (truth) with that great personage in France and write to him: “No matter how clear, pure and polished the mirror may be, not until it is turned unto the Sun of Truth will it find glorious bounty and become reflective of rays.” *** </p>

Likewise, an expert student prepareth and memorizeth his lessons and exercises with the utmost effort, and in the day of examination he appeareth with infinite joy before the master. Likewise, the pure gold shineth radiantly in the fire of test. Consequently, it is make clear that for holy souls, trials are as the gift of God, the Exalted; but for weak souls they are an unexpected calamity. This test is just as thou hast written: it removeth the rust of egotism from the mirror of the heart until the Sun of Truth may shine therein. For, no veil is greater than egotism and no matter how thin that covering may be, yet it will finally veil man entirely <span data-pg='723'></span> and prevent him from receiving a portion from the eternal bounty. </p>

<p id='253.3'> Praise be to God! according to the commandments and exhortations of Bahá’u’lláh, we are the well-wishers of all the governments and act toward all the nations of the world in peace and love. We have no intention but that which is good and no desire but the good pleasure of God. We mean well toward every people and seek to have sincerity and good-will toward every government. In return for arrows and swords, we present milk and honey and we heal the deadly poison with the swift healing antidote. Night and day we are in action and exertion, in order to dress the wounds and cure the pain (of the people), to care for the afflicted and comfort even the ill-natured one, so that, through the assistance and favor of God, this darkness of selfish prejudice shall vanish and the error of folly and ignorance shall be changed into divine guidance. </p>

By God, the true One, verily, the Holy Spirit confirmeth every maid-servant who ariseth to spread the fragrances of God, so that the inhabitants of the whole world cannot overcome her spiritual strength — for similar things have happened in the past centuries. </p>

<p id='255.4'> O thou maid-servant of God! Celebrate the praises of God; become thou engaged with His mentioning like unto the tempestuous and roaring torrent rushing down from the mountains and hills; rend asunder the veils and coverings, so that the shining lights may become manifest to the eyes, refreshing the hearts of the righteous ones with the gentle breezes of the flowers of truth and the sweet fragrance of the dawn of eternity. </p>

<p id='255.5'> O thou maid-servant of God! Verily, the bounties of thy Lord are great and great in this glorious century and new age; the confirmations are consecutive and continuous; the rays of the Sun of Truth are shining <span data-pg='727'></span> and sparking; the stars of guidance are gleaming and scintillating and the rains of generosity are falling and flowing! Blessing is upon the one who taketh a share from this glorious outpouring and receiveth illumination from this light which is shining forth from the firmament of ether. </p>

<p id='255.6'> O thou maid-servant of God! Blessed art thou, for the Temple of the Covenant (‘Abdu’l-Bahá) hath become manifest to thee in a dream with incomparable humility and submission toward God, and that thou hast beheld that countenance overflowing with yearning, attraction and love toward the Beauty of the Almighty. Ere long thou shalt witness a great effect through this observation, whereby the spirit of life will become manifest in thee, which is now flowing in the veins of the contingent beings. Then thou shalt behold that which none have seen! At that time thou shalt fall upon the ground before God the True One, for He hath favored thee with this most great bounty. </p>

Thou art present and visible and under all circumstances thou art protected by the glances of the Spirit. </p>

<p id='258.4'> Print the account which thou hast written about thy trip to ‘Akká and spread <span data-pg='729'></span> it. </p>

<p id='259.4'> That merciful maid-servant (i.e., thyself) seeth some spiritual dreams (or visions). these are, in reality, discoveries of the heart and are spiritual visions. I beg of God that, through the power of insight, thou mayest continually witness the lights of the Kingdom of Abhá. </p>
