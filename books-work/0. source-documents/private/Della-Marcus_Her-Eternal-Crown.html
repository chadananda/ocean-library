Notes and Acknowledgements

	I never imagined that I would one day write a book. The idea for the original project began when I visited Romania in October 1990, just one year after the country opened up after its long period of Communist isolation. In 1987 a very dear friend of mine, Yass Khabirpour, had settled in the northern city of Cluj-Napoca as a pioneer of the Baha'i Faith and a student and I was curious to see what a former Communist country was like. I clearly remember sitting in Yass's home talking to her and Alessandra Lanfranconi, who was also visiting Romania. We were discussing the history of the Faith in Romania and Queen Marie, and Alessandra brought out a copy of {The Guardian of the Baha'i Faith} which had been published shortly before, in 1988. I had not yet had a chance to read this precious book by Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum and spent some of my time perusing the chapters about Queen Marie and Martha Root. Memories flooded back of hours spent during my childhood in Luxembourg poring through volumes of {The Baha'i World}, which contained some of the beautiful Romanian Queen's appreciations of the Baha'i Faith and descriptions of her encounters with Martha Root. There seemed to be a great deal of information available but it was scattered in many dif≠ferent books. It was upon my return to the Holy Land from Romania that I decided I would like simply to gather all the material together, as I believed this could be of particular importance to the newly-established Baha'i community in Romania. <span data-pg='x'></span>

	My interest in Queen Marie led me to read Hannah Pakula's comprehensive biography {The Last Romantic} and I realized there might be heretofore unknown and unpublished information available, particularly in Romania's State Archives, which Pakula had listed as her source for one of Queen Marie's diary entries which mentioned the Baha'i Faith. Through the extraordinary generosity of a blessed individual, I was able to consider spending not merely a summer in Romania, as I had originally intended, but an entire year. That year turned into six, during which time I was able to carry out research on Queen Marie, with particular attention to the latter part of her extraordinary life. I would like to express my profound gratitude to that person, whose assistance made it possible for me to move to Romania and to get to know its exquisite language, its wonderful people and its rich history. I also am deeply indebted to the Universal House of Justice for encouraging this project. Its trust I cherish beyond words.

	It has been a life-altering experience getting to know Queen Marie and Martha Root more intimately. I was permitted to read Queen Marie's diaries, preserved in the Romanian State Archives in Bucharest, covering a period of 13 years, from the beginning of 1926 when she first received Martha Root, to the end of 1938 when she passed away. Here I wish to express my gratitude to two Romanians, Mrs Ani Bicir and Mrs Maria Ionescu, who worked in the State Archives at the time I was doing my research and were extremely helpful to me. We had a difficult time with language, as I did not yet know Romanian, but they were both very patient with me.

	I was amazed at the amount of information available about the relationship of Queen Marie to the Baha'i Faith and decided it might constitute an excellent basis for future reference on the subject. This is how {Her Eternal Crown: Queen Marie of Romania and the Baha'i Faith} came into existence.

	I am deeply indebted to Mr Ian C. Semple, who was the first to read my manuscript and who provided not only <span data-pg='xi'></span> invaluable, detailed comments and suggestions but also consented to write the Foreword for the book and whose door was always open for my endless stream of questions; and to Mr J. Douglas Martin, the second reader of the manuscript, who provided his own very helpful comments. My heartfelt thanks also to Judith Oppenheimer, Archivist at the Baha'i World Centre, who helped me extensively in my search for materials and who was always available to answer questions; to my father, Leslie Marcus, to Louise Mould and Elena Andrei for reading the manuscript and offering their own comments and suggestions; to my mother, Audrey Marcus for offering her extraordinary talent as an artist in designing the cover; to my aunt, Janet Washburn, for suggesting the title of the book; to Beverley Rennie who, as friend and erstwhile Coordinator of the Audio-Visual Department at the Baha'i World Centre, encouraged me from the very start and provided samples of images to keep me inspired; to Shirin Youssefian Maanian who helped me formulate many ideas; and last but not least to Fori Constantinescu and her mother Ioana Gorun, who cared lovingly for me during the most challenging period of this endeavour. I would like to make special mention of my professor and beloved friend Dr Isabelle Armitage, whose encouragement throughout the years has often sustained me. I am deeply saddened that Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum (d. 19 January 2000), Isabelle Armitage (d. 17 March 2000) and my father (d. 8 April 2000) did not live to see this book published.

	I would also like to thank the Baha'i Publishing Trust of the United Kingdom for permission to reproduce passages from {The Guardian of the Baha'i Faith} by Ruhiyyih Rabbani, Kalimat Press for permission to reproduce a passage from Marzieh Gail's introduction to {Tahirih the Pure} by Martha L. Root, and Glenn Egli for the photograph of Amatu'l-Baha.

	The writings of both Queen Marie and Martha Root contained a number of spelling mistakes and inconsistencies. The Queen, who was born in England of one English and one <span data-pg='xii'></span> Russian parent, learned to speak English, German, French and Romanian but claimed that 'spelling ... [was] not [her] strong point' (Bolitho, {Biographer's Notebook}, p.9). For the most part I have left errors uncorrected except in the case of some place names where an endnote appearing after the first occurrence of the name will indicate the various spellings used.

	The transliteration of oriental words and proper names has been made according to the system established at one of the International Oriental Congresses and used by Shoghi Effendi.

Foreword

	In the tumultuous years at the close of the nineteenth century and the opening decades of the twentieth, it fell to young Princess Marie of Edinburgh, granddaughter of both Czar Alexander II of Russia and Queen Victoria of Britain, to marry, at the age of 17, Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania. She stood by his side, his stalwart and courageous consort, through years of struggle and great suffering, as Romania emerged a united and immensely strengthened country, from the anguish of the First World War.

	This book is not a retelling of the life of Queen Marie, nor an account of her profound love for her adopted country and its people whom she championed in the counsels of great nations; it is a more intimate story of the moral courage of a woman deeply wounded by the swords of the envious and ambitious and enmeshed in the cords of diplomatic and political loyalties which restrict the freedom of any monarch. Brought up in the Church of England, married into a Roman Catholic royal family, reigning in a country the majority of whose people were of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Queen Marie had the depth of love for God and Christ and the breadth of spiritual vision to embrace all such variations and to recognize and publicly hail the divine reality of the message of Baha'u'llah, a message which, she wrote, was 'Christ's Message taken up anew in the same words almost, but adapted to the thousand years and more difference that lies between the year one and today.' 'It is like a wide embrace gathering together all those who have long searched for words of hope.' The <span data-pg='xiv'></span> Queen's response to this message is told largely in the form of extracts from her own letters and diaries and from those of Miss Martha Root, who first brought it to her and became her loyal friend.

	In one of His writings, Baha'u'llah exclaims: 'How great is the blessedness that awaiteth the king who will arise to aid My Cause in My Kingdom... Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead of blessings unto the whole world.' From these words it can be understood why Baha'is in every land revere--the name of this illustrious queen and are confident that her actions will bring untold blessings upon the spiritual destiny of Romania.


	It is befitting that this story of a little-known but profoundly significant part of the life of Queen Marie should have been written by an author of similarly diverse back≠ground: of American descent, raised in Luxembourg, for many years a resident in the Holy Land, a lover of Romania and its people and a member of its rapidly emerging Baha'i community.

Introduction

	One hundred and fifty-six years have passed since the birth of the Baha'i Revelation, the latest in a succession of messages from the Supreme Creator, God. It is assumed that most of the readers of this book will be familiar with at least the basic tenets of the Baha'i Faith. The mere century and a half of its existence has witnessed its spread to the far corners of the world and, owing to the latest spate of inhuman persecutions of its followers in Iran since the revolution in 1979, it has regularly occupied an important place in the deliberations of international, national and local governmental and non-governmental for a concerned with the preservation of human rights, as well as in the headlines of the world's media. However, for those who hear of the Baha'i Faith for the first time, know little about it and wish to learn of its history and teachings, many fine introductory books exist, some of which are listed in the bibliography.

	It is however important for the reader of this book to understand several aspects of the Baha'i Faith. One is that the Prophet-Founder of the Baha'i revelation, Baha'u'llah, meaning 'Glory of God' in Arabic, enjoined upon all people, including the world's monarchs and rulers, to recognize the Manifestations through which God makes Himself known to His creation, among whom were Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, the Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad and, more recently, Baha'u'llah and His predecessor the Bab, whose title means 'the Gate' in Arabic. Baha'u'llah also stressed that such recognition brings with it the further requirement of abiding by the laws and <span data-pg='2'></span> ordinances which each Manifestation brings and which are applicable for the duration of the respective prophetic dispensation. In the first paragraph of His Most Holy Book, {The Kitab-i-Aqdas}, Baha'u'llah made these weighty responsibilities very clear:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of Him Who is the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Fountain of His laws, Who representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the world of creation. Whoso achieveth this duty hath attained unto all good; and whoso is deprived thereof hath gone astray, though he be the author of every righteous deed. It behoveth every one who reacheth this most sublime station, this summit of transcendent glory, to observe every ordinance of Him Who is the Desire of the world. These twin duties are inseparable. Neither is acceptable without the other. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Source of Divine inspiration.[l]
.......... [1. Baha'u'llah, Kitab-i-Aqdas, para. 1.]
[.///]
[.]

	From the time of its creation humanity has been passing through an evolutionary process, just as the individual person moves from infancy to childhood to adolescence and finally to the maturity of adulthood. Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, described the present stage of humankind's evolution in these terms:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The long ages of infancy and childhood, through which the human race had to pass, have receded into the background. Humanity is now experiencing the commotions invariably associated with the most turbulent stage of its evolution, the stage of adolescence, when the impetuosity of youth and its vehemence reach their climax, and must gradually be superseded by the calmness, the wisdom, and the maturity that characterize the stage of manhood. Then will the human race reach that stature of ripeness which will enable it to acquire all the powers and capacities upon which its ultimate development must depend.[2]
.......... [2. Shoghi Effendi, World Order, p. 202.]
[.///]
[.]

	The Guardian further explained the progressive nature of revelation in relation to the latest divine dispensation, which <span data-pg='3'></span>
 [.]
[.//]
.......... ...identified with Baha'u'llah abrogates unconditionally all the Dispensations gone before it, upholds uncompromisingly the eternal verities they enshrine, recognizes firmly and absolutely the Divine origin of their Authors, preserves inviolate the sanctity of their authentic Scriptures, disclaims any intention of lowering the status of their Founders or of abating the spiritual ideals they inculcate, clarifies and correlates their functions, reaffirms their common, their unchangeable and fundamental purpose, reconciles their seemingly divergent claims and doctrines, readily and gratefully recognizes their respective contributions to the gradual unfoldment of one Divine Revelation, unhesitatingly acknowledges itself to be but one link in the chain of continually progressive Revelations, supplements their teachings with such laws and ordinances as conform to the imperative needs, and are dictated by the growing receptivity, of a fast evolving and constantly changing society, and proclaims its readiness and ability to fuse and incorporate the contending sects and factions into which they have fallen into a universal Fellowship, functioning within the framework, and in accordance with the precepts, of a divinely conceived, a world-unifying, a world-redeeming Order.[3]
.......... [3. Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 100.]
[.///]
[.]

	If we can understand and accept Baha'u'llah's teachings concerning progressive revelation, including the premise that each dispensation 'abrogates unconditionally' those gone before it, while recognizing that each was an essential stepping-stone for humanity's continued maturation, then we must also accept that every religious dispensation must attract to it the largest possible number of adherents in order to develop to its greatest potential.

	Each divine revelation is carried forward by its adherents and this responsibility to propagate the Word of God has existed from the time the Creator brought man into being. From time to time one of these religions benefited from an influential promoter who spurred on its progress.

	As Christianity is at present the most geographically spread of the world's independent religions and probably the best known to Westerners in terms of history and teachings, the following example is perhaps the best suited to illustrate an <span data-pg='4'></span> instance of such significant progress. The great divine message brought to the world by Jesus of Nazareth, the Prophet of God who had been born into Judaism and came to be known as Jesus Christ, was propagated by His Apostles and the slowly but ever-increasing band of followers, who ensured its spread throughout the Roman Empire despite serious persecutions, sadly associated with the beginning of every dispensation. Jesus had taught His followers that they must choose martyrdom rather than renounce their faith. Jewish and Roman persecutors tormented the Christians but Jesus' gentle and loving teachings attracted many who were greatly disillusioned by the beliefs and practices of the time. The fortunes of the Christian Faith changed considerably when it was adopted by the Roman Emperor Constantine, through whose support and efforts it was eventually proclaimed the official religion of the Empire after his death. Without doubt the recognition accorded to Christianity by the most influential ruler of the time led to its rapid spread and by 500 AD an estimated 20 per cent of the world's population had accepted the religion.

	During Baha'u'llah's exile and following His revelation as the latest in this succession of Prophets sent by God to assist humankind, powerful rulers and leaders held sway over the greater part of the world's population. Shoghi Effendi described them as 'most of the preeminent embodiments of power and of sovereignty in His [Baha'u'llah's] day'[4] and listed them as:
.......... [4. Shoghi Effendi, Promised Day is Come, p. 21.]

[.]
[.//]
.......... The Emperor of the French, the most powerful ruler of his day on the European continent, Napoleon III; Pope Pius IX, the supreme head of the highest church in Christendom, and wielder of the sceptre of both temporal and spiritual authority; the omnipotent Czar of the vast Russian Empire, Alexander II; the renowned Queen Victoria, whose sovereignty extended over the greatest political combination the world has wit≠nessed; William I, the conqueror of Napoleon III, King of Prussia and the newly acclaimed monarch of a unified Germany; Francis Joseph, the autocratic king-emperor of the <span data-pg='5'></span> Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the heir of the far-famed Holy Roman Empire; the tyrannical 'Abdu'l-'Azlz, the embodiment of the concentrated power vested in the Sultanate and the Caliphate; the notorious Nasiri'd-Din Shah, the despotic ruler of Persia and the mightiest potentate of Shf'ih Ishlm.[5]
.......... [5. ibid. p. 20.]
[.///]
[.]

	These Baha'u'llah addressed directly, both collectively and individually, during 1867 and 1868 in mighty and memorable Tablets, reminding them of their grave responsibility:

[.]
[.//]
.......... God hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the people, that ye may rule with justice over them, safeguard the rights of the downtrodden, and punish the wrong-doers. If ye neglect the duty prescribed unto you by God in His Book, your names shall be numbered with those of the unjust in His sight. Grievous, indeed, will be your error.[6]
.......... [6. Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, p. 247.]
[.///]
[.]

	As had other Prophets in earlier religious dispensations, Baha'u'llah thus required all people to recognize Him as the Manifestation of God for this day, to abide by His laws which are the laws of God, and to promote His teachings:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...God hath prescribed unto every one the duty of proclaiming His Message, and regardeth it as the most meritorious of all deeds.[7]
.......... [7. ibid. p. 278.]
[.///]
[.]

	The Baha'i Faith is the first religion for which its own Prophet left over one hundred books and Tablets, written either in His own hand or dictated and approved by Him. Baha'u'llah explained that these holy writings are destined to guide humankind throughout His dispensation for the duration of at least one thousand years, after which time God will send to the world a new Manifestation of Himself to continue guiding humanity in its evolutionary process.

	Until then, the followers of Baha'u'llah, known around the world as Baha'is, are to carry out His teachings and exert their utmost energies to unite all humankind.

	But what exactly is a Baha'i? 'Abdu'l-Baha, the son of Baha'u'llah, His appointed successor and authoritative <span data-pg='6'></span> interpreter of His teachings, defined a Baha'i as: 'The man who lives the life according to the teachings of Baha'u'llah...'[8]
.......... [8. Esslemont, {Baha'u'llah and the New Era}, p. 69.]

	He went on to say that 'a man may call himself a Baha'i for fifty years, and if he does not live the life he is not a Baha'i'.[9]
.......... [9. ibid.]

	'Abdu'l-Baha's statements suggest that even a person who has never heard the name of Baha'u'llah could be considered a Baha'i if his deeds were in conformity with Baha'u'llah's teachings; for what is essential is not the name but rather the way a person develops and lives his spiritual life.

	'Abdu'l-Baha further explained:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...ye must conduct yourselves in such a manner that ye may stand out distinguished and brilliant as the sun among other souls. Should anyone of you enter a city, he should become a centre of attraction by reason of his sincerity, his faithfulness and love, his honesty and fidelity, his truthfulness and loving-kindness towards all the peoples of the world, so that the people of that city may cry out and say: 'This man is unquestionably a Baha'i, for his manners, his behaviour, his conduct, his morals, his nature, and disposition reflect the attributes of the Baha'is.' Not until ye attain this station can ye be said to have been faithful to the Covenant and Testament of God. For He hath, through irrefutable Texts, entered into a binding Covenant with us all, requiring us to act in accordance with His sacred instructions and counsels.[10]
.......... [10. 'Abdu'l-Baha, {Selections}, p. 71.]
[.///]
[.]

	But 'Abdu'l-Baha also warned the followers of Baha'u'llah not to use the name lightly:

.......... A man may be a Baha'i in name only. If he is a Baha'i in reality, his deeds and actions will be decisive proofs of it. What are the requirements? Love for mankind, sincerity toward all, reflecting the oneness of the world of humanity, philanthropy, becoming enkindled with the fire of the love of God, attain≠ment to the knowledge of God and that which is conducive to human welfare.[ll]
.......... [11. 'Abdu'l-Baha, {Promulgation}, p. 336.]
[.///]
[.]

	'Abdu'l-Baha's definition promotes action rather than words: <span data-pg='7'></span>

[.]
[.//]
.......... Let those who meet you know, without your proclaiming the
fact, that you are indeed a Baha'i.

.......... Put into practice the Teaching of Baha'u'llah, that of kindness to all nations. Do not be content with showing friendship in words alone, let your heart burn with loving kindness for all who may cross your path.[12]
.......... [12. 'Abdu'l-Baha, {Paris Talks}, p. 16.]

	<nd>

.......... Let your actions cry aloud to the world that you are indeed Baha'is, for it is actions that speak to the world and are the cause of the progress of humanity.

.......... If we are true Baha'is speech is not needed. Our actions will help on the world, will spread civilization, will help the progress of science, and cause the arts to develop. Without action nothing in the material world can be accomplished, neither can words unaided advance a man in the spiritual Kingdom. It is not through lip-service only that the elect of God have attained to holiness, but by patient lives of active service they have brought light into the world.

.......... Therefore strive that your actions day by day may be beauti≠ful prayers. Turn towards God, and seek always to do that which is right and noble. Enrich the poor, raise the fallen, comfort the sorrowful, bring healing to the sick, reassure the fearful, rescue the oppressed, bring hope to the hopeless, shelter the destitute!

.......... This is the work of a true Baha'i, and this is what is expected of him. If we strive to do all this, then are we true Baha'is but if we neglect it, we are not followers of the Light, and we have no right to the name.[13]
.......... [13. 'Abdu'l-Baha, {Paris Talks}, pp. 80-1.]
[.///]
[.]

	Being a Baha'i therefore is something at once simple and complicated. The Baha'i Faith requires of its believers acceptance of the oneness of God, the oneness of humanity and the oneness of religion. It necessitates also the recognition of Baha'u'llah as the latest Manifestation of God for this day and a wholehearted and constant attempt to live by and promote His teachings. Shoghi Effendi also explained very clearly that there is more to being a Baha'i than we might assume:

[.]
[.//]
.......... It is good for the Baha'is to learn that being a Baha'i is essentially an inner thing, or way of life, and not dependent on fixed patterns.[14]
.......... [14. Shoghi Effendi, in Garrida, {Directives from the Guardian}, p. 10.]
[.///]
[.] <span data-pg='8'></span>

	But the Baha'i Faith, like all other religions, is also undergoing its own evolutionary process. In some ways, the practical side of being a Baha'i is somewhat different today than it was in the early days of its existence. As more and more of the original Persian and Arabic writings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha have been translated into other languages and the elucidations of Shoghi Effendi have been published, the understanding of what it means to be a Baha'i has changed, bringing with it increased responsibilities and duties. Laws which were not known because they were unavailable in translation were eventually rendered into the languages of the countries in which the Baha'i Faith was established. These were studied by the believers and were gradually made binding, in accordance with Baha'u'llah's express wishes and the requirements of the time, by 'Abdu'l-Baha, Shoghi Effendi and, finally, by the Universal House of Justice, the supreme elected body of the Faith, which first came into existence in 1963, five and a half years after the passing of Shoghi Effendi.

	Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum, the widow of Shoghi Effendi, sheds some light on the developmental stage of the Baha'i community in 1921 when Shoghi Effendi learned that he had been appointed Guardian of the Baha'i Faith in the Will and Testament of his grandfather, 'Abdu'l-Baha:

[.]
[.//]
.......... He beheld a widely diversified, loosely organized community, scattered in various parts of the globe, and with members in about twenty countries. These people, loyal, devoted and sincere though they were, were still, to a great extent, living in their parent religion's house, so to speak; there were Christian Baha'is, Jewish Baha'is, Muhammadan Baha'is and so on. They believed in the Baha'i Faith but were intimately connected with their former churches. Like fruit on a tree, they were a new crop but still stuck to the old branch. This was true East and West alike. That was the point to which the Faith had evolved at the time of the Master's ascension.[15]
.......... [15. Rabbani, {Twenty-Five Years of the Guardianship}, p. 6.]
[.///]
[.]

	It was not until the mid-1940s that the Guardian began explaining to the believers that their church membership was <span data-pg='9'></span> incompatible with adherence to the Baha'i Faith. Slowly, and with infinite patience, he made it clear to the Baha'is that they could not continue their other religious affiliations.

	If we examine the teachings of each Manifestation of God we see that the spiritual message is basically the same from one dispensation to the next. What changes fundamentally are the social teachings whose evolution must match the evolution of humanity. Shoghi Effendi explains this very clearly:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The fundamental principle enunciated by Baha'u'llah ... is that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process, that all the great religions of the world are divine in origin, that their basic principles are in complete harmony, that their aims and purposes are one and the same, that their teachings are but facets of one truth, that their functions are complementary, that they differ only in the nonessential aspects of their doctrines, and that their missions represent successive stages in the spiritual evolution of human society ...[16]
.......... [16. 16 Shoghi Effendi, {Promised Day is Come}, p. v.]
[.///]
[.]

	In light of this continuity it would be perfectly natural for a person to live his life in accordance with the spiritual teachings of Baha'u'llah, as they do not differ from those of all the Prophets of bygone ages. If a person who lives by the spiritual teachings of Jesus or Moses, to name but two Manifestations of God, can be considered as living by the spiritual teachings of Baha'u'llah, why can he not remain a Christian or a Jew? This is because the social teachings form an integral part of any divine revelation and must be applied as well as the spiri≠tual ones to be most effective.

	John Esslemont explained in his book {Baha'u'llah and the New Era}:

[.]
[.//]
.......... In order to attain to the Baha'i life in all its fullness, conscious and direct relations with Baha'u'llah are as necessary as is sunshine for the unfolding of the lily or the rose. The Baha'i worships not the human personality of Baha'u'llah, but the Glory of God manifest through that personality. He reverences Christ and Muhammad and all God's former Messengers to <span data-pg='10'></span> mankind, but he recognizes Baha'u'llah as the bearer of God's Message for the new age in which we live, as the Great World-Teacher who has come to carry on and consummate the work of his predecessors.[17]
.......... [17. Esslemont, {Baha'u'llah and the New Era}, p. 70.]
[.///]
[.]

	If a person is fortunate enough to find the Faith of Baha'u'llah, strives throughout his life to carry out the precepts outlined above by 'Abdu'l-Baha and adds to this a disciplined study of the teachings of Baha'u'llah, then he can be considered a Baha'i. But no one may be coerced to become a follower of Baha'u'llah's teachings. The independent investigation of the truth is one of the fundamental elements of the Baha'i teachings. Shoghi Effendi emphasized this in the guidance he offered to an individual believer:

[.]
[.//]
.......... We should never insist on teaching those who are not really ready for the Cause. If a man is not hungry, you cannot make him eat.[18]
.......... [18. Shoghi Effendi, {Unfolding Destiny}, p. 451.]
[.///]
[.]

	No monarch or ruler was to be found during Baha'u'llah's lifetime to heed His call, despite His clear message and His warning to them of the consequences of such repudiation. One by one the prophecies contained in His Tablets to them about the loss of their thrones, their kingdoms and empires, their sovereignty and in some cases even their lives came to pass. None was found before Baha'u'llah's passing from this world to recognize the divine message and contribute to its swift propagation.

	Only years later, shortly after the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha, did Baha'u'llah's message finally find in the heart and soul of a ruling monarch the response He had requested. A Queen of a European country which had been greatly influenced by the Roman Empire, particularly in its religious and linguistic tendencies, encountered the Baha'i Faith in the eve of her life and accorded it unexpected and spontaneous support and allegiance.

	{Her Eternal Crown: Queen Marie of Romania and the Baha'i Faith} covers only one aspect, albeit an extremely important one, of a specific 12-year period in the history of this revelation.

<span data-pg='11'></span>

	It records the encounter and relationship of Romania's second Queen with the Baha'i Faith during the years 1926 to her passing in 1938. This is the story of that mighty and courageous Queen, ardent promoter of the latest message of God to humankind, as revealed in her own diaries and letters and in the letters of the Baha'i who introduced her to Baha'u'llah's teachings, Martha L. Root. In spite of ever-increasing vicissitudes and hardships which concurred with her discovery and study of the Faith manifested by Baha'u'llah, Queen Marie will, in the words of Shoghi Effendi, be recognized for eternity as:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...the sovereign... shining in solitary glory, who has, in however small a measure, felt impelled to respond to the poignant call of Baha'u'llah[.][19]
.......... [19. Shoghi Effendi, {Promised Day is Come}, p. 13.]

	<nd>

.......... ...she, alone among her sister-queens, alone among all those of royal birth or station, was moved to spontaneously acclaim the greatness of the Message of Baha'u'llah, to proclaim His Fatherhood, as well as the Prophethood of Muhammad, to commend the Baha'i: teachings to all men and women, and to extol their potency, sublimity and beauty.

.......... Through the fearless acknowledgment of her belief to her own kith and kin, and particularly to her youngest daughter; through three successive encomiums that constitute her greatest and abiding legacy to posterity; through three additional appreciations penned by her as her contribution to Baha'i: publications; through several letters written to friends and associates, as well as those addressed to her guide and spiritual mother [Martha L. Root]; through various tokens expressive of faith and gratitude for the glad-tidings that had been brought to her through the orders for Baha'i: books placed by her and her youngest daughter; and lastly through her frustrated pilgrimage to the Holy Land for the express purpose of paying homage at the graves of the Founders of the Faith--through such acts as these this illustrious queen may well deserve to rank as the first of those royal supporters of the Cause of God who are to arise in the future, and each of whom, in the words of Baha'u'llah Himself, is to be acclaimed as 'the very eye of mankind, the luminous ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead of blessings unto the whole world'.[20]
.......... [20. Shoghi Effendi, {God Passes By}, p. 390.] <span data-pg='12'></span>
[.///]
[.]

	Shoghi Effendi concludes his statement by pointing to the high station Queen Marie achieved:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Queen Marie's acknowledgment of the Divine Message stands as the first fruits of the vision which Baha'u'llah had seen long before in His captivity, and had announced in His Kitab-i≠Aqdas. 'How great', He wrote, 'the blessedness that awaits the King who will arise to aid My Cause in My Kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Me!... All must glorify his name, must reverence his station, and aid him to unlock the cities with the keys of My Name, the Omnipotent Protector of all that inhabit the visible and invisible kingdoms. Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous ornament on the brow of creation, the fountain-head of blessings unto the whole world. Offer up, O people of Baha, your substance, nay your very lives for his assistance.'[21]

Prologue

A Belated Message for Romania

[.]
[.//]
To my Country and my People

.......... When you read this, o my People, I will have passed into the Great Beyond that remains for us all a mystery. Because of my great love for you, I wish my voice to reach you one last time, even from beyond the peace of the grave.

.......... I was only 17 years old when I came into your midst. I was young and ignorant, but proud of my country of origin. Today I am proud to have been born an Englishwoman, but because I adopted a new nationality I worked hard at becoming a good Romanian.

.......... That was not easy at the start. I was a foreigner in a foreign land, alone among people I did not know. But few ponder how hard is the road for a foreign princess, until she becomes one with the country into which she had been brought.

.......... I became yours through joy and pain. Looking back it is hard to say which was greater, the joy or the pain, but the pain lasted longer. No man is judged fairly while he is alive, only after death is he remembered or forgotten ... perhaps you will remember me because I loved you deeply, and I tried to serve you with all my heart, for my heart was strong, all-accepting, impulsive, and later it became patient, exceedingly patient.

.......... I was allowed to live great moments alongside you, O my People, times of great upheaval and great successes. For a time I was allowed to be your guide and inspiration, the one who kept the flame alight, who became the centre of resistance during the dark days.

.......... I can tell you this now because I am no longer alive. You gave me a name in those days which I love, you called me 'Mother of All', and such will I remain in your memory, 'Mother of All', <span data-pg='14'></span> the one who was always to be found in moments of pain and danger.

.......... Later came a time when you defiled me, but this is the fate of mothers, to be denied. So I endured it and carried on loving you, despite the fact that I could no longer help you as I could when you believed in me. But this has been forgotten.

.......... I was with you for so long, o my People that it seems impossible to think that I must leave you. Every man comes to the end of his days. I also have come to the end, but before becoming silent for eternity, I wish to raise my hands in blessing.

.......... I bless you, beloved Romania, home of my joy and pain, you beautiful country of my heart, whose many paths I knew. Wonderful country I saw crippled, whose eternal dream I shared and was permitted to see come true.

.......... May you be filled always with abundance, may you be filled with great honour, and rise up rightly and loftily among the nations, be always honest, loving and knowing.

.......... I feel I have understood you, never judging, but loving...

.......... I have never liked forms and rules, nor did I watch what I said. I loved the truth and dreamed of living in the light of the sun, but in my later years I lived as best I could, not as I would have wished.

.......... But when you remember me, o my People, think of me as one who grew fond of life and beauty, who was too honest to pretend, too militant to be defeated, too loving to judge.

.......... I have no wealth to leave to you. What you so generously gave me I spent in your midst. I beautified those places I was given to live in. If all those beauties will remind you of me then I will be fully rewarded for the love I gave you, because for me beauty was a creed. I brought the little abandoned castle of Bran back to life, but Tenha Yuvah is the place I created. It was there that I was able to make a dream come true, and this is why it meant so much to me, more than I will ever be able to express.

.......... I have asked my son, King Carol II, to have my heart taken out of my body, to have it carried to Stella Maris, the small church I built along the sea.

.......... My body will rest at Curtea de Arges, alongside that of my beloved husband, King Ferdinand, but my heart I wish to dwell under the stones of the little church I built. <span data-pg='15'></span>

.......... During a long life, many came to seek out my heart, so that after my death I wish to know that they will be able to continue coming to it, along the lily-lined path, which was my pride and joy.

.......... I want to rest there, among all the beauty I created, among the flowers I sowed. Because my heart is there, I do not wish it to be a place of sadness, but rather a place of peace and delight, as it was when I was alive.

.......... I am leaving my children to the heart of my People. Because they are human they have their faults, but their hearts are good, as was mine. Love them and serve each other, as is seemly.

.......... Ileana, I leave in your special care, because she is without a real home.

.......... And now, farewell forever, as from now on I can send you no sign. But above all, remember that I loved and blessed you with my dying breath.

Marie,
Bran August 1933[1]
.......... [1. Letter of Queen Marie to the Country and People of Romania, August 1933, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Five years before her passing, Queen Marie penned these lines to the Romanian people, surely intending her words to be shared with her people upon her death. Yet the message of Romania's Queen Mother never reached them.[2]
.......... [2. It seems only to have appeared publicly in extract form in Hannah Pakula's biography of Queen Marie, {The Last Romantic}, which was not widely available in Romania, nor was it translated into the Romanian language, so it is unlikely that many Romanians are aware of the letter's existence.]

	When Romanians are asked about Queen Marie, most profess some knowledge of her as one of their country's queens and some know that she was reputed to have been a good and truly caring queen-consort. For many reasons, not least of which is the 60-year gap since her death, Queen Marie is even less well known in other countries, despite the fact that she was a prominent figure in Europe and North America during her lifetime. Her descent from the powerful British and Russian royal families, her renowned beauty and her active involvement in the social, economic and political issues of the period in which she lived made her life a subject of much interest.

	The responsibility of the monarchs and rulers of the world was drawn to their attention in a Tablet addressed collectively to them by Baha'u'llah: <span data-pg='16'></span>

[.]
[.//]
.......... God hath committed into your hands the reins of the government of the people, that ye may rule with justice over them, safeguard the rights of the down-trodden and punish the wrong-doers.[3]
.......... [3. Baha'u'llah, {Proclamation of Baha'u'llah}, p. 11.
[.///]
[.]

	In another Tablet He reminds them that 'Your people are your treasures'.[4] He warns them,
.......... [4. {Proclamation of Baha'u'llah}, p. 12.

[.]
[.//]
.......... Beware not to deal unjustly with anyone that appealeth to you, and entereth beneath your shadow. Walk ye in the fear of God, and be ye of them that lead a godly life... Put your whole trust and confidence in God, Who hath created you, and seek ye His help in all your affairs.[5]
.......... [5. {Proclamation of Baha'u'llah}, p. 9.]
[.///]
[.]

	Queen Marie seemed to understand this responsibility and take it to heart from the time she arrived in her adopted country. She got to know Romania's people, its culture, its customs, its countryside and, above all, its aspirations, which became her own. She selflessly dedicated much time and energy to the sick and dying during World War 1. After the war she joined Romanian statesmen in an unofficial capacity at the Paris peace talks to plead the country's case for territorial gains. Few people seem aware that Romania's present size is largely due to Queen Marie's lobbying efforts in Paris. She also wrote numerous books and articles about Romania, in the hope of dispelling negative feelings towards the country that she had come to love so deeply.

	Spirituality and a staunch belief in God guided the Romanian Queen throughout her life. At the beginning of 1926 Queen Marie was to begin a new spiritual journey with the help of an extraordinary woman, Martha L. Root, who was visiting the once beautiful city of Bucharest.

<span data-pg='17'></span>

Martha L. Root[1]
.......... [1. Two fine biographies have been written about Martha Root: {Martha Root: Lioness at the Threshold} by M. R. Garis and {Martha Root: Herald of the Kingdom} compiled by Kay Zinky. Other books provide significant descriptions of Martha, some of which are included in the bibliography of this book.]

	Many people use material and physical standards by which to judge others. In the world today, as was true during Martha Root's time, fame usually comes much easier to the rich and beautiful. 'Abdu'l-Baha explained that wealth, while not undesirable, does not constitute a measure by which people can be
fairly valued:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The Baha'is must be distinguished from others of humanity. But this distinction must not depend upon wealth--that they should become more affluent than other people. I do not desire for you financial distinction. It is not an ordinary distinction I desire; not scientific, commercial, industrial distinction. For you I desire spiritual distinction--that is, you must become eminent and distinguished in morals. In the love of God you must become distinguished from all else. You must become distinguished for loving humanity, for unity and accord, for love and justice. In brief, you must become distinguished in all the virtues of the human world--for faithfulness and sincerity, for justice and fidelity, for firmness and steadfastness, for philanthropic deeds and service to the human world, for love toward every human being, for unity and accord with all people, for removing prejudices and promoting international peace. Finally, you must become distinguished for heavenly illumination and for acquiring the bestowals of God. I desire this distinction for you. This must be the point of distinction among you.[2]
.......... [2. 'Abdu'l-Baha, {Promulgation}, p. 190.]
[.///]
[.]

	If Martha Root were to be judged by common standards she might be considered plain and unfashionable, 'her sense of dress ... [was] usually described as dowdy or eccentric'.[3] She <span data-pg='18'></span> also always tried to live 'simply, frugally',[4] sometimes to the detriment of her health, which had been fragile since her childhood. By the time she encountered the Baha'i Faith and, in 1909, become one of its followers at the age of 37, Martha Root was probably considered by many people to be an old woman. The fact that she was not married may have contributed to the perception of some people that she was odd. She was an elderly spinster, a journalist, travelling around the world alone, under trying conditions. She was determined to heed 'Abdu'l-Baha's request to her in His letter:
.......... [3. Garis, {Martha Root}, p. 219.]
.......... [4. ibid. p. 226.]

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...my hope from the blessings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is that thou mayest forget rest and composure and like unto a swift-flying bird, thou mayest reproduce the melody of the Kingdom and engage in songs and music in the best of tunes. All ears are alert for the summons to the Most Great Peace. It is therefore better for thee to travel now around the world, if this is conveniently possible, and roar out the call of the Divine Kingdom. Thou shalt witness great results and extraordinary confirmations.[5]
.......... [5. Letter of 'Abdu'l-Baha to Martha Root, 10 January 1919; another version of this letter is published in {Martha Root}, p. 87-8.]
[.///
[.]

	'Abdu'l-Baha had seen in Martha Root the true potential which would bring her spiritual distinction. Some insight into aspects of Martha's Baha'i life are provided by a friend of hers, Marzieh Gail:

[.]
[.//]
.......... And so on and on she travelled--not young or strong, not beautiful, not rich, alone, and more than once in terrible danger--on and on, for twenty years. She had begun these journeys in response to 'Abdu'l-Baha's mandate to America, issued in His Tablets of the Divine Plan. That was 1919. She was the first to arise, and she carried on with her work until, far from home, she stumbled and fell 'in her tracks'.[6]
.......... [6. Gail, 'With Martha', in Root, {Tahirih the Pure}, p. 3.]

	<nd>

.......... Although I have always taken everything Martha did for granted--she was Martha, that was enough--still I have wondered how she, to outward seeming an unnoticeable, average little woman, with no worldly credentials, ever took it into her head to approach the remote, bejewelled and glamorous Queen Marie of Rumania, daughter of <span data-pg='19'></span> the Duke of Edinburgh, granddaughter of that Victoria who, 'Abdu'l-Baha affirms, 'was superior to all the kings of Europe .. '[7]
.......... [7. ibid. p. 11.]
[.///]
[.]

After 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, Shoghi Effendi assumed the leadership of the Baha'i community, which included the guidance of such faithful workers as Martha Root. He also saw her with other eyes, evaluating her efforts in spiritual terms. Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum describes the Guardian's relationship with Martha Root:

[.]
[.//]
.......... From the inception of Shoghi Effendi's ministry she not only turned her loving heart to him but constantly sought his advice as to her plans. It would not be exaggerating to say they had a partnership in all her undertakings, marked by a mutual love and confidence all too rare in the harassed life of the Guardian. They kept in close touch, a flow of letters and cables apprising him of her plans, her needs, her victories, her requests for guidance and his unfailing answers giving encouragement and advice... She turned to him at all times, unhesitatingly making requests of him which she felt were in the interests of the Faith. The Guardian was well aware of both the purity of her motives and her good judgement and almost invariably acceded to these requests, which ranged from letters of encouragement to individuals to cabled messages to figures of great prominence.

.......... ...Love begets love. Martha's great love for Shoghi Effendi called forth his love and his responses the way the capacity of a diamond to reflect light captures its rays and casts them back brilliantly.[8]
.......... [8. Rabbani, {Guardian of the Baha'i Faith}, pp. 40-1.]
[.///]
[.]

	Excerpts from Shoghi Effendi's own description of Martha Root in {God Passes By} are truly moving and soul-stirring:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Nor can I dismiss this subject without singling out for special reference her who, not only through her preponderating share in initiating measures for the translation and dissemination of Baha'i literature, but above all through her prodigious and indeed unique exertions in the international teaching field, has covered herself with a glory that has not only eclipsed the achievements of the teachers of the Faith among her contemporaries the globe around, but has outshone the feats accomplished by any of its propagators in the course of an <span data-pg='20'></span> entire century. To Martha Root, that archetype of Baha'i itinerant teachers and the foremost Hand raised by Baha'u'llah since 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, must be awarded, if her manifold services and the supreme act of her life are to be correctly appraised, the title of Leading Ambassadress of His Faith and Pride of Baha'i teachers, whether men or women, in both the
East and the West.

.......... The first to arise, in the very year the Tablets of the Divine Plan were unveiled in the United States of America, in response to the epoch-making summons voiced in them by 'Abdu'l≠Baha; embarking, with unswerving resolve and a spirit of sublime detachment, on her world journeys, covering an almost uninterrupted period of twenty years and carrying her four times round the globe, in the course of which she travelled four times to China and Japan and three times to India, visited every important city in South America, transmitted the message of the New Day to kings, queens, princes and princesses, presidents of republics, ministers and statesmen, publicists, professors, clergymen and poets, as well as a vast number of people in various walks of life, and contacted, both officially and informally, religious congresses, peace societies, Esperanto associations, socialist congresses, Theosophical societies, women's clubs and other kindred organizations, this indomitable soul has, by virtue of the character of her exertions and the quality of the victories she has won, established a record that constitutes the nearest approach to the example set by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself to His disciples in the course of His journeys throughout the West.

.......... Her eight successive audiences with Queen Marie of Rumania, the first of which took place in January, 1926 in Cotroceni[9] Palace in Bucharest, the second in 1927 in Pelisor Palace in Sinaia, followed by a visit in January of the ensuing year to her Majesty and her daughter Princess Ileana, at the royal palace in Belgrade, where they were staying as guests of the King and Queen of Yugoslavia, and later, in October, 1929, at the Queen's summer palace 'Tehna Yuva',[10] at Balcic, on the Black Sea, and again, in August, 1932 and February, 1933, at the home of Princess Ileana (now Arch-Duchess Anton of Austria) at Modling, near Vienna, followed a year later, in February, by another audience at Cotroceni Palace, and lastly, <span data-pg='21'></span> in February, 1936, in that same palace--these audiences stand out, by reason of the profound influence exerted by the visitor on her royal hostess, as witnessed by the successive encomiums from the Queen's own pen, as the most outstanding feature of those memorable journeys. The three invitations which that indefatigable champion of the Faith received to call on Prince Paul and Princess Olga of Yugoslavia at the Royal Palace in Belgrade; the lectures which she delivered in over four hundred universities and colleges in both the East and the West; her twice repeated visits to all German universities with the exception of two, as well as to nearly a hundred universities, colleges and schools in China; the innumerable articles which she published in newspapers and magazines in practically every country she visited; the numerous broadcasts which she delivered and the unnumbered books she placed in private and state libraries; her personal meetings with the statesmen of more than fifty countries, during her three-months stay in Geneva, in 1932, at the time of the Disarmament Conference; the painstaking efforts she exerted, while on her arduous journeys, in supervising the translation and production of a large number of versions of Dr Esslemont's 'Baha'u'llah and the New Era'; the correspondence exchanged with, and the presentation of Baha'i books to, men of eminence and learning; her pilgrimage to Persia, and the touching homage paid by her to the memory of the heroes of the Faith when visiting the Baha'i historic sites in that country; her visit to Adrianople, where, in her over-flowing love for Baha'u'llah, she searched out the houses where He had dwelt and the people whom He had met during His exile to that city, and where she was entertained by its governor and mayor; the ready and unfailing assistance extended by her to the administrators of the Faith in all countries where its institutions had been erected or were being established--these may be regarded as the highlights of a service which, in many of its aspects, is without parallel in the entire history of the first Baha'i century.
.......... [9. The name of this Bucharest palace is frequently misspelled as 'Controceni', owing to Martha Root's initial misspelling, and rather than repeatedly noting this, the spelling has been corrected throughout.
.......... [10. The name of this summer palace in Balcic is frequently misspelt owing to Martha Root's initial misspelling. Various forms of the spelling include: Tehna Yuva, Tenha-Yuva, Tenhad-Yuvah, TenhaJuva. Rather than repeatedly note this, the spelling has been corrected throughout, except in published sources such as {Star of the West}.

.......... No less impressive is the list of the names of those whom she interviewed in the course of the execution of her mission, including, in addition to those already mentioned, such royal personages and distinguished figures as King Haakon of Norway; King Feisal of 'Iraq; King Zog of Albania and members <span data-pg='22'></span> of his family; Princess Marina of Greece (now the Duchess of Kent); Princess Elizabeth of Greece; President Thomas G. Masaryk and President Eduard Benes[11] of Czechoslovakia; the President of Austria; Dr Sun Yat Sen; Dr Nicholas Murray Butler, President of Columbia University; Prof. Bogdan Popovitch of Belgrade University; the Foreign Minister of Turkey, Tawfiq Rushdi Bey; the Chinese Foreign Minister and Minister of Education; the Lithuanian Foreign Minister; Prince Muhammad-'Ali of Egypt; Stephen Raditch; the Maharajas of Patiala, of Benares, and of Travancore; the Governor and the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem; Dr Erling Eiden, Archbishop of Sweden; Sarojini Naidu; Sir Rabindranath Tagore; Madame Huda Sha'ravi, the Egyptian feminist leader; Dr K. Ichiki, minister of the Japanese Imperial Household; Prof. Tetrujiro Inouye, Prof. Emeritus of the Imperial University of Tokio [sic]; Baron Yoshiro Sakatani, member of the House of Peers of Japan and Mehmed Fuad, Doyen of the Faculty of Letters and President of the Institute of Turkish history.
.......... [11. In the original the accent is missing from Eduard Benes's name.

.......... Neither age nor ill-health, neither the paucity of literature which hampered her early efforts, nor the meagre resources which imposed an added burden on her labours, neither the extremities of the climates to which she was exposed, nor the political disturbances which she encountered in the course of her journeys, could damp the zeal or deflect the purpose of this spiritually dynamic and saintly woman. Single-handed and, on more than one occasion, in extremely perilous circumstances, she continued to call, in clarion tones, men of diverse creeds, colour and classes to the Message of Baha'u'llah, until, while in spite of a deadly and painful disease, the onslaught of which she endured with heroic fortitude, she hastened homeward to help in the recently launched Seven Year Plan, she was stricken down on her way, in far off Honolulu. There in that symbolic spot between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, in both of which she had laboured so mightily, she died, on September 28, 1939, and brought to its close a life which may well be regarded as the fairest fruit as yet yielded by the Formative Age of the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah.

.......... To the injunction of 'Abdu'l-Baha bequeathed in His Will to follow in the footsteps of the disciples of Jesus Christ, 'not to rest for a moment', to 'travel throughout all regions' and to raise, <span data-pg='23'></span> 'without rest and steadfast to the end', 'in every land, the cry of ''Ya Baha'u'l-Abha"', this immortal heroine yielded an obedience of which the present as well as future generations may well be proud, and which they may emulate.

.......... 'Unrestrained as the wind', putting her 'whole trust' in God, as 'the best provision' for her journey, she fulfilled almost to the letter the wish so poignantly expressed by 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets, whose summons she had instantly arisen to carry out: 'O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of "Ya Baha'u'l-Abha" in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the Divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it.'

.......... 'I am deeply distressed to hear of the death of good Miss Martha Root', is the royal tribute paid to her memory by Princess Olga of Yugoslavia, on being informed of her death, 'as I had no idea of it. We always enjoyed her visits in the past. She was so kind and gentle, and a real worker for peace. I am sure she will be sadly missed in her work.'

.......... 'Thou art, in truth, a herald of the Kingdom and a harbinger of the Covenant,' is the testimony from the unerring pen of the Centre of Baha'u'llah's Covenant Himself, 'Thou art truly self-sacrificing. Thou showest kindness unto all nations. Thou art sowing a seed that shall, in due time, give rise to thousands of harvests. Thou art planting a tree that shall eternally put forth leaves and blossoms and yield fruits, and whose shadow shall day by day grow in magnitude.'

.......... Of all the services rendered the Cause of Baha'u'llah by this star servant of His Faith, the most superb and by far the most momentous has been the almost instantaneous response evoked in Queen Marie of Rumania to the Message which that ardent and audacious pioneer had carried to her during one of the darkest moments of her life, an hour of bitter need, perplexity and sorrow...

.......... The American Baha'i community, crowned with imperishable glory by these signal international services of Martha Root, was destined, as the first Baha'i century drew to a close, to distinguish itself, through the concerted efforts of its members, both at home and abroad, by further achievements of such scope and quality that no survey of the teaching activities of the Faith in <span data-pg='24'></span> the course of that century can afford to ignore them. It would be no exaggeration to say that these colossal achievements, with the amazing results which flowed from them, could only have been effected through the harnessing of all the agencies of a newly established Administrative Order, operating in conformity with a carefully conceived Plan, and that they constitute a befitting conclusion to the record of a hundred years of sublime endeavour in the service of the Cause of Baha'u'llah.[12]

	Martha Root's long-time friend Doris McKay, who wrote for the biennial {The Baha'i World}, provides another intimate glimpse into Martha's heroic life:

[.]
[.//]
.......... 'And the Queen', said Martha Root, 'met me at the stairs. I saw her standing there, a queen indeed, with her flowing black velvet dress and strands of marvellous pearls... We had tea in her inner library.'

.......... I thought as I gazed at that small blue-clad figure eagerly sitting forward on her chair in my simple living-room, that this same beloved 'Martha' who was now relating to me the fairy story of her adventures was identical with the one whom the Queen of Roumania had welcomed five times to her palace. There could be no other. Martha's love had shone out upon and drawn the Queen, as it now did me.

.......... 'Whosoever has lost himself has found the universe and the inhabitants thereof,' 'Abdu'l-Baha had said. How literally true this had proved to be for Martha Root! She had become a personage to whom the great scholars of the different countries had listened with respect, for whom the palace doors of many rulers had opened. But the woman who had talked intimately with Thomas Masaryk, and Eduard Benes; who had had audience with King Faisal of 'Iraq; who had four times visited Prince Paul and Princess Olga of Yugoslavia; who said of King Haakon, 'This spiritually lovable King of Norway who will never talk about himself ... made me very happy'; who was the intimate of Queen Marie--to mention some of the illustrious names -made no display of learning, nor did she depend on dress or personal appearance. The true love is regal in its freedom from self-consciousness and fear; the true wisdom is <span data-pg='27'></span> unabashed in the presence of learning, and it was in these ways that she found congeniality with the great of the five continents which she had travelled.

.......... Whoever you were, her loving interest was her introduction to you. There was no one, high or low, who had not felt that. Moreover she had a message for you, a Message from a King, the Greatest of All. There was a quiet stateliness in her manner, an element of ceremony. 'Make every meeting an occasion,' she instructed me. 'Give something always, if only a flower, some candy or fruit. Pray that they will accept from you the Greater Gift.'

.......... Who was Martha Root? What was the light her past threw upon such a career? She was born August 10, 1872 at Richwood, Ohio, of pioneer American stock. Her family moved to Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, a town to which Martha's homing instincts always turned in her later travels. She graduated from Oberlin and attended the University of Chicago. She was a school teacher, then a newspaper woman. One day after a chance meeting with a Baha'i traveller in a restaurant in Pittsburgh, she heard the Message of Baha'u'llah. At that moment the 'Concourse on high' passed down its chalices of pure light. The star of Martha's destiny began to rise. A signal to that star was to use her connection with the press to call together a mass meeting of four hundred in the Schenley Hotel in Pittsburgh to hear 'Abdu'l-Baha speak in His journey from east to west in 1912.

.......... In 1919 in answer to 'Abdu'l-Baha's call to American believers to scatter and spread the Faith of Baha'u'llah, Martha, after a white moment of decision, embarked upon her world journeys as an ambassador of the Oneness of Mankind. On the ship bound for South America she called the people together and informed them of the nature of her mission. In her subsequent travels in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, Russia happened to be the only country she did not visit. The spirit of her world embracing love vibrated over the wires of radio stations from Capetown to Oslo. Sheaves of newspaper clippings brought back her words to us from remote ports. A steady stream of articles appeared in which the flash of her insight into people and circumstances transported us to Belgrade, Athens, Stockholm, to Reykjavik (capital of Iceland), <span data-pg='28'></span> Antwerp or Adrianople. In Iran she continued her researches into the life of Tahirih, heroic woman pioneer and martyr in the time of the Bab, with whom the soul of Martha seemed mysteriously linked.

.......... Her sense of Mission is illustrated by the fact that she carried with her a collection of photographs of the various rulers to whom Baha'u'llah had addressed His Epistles. Among these were the Czar of Russia, Napoleon III, Pope Pius IX, Nasiri'd≠Din Shah, Queen Victoria--it was a young picture of the Queen in accordance with the history of the times. The spirit of Martha's going forth was like that of Badi', the youth who, in the time of Baha'u'llah volunteered to deliver the Tablet to the Shah of Persia knowing that he would suffer death at the hands of an antagonistic government. The spirit of renunciation expressed itself, now, in this modern apostle of Baha'u'llah in subtle ways comparable in degree. She had become the embodiment of a love which does not passively wait, but which goes forth with a wholehearted reckless spending of personality, of time, of strength. There was a bleak daily discipline of a meticulous economy, the dedication of moments of exhaustion to the service of her Cause: her undeviating back≠breaking obedience to the star she followed. In 1935, for example, we find her writing from Sweden that although very ill that fact must not impede progress in teaching the Cause of God. Her health shaken, she returned for one of her occasional visits to America in 1936, renewed her association with her beloved friends and family. Then in May, 1937, this brave heart again 'took sail'.

.......... I suppose there were many of us across the United States who had a troubling sense of finality as we caught through train windows the last tender flash of Martha's blue eyes. Her boat left San Francisco May 20th, docked for a few hours in Honolulu, then sailed for Japan. With the captain's cooperation she lectured on the boat. 'I spoke for an hour,' she said, 'and questions and answers followed for an hour. There were ten religions and ten nations represented... There were several young Japanese professors present returning from post≠graduate studies in Europe. Who can tell how far reaching are the words of truth? She arrived in Tokio June 3rd for a month of brilliant teaching activity, then moved on to Shanghai early in <span data-pg='29'></span> that fateful July of Japanese bombardment. She escaped under gunfire with other Americans to Manila on the night of the earthquakes. After about four months of intensive teaching she embarked on a small Oriental steamer for Bombay, arriving there from Ceylon October 15th.

.......... The fifteen months of Martha's stay in India were the crowning triumph of her efforts, a sustained splendour of achievement. The Baha'is of India and Burma wrote to our 1938 Convention:

[.]
............... 'The most outstanding feature in the year under report has been the teaching activities of our beloved sister Miss Martha L. Root. This star servant of Baha'u'llah toured from Bombay to Mandalay, and from Srinagar to Colombo. Wherever she went, she delivered the message of Baha'u'llah in her own convincing way, and published the divine Cause amongst all the educated people of this great continent... In Karachi she attended the 10th Convention of the Baha'is of India and Burma and probably did the greatest service of her life... She stayed in that town for three months and got the book {Tahirih, the Pure}, printed and mailed the world over... In Simla she graced the first Baha'i Summer School with her presence and drew down the blessings of God on this institution... Miss Martha Root has opened the whole of India for us, and it now devolves upon us to utilize these openings and produce the best of results.' After her final three months' tour of the Northern India Universities where her addresses had been enthusiastically received by thousands of progressive youth, she returned to Bombay. A gathering of the friends saw her off for Australia on the steamship {Straithard} December 29, 1938.

............... 'After visiting Australia and New Zealand Martha Root was on her way home in the spring of 1939. At Honolulu, on that island between the two hemispheres, she was obliged to leave the boat because of illness. It was here after an illness of months that the soul of Martha undertook the journey 'from earth to heaven'. The date was September 28, 1939. The Guardian, whose words had continually cheered her heart with his tender concern, cabled the National Spiritual Assembly:

............... 'Martha's unnumbered admirers throughout Baha'i world lament with me (the) earthly extinction (of) her heroic life. Concourse on high acclaim her elevation (to) rightful position <span data-pg='30'></span> (in) galaxy Baha'i immortals. Posterity will establish her as foremost Hand which 'Abdu'l-Baha will have raised up (in) first Baha'i century. Present generation (of) her fellow≠believers recognize her (to be the) first, finest fruit (which the) Formative Age (of the) Faith (of) Baha'u'llah has as yet produced. Advise hold befitting memorial gathering (in) Temple (to) honour one whose acts shed imperishable lustre (on) American Baha'i community. Impelled (to) share with National Assembly expenses (of) erection (of) monument (in) symbolic spot, (the) meeting-place (of) East (and) West, to both (of) which she unsparingly dedicated (the) full force (of her) mighty energies.'
[.]

.......... In a letter dated October 20, 1939, addressed to Roy C. Wilhelm, treasurer, the Guardian, through his secretary, refers to the passing of Miss Martha L. Root. 'The very sad and indeed distressing news of the passing away of our beloved Martha was a great shock to the Guardian, who feels unutterably sorry at this heavy blow sustained by the Cause. Her departure constitutes the heaviest blow which the teaching force not only in America but throughout the entire Baha'i world has sustained since the passing of our beloved Master. May the memory of the distinguished services it has been her unique privilege to render in so many fields and over such a long and uninterrupted period of years serve as a source of continued inspiration to the present-day and future generations of Baha'i teachers, to whom she will indeed ever be the very embodiment of those teaching qualities which only a few Baha'i teachers, whether in the East or the West, can claim to have attained.

[.]
............... 'To you, and to all the dear American friends who are now so profoundly deploring beloved Martha's passing, the Guardian feels moved to convey the assurances of his deepest and most loving sympathy in your great bereavement. May Baha'u'llah comfort your grief-stricken hearts, and cause this calamity to further cement the unity, deepen the devotion and increase the resourcefulness of the American believers, and in particular those dear pioneers who are so indefatigably labouring in foreign and distant fields.'
[.]

.......... In the Guardian's hand: 'The passing of dearest Martha and
the circumstances of her severe and painful illness have brought <span data-pg='31'></span> profound sorrow, but I rejoice at the glory and joy that must be hers and which she fully deserves in the Abha Paradise.'

.......... 'Sometimes I have asked myself,' Martha Root had said, musing upon the life of Tahirih, 'was Tahirih great enough instantly to say, "O God, I give my life to establish this Faith among mankind!" or did she, too, need to be trained by the Infinite God to long to give her life as a martyr to serve this new universal Revelation?' That that longing did come to fill Martha's whole being can be the only explanation of her remarkable career. As she pioneered further into the realms of the spirit a Will greater than her own resolve moved her. She became a lamp carrying a Light. Or you might say the abnegation of her very {self} was comparable to the crushing of the rose in the process of attar-making: the rare attar of a divine love drifted through every doorway and thrilled every heart.

.......... As we bid farewell to her familiar, loved presence among us-≠we, all the world--let us echo her own words to her beloved friends in India: 'I shall not say "Good-bye", I couldn't--it hurts my heart so! But we shall say: "Allah-u-Abha"! Always, "Allah-u-Abha".'[30]

	Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum writes of the passing of Martha Root and its effect upon Shoghi Effendi in a way that enables us to understand the 'spiritual distinction' of this great soul:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The years rolled by and Martha Root continued, white haired, frail and indomitable, her ceaseless journeys, until she was stricken by a 'deadly and painful disease', as Shoghi Effendi wrote, and in Honolulu on September 28, 1939 she passed away. She had been on fire with pain during the last weeks of a tour of the Antipodes and, on her way back to America, to assist in the prosecution of the first Seven Year Plan, she literally dropped in her tracks, yielding up a life the Guardian said might well be regarded as the fairest fruit the Formative Age of the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah had yet produced.

.......... I well remember the day the cable conveying the news of her death reached Shoghi Effendi. He himself was very ill with sand fly fever, had a high temperature (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and, alas, should never have had to receive such news in such a condition! But there was no way we could withhold it from <span data-pg='32'></span> him. He was the Guardian, it was Martha Root who had died. Against the strong remonstrances of his mother, his brother and myself, he pulled himself up to a sitting position in his bed, white, terribly weak, and very shaken by this sudden news, and dictated a cable to America announcing her death. He said what else could he do--the whole Baha'i world was waiting to hear what he would say.[31]
.......... [31. Rabbani, {Guardian of the Baha'i Faith}, pp. 41-2.]
[.///]
[.]

	May this brief description and tribute to Martha Root conclude with the moving words of Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum which explain so clearly what spurred on this 'star-servant of Baha'u'llah':

[.]
[.//]
.......... Martha Root was firmly convinced that in her possession was the most priceless gem the world had ever seen--the Message of Baha'u'llah. She believed that in showing this gem and offering it to anyone, king or peasant, she was conferring the greatest bounty upon him he could ever receive. It was this proud conviction that enabled her, a woman of no wealth or social prestige, plain, dowdily dressed and neither a great scholar nor an outstanding intellectual, to meet more kings, queens, princes and princesses, presidents and men of distinction, fame and prominence and tell them about the Baha'i Faith than any other Baha'i in the history of this Cause has ever done.[32]

From Princess to Queen

	Marie Alexandra Victoria was born on 29 October 1875 at Eastwell Park in Kent to Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh, and to Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna. Granddaughter of Queen Victoria on her father's side and of Czar Alexander II of Russia on her mother's side, she bore the official title of Princess of Great Britain and Ireland but was known to her family as Missy. She had an elder brother, Alfred, and three younger sisters, Victoria Melita known as Ducky, Alexandra known as Sister Sandra, and Beatrice known as Baby Bee.

	An agreement reached before Marie's parents' wedding determined that their children would be raised in the Anglican Church. Her mother was an ardent Russian Orthodox and Marie was thus exposed from her earliest life to two very distinctive sets of rituals within Christianity.

	In 1886 the Duke of Edinburgh was named Commander of Her Majesty's Mediterranean Fleet in Malta and the whole family spent three years on that island. Marie religiously kept diaries throughout her life and described the years in Malta as very happy and memorable ones. Here she acquired her great love for eastern architecture, flowers and riding, which she would delight in for the rest of her life.

	While in Malta she spent much time with her cousin George, son of King Edward VII and later king himself, who was in the Royal Navy. Marie's diaries indicate a very special fondness for cousin George, and although the future King George V had cared for her so deeply that he had wanted her <span data-pg='34'></span> to become his wife, Marie's mother made every effort to prevent an alliance with the British royal family because of her own personal dislike of them. Marie's destiny, however, lay in a different kingdom.

	Another friend made by Marie and her sisters during the 1888-9 winter was Lilian Barron, known affectionately by them as 'Little Lilian', daughter of Major Harry Barron of the Royal Artillery. Lilian Barron later became Lilian McNeill and the friendship established so early in the two girls' lives would continue many years later.

	From Malta the Duke of Edinburgh and his family moved to the German Duchy of Coburg and Gotha, which the Duke was to inherit from his uncle Ernst, brother of Queen Victoria's consort Prince Albert.

	At the age of 16 Marie was introduced by her mother to Ferdinand Victor Albert Mainrad, Prince of Hohenzollern≠Sigmaringen. Ten years her senior, the young prince was the son of Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Princess Antonia.

	Prince Ferdinand was also the nephew of King Carol I, formerly Karl von Hohenzollern, who had been offered by plebiscite the rule of the Ottoman Empire's province of Romania in 1866 by the leader of the Liberals and the first Romanian statesman Ion C. Bratianu with the support of Napoleon III and Bismarck. The Nationalist Movement in Romania had decided to search for a foreign prince in an attempt to prevent local intrigues and to increase the wealth and prestige of the country.

	Upon his arrival in Romania in 1866 Karl von Hohenzollern became leader of a provisional government under the nominal sovereignty of the Sultan of Turkey. At that time the country consisted only of Walachia and Moldavia and Karl was proclaimed prince and ruler by the new Assembly. It was then that he romanized his name to Carol. A new constitution was promulgated in July of that same year and in October 1866 the Ottoman Empire issued the act <span data-pg='35'></span> of investiture for Carol in which it recognized the unity of the two Romanian countries, Walachia and Moldavia. Although the Ottoman Empire had relaxed its authority and had declared Romania a 'privileged province', Romania joined the Russians in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-8, and it was during this time that Romania declared its independence from Turkey, an act fully upheld by the Congress of Berlin. But the victory of the Russo-Romanian alliance meant that the Romanians had to give up southern Bessarabia in exchange for northern Dobrogea. In 1881 the Romanian Parliament voted to transform Romania into a kingdom and the prince was crowned king on 10 May, becoming Carol I.

	In 1869 Carol had taken the German Princess Elisabeth of Wied as his wife and they had one daughter. On the death of this only child at the age of four, the provisions of the constitution required the Romanian throne to pass on the king's death to the oldest son of King Carol's brother, thus making Ferdinand the heir apparent in 1880.

	The 1880s also ushered in the discontented workers' movement and more and more strikes plagued the country.

	On 10 January 1893 Marie married the shy and retiring Crown Prince Ferdinand at Sigmaringen Castle in Germany. They immediately moved to Romania and Marie's early life in her newly-adopted country was very difficult. King Carol dominated the young couple's life and his distrust of all political parties in Romania led him to forbid Ferdinand and Marie from associating with virtually everyone in Romanian society.

	Marie gave birth on 15 October 1893 to an heir, Carol, followed a year later by a daughter, Elisabetha. Queen Elisabeth is described as having resented Maries ability to provide an heir to the throne and she considered herself much more qualified to raise children, accusing Marie of being 'too English' and 'too frivolous'.[l] The education of Carol and Elisabetha was thus taken over by Queen Elisabeth with the approval of King Carol. Marie repeatedly confided to her diary that her two oldest children caused her the greatest <span data-pg='36'></span> amount of concern and grief. Young Carol indulged in 'fits of rage and anger[2] whereas Elisabetha was described by her mother as having a 'rather cold reserved nature and she seems to keep people at a distance in such an uncomfortable way'.[3] A tutor appointed by the King and Queen was a terrible influence on Carol, turning the boy against his mother, and at age 18 the prince was already very violent, something which would characterize his entire life.

.......... [2. Pakula, {Last Romantic}, p. 151.]
.......... [3. Queen Marie to Pauline Astor, 4 June 1908, in ibid. p. 154.]

	A second daughter, Marie, also known as Mignon, was born on 9 January 1900. This little girl was 'a child of joy and sunshine'[4] and the Crown Princess fought to have more to do with the raising of her children. Three years later her second son, Nicholas, was born on 7 August, followed in 1909 by her 'naturally well-behaved' daughter, Ileana, 'born with the law within her, it was never necessary to teach [her] the difference between right and wrong; [she knew]'.[5] Her sixth and last child, a boy named Mircea, was born in January 1913.
.......... [4. Marie, {Story of My Life}, p. 403.]
.......... [5. ibid. p. 521.]

	During this period, encouraged by her friend Waldorf Astor, Marie began learning the Romanian language and became involved in charitable work. King Carol also relaxed his policy of not allowing his nephew and niece any contact with the population. Among Marie's newly-acquired friends were Prince Barbo Stirbey and his sister Elise Stirbey Bratianu of one of the great ruling families of Romania. Prince Stirbey helped Marie understand a great deal about the country and its politics. In those days women were not supposed to concern themselves with politics but Marie had come to care deeply for Romania and discreetly absorbed Prince Stirbey's lessons. It was at this time that Marie began to understand that she could shape her own role in Romania. In 1912 the first Balkan War followed the Italian defeat of Turkey during the Tripolitan War. The Bulgarians, Serbs, Greeks and Montenegrins declared war on the Ottoman Empire; Queen Marie described the Bulgarians as power-hungry. King Carol I had secretly aligned Romania with Austria-Hungary and Germany but was openly proclaiming <span data-pg='37'></span> his country as neutral. He believed that Germany's military and economic power would protect Romania from Russia. For this neutrality a claim was staked in 1913 for the territorial concession of the southern Dobrogea along the Black Sea, which was granted. At the frenzied insistence of some of Romania's officials, King Carol declared war with Turkey on Bulgaria after her sudden attack on her former allies, the Serbs and the Greeks. Bulgaria realized rapidly that she was overwhelmed but the cholera epidemic encountered by the Romanians in Bulgaria claimed untold lives among the mass of men that had enlisted so enthusiastically. The presence of a large number of Romanian landless peasants in Bulgaria during the second Balkan War fostered social unrest as they saw how well off and developed their southern agricultural neighbours were.

	 Marie started her hospital work during the second Balkan War and records in her diary that 'soon doctors, orderlies, soldiers, officers and sisters of charity became my most ardent adherents; I was never tired or discouraged, I would allow no difficulty to beat me, the harder the work the more strength did I find, and in a few days I had become the pivot around which everything revolved.'[6] She found this work very rewarding and encouraged Elisabetha, Nicholas and Mignon to assist her in the hospitals. Photographs during this time, some published in the press, show the princess wearing a Red Cross uniform. She does not appear to have been daunted by the atrocities and contagious diseases in these hospitals. Repeatedly she expressed in her diary her delight at being able to comfort the wounded and she increasingly understood the responsibility that fell on her shoulders as Crown Princess. She testified to the fact that her 'life and interests have changed... I don't feel myself at all, I am a changed person.'[7]

	All of these changes helped to prepare Marie to assume her new duties as queen when King Carol I died on 9 October 1914 in Sinaia. She appears to have made the <span data-pg='38'></span> transition quite smoothly and, with her recently acquired knowledge, she began offering her own understanding and advice to her husband, now the King, and to others in the government.

	At the outbreak of World War I, shortly before King Carol's death, great efforts were made by many, including Crown Princess Marie, to prevent Romania from allying itself with Germany again. King Carol and his nephew Ferdinand were both very loyal to their country of birth and neither of them could imagine that the seemingly invincible German army could ever be defeated. The Romanians generally favoured an alliance with the Entente and strong popular demand led to a compromise of neutrality. Queen Marie also had strong ties to Germany and her mother often reminded her of this link, but she was certain that Romania's only chance lay with an alliance with the Entente. She embarked on efforts to convince her husband of this need. The Entente representatives promised Romania Transylvania in exchange for its alliance, which finally led to Romania breaking its neutrality in August 1916 and declaring war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Germany, allied to Austria-Hungary, almost immediately attacked Romania; it became clear very soon that Romania's entry was too late and that she was ill-prepared for the war. Bulgaria and Turkey, allied with Germany, also declared war on Romania, forcing her to spread her troops along her southern borders in addition to those that were defending her border with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Various plots orchestrated by Romania's enemies and some of her supposed allies, as well as a score of unkept promises, did nothing to reassure her in her extreme hardship.

	Queen Marie found a new way of making a contribution by writing books aimed at fostering a greater international understanding of Romania and to raise badly-needed funds. Her first book was entitled {My Country} and in it she charmingly described the Romanian peasants and gypsies. <span data-pg='39'></span>

	During this terrible ordeal, three-year old Mircea succumbed to typhoid fever on 2 November 1916, the first in a long series of personal tragedies of the 40-year old Queen. The royal family was evacuated almost immediately from Bucharest to Iasi where it was felt they would be safer. The government followed to the northern city shortly thereafter. Queen Marie communicated regularly with her cousins King George V and Czar Nicholas II to try to get England and Russia to uphold their commitments to Romania, agreed upon to encourage the Romanians to join the Entente. Queen Marie's hope in the future was deeply shaken when she learned that Czar Nicholas, prompted by strikes and riots of a bitter and angry population, abdicated on his and his son Alexis's behalf on 15 March 1917. A provisional government took over in Petrograd and it was discovered that the Russians were plotting to imprison or kill King Ferdinand and Queen Marie in May.

	Fearing similar discontent in Romania, King Ferdinand signed a proclamation in the spring of 1917 by which the Romanian peasants, who made up a huge proportion of the population, were to receive land and greater rights in the affairs of state.

	The French General Henri Berthelot arrived in Romania to assist with the reform of its army. At the same time Queen Marie was offered asylum by her English cousins, which she preferred to refuse. She appears to have understood very well her duty as sovereign and the extreme personal danger from plots, starvation and other war-time threats to her and her family did not deter her from this serious commitment. She informed her mother that she and her husband were 'attached to [their] country in a way not often given to sovereigns'.[8] Despite French intervention, Romania felt forced to surrender to Germany as three-quarters of the country's territory had fallen into enemy hands. Romania's population was decreased by one-tenth, with 360,000 military and almost an equal number of civilian casualties by 1918.
.......... [8. Unpublished letter of Queen Marie to her mother, 12 January 1918, Romanian State Archives: V, 2733/1918. <span data-pg='40'></span>

	On 15 September 1918 Marie's family troubles took a turn for the worse when her eldest son Carol eloped with a Romanian, Ioana Marie Valentine (Zizi) Lambrino. The King and Queen did not approve of this marriage. The constitution which had come into effect during Carol I's reign stipulated that no male member of the dynasty could marry a Romanian. What troubled Queen Marie more than anything was the fact that Carol had not confided in her his intentions. Carol tried to defy his parents and made an unsuccessful attempt at renouncing the throne so as to be allowed to remain married to Zizi and leave the country. A separation from his wife, arranged by his parents, and an annulment of their marriage soon wore down Carol's resistance, despite the birth of his son Carol Mircea on 8 January 1920. To further distance Carol from his wife and child, he was sent away on a world tour at the end of which he was introduced to the sister of Crown Prince George of Greece, who was engaged to be married to Queen Marie's eldest daughter Elisabetha. Princess Helen of Greece married the Romanian Crown Prince several weeks after her brother's wedding in Athens in early 1921.

	Fortunately Romania's fate began to improve as Allied troops arrived at the Danube on 9 November 1918 and the Romanian army was finally able to mobilize. Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany abdicated and Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. Queen Marie received the 'Croix de Guerre' from the French Minister in Iasi for her outstanding work.

	Peace negotiations began in Paris to settle all territorial matters of the countries involved in World War I. The poor results of Romania's negotiators soon made it apparent that there was a need for additional assistance. Queen Marie was asked in early 1919 to go to France to unofficially plead her country's case. She had developed an ability to gain support and sympathy for Romania and it is fairly certain that the country would not have had its present territorial expanse <span data-pg='41'></span> without the Queen's intervention. Queen Marie managed well to convey to the French and the British her sincere love for Romania and its needs, although she failed to impress US President Wilson. Her encouraging assistance to Romania's negotiators eventually led to their winning their demands of all of Transylvania, nearly all of Bukovina, Bessarabia, the southern Dobrogea and two-thirds of the Banat area. The country more than doubled and its population increased by more than 100 per cent, making it the fifth largest country in Europe that year, after France, Spain, Germany and Poland. However, Queen Marie's accomplishments in Paris have been obliterated from historical records, and although her efforts were unofficial, it is unfortunate that posterity accords her no credit.

	During that same visit Queen Marie met Loie Fuller, an American dancer who had made a name for herself at the Folies Bergeres in Paris. Their friendship was much criticized, particularly since it was felt improper for a queen to befriend a dancer and because Loie Fuller seemed to get herself into financial difficulties from time to time. There is ample evidence that Queen Marie maintained a faithful correspondence with the dancer, whom she considered to be a steadfast friend.

	On becoming King of Romania, Ferdinand was obliged by the constitution to bring up his offspring in the Romanian Orthodox faith. When his first child was christened in the Orthodox Church, King Ferdinand was refused communion by the Catholic Church for this action, a punishment which lasted 20 years. Perhaps ironically, it was to this very church that he was so devoted all his life. Queen Marie testified on several occasions to her own frustration at the different religious affiliations in her family and occasional frictions caused her to lament in her diaries the absurdity of this intolerance.

	A further important political alliance was fostered with the marriage of Princess Mignon to King Alexander of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in June 1921. It <span data-pg='42'></span> was following this union that Queen Marie became known as the mother-in-law of the Balkans.

	Great joy was manifested by all on the birth of the heir to the Romanian throne on 25 October 1921. The son of Prince Carol and Princess Helen was named Mihai (Michael in English) and was said to have been the only joy shared by his parents. Their relationship became more and more strained for a variety of reasons, including Helen's regular and prolonged absences from Romania. Princess Helen's parents had been exiled from Greece and she repeatedly claimed her companionship was vital to the Greek .Queen's survival. Carol's frustration at being left alone led him to find companionship elsewhere and it was not long before he met the woman with whom he was to spend the rest of his life, Elena Lupescu, a Romanian woman of Jewish descent.

	On 15 October 1922 King Ferdinand and Queen Marie were crowned in a ceremony in Alba Iulia as sovereigns of Greater Romania. Although the country had vastly increased in size and population owing to the peace negotiations in Paris, Romania was plagued by considerable unrest, as were its neighbouring countries. Unwise and unconcerned politicians further aggravated the discontent of vast numbers of the population.

	As King Ferdinand's health began to deteriorate owing to various afflictions, he had to deal with the sorrow caused by his son Carol's separation from Helen. Carol used an official visit to London for the funeral of Queen Alexandra, widow of Edward VII, to once again abandon his family and country. He met up with Elena Lupescu in Paris in 1926 and immediately informed his parents that he was renouncing the throne. Efforts to make him see reason were of no avail and King Ferdinand was this time forced to accept the .renunciation. The parliament ratified the succession and anti-royalists were quick to use the propaganda to their own ends. great sadness overwhelmed King Ferdinand and Queen Marie at their son's defection.

1926

	It was at this time of Queen Marie's great distress that the American Baha'i teacher and journalist Martha L. Root wrote on 22 September 1925 to inform Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, that she was '[planning] to go also to Bucharest'[1] after a month's visit to Budapest. She arrived in Romania at the end of January and wrote to her dear friend Ella Cooper on 19 February 1926:
.......... [1. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 22 September 1925, International Baha'i Archives.]

[.]
[.//]
.......... Next Bukarest, the Amer. Minister said I could not see the Queen Marie of Romania, but I wrote her a letter & sent her 'Abdu'l-Baha's picture and Dr Esslemont's book [{Baha'u'llah and the New Era}].[2]
.......... [2. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Ella Goodall Cooper, 19 February 1926, National Baha'i Archives, Wilmette: Ella G. Cooper Papers.]
[.///]
[.]

	Martha's tireless efforts to make known to all the Faith of Baha'u'llah extended also to kings and rulers of the countries she visited in every continent of the world. From Bucharest Martha Root informed Shoghi Effendi, on 25 January 1926, of her intention to seek out the Romanian Queen:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Here I hope to meet the Queen of Rumania, and give her the Message. Anyway I can meet the principal Lady in Waiting to Her Majesty and tell her about the Teachings. This Lady in Waiting who has promised to receive me is ill in bed these few days & I telephone each day to see when I am to go.[3]
.......... [3. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 25 January 1926, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	While waiting for an opportunity to meet the Queen, or at least her Lady in Waiting, Martha kept herself busy in Bucharest as she told Shoghi Effendi in that same letter: <span data-pg='44'></span>

[.]
[.//]
.......... The first day I came a great Princess, Princess CANTACUZINO invited me to her home. I met her through the American Minister and Consul, and she has given me splendid letters of introduction to other great people. I put 'God's Heroes' into Bukarest University Library. The Minister of Foreign Affairs may arrange for me to lecture Sat. evening in the Fundatia Universitara Carol I. lecture hall. I can speak on the Principles but not on the history. Am speaking in a near by city Wednes. eve. Spoke yesterday before Theosophists in P.M. & before the Esperantists in the evening, fine audiences & some were very interested. Am speaking each evening this week and will leave Monday for Sofia ...[4]
.......... [4. ibid.]
[.///]
[.]

	A day later, on 26 January 1926, Martha Root wrote again to Shoghi Effendi of her plans to move on but still kept alive the hope of a direct or indirect encounter with Queen Marie:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I shall leave here Feb. first or second or third, [as] soon as I can have [an] interview with the Lady of Waiting to the Queen of Rumania, she had promised to see me, but she has grippe these days, of course I should be very happy if I can meet the Queen, but if I cannot this Lady in Waiting will convey to her my messages and Baha'i books... I am speaking each day or evening in Bukarest, everything is going just like a miracle.[5]

	In a letter of 19 February 1926 to Ella Cooper, Martha Root explained that her prayers had been answered and her wish granted as she was to meet the Queen at Cotroceni Palace on 30 January 1926: 'Next day came a letter from the Palace inviting me to visit her the next day at noon.'[6]
.......... [6. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Ella Goodall Cooper, 19 February 1926, National Baha'i Archives, Wilmette: Ella G. Cooper Papers.]
[.///]
[.]

	Martha Root detailed this historic reception in a written testimony entitled 'Her Majesty, Queen Marie of Rumania', first published in {The Baha'i Magazine, Star of the West} in June 1926:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Having written to her Majesty, Queen Marie of Rumania, sending with the little note the book, 'Baha'u'llah and The New Era', an invitation came from the Royal Palace that she would see the writer the next morning at twelve o'clock. It was a precious letter, for the Queen was not receiving any one because she was in personal sorrow in those days of <span data-pg='45'></span> January fifteen to February first, 1926, when the writer was in Bucharest.

.......... The palace was not the one in the centre of the city which is used more for state functions, but another great palace farther out, a distance of one half hour by carriage. No need to ask, next morning, if this is the right direction: the hundreds of automobilists, diplomats, military officers, horseback riders, tradesmen and drivers of ox-carts formed two great colourful, interesting processions, one going each way. It looked as if all roads in the Balkan lands must be leading to this Rumanian King and Queen's Palace, much the same as the mighty Danube River after touching many lands chooses Rumania in which to seek the sea.

.......... In the distance one sees the splendidly wooded grounds of the palace. They are like a winter fairyland, enchanting with light snow and icicles half-revealing, half-concealing their forest greens. Soon one reaches the great gates where officers in fine uniforms stand at attention, and others are stationed down the winding road leading to the porte-cochere. One and all when they see the letter, bow, then motion the coachman forward. So everything went easily, just like a shadow moving round and losing itself in the noonday sun. The palace was one of those art creations so satisfying to the eye in colour, form and proportion. As one approaches, one sees that it is not going to be necessary to ring a bell to enter a Queen's home. Men in stately livery assist one, their eyes are kindly, and instantly one feels that a regal atmosphere is also an inner something indescribably extraordinary as well as gorgeous externally. The butler with almost Gladstonian manners shows the way up a wide circular stairway to a drawing room. He informs a Lady in Waiting who comes at once. She is a young woman very pleasing, and she has her knitting, a scarf, in one hand. She smiles and greets me and says that Her Majesty, the Queen, will receive me. Passing down the wide halls hung with art treasures we enter an immense music room where flowers, tapestries, cloissoneres seem vibrant with beauty and perfectly blended.

.......... However, one gives them hardly a glance, for one feels the presence and sees in the distance a most beautiful woman emerging through the portieres. The Lady in Waiting whispers <span data-pg='46'></span> so low that it is like a breath, 'Her Majesty', and then disappears, softly closing the doors behind me.

.......... Queen Marie of Rumania comes quickly forward, smiling her welcome. How beautiful she is! She looks like a flower herself, in her blue silk morning dress with gold low shoes and hose. One can understand how all love and adore their Queen, for she possesses beauty and charm of mind and manners, while from her grave blue eyes flashes the light of a great spirit; she knows, she understands, she loves! The meeting that morning was very simple, very great, the visitor felt the Queen's friendliness.

.......... Sitting down together by the table, Her Majesty expressed thanks for the book, 'Baha'u'llah And The New Era', and said that she was reading it with deep interest. She remarked how people's lives differ: some can be like apostles and travel over the whole world to spread divine Teachings, others perhaps have the task of King or Queen whose responsibility is to bring a country and its people to the highest development possible. She showed how a King and Queen are the supreme court of justice when all else has failed; when justice has not been found anywhere else, theirs is an ear that can still listen, a hand that can still give, a heart that can still pardon.

.......... Her Majesty proved how awake a Queen must be, always watchful, always ready. She must never avow herself tired, never admit that she is at the end of her tether. There must never be any hour of the day or night when the one in need cannot come to her.

.......... Later the conversation turned to religion. Her Majesty expressed herself that every good part in every religion should be respected, that it is not form but the spirit which is to be considered. She said: 'I myself am a Protestant; my husband is Catholic and the children are orthodox. We have always had perfect understanding, each has respected the other's religion. No one ever tried to make me anything except a Protestant, and the people have always found me broad toward other religions. I have never been able to understand this spirit of intolerance and I am astonished at the degree of love that is wasted. If people would only turn to good all their knowledge, their heart, their intelligence!'

.......... Then Her Majesty emphasized how the ills of the world would be so much less, if only people would never put them <span data-pg='47'></span> into words. 'For instance,' she said, 'young people go out full of confidence, skirting a danger perhaps not bad to them, and which perhaps would not lead to bad if the people around them did not fan this thought. No one wishes to be bad. The reason I am so much in sympathy with your Baha'i Teachings is because It is the good influence which the young should find instead of the bad. The bad is so much more frequently emphasized, that the good often goes under. Sometimes I am accused of not speaking loud enough in indignation against the evils, but life is so full of pitfalls and temptations! I assure you that any one can come to me and confess his wrong and I will try to help him out of it. All work, all ambition, all thought should be constructive instead of destroying.'

.......... Her Majesty, in speaking of her own life, said that no matter how hard hit she was, she always took it as something necessary to her own final completely unselfish self. One saw her big universal outlook, her courage in dark hours, for at the moment when the writer saw her, she had just been going through a great personal grief.

.......... Several questions were asked by Her Majesty concerning the Baha'i Movement for world peace. She was interested in all the Principles and in the teachings for the inner progress of the soul.

.......... Seeing the writer's Esperanto pin she asked about the progress of Esperanto in the different lands. It was explained that the five-pointed star stands for the light to the five continents. The white background is the colour of peace; the green is the Esperanto colour of hope and the word 'Esperanto' means 'one who hopes'. The little star was presented to Her Majesty and she is wearing it. She was delighted to hear that a new clubhouse has just been presented to the Esperantists of Bucharest by Mr Henry Fisher, one of the great promoters of Esperanto in Europe. She also said: 'Esperanto has my greatest sympathy, and although I am so busy I do hope I shall have time to study Esperanto.' She was greatly interested in all plans for the Eighteenth Universal Esperanto Congress which is to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland the first week in August. Her Majesty, before her marriage was the Princess of Edinburgh.

.......... Speaking of the Universal Educational Congress which was held in San Francisco in 1923, and in Edinburgh, Scotland in <span data-pg='48'></span> 1925, Her Majesty said she hopes that this Congress will convene, sometime, in Bucharest and that she will herself, come to the sessions.

.......... Her Majesty, Queen Marie of Rumania is an author and some of her works have been translated into Esperanto. She has great capacity and works very hard to promote many universal movements for the better understanding of the nations and the welfare of humanity. The week the writer was there she gave her patronage and much help to the formation and first brilliant meeting of 'The Society of the Friends of the United States in Rumania', The object of this society is to perpetuate the existing friendship between the people of Rumania and the United States through a study of the English language, American history, literature, art, science; to facilitate exchanges of scholars of both countries; to invite and receive officially American visitors desiring to know Rumania better. The speakers were Professor Leon Feraru of Columbia University, New York, who is the Chairman of the Literary Committee of 'The Society of Friends of Rumania in New York'; American Ambassador to Rumania, Mr W. S. Culbertson and Princess Cantacuzene, Vice President of the International Council of Women. Professor Feraru said there were six hundred thousand Rumanians in America; Mr Nicholas Lupu, Leader of the Peasant Party, another speaker said, 'America is not bound by a treaty with Rumania, but she is bound by her ideal of justice, stronger than any treaty, and according to her ideal she cannot do us any injustice.'

.......... The world admires Her Majesty, Queen Marie, because she is
so daring and so enthusiastic in all that she undertakes. She interests herself in all international movements based upon broad and universal principles of right and justice. When the writer said good-bye to this great-hearted, wise, beautiful Queen and gave her Baha'u'llah's, 'Seven Valleys', a wonderful little book which shows how the spirit can progress through seven stages to perfect freedom, she went away. She too, carried a gift from Her Majesty--a lovely new ideal of queen-womanhood. It had been a most happy hour. Riding back through the winter beauty, she remembered a curious saying of the Rumanian peasants, 'Perhaps the time of afterwards has come!' IT HAS COME! Though one can hardly vision it with <span data-pg='49'></span> earthbent eyes, those thousand years of peace foretold in the Bibles of the world are to begin in this century![7]

	As had become her daily habit since childhood, Queen Marie recorded for posterity the important happenings in her life. Her first encounter with the Baha'i Faith through its valiant promoter Martha Root was duly noted that very day in her diary:

[.]
[.//]
Sunday Jan 30th 1926
Cotroceni

.......... Real thaw today which makes everything look dull and ugly. Received a kind modest little American a Miss Root who goes about trying to spread good will amongst nations. She is a great upholder of 'Esperanto' believing that a universal language learnt by all would promote .good feeling and understanding amongst all Nations and there is certainly something in the idea.

.......... Curiously enough she is interested in the same teaching as Roxo [Weingartner] and has brought me the very book Roxo always , keeps near her bed with the teachings of a certain Baha'u'llah now dead but who was one of the wise ones of this earth. She seemed terribly moved by our grief about Carol and liked to believe that there was some devine [sic] trial in it which would ultimately turn out for the good of all of us even of the Prodigal Son.[8]
.......... [8. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished diary entry 30 January 1926, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Of particular importance is the fact that after reading just part of J. E. Esslemont's introduction to the Baha'i history and its teachings, {Baha'u'llah and the New Era}, and her relatively short meeting with Martha Root, Queen Marie admitted privately to her diary her understanding of Baha'u'llah's special station. It must be remembered that although it is almost certain that Queen Marie foresaw the eventual publication of part or all of her diaries, what she recorded was initially intended for her own personal benefit and record. From a reading of her diaries kept over a period of nearly 12 years, it is clear that her Journal was her confidante, the silent and uncritical witness of the Queen's most cherished moments her most private thoughts, her fears, her sorrows and all things that rejoiced or burdened her heart. Such assessment of <span data-pg='50'></span> one's daily life also happens to be in keeping with an ordinance of Baha'u'llah:

[.]
[.//]
.......... O Son of Being! Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to a reckoning; for death, unheralded, shall come upon thee and thou shalt be called to give account for thy deeds.[9]
.......... [9. Baha'u'llah, {Hidden Words}, Arabic no. 31.]
[.///]
[.]

	Queen Marie had begun keeping her diary from a very early age, long before she encountered the Baha'i Faith, but a natural inclination to 'bring [herself] to account each day', as enjoined by Baha'u'llah, no doubt helped her greatly throughout her life.

	Interestingly, Queen Marie grasped at once one of the great features of the Baha'i Faith: true religious tolerance. Linked in this most recent divine Revelation to the concept expounded by Baha'u'llah of revelation as something progressive, its appeal to the Queen was obvious from her later public statements on the subject and also from her comment to Martha Root during their first meeting about the understanding reached in her family. She described it as having successfully assembled three different Christian denominations: Anglicanism, Roman Catholicism and Romanian Orthodoxy. Queen Marie had had early experience of religious diversity in her childhood. Her mother was Russian Orthodox, and although she had a strong allegiance to her family's traditional religion, she had had to consent to her children being raised as Anglicans, the faith of the British royal family. The family's move to Germany provided the Duchess of Coburg with an opportunity to have her children confirmed in the German Protestant Church, which she preferred to the Anglican Church.

	During their meeting Martha also managed to explain to Queen Marie the Baha'i attitude towards tests and difficulties in order to help her understand that the grief the royal family was experiencing over Carol's behaviour could yield valuable lessons for all. These words of 'Abdu'l-Baha would surely have touched Queen Marie's heart as they not only explain <span data-pg='51'></span> grief and suffering but do so in language particularly appealing to her love of nature:

[.]
[.//]
.......... While a man is happy, he may forget God; but when grief comes and sorrows overwhelm him, then will he remember his Father who is in Heaven, and who is able to deliver him from his humiliations.

.......... Men who suffer not, attain no perfection. The plant most pruned by the gardeners is that one which, when the summer comes, will have the most beautiful blossoms and the most abundant fruit.

.......... The labourer cuts up the earth with his plough, and from that earth comes the rich and plentiful harvest. The more a man is chastened, the greater is the harvest of spiritual virtues shown forth by him. A soldier is no good General until he has been in the front of the fiercest battle and has received the deepest wounds.[10]

	In a letter to Ella Cooper dated 19 February 1926, Martha Root further clarified certain details of her meeting with Queen Marie:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Next to my visit to the Greatest Holy Leaf, this visit to Queen Marie was one of the most splendid events of my life. I took her the Greatest Name and 'Seven Valleys'--and two Esperanto books and my Esperanto pin, a little bottle of perfume, a little box of candy, a branch of white lilies, and a report of the Education Congress in Edinburgh (She was the Princess of Edinburgh before her marriage). She asked me to tell her about the Bahai Movement & said she had been reading the book I sent and was very interested in the Principles. (She gave me the address of a dear friend of hers in Vienna whom I am to call upon).[11] She asked a number of questions. I love her and felt more at home with her than with many other people who are not queens--I learned a great deal from her too. It was such a happy visit, she was so sweet and gracious--she held the Greatest Name and Shoghi Effendi's picture in her hands while we talked--for most of the hour. I feel I can write & send her books or news. If you would care to send her some Bahai books her address is

Queen Marie of Rumania
Bukarest, Rumania <span data-pg='52'></span>

.......... You might send her the little book about your mother's visit to Haifa and Akka, also Hidden Words & Divine Philosophy-≠or any ones you wish. If you wish, you could say that I asked you please, to send the one about your visit. Please 'feed her' Ella, for she is a searching soul.

.......... I was in the homes of the Ladies in Waiting, one had visited Persia 20 yrs. ago as a girl & had heard about the Babis. I gave her some books. Was in the home of Princess Cantozene, Vice Pres. of the Internat. Council of Women (Lady Aberdeen is Pres.) the Minister of Foreign Affairs invited me to speak in Foundation Carol University at a public lecture for 200 (?) people, but I couldn't wait over another week & I said to the Queen that perhaps she would give a lecture on the Baha'i Teachings in this University. Ella, I know I did wisely not to rush it too much for there is much orthodoxy and the Queen is broader than many of her subjects. All this is not for publication, I will write about it -just what I think she would like.

.......... Ella, I wore your hat when I called upon the Queen (and the white dress I wore at the Esperanto evening). I have your hat put back now--in the winter sometimes I took the crown (top) off & put it on my little hat, but now I have it back to its original shape & will wear it just as you wore it. I need it more in Central Europe than in the Balkans.[12]

[.]

	As Martha Root stated, it was during this first visit that Queen Marie received from Martha her second Baha'i book, {The Seven Valleys} by Baha'u'llah.

	It appears that Queen Marie told Martha of her friend Roxo Weingartner's interest in the Faith and it is perhaps this friend that Martha referred to in a letter to Shoghi Effendi written from Austria in February 1926:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Today I telephoned the friend of the Queen of Rumania who lives in Vienna & she has invited me to her home Friday--her husband I think is Director of the Grand Opera here. Both I think are interested, but I do not know yet. Queen Marie has written them about the Baha'i Cause & that I am coming to see them.[13]

	In a postscript to this letter Martha added a detail she had omitted from her previous letters to Shoghi Effendi about <span data-pg='53'></span> her first visit with Queen Marie: 'Queen Marie held your picture for an hour while she talked with me.'[14] It is reasonable to assume from this that the Queen was deeply moved by her encounter with the Baha'i Faith. This assumption is further supported by Queen Marie's diary entries over the next few weeks:

.......... Later the Catholic Bishop made restrictions, unbelieving that we really should be able to have our little orthodox chapel in a Catholic building --the Catholics are always against an unity of religions, and the idea that another confession could worship beneath the same roof as they. So against all my conception and my dear Baha'u'llah's teachings. Eternally carrying worldly strife into religion.[16]

	It is clear that Queen Marie found in the teachings of Baha'u'llah an approach which was much more in keeping with her own feelings of tolerance, an attitude illustrated by these words of Baha'u'llah:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship...

.......... They that are endued with sincerity and faithfulness should associate with all the peoples and kindreds of the earth with joy and radiance, inasmuch as consorting with people hath promoted and will continue to promote unity and concord, which in turn are conducive to the maintenance of order in the world and to the regeneration of nations. Blessed are such as hold fast to the cord of kindliness and tender mercy and are free from animosity and hatred.[17]
.......... [17. Baha'u'llah, {Tablets}, pp. 35-6.

Cotroceni

.......... Went to English church with Ileana, but it was what I would, call a poor service. I really pray better at home with my Baha'u'llah books and teaching [sic] which have brought me such a message lately, the message in fact that I have always been waiting for-≠it has become a joy and comfort to me and has at last brought God quite near. For the first time I have felt religion. Every principle of Baha'u'llah is acceptable to me, understandable, of greatest and perfect help. All my hazy desires and thoughts have been suddenly made concrete by this teaching. My who [SIC] soul answers it feels it to be thee [sic] teaching.

.......... I am also giving it to Ileana, for she too is a great searcher and astonishingly open and waiting for truth [18]
.......... [18. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished diary entry 21 February 1926, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Thus within a month and a half of Queen Marie's first encounter with the Baha'i Faith, she was not only studying it regularly but had begun to refer to it in her diary in such possessive terms as 'my dear Baha'u'llah's teachings' and 'my Baha'u'llah books and teaching', stating that it was the 'message in fact that I have always been waiting for', which had become a joy and comfort ... and has at last brought God quite near'. She found 'every principle of Baha'u'llah ... acceptable, understandable, of greatest and perfect help'. Surely if she had found anything about the Baha'i teachings that was in the least objectionable she would not have shared them with her child. Her eagerness to give them to Ileana is further evidence of her complete approval.

	Although she would continue throughout her life to attend church services, she admitted to her diary that since finding the Baha'i Faith she prayed 'better at home' and that her 'hazy desires and thoughts' were 'suddenly made concrete'.

	On 21 February Queen Marie wrote a letter to her friend Loie Fuller in which she made her first known recommendation about the Baha'i Faith and confirmed in very moving terms her personal sentiments:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Lately a great hope has come to me from one, Abdu'l-Baha. I have found in His and in His Father, Baha'u'llah's Message of <span data-pg='55'></span> Faith all my yearning for real religion satisfied. If you ever hear of Baha'is or of the Baha'i Movement which is known in America, you will know what that is, what I mean: these Books have strengthened me beyond belief and I am now ready to die any day full of hope. But I pray God not to take me away yet for I still have a lot of work to do.[19]
.......... [19. Unpublished letter of Queen Marie to Loie Fuller, 21 February 1926.]
[.///]
[.]

	'Abdu'l-Baha explained the work that was to be done by those who had recognized Baha'u'llah:

[.]
[.//]
.......... From amongst all mankind hath He chosen you, and your eyes have been opened to the light of guidance and your ears attuned to the music of the Company above; and blessed by abounding grace, your hearts and souls have been born into new life. Thank ye and praise ye God that the hand of infinite bestowals hath set upon your heads this gem-studded crown, this crown whose lustrous jewels will forever flash and sparkle down all the reaches of time.

.......... To thank Him for this, make ye a noble effort, and choose for yourselves a noble goal. Through the power of faith, obey ye the teachings of God, and let all your actions conform to His laws.[20]
.......... [20. 'Abdu'l-Baha, Selections, p. 35.]
[.///]

	A few days after Queen Marie wrote to Loie Fuller, there is further evidence of her growing attachment to the Baha'i teachings and her incorporation of the daily reading of the Baha'i writings into her busy schedule:

.......... I begin every morning now with the reading of some of Abdu'l≠Baha and Baha'u'llah's teachings and wisdome [sic] it does me a great deal of good, consoles me and makes me think.

	On 24 April 1926, in a letter written on his behalf, Shoghi Effendi acknowledged Martha Root's letters regarding her meeting with Queen Marie:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letters dated January 10, March 29 and 8, April 12 and 6, a letter which was not dated, and a postcard. I consider this a great pleasure because I thereby obtain a chance of reading your letters and informing myself of the splendid work you are doing in Eastern Europe.

.......... As Europe, especially the Eastern section, has suffered a great deal from the last war the people are quite ready and anxious to hear about peace...
[.///]
[.]

	Shoghi Effendi's handwritten addition to this letter reads:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I have read your glowing reports with thankfulness and pride and I continue--nay redouble--my prayers for you that your heart's desire may ere long be fulfilled. I will also remember those with whom you have recently come in contact and trust that Europe may in the not distant future turn ablaze as a result of your unique, memorable and unprecedented services. You have truly endeared yourself to all the Baha'i world and your name whether in the East or in the West evokes the deepest sentiments of admiration, praise and gratitude...

.......... I am thrilled by your account about the Queen!!![23]
.......... [23. Unpublished letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 24 April 1926, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	It is unfortunate that the account referred to by Shoghi Effendi--the first description to him by Martha Root of her meeting with the Romanian Queen--cannot be located.

	Queen Marie rapidly seized the responsibility enjoined upon every seeker after truth by 'Abdu'l-Baha:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...O ye beloved of God, offer up thanks that ye have, in the day of the dawning, turned your faces unto the Light of the World and beheld its splendours. Ye have received a share of the light of truth; ye have enjoyed a portion of those blessings that endure forever; and therefore, as a returning of thanks for this bounty, rest ye not for a moment, sit ye not silent, carry. to men's ears the glad tidings of the Kingdom, spread far and wide the Word of God.[24]
.......... [24. 'Abdu'l-Baha, {Selections}, pp. 33-4.]
[.///]
[.] <span data-pg='57'></span>

	Commissioned by the North American Newspaper Alliance to submit regular articles for syndication, the Queen, spontaneously and unsolicited, decided to write about the Baha'i teachings and to recommend them to her vast readership. Her first open letter appeared in the {Toronto Daily Star} on 4 May 1926.

[.]
[.//]
.......... A woman brought me the other day a Book. I spell it with a capital letter because it is a glorious Book of love and goodness, strength and beauty.

.......... She gave it to me because she had learned I was in grief and sadness and wanted to help... She put it into my hands saying: 'You seem to live up to His teachings.' And when I opened the Book I saw it was the word of Abdu'l-Baha, prophet of love and kindness, and of his father the great teacher of international good-will and understanding--of a religion which links all creeds.

.......... Their writings are a great cry toward peace, reaching beyond all limits of frontiers, above all dissension about rites and dogmas. It is a religion based upon the inner spirit of God, upon that great, not-to-be-overcome verity that God is love, meaning just that. It teaches that all hatreds, intrigues, suspicion, evil words, all aggressive patriotism even, are outside the one essential law of God, and that special beliefs are but surface things whereas the heart that beats with divine love knows no tribe nor race.

.......... It is a wondrous Message that Baha'u'llah and his son Abdu'l≠Baha have given us. They have not set it up aggressively knowing that the germ of eternal truth which lies at its core cannot but take root and spread.

.......... There is only one great verity in it: Love, the mainspring of every energy, tolerance towards each other, desire of under≠standing each other, knowing each other, helping each other, forgiving each other.

.......... It is Christ's Message taken up anew in the same words almost, but adapted to the thousand years and more difference that lies between the year one and today. No man could fail to be better because of this Book.

.......... I commend it to you all. If ever the name of Baha'u'llah or Abdu'l-Baha comes to your attention, do not put their writings <span data-pg='58'></span> from you. Search out their Books, and let their glorious, peace-bringing, love-creating words and lessons sink into your hearts as they have into mine.

.......... One's busy day may seem too full for religion. Or one may have a religion that satisfies. But the teachings of these gentle, wise and kindly men are compatible with all religion, and with no religion.

.......... Seek them, and be the happier.

By Marie, Queen of Romania[25]

[.///]
[.]

	Queen Marie's public acknowledgement of the parallel between the Baha'i message and the earlier one from Christ indicates her immediate grasp of the Baha'i concept of progressive revelation. She explained that the messages are the same but that they are adapted to their time. She bore witness to her audience how her heart was touched by the Baha'i Faith and how it had contributed to her increased happiness in a time of 'grief and sadness'.

	Amatu'l-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum, wife of Shoghi Effendi, makes a very touching comment in her biography The Guardian of the Baha'i Faith relating to Queen Marie's open letter in the Canadian newspaper. It illustrates how deeply this public support by royalty helped the Guardian in his own trying life:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Shoghi Effendi used to remark that out of his sufferings something always seemed to be born. He would go through these ordeals by fire -for indeed he seemed to fairly burn with suffering--and then some rain from heaven, in the form of good news, would shower upon him and help to revive him...

.......... It was at this time, when affliction was literally engulfing the Guardian, that, on May 4th, the 'Toronto Daily Star' published a highly appreciative statement made by Queen Marie of Rumania on the Baha'i Faith, a statement, followed by others during the course of her visit to the United States and Canada, which was printed in about two hundred newspapers and constituted some of the widest and most spectacular publicity the Faith has ever received.[26]
.......... [26. Rabbani, Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, p. 39.] <span data-pg='59'></span>
[.///]
[.]

	In his letter of 29 May 1926 to Martha Root, Shoghi Effendi expressed his sentiments about Queen Marie of Romania's stupendous statement:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The copy of the Queen's appreciation which I enclose is a well-deserved and memorable testimony of your remarkable and exemplary endeavours for the spread of our beloved Cause. It has thrilled me and greatly reinforced my spirit and strength. Yours is a memorable triumph, hardly surpassed in its significance in the annals of the Cause. I have received the paper from Canada, sent to me by Helen Grand whom Lady Blomfield and Mrs Coles know well. I have immediately cabled you care Mr Simpson: '"Toronto Daily Star" of May 4 published magnificent statement by Rumanian Queen on Cause. Your high endeavours gloriously successful. Consult promptly Mountfort Mills care Banktrust Paris on advisability to approach her regarding Jahrum martyrdom. Exert utmost endeavour. Praying fervently for your success. Mailing copy. Boundless gratitude.'

.......... Dearest Martha: I am also enclosing copies of my circulars on the recent vile atrocities in Persia. I feel strongly the necessity for some vigorous action on their behalf. I wish you to consider carefully and prayerfully the advisability of approaching the Queen. I leave all details, if you so decide, to your discretion and your reliance upon Divine Guidance. Do not press the issue if you do not find it feasible. I advise you to consult Mr Mills, Lady Blomfield and others who might help in their advice and assistance. I have, last night, being Ascension night, specially and tenderly remembered you at Baha'u'llah's Shrine and supplicated for you from the bottom of my heart Divine Guidance and Strength. I would greatly appreciate any particulars you can give me about the Queen's 'Book of Love', any references to it in newspapers, reviews, and periodicals and, if it can be secured, a copy of the book itself. I hold myself in readiness to do all I possibly can to assist in this vital and far-reaching task. Your perseverance, your indomitable faith, your heroic courage, your sweet and gentle nature are yielding the promised fruit! Persevere, nay redouble in your efforts and be always assured that my earnest and continued prayers follow you wherever you go.[27]

	How moving was the confidence in Martha expressed by Shoghi Effendi when he wrote: 'I wish you to consider carefully and prayerfully the advisability of approaching the Queen. I leave all details, if you so decide, to your discretion and your reliance upon Divine Guidance. Do not press the issue if you do not find it feasible.' He knew she would use great care and rely on God to guide her in her decision.

	On that same day, Shoghi Effendi wrote to Mountfort Mills:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I trust you have received by now my cable to you regarding Queen Marie's glowing appreciation of the Teachings of the Cause. I felt when I read it a strong impulse to communicate with you and request you to consult Martha on the advisability of approaching her about the persecutions in Persia. I realize the delicacy and the peculiar difficulties of such a work as this. I do not wish you to feel constrained in any way to press the matter unduly. I would also request you to endeavour in every possible way to secure detailed information and the fullest particulars regarding this most astonishing and highly significant event in the progress of the Cause. I wonder whether the whole book treats of the Cause, and what measure of publicity it has had so far in the European press, and particularly in English periodicals.

.......... I feel that with patience, tact, courage and resource we can utilize this development to further the interests, and extend the influence of the Cause. I shall be only too glad to give any assistance I possibly can.[28]

	Queen Marie's remarks in her diary in May 1926 indicate that by now her study of the Baha'i Faith had become part of her daily activities:

.......... [30. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished diary entry 19 May 1926, Romanian State Archives.] <span data-pg='61'></span>
[.///]
[.]

	The Queen chose these quotations from the writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha for the frontispiece of her diary covering the period July, August and the beginning of September 1926:

[.]
[.//]
.......... When man turns his face to God he finds sunshine everywhere. Abdu'l-Baha

.......... Do no harm to anybody; pray for all; try to make your light shine in the world and let your banner fly high in the Heavens. Abdu'l-Baha

.......... God, who sees all our hearts, knows how far our lives are the fulfilment of our words. Abdu'l-Baha[31]
.......... [31. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished, Frontispiece for July, August, beginning of September 1926, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	These quotations are indeed interesting ones to have been chosen. The first describes the absolute necessity of a connection with and commitment to our Creator which in turn sheds upon us the indispensable heat and light of the celestial body, without which all living beings would die. The second is an enjoinder for universal kindness and concern, through intimate communion with our Creator, and a challenge to openly serve Him. The last is a brief and poignant statement of who the real judge of our life's endeavours is.

	Deeply moved by the results of her visit with Queen Marie and the subsequent public testimony, Martha Root wrote to the Queen on 2 June 1926 to thank her personally for these efforts.

To Her Majesty,
Queen Marie of Rumania

My great and beautiful Queen:

.......... From America and Canada I am hearing of your wonderful article about the Teachings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. All over the United States and in Canada they are enthusiastic! You have helped the whole world! You will have a station higher than that of any Queen of this world, for in all the <span data-pg='62'></span> worlds of God you will be honoured and loved because you arose to proclaim the Teaching of this new Day of God.

.......... I received the clipping Saturday and as I read it--those glorious words appeal to the soul and make it thirst to study and know more of the Teachings--I suddenly saw your son and saw your prayers for him answered! I know you will not be disappointed in your boy, that God is hearing you and answers your prayers. You will see, because you have served Baha'u'llah, He will serve you and always you will know in your heart that God is very pleased with you. Your name will go down the ages, you are like the 'mother of the chosen ones', for many great teachers of these new Principles will be those who have heard of Baha'u'llah and His Teachings first from your syndicated article.

.......... Can I serve you in any way, O Queen Marie whom I love so dearly? I can never thank you enough. I expect to reach London June 8 and be in Great Britain five months. I will tell the Esperantists at the 18th Universal Esperanto Congress in Edinburgh (July 31-Aug. 5) what you said about Esperanto. I am not sure whether my article about you is yet published in America, but it will soon be out, perhaps in the June number. If you think of anything more in Great Britain that I can do please give me the suggestion. I am planning to speak before many different societies, see the editors, Esperantists, broadcasting. My address in London is care of American Consul, London. Perhaps I will send you news sometimes of the progress of the Baha'i Movement in different parts of the world.

.......... I always pray the little prayer for your son and always keep thinking how I can help him in some other way.

.......... Always I am your true and grateful friend, O gracious Queen Marie, and always I remember how sweet you are. You are far greater than you know, for as you have served God, He will give you a great station in the spiritual Kingdom. You have influenced millions of souls by your article.

With love and thanks and prayers,
I am,
yours in His Covenant of Love,
Martha L. Root.

	In this letter Martha Root predicted that Queen Marie's 'name will go down the ages'. At present it is extremely dif≠ficult to find recognition or even mention of Queen Marie's contributions and services on behalf of Romania in the annals of European events. However, the absence of such evidence of Queen Marie's involvement and role in history will be brightly reversed as Baha'is in years to come begin to appreciate the great station of this courageous Queen, a station far greater than that which traditional historians might accord. Even now Martha's prediction is being fulfilled throughout the world. Queen Marie is beginning to be known and recognized for the fact that she, in the words of Martha Root, 'arose to proclaim the Teachings of this new Day of God'.

	Queen Marie responded to Martha Root's letter on 8 June 1926 on the back of a picture postcard of herself sitting in a window seat:

What I wrote [for the syndicates] was because my heart overflowed with gratitude for the revelation you brought me. I am happy if you think I helped. I thought it might bring truth nearer, because my words are read by so many. The books of Abdu'l≠Baha are also an immense inspiration to my Ileana. For the moment sad news of my prodigal son--but we must pray with faith and belief that he will come back to himself.

	Here the Queen admitted that she knew her articles were read by many and stated that it was for this reason that she chose to write about these teachings openly.

	This exchange of correspondence between Martha Root and Queen Marie once again brought happiness and relief to the Guardian, as shown in his letter to Martha of 10 July 1926: <span data-pg='64'></span>

[.]
[.//]
.......... Your letters dated June 1, 6, 15th have given me strength, joy and encouragement at a time when I felt depressed, tired and disheartened. I am so gratified to learn that you have directly communicated with the Queen and I am impatiently waiting to hear the result. Do let me know immediately you hear from her, whether directly or indirectly. I have disseminated the glad-tiding of your highly successful interviews with her, and Her Majesty's gracious response, throughout the East, that the oriental believers may be more fully acquainted with the heroic efforts and high courage of one who is destined to contribute so distinct a share to their ultimate deliverance. You have surely achieved a historic mission which will illuminate the annals of our Cause. Do write to me, if you are informed, of the circumstances and manner in which the Queen was moved to write her appeal and broadcast it throughout the world. Is it addressed exclusively to American women, to the American nation or to the world at large? Has she written a book on this subject? Any information you can glean and send to me will be most valuable in the influence it will exert throughout the East.[34]

	During this entire period severe persecution of the Baha'is in Iran caused serious concern and anguish. Shoghi Effendi hoped that some form of intervention by Queen Marie might influence the persecutors to desist from their intolerant and vicious attacks. On 16 July Shoghi Effendi cabled Martha to inform her that the Iranian Baha'is were 'thrilled [and] consoled' to learn of Queen Marie's efforts on behalf of the Faith for which many of their co-religionists had lost their lives and others had been harassed, imprisoned--and tortured.

	Shoghi Effendi regularly informed Martha of the importance of her efforts, as in his letter to her of 17 July 1926. His requests to keep Mountfort Mills apprised of everything concerning her relations with Queen Marie were related to the efforts being made to protect the Baha'is in Iran.

[.]

.......... Your unique services will ever be remembered with pride and gratitude and generations yet unborn will exult in the memory of one who has so energetically, so swiftly and beautifully paved the way for the universal recognition of the Faith of <span data-pg='65'></span> Baha'u'llah. Do write me every particular and detail of your activities, particularly about your relations with the Queen, your correspondence with her, your plans to win her even more effectively to the Cause. I am hoping to write soon a letter to Her Majesty and will send you a copy immediately it is written...

.......... The card sent you by the Queen I shall preserve as a precious reminder of your invincible faith, your high courage, your glorious victory.

	Not only did Shoghi Effendi explain in moving terms to Martha the historical significance of her own actions on behalf of the Cause of Baha'u'llah, he judged the time propitious for establishing direct contact with Queen Marie. And so came the first letter penned by Shoghi Effendi to the Romanian Queen:

[.]
[.//]
July 28th. 1926

To her Majesty
Queen Marie of Rumania:

Your gracious Majesty:

.......... As one of the humble followers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah upon whose youthful shoulders have fallen the responsibilities of His mighty Cause, may I venture to approach your Majesty and express in the name of the Baha'is of both the East and the West our feelings of joyous admiration and boundless gratitude for the queenly tribute which your Majesty has paid to the beauty and nobility of the Baha'i teachings.

.......... To my dear fellow-workers in Persia, particularly--the down≠trodden victims of relentless religious fanaticism--your Majesty's eloquent testimony to the potency of the message they bear has been of immense significance and will certainly prove a great relief. Broadcast at the very time when they were just emerging from one of those severe trials which periodically afflict them, your soul-stirring message has been to them a most welcome consolation as well as an abiding assurance of ultimate deliverance and victory. They rejoice to observe that <span data-pg='66'></span> the sufferings borne so long and so heroically by the Bab, by Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, and the unspeakable atrocities which unnumbered martyrs of the Faith have silently and patiently endured, are but beginning to yield their promised fruit. They cannot but wonder and feel truly grateful at the thought that the call to Universal Peace and Brotherhood so clearly voiced by Baha'u'llah, yet so cruelly ignored, nay stifled, for over eighty years by their own fellow-countrymen, has at last found in the heart of an honoured and beloved Queen a warm and ready response.

.......... My dearly-beloved brethren of the East and the West, whose one object in life is to promote and in some measure to establish the sublime Principles proclaimed by Baha'u'llah, are convinced that the moving appeal penned by your Majesty will prove of incalculable benefit to the Cause so dear to their hearts. They recall with profound emotion the explicit promise of Baha'u'llah to every Sovereign that rises to summon the multitude to the Message He has given to the world, and they feel confident that the unfailing grace of the Almighty will be abundantly showered upon the eminent advocate of so noble a Cause.

.......... And in conclusion, may I convey to your Majesty on behalf of the family of 'Abdu'l-Baha and myself the expression of our profound and heartfelt sympathy in the sorrows that have recently weighed so heavily upon you. Your beautiful and spontaneous appreciation of our beloved Cause, the memory of which we shall preserve and cherish, has forged a link of abiding affection and fellowship that will unite our hearts. We earnestly pray that this darkening cloud may soon pass away and yield to the sunshine of a joyous reunion.
With deepest and truest love,

	Perhaps knowledge of death and other forms of persecution for association with the Baha'i Faith would have frightened some into silence but Queen Marie was not known to be fearful. Upon receipt of Shoghi Effendi's letter Queen Marie replied to the Guardian in a way that leaves no doubt about <span data-pg='67'></span> her appreciation of the Baha'i Faith and her personal commitment and initiative to spread the message to her friends as well as to a wider audience:

.......... Indeed a great light came to me with the message of Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha. It came as all great messages come at an hour of dire grief and inner conflict and distress, so the seed sank deeply.

.......... My youngest daughter finds also great strength and comfort in the teachings of the beloved masters.

.......... We pass on the message from mouth to mouth and all those we give it to see a light suddenly lighting before them and much that was obscure and perplexing becomes simple, luminous and full of hope as never before.

.......... That my open letter was a balm to those suffering for the cause, is indeed a great happiness to me, and I take it as a sign that God accepted my humble tribute.

.......... The occasion given me to be able to express myself publicly, was also His Work, for indeed it was a chain of circumstances of which each link led me unwittingly one step further, till suddenly all was clear before my eyes and I understood why it had been.

.......... Thus does He lead us finally to our ultimate destiny.

.......... Some of those of my cast wonder at and disapprove my courage to step forward pronouncing words not habitual for Crowned Heads to pronounce, but I advance by an inner urge I cannot resist.

.......... With bowed head I recognize that I too am but an instrument in greater Hands and rejoice in the knowledge.

.......... Little by little the veil is lifting, grief tore it in two. And grief was also a step leading me ever nearer truth, therefore do I not cry out against grief!

.......... May you and those beneath your guidance be blessed and upheld by the sacred Strength of those gone before you.

.......... Marie[37]

	In but one audience with Martha Root, Queen Marie had recognized the station and role of the Guardian of the Baha'i <span data-pg='68'></span> Faith. The tone of her letter to Shoghi Effendi is both dignified and humble.

	From this letter it is clear that Queen Marie understood intuitively that having heard the message of Baha'u'llah she now had her own role. She recognized that her actions on behalf of the Baha'i Faith were linked to God's approval of her. She knew full well, as mentioned in her letter, that those around her did not approve of her promotion of this Faith but she felt that such a great mission was divinely inspired and far beyond personal choice. She immediately began to spread the teachings without having been asked to do so and considered herself 'an instrument in greater Hands'. Baha'u'llah described so beautifully this role which Queen Marie instinctively assumed, gleaned from her study of the latest message from God which had spurred her on 'by an irresistible inner urge':

[.]
[.//]
.......... The Book of God is wide open, and His Word is summoning mankind unto Him. No more than a mere handful, however, hath been found willing to cleave to His Cause, or to become the instruments for its promotion. These few have been endued with the Divine Elixir that can, alone, transmute into purest gold the dross of the world, and have been empowered to administer the infallible remedy for all the ills that afflict the children of men. No man can obtain everlasting life, unless he embraceth the truth of this inestimable, this wondrous, and sublime Revelation.[38]
.......... [38. Baha'u'llah, {Gleanings}, p. 183.]
[.///]
[.]

	Queen Marie had immediately become such an instrument for the promotion of God's Cause, despite her disapproving entourage. She was fortunate and happy that her youngest daughter Ileana shared her interest in these teachings.

	In August 1926 Martha informed Shoghi Effendi that she had extended to the Queen an invitation to address the Congress participants in Pennsylvania about the Baha'i Faith, as the Queen was expected to visit the United States: 'I telegraphed Her Majesty Queen Marie about the Sesquicentennial in Philadelphia & expect to hear from her this week.'[39]

	Martha responded to Queen Marie's telegram on 26 August, explaining in great detail how much the Queen's public recognition assisted both the spread of the Baha'i Faith and the efforts to aid the persecuted Baha'is in Iran:

[.]
[.//]
Care American Consul,
London, England.
August 26, 1926.

To Her Majesty, Queen Marie, of Roumania,
Bucharest.

Most beloved Queen:

.......... Tenderest love to you, your Majesty, Queen Marie, of Roumania. I am always thinking of you and loving you and praying for you. I pray about your journey to America, for God's First Choice for you. You are the greatest queen in all the worlds of God, because you have sent forth the call for the new, divine civilization, and many millions are becoming interested. Even you, although you are all-conscious, and so great a Queen, will never realize--no human being can--how great is this service to the souls who are suffering.

.......... Your article sent such a thrill through the hearts of the millions and more Persian Baha'is, in their persecutions, their martyrdoms, it meant everything to hear that a Queen had written of these wonderful peace principles. It gave them a new hope and it did a definite something towards the religious freedom of Persia. Undoubtedly your writing has influenced <span data-pg='70'></span> other governments. The Netherlands government recognized my letter to the Queen and I received a reply through the Minister of Foreign Affairs. President Masaryk, of the Czechoslovak Republic sent me a letter that the matter of the Persian persecutions had been put before the Foreign Minister (His Librarian asked about the books on the Baha'i Movement, which I had ordered from New York and which he said had not yet arrived, and asked for more details that he could trace them.) Prince Arfa, Persian delegate to the League of Nations, at Geneva, wrote me that your article and the letter and all the other data I sent and his own letter, had brought a response from Persia that the offenders in those last martyrdoms would be punished.

.......... Perhaps I should make it very clear to you that the only thing I sent to the other Governments was the clipping from the newspaper of your article, and the clipping from the London papers about the persecutions, and my letter calling their attention to the martyrdoms. I thought you would be interested to know that these other Governments had responded.

.......... Precious Queen Marie, your marvellous telegram of greeting was so beautiful I send you a thousand thanks. Your wonderful message will make them very happy, although they will be deeply disappointed that you could not come. I cable it on to them at once. It was so gracious of you to send this lovely message. Because you have so whole-heartedly spoken of this Message for this New Day God will bespeak for you the blessings of this world and of all the worlds of God.

.......... Lady Blomfield, in London, is arranging a great World Unity Conference for the World's Supreme Peace, September twenty-seven in Caxton Hall. Would you permit me, please to read the same telegram or a similar one, at her Congress? It would mean so much. (She knows the wife of the Roumanian Minister here). Lady Blomfield has invited Sir Bose the scientist to speak, and also there will be one Jew, one Christian, etc. Each speaker will tell the aims of his religion for the Supreme Peace. If you should be in London and could speak--it seems too good to be true. I can never, never thank you enough for your article and telegram, your sympathy and co-operation. In my corner of the world each day I am praying for you and yours most faithfully. I love you, most Sweet Queen, and <span data-pg='71'></span> because you have served Baha'u'llah I pray to serve you in this world and in every world of God.

.......... I hope His Majesty, the King, is better. I never forget to pray the prayer for your son and I feel sure your prayers for him will be answered. Shoghi Effendi prays for you each day and for all your loved ones. He is so appreciative of your beautiful spirit and your stupendous work for the Cause of Baha'u'llah. I am always longing for the time when you and Shoghi Effendi will meet each other.

With the deepest, truest love to you, dearest Queen Marie, I am,
Yours most humbly in His Covenant,

	On 24 August 1926 Martha was able to provide Shoghi Effendi with the detailed information he had requested in his letter to her of 10 July:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Now about Her Majesty, Queen Marie, she writes for an American syndicate and this article which she wrote about the Baha'i Cause was sent to this American syndicate and appeared on the same day in more than 200 newspapers in the United States and Canada, of course in the very best newspapers, in New York, Boston, Chicago, California, etc., etc. It has been copied by many other papers in many parts of the world--it has been broadcast by radio and many Baha'is, just as I did, had several hundred copies mimeographed to give out. Roy Wilhelm also had many mimeographed, and he bought papers from different cities, as many as he could. It is a universal message addressed to the world at large and not just to the United States.

.......... As to Her Majesty going to the United States, as I keep reading the papers I fear she is not going to be able to get there. Her Government does not wish it; also the King is not well. Possibly if she cannot go to the United States she might come to London. I will try to keep in touch with her. I do not write very often, but each letter I have sent she has replied to it. I think it is beautiful that her daughter Ileana, seventeen years old, is studying Baha'u'llah's teachings so deeply. I will pray <span data-pg='72'></span> about it, dearest Shoghi Effendi, and if a few months later she does not go to America or comes to London perhaps Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha will show us whether it would be wise for me to try to meet her again. I have been thinking a good deal about this. Would you please pray about it Shoghi Effendi, dearest? She will influence many countries and the whole world...

.......... After Danzig I expect to go down through Russia and then it would certainly be very easy to go to see Her Majesty, Queen Marie. But I have a feeling possibly a door may open to see her sooner...

.......... A Baha'i girl, Miss Marcie Pope Robinson gave a wonderful radio talk in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.A. (a large city) about Queen Marie's article--giving it in full. She also wrote an excellent article on the persecutions. Also an excellent article about Queen Marie. I think it is wise to send these clippings all to Her Majesty, Queen Marie of Rumania (instead of sending them to you.)[42]
.......... [42. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 24 August 1926, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]

	On 27 August 1926 Queen Marie wrote to her friend Roxo Weingartner, referring to an enclosed letter. This appears to be the letter she had received from Shoghi Effendi dated 28 July:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I am enclosing a letter that will interest you--when read will you send it me back. Amongst the Queen's Counsels, I once wrote of the wonderful message of Abdu'l-Baha that had come to me at an hour of grief--this gave the Baha'is tremendous joy, they consider it as a sign that the great of this world are opening their ears to truth, but the letter speaks for itself. Of course I never thought whilst writing that small little article that it would be read by so many.

.......... But I am pleased though that my words were a consolation to those oppressed.[43]
.......... [43. Unpublished letter of Queen Marie to Roxo Weingartner, 27 August 1926.]
[.///]
[.]

	Although the last sentence of the first paragraph appears to contradict the statement in her letter of 8 June 1926 to Shoghi Effendi that 'her words are read by so many', it is more likely that she was surprised to learn what a powerful and widespread impact her statement had made. <span data-pg='73'></span>

	Shoghi Effendi kept Martha Root constantly apprised of his actions concerning Queen Marie, as shown in his letter to her of 30 August 1926: 'I am enclosing a copy of my letter to the Queen. Do not share its contents with anyone.'[44]
.......... [44. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 30 August 1926, International Baha'i Archives.]

	A month later, on 23 September 1926, the Guardian also forwarded to Martha Root a copy of the Queen's response to his letter. Shoghi Effendi's covering letter described in moving terms the importance to him of Queen Marie's testimony and his request to Martha to share it very selectively demonstrates his full understanding of the difficulties the Queen might face as a result of her outspokenness.

[.]
[.//]
.......... I am glad to share with you the contents of the Queen of Rumania's answer to my letter. I think it is a remarkable letter, beyond our highest expectations. The change that has been effected in her, her outspoken manner, her penetrating testimony and courageous stand are indeed eloquent and convincing proof of the all-conquering Spirit of God's living Faith and of the magnificent services you are rendering to His Cause.

.......... I shall not publish this letter, but will share one or two passages in it with the friends in my next general letter wherein I shall make mention in befitting terms of your noble, inestimable, unforgettable contribution to such an astonishing success. Do not show the letter to anyone but to the most reliable and intimate associates that you have among the believers.[45]
.......... [45. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 23 September 1926, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]

	Martha Root acknowledged receipt of this letter in October 1926 and she must have been very moved by the Guardian's approval of her work: 'deepest thanks for your splendid letter & the wonderful letter from Her Majesty.'[46]
.......... [46. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, October 1926, International Baha'i Archives.]

	At about this time, Queen Marie was making plans to visit the United States. She had a number of close American friends and felt encouraged by countless written responses to her articles published in the United States to travel to that receptive country. There was great excitement at this prospect. During her period of preparation she continued her study of the Baha'i Faith, as she confided to her diary: <span data-pg='74'></span>

Most Gracious Queen Marie:

.......... Mrs C. M. Cooper, of San Francisco, California, USA, has just written me telling me that she has sent a letter to ,you in the great hope that you will be a guest of the Women s City Club of San Francisco. It is the National League for Woman's Service, the most important woman's club .in San Francisco, it has six thousand members. Mrs Cooper IS a great friend of mine and she has asked me if I will also bring this matter to your attention. If you accept any hospitality in San Francisco I think this Club is composed of the most representative people.

......... I love you, most gracious queen. Your picture is on my table and each day I pray for your happiness and your spiritual progress. Always too, I pray for your son and each member of your family and for your country. If you go to the United States I am sure you will feel the love of every American. I watch the papers so eagerly to learn of your plans. Three days ago I saw a large, lovely picture. of you and your daughter, Ileana, in a London paper. I liked it so much.

.......... With love and thanks and prayers for you, your Majesty, sweet Queen Marie, I am,

	Martha's salutation at the end of her letter is particularly touching as she assured the Queen of her true friendship, <span data-pg='75'></span> something Queen Marie could not always take for granted with other acquaintances.

	Once again, without any prior announcement, the Queen submitted for publication a further statement based on her study of the Baha'i teachings. This appeared in an open letter in the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin on 27 September 1926:

[.]
[.//]
.......... At first we all conceive of God as something or somebody apart from ourselves. We think He is something or somebody definite, outside of us, whose quality, meaning and so-to-say 'personality' we can grasp with our human, finite minds, and express in mere words.

.......... This is not so. We cannot, with our earthly faculties entirely grasp His meaning--no more than we can really understand the meaning of Eternity.

.......... God is certainly not the old Fatherly gentleman with a long beard that in our childhood we saw pictured sitting amongst clouds on the throne of judgement, holding the lightning of vengeance in His hand.

.......... God is something simpler, happier, and yet infinitely more tremendous. God is All, Everything. He is the Power behind all beginnings. He is the inexhaustible source of supply, of love, of good, of progress, of achievement. God is therefore Happiness. His is the voice within us that shows us good and evil.

.......... But mostly we ignore or misunderstand this voice. Therefore did He choose his Elect to come down amongst us upon earth to make clear His word, His real meaning. Therefore the Prophets; therefore Christ, Muhammad, Baha'u'llah, for man needs from time to time a voice upon earth to bring God to him, to sharpen the realization of the existence of the true God. Those voices sent to us had to become flesh, so that with our earthly ears we should be able to hear and understand.

.......... Those who read their Bible with 'peeled' eyes will find in almost every line some revelation. But it takes long life, suffering or some sudden event to tear all at once the veil from our eyes, so that we can truly see...

.......... Sorrow and suffering are the surest and also the most common instructors, the straightest channel to God--that is to say, to that inner something within each of us which is God. <span data-pg='76'></span>

.......... Happiness beyond all understanding comes with this revelation that God is within us, if we will but listen to His voice. We need not seek Him in the clouds. He is the All-Father whence we came and to whom we shall return when, having done with this earthly body, we pass onward.

.......... If I have repeated myself forgive me. There are so many ways of saying things, but what is important is the Truth which lies in all the many ways of expressing it.

..........By Marie, Queen of Rumania[49]
.......... [49. Philadelphia Evening Star, 27 September 1926.]
[.///]
[.]

	Thus Queen Marie explained to the world how she viewed God and she daringly and boldly told her readers of her recognition that Christ and Baha'u'llah share a common station as Prophets. She also acknowledged this same rank for the Manifestation of God who came in the period between the two, Muhammad. Without any hesitation she keenly expounded one of the fundamental teachings of Baha'u'llah:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...in the kingdoms of earth and heaven there must needs be manifested a Being, an Essence Who shall act as a Manifestation and Vehicle for the transmission of the grace of the Divinity Itself, the Sovereign Lord of all. Through the Teachings of this Day Star of Truth every man will advance and develop until he attaineth the station at which he can manifest all the potential forces with which his inmost true self hath been endowed. It is for this very purpose that in every age and dispensation the Prophets of God and His chosen Ones have appeared amongst men, and have evinced such power as is born of God and such might as only the Eternal can reveal.[50]
.......... [50. Baha'u'llah, {Gleanings}, pp. 67-8.]
[.///]
[.]

	The following day, 28 September, a further statement appeared in the Canadian Toronto Daily Star, demonstrating Queen Marie's interest in life after death and the soul and her understanding of these gleaned from her study of 'Abdu'l≠Baha's writings. Its syndication carried it around the world to different newspapers, including The China Press on 12 December 1926: <span data-pg='77'></span>

[.]
[.//]
.......... Of course, if you take the stand that creation has no aim, it is easy to dismiss life and death with a shrug and a 'that ends it all; nothing comes after.'

.......... But how difficult it is so to dismiss the universe, our world, the animal and vegetable world, and man. How clearly one sees a plan in everything. How unthinkable it is that the miraculous development that has brought man's body, brain and spirit to what it is, should cease. Why should it cease? Why is it not logical that it goes on? Not the body, which is only an instru≠ment, but the invisible spark or fire within the body which makes man one with the wider plan of creation.

.......... My words are lame and why should I grope for meanings when I can quote from one who has said it so much more plainly, Abdu'l-Baha, who I know would sanction the use of his words:

.......... 'The whole physical creation is perishable. Material bodies are composed of atoms. When these atoms begin to separate, decomposition sets in. Then comes what we call death.

.......... 'This composition of atoms which constitutes the body or mortal element of any created being, is temporary. When the power of attraction which holds these atoms together is withdrawn, the body as such ceases to exist.

.......... 'With the soul it is different. The soul is not a combination of elements, is not composed of many atoms, is of one indivisible substance and therefore eternal.

.......... 'It is entirely out of the order of physical creation; it is immortal! The soul, being an invisible, indivisible substance, can suffer neither disintegration nor destruction. Therefore there is no reason for its coming to an end.

.......... 'Consider the aim of creation: Is it possible that all is created to evolve and develop through countless ages with merely this small goal in view--a few years of man's life on earth? Is it not unthinkable that this should be the final aim of existence? Does a man cease to exist when he leaves his body? If his life comes to an end, then all previous evolution is useless. All has been for nothing. All those aeons of evolution for nothing! Can we imagine that creation had no greater aim than this?

.......... 'The very existence of man's intelligence proves his immortality. His intelligence is the intermediary between his body and his spirit. When man allows his spirit, through his soul, to enlighten his understanding, then does he contain all creation; <span data-pg='78'></span> because man being the culmination of all that went before, and thus superior to all previous evolutions, contains all the lower already-evolved world within himself. Illumined by the spirit through the instrumentality of the soul, man's radiant intelligence makes him the crowning-point of creation!'

.......... Thus does Abdu'l-Baha explain to us the soul--the most convincing elucidation I know.

	As Queen Marie began her voyage to North America, Shoghi Effendi elaborated to the Western Baha'is the wonderful news of her encounter with the Baha'i Faith. In a letter dated 17 October 1926 he imparted his great joy and helped the believers to comprehend the significance of these events, as well as the greatness of Martha Root's work for the Cause of Baha'u'llah:

[.]
[.//]
To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout the West

Dearly-beloved brothers and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha:

.......... In the course of the few months that have elapsed since my last communication to you regarding the appalling circumstances that have culminated in the martyrdom of our Persian brethren in Jahrum, events of the highest importance to the future welfare of our beloved Cause have transpired, and with startling suddenness conferred abiding solace upon those who still have to face the pains and terrors of unmitigated and shameless tyranny.

.......... You have, most of you I presume, read with thrilling joy in one of the recent issues of the {Star of the West} that illuminating account given by our beloved sister, Miss Martha Root, wherein she tells with her characteristic directness and modesty the story of her moving interview with Her Majesty Queen Marie of Roumania and of the cordial and ready response which her gentle yet persuasive presentation of the principles of the Baha'i Faith has evoked in the heart of that honoured Queen. One of the visible and potent effects which this historic interview proved capable of achieving was the remarkable appeal in the form of an open letter which Her Majesty freely and spontaneously caused to be published to the world <span data-pg='79'></span> at large testifying in a language of exquisite beauty to the power and sublimity of the Message of Baha'u'llah.

.......... It was indeed a never-to-be-forgotten occasion when, on the eve of the day commemorating the passing of Baha'u'llah, a handful of us, His sorrowing servants, had gathered round His beloved Shrine supplicating relief and deliverance for the downtrodden in Persia, to receive in the midst of the silence of that distressing hour the glad-tidings of this notable triumph which the unbending energy and indomitable spirit of our beloved Martha has achieved for our sacred Cause.

.......... With bowed heads and grateful hearts we recognize in this glowing tribute which royalty has thus paid to the Cause of Baha'u'llah an epoch-making pronouncement destined to herald those stirring events which, as 'Abdu'l-Baha has prophesied, shall in the fullness of time signalize the triumph of God's holy Faith. For who can doubt but that the deeds of those valiant pioneers of the Faith, unexampled though they have been in the abundance of their number and unexcelled in their sublime heroism, are but a faint glimmer of what, according to the divine promise, its steadfast followers are destined to perform? Those heroic exploits that have immortalized the names of its primitive adherents will continue to adorn and illuminate the pages of its blood-stained history; yet we cannot forget that the period of its full fruition with all its promise of world felicity and undreamt-of achievements is yet to be realized, its golden age yet to unfold. Indeed, how chastening to our pride, how challenging to our enthusiasm, if we but pause for a moment amidst the world's many distractions and ponder in our hearts the vastness, the compelling urgency, the ineffable glory of what still remains unachieved.

.......... But let us all remember, in this connection, that prior to every conceivable measure destined to raise the efficiency of our administrative activities, more vital than any scheme which the most resourceful amongst us can devise, far above the most elaborate structure which the concerted efforts of organized Assemblies can hope to raise, is the realization down in the innermost heart of every true believer of the regenerating power, the supreme necessity, the unfailing efficacy of the Message he bears. I assure you, dear friends, that nothing short of such an immovable conviction could have in days past <span data-pg='80'></span> enabled our beloved Cause to weather the blackest storms in its history. Naught else can today vitalize the manifold activities in which unnumbered disciples of the Faith are engaged; naught else can provide that driving force and sustaining power that are both so essential to the success of vast and enduring achievements. It is this spirit that above all else we should sedulously guard, and strive with all our might to fortify and exemplify in all our undertakings.

.......... Moved by an irresistible impulse, I have addressed to Her Majesty in the name of the Baha'is of both the East and the West a written expression of our joyous admiration and gratitude for the queenly tribute which Her Majesty has paid to the beauty and nobility of the Baha'i Teachings. I have, moreover, assured Her Majesty of the far-reaching effect which her superb testimony will inevitably produce, and of the welcome consolation it has already brought to the silent sufferers in that distracted country. To my message of appreciation and grati≠tude there has come lately a written response, penned by Her Majesty, profoundly touching, singularly outspoken, and highly significant in the testimony it bears. From this queenly tribute to a divine ideal I quote these penetrating words:

.......... 'Indeed a great light came to me with the Message of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. It came as all great messages come at an hour of dire grief and inner conflict and distress, so the seed sank deeply... We pass on the Message from mouth to mouth and all those we give it to see a light suddenly lighting before them and much that was obscure and perplexing becomes simple, luminous and full of hope as never before. That my open letter was balm to those suffering for the Cause is indeed a great happiness to me, and I take it as a sign that God accepted my humble tribute... With bowed head I recognize that I too am but an instrument in greater Hands and rejoice in the knowledge...'

.......... Dear friends, with feelings of profound emotion we recall the glowing promises that have so often fallen from the lips of our departed Master, and with throbbing hearts rejoice in the gradual realization of His most cherished desire.

.......... And as we call to mind the circumstances that have led to such a notable advance, we are filled with admiration for that unique and great-hearted apostle of Baha'u'llah, our dearly-beloved <span data-pg='81'></span> Martha Root, who, under trying circumstances and almost single-handed in her efforts, has so wonderfully paved the way for the universal recognition of the Cause of God. In her case we have verily witnessed in an unmistakable manner what the power of dauntless faith, when coupled with sublimity of character, can achieve, what forces it can release, to what heights it can rise.

.......... Let such remarkable revelations of the reality and continuity of the divine purpose, made manifest from time to time to us His feeble children, serve to fortify our faith in Him, to warm the chill which fleeting misfortunes may leave behind, and fill us with that celestial potency which alone can enable us to withstand the storm and stress that lives dedicated to His service must needs encounter.

The visit lasted from 18 October to 20 November 1926. They crossed the entire country by train, beginning in New York and making stops in Washington DC (where Queen Marie was received by President and Mrs Calvin Coolidge), North Dakota, Washington, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Chicago and Indiana. When she arrived in Chicago she learned that her husband had been taken very ill and she was advised to return to Romania as soon as possible.

	In the course of Queen Marie's journey across the United States she received flowers from the Baha'is and she extended <span data-pg='82'></span> to them her thanks through a message she requested Martha Root to have published for her in {The Baha'i Magazine, Star of the West}:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I am so happy to be able to thank, through the BAHA'I MAGAZINE, THE STAR OF THE WEST, all these Baha'i friends in America who sent me the lovely bouquets in all the cities through which I passed. How it touched my heart! Wherever I came, those nosegays always on my table, nothing personal, never saying who had brought them, never able to thank anyone, just sent with the love of the Baha'is of those cities, went straight to my heart! No one ever understood how much those bouquets meant to me![54]

	On 1 November 1926 the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada wrote to the Queen:

[.]
[.//]
To Her Most Gracious Majesty
Marie, Queen of Rumania

The Rumanian Legation Washington, D.C.

Your Majesty:
.......... Since that notable day some six months ago, when, through a newspaper article entitled 'The Book of Love', the friends of 'Abdu'l-Baha throughout the United States and Canada learned of your interest in the Baha'i teachings, we have longed for the privilege of expressing to your Majesty our heart-felt appreciation of this eminent service to the Cause of world unity, spiritual understanding, and firmly-founded, just peace.

.......... Conscious of the burden of public engagements which your Majesty has assumed in giving so many American cities the gracious dignity of your presence, we have until now refrained from uttering our grateful feelings, in order not to add even one moment to the fullness of your life in these days. From the fact, however, that recently two more of your Majesty's contributions have referred to the teachings, we consider it essential that you be made aware of how profoundly the American Baha'is are impressed by your Majesty's insight and gifts, and what encouragement your action has given our own inadequate efforts to uphold the ideals and promote the principles of Baha'u'llah. <span data-pg='83'></span>

.......... In expressing the warm appreciation of all the American Baha'is for your Majesty's beautifully written and greatly influential tributes to the Cause, we would also make known to you the gratitude with which we received, through Miss Martha Root, your Majesty's gracious good wishes for the success of the World Unity Conference in Philadelphia it proved impossible for your Majesty to attend. At present the American Baha'is are arranging similar Conferences from month to month in various cities. We feel certain that, even though the press of duty and responsibility prevent your Majesty from contributing your noble influence to any of them directly, through personal participation, nevertheless your spiritual adherence and encouragement will not be withheld.

.......... We reverently remember, indeed, the words of mighty assurance addressed by Baha'u'llah to the kings of Europe and the East from his prison in 'Akka sixty years ago when, proclaiming the dawn of Universal Peace, he wrote of that spiritual crown and eternal authority awaiting the ruler who should first respond to the humanitarian call of the new day. May your Majesty's life and labour be blessed with the reinforcement and favour of the Supreme King!

Yours sincerely, in love of 'Abdu'l-Baha,

The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is
of the United States and Canada By
[signed] Horace Holley Secretary

.......... In token of our high esteem we take the liberty of presenting your Majesty with a copy of 'Abdu'l-Baha's addresses delivered in America: 'The Promulgation of Universal Peace.'[55]

	At the conclusion of her American visit, as she boarded the ship in New York that was to take her back to Europe, the Queen related a delightful encounter in her diary:

[.]
[.//]
Tuesday Nov. 23rd 1926 New-York

.......... I also received Mrs Cochran a very interesting old lady recommended to me by Roxo whose teacher she had been. A very wonderful old lady who was a personal follower of <span data-pg='84'></span> Abdu'l-Baha & had known him. She had wonderful things to tell me. We talked over an hour together & I only wish we had had a [sic] least another two hours at least. Ileana came in for a little then also Nikky.[56]
.......... [56. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished diary entry 23 November 1926, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	That this Baha'i managed to have the opportunity of a private audience with Queen Marie at such a time seems most providential. Queen Marie's diary entry testifies that she enjoyed her talk with Mrs Cochran.

	Queen Marie's life during this period continued to be fraught with personal distress owing to her son Carol's behaviour in Paris. It seems that no sooner was he out of Romania than he began to try to blame everyone else for his misfortunes. He was described as insincere and lying, heaping responsibility on his wife and mother whom he accused of conspiring against him. On her way to the United States, Queen Marie met with Carol, as she cared deeply for her oldest son and always felt that there remained a hope that he might eventually rise to assume his responsibility as heir to the throne, despite his renunciation. It is unfortunate that during his period in Paris Carol began associating with people who are said to have had a detrimental influence on him. Although he had made his own choice between Elena Lupescu and the throne, it was not long before he began to cry out publicly about the injustice of having been forced to do so and having to live in exile.

	Shortly after Queen Marie's return to Romania, Martha Root began contemplating another trip to Bucharest, as she stated in her letter to Shoghi Effendi of 3 December 1926:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Shoghi Effendi, I have it in my heart, the latter part of next year, on my way to Turkey, that perhaps Her Majesty Queen Marie would invite me again to the Palace if I can go to Bucharest.[57]
.......... [57. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 3 December 1926, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Eager to share Baha'u'llah's message with high and low alike and highly encouraged by the receptivity she had found in <span data-pg='85'></span> the Queen of Romania, Martha resolved in an earlier letter to the Guardian: 'Am trying to give the Message to the Ruler of each country where I go.'[58] She had some indirect help in her efforts from Queen Marie, as she related in a letter to Shoghi Effendi of 28 December 1926:
.......... [58. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 1 June 1926, International Baha'i Archives.]

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...In Madrid I wrote to the King Alphonso XIII and took 'Baha'u'llah and the New Era'--and what Her Majesty Queen Marie said--and went to the palace, saw the Secretary and left this with him for the King.[59]
.......... [59. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 28 December 1926, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	In a postscript in that same letter she reiterated her desire to see the Queen of Romania again: 'I keep it in my heart to go to see Her Majesty, Queen Marie, next year on my way down to Turkey and Persia.'[60]
.......... [60. ibid.]

1927

	In his letter to her of 16 January 1927 Shoghi Effendi expressed his delight at and approval of Martha's efforts to maintain regular contact with Queen Marie:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Persia is astir with the joy-giving news of your recent triumphs. The news has spread like wildfire through every village and hamlet. I wonder whether you think it advisable to get in touch with the Queen In Bucharest and do everything you possibly can to sustain and deepen her interest. She must not feel we have forgotten her.[1]
.......... [1. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 16 January 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	One year had elapsed since the two women had first met, and although a certain amount of regular contact had been maintained, the Guardian was anxious lest the Queen feel abandoned. Martha shared Shoghi Effendi's concern in her response of 22 February: 'Yes, I will write to Her Majesty, Queen Marie. I, too, feel she must never think that we have forgotten her. I will pray for her and do the utmost.'[2]
.......... [2. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 22 February 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]

	Martha had received a gift from the Baha'is of Khurasan, as Shoghi Effendi explained in a letter to her of 4 February 1927:

[.]
[.//]
.......... It gives me the greatest pleasure to enclose herewith a most precious relic, presented to you, in recognition of your unrivalled services to the Baha'i Faith, by the Baha'is of Khurasan, one of the most important eastern provinces of Persia. On this illuminated sheet is inscribed a prayer of Baha'u'llah revealed to one of the handmaids of God. It is adorned and blessed in the centre by a ring of Baha'u'llah's own sacred hair. This has been forwarded to me through the Spiritual Assembly of Mashhad, the chief town of the province. Will you kindly send me the receipt that I may forward it to the Mashhad Assembly... <span data-pg='87'></span>

.......... You see, dearest Martha, what you have achieved, what you have deserved, and what a turmoil of enthusiasm your self-sacrificing devotion has caused in the hearts of the faithful in Baha'u'llah's native land! You are the truest and best example to every labourer in the Divine Vineyard.[3]
.......... [3. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 4 February 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	One of Martha Root's outstanding qualities was her generosity and her constant concern for others. Because her friendship with Queen Marie was so genuine, Martha decided to make a very great sacrifice for her, as she informed Shoghi Effendi in her letter of 14 March 1927:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Saturday night I felt the urge and wrote Her Majesty, Queen Marie a letter of love. Also, I told her about the rare gift from those dear Meshhad brothers and sisters and told her I wish to give this gift to her so that afterwards she may bequeath it to her loved country, Rumania, which stands midway between the East and the West. I feel sure I shall hear from her. I explained what this great gift really means. Shoghi Effendi, Dear, at first it was very hard for me to even think of giving it up, for I longed to keep it and take it about with me everywhere, but now I feel differently, it would make me happier to have Her Majesty Queen Marie possess it, for I know in some ineffable way, it would bring her a great Blessing. Someway, I feel it 'belongs' to her, this first Queen of the world who has arisen so splendidly to promote our Teachings. I feel Baha'u'llah loves her and will always guide her. I too, hope she will feel that we 'never forget her'. I wrote her also, how much the people in America loved her and some of the things they said. I have not sent the gift yet, for I feel I shall hear from her.[4]
.......... [4. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 14 March 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Perhaps one day in the not-too-distant future this historic relic will be unearthed somewhere among Queen Marie's belongings to take its rightful and distinguished place in Romania, together with all the other documents and mementos of the association of its Queen with the Baha'i Faith. No doubt the day will come when the Romanian people will be proud to have become the recipients of such a priceless gift, the like of which, as Martha Root said, does not exist in any other European country. <span data-pg='88'></span>

	Shoghi Effendi deeply appreciated Queen Marie's public proclamations, as is evident from his letter to Martha Root of 24 March 1927 in which he drew a very important conclusion about her interest in the Faith:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I am eagerly awaiting to hear of the response of the Queen to your letter. Will you please send me a copy of her answer whenever you receive it. We all expect her to continue her services to the Faith through the medium of the Press and otherwise and thus prove to the many who have read her appreciations that her interest is genuine, profound, and determined. May the Beloved's guidance and grace and your own continued efforts yield the most abundant fruit in such a glorious field of service.[5]
.......... [5. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 24 March 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	An initial response from Queen Marie reached Martha Root by telegram, as she related in her letter to Shoghi Effendi of 2 April 1927, and it is noteworthy that the Queen took the time to cable Martha about her schedule:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Also, I had a telegram from Her Majesty Queen Marie when she received my letter. She said she might not be in Bucharest in April, so between you and me I will just keep the great gift (from Meshhad) until sometime when I am passing through Rumania. The Queen is our true friend. She wired as soon as she received my letter. I do not wish to say to anyone except you that I think of going to Rumania. But I had it in my heart to go either in April or in the autumn. (These are the only times I could go.) I think the autumn will be much better. I appreciated it that she wired me.[6]
.......... [6. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 2 April 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Shoghi Effendi in turn wrote to Martha on 17 April and, having learned of King Ferdinand's grave illness, requested her advice on the advisability of sending condolences in the event of his passing:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I urge you not to miss any chance that presents itself to impress Queen Marie with our love and best wishes and prayers for her and of our earnest hope that she will find it possible to render her share of service to the Cause of Baha'u'llah. The Baha'is in every land, inspired and thankful in connection with her <span data-pg='89'></span> splendid appreciations of their beloved Cause, look forward with intense hope and expectation to still greater and more glorious evidences of her praise and admiration of the Baha'i Faith. Do you think that in the event of the death of the King, whose condition seems critical, a telegram of condolence on behalf of the Family, the Baha'is and myself addressed to her would be well-advised? I wonder whether she would expect it.[7]
.......... [7. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 17 April 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	That Shoghi Effendi turned to Martha Root for her opinion on anything that pertained to the Queen of Romania was characteristic of the Guardian, who counted on those most knowledgeable about a given situation to advise him. Martha also turned to the Guardian whenever she had to make an important decision. This deep mutual trust was something which characterized the great friendship that existed between the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith and this devoted servant.

	From Finland Martha notified Shoghi Effendi on 21 May of her plans for a further trip to Romania and expressed her hope of meeting another Queen on her way:

[.]
[.//]
.......... If I get to Russia and back before the Danzig Congress, I had thought after the Congress I would work down to Rumania, perhaps stop in Serbia if the Serbian Queen (Queen Marie's daughter) is home, then go [to] Bulgaria to Sofia (not sure about this, but would try to go) then go to Constantinople, Athens, Angora, and then to Persia...

.......... Today am mailing a letter to Her Majesty Queen Marie. (Wasn't the book about her journey through America interesting!) I hope I can go to see her...

.......... P.S. ... Also, to contact the Government in Moscow, see Miss Grinevskaya--then come out and go down through the other way to meet Her Majesty Queen Marie and try to meet the Queen of Serbia.[8]
.......... [8. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 21 May 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	The prospect of Martha meeting other royal personages was thrilling to the Guardian, as he mentioned in his letter to her of 29 June 1927:

[.]
[.//]

.......... I hope you will succeed in meeting not only the Rumanian Queen but her daughter, the Queen of Serbia and King Boris <span data-pg='90'></span> of Bulgaria as well and I trust you will not hesitate to send me all particulars and details regarding your work in such an important field.[9]
.......... [9. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 29 June 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Although Martha began a letter to Queen Marie on 12 May 1927, she explained on 23 May, in the same letter, that she was unable to post it at the time. She wished to assure the Queen of her friendship and prayers as King Ferdinand's condition worsened:

[.]

To Her Majesty
Queen Marie of Rumania

Beloved Queen Marie, our 'Wingan Kifranfi Wuo':[10]
.......... [10. Title given to Queen Marie by an American Indian tribe during her visit to the United States in 1927.]

.......... Deepest truest love to you and thanks for your kind telegram to Danzig. I am keeping the precious relic, the prayer and the lock of Baha'u'llah's sacred hair, and when I come to Rumania in the autumn I will bring it to you. I am planning to go to Constantinople (and Persia) via Rumania [2] and Bulgaria [3] and Serbia [1].[11] Always you are in my heart and prayers, and each member of your family.
.......... [11. The numbering appears to be the order in which Martha Root planned to visit these countries.]

.......... It was such a delight, when I reached Helsingfors, to find the fascinating red, gold, blue book with your beautiful picture and the captivating title On Tour with Queen Marie'. From preface to Au Revoir I whirled with you through my country. I loved you that you were so sweet and loyal to Samuel Hill-no matter what his museum was at Maryhill, you and he have founded a peace between America and Rumania that will outlast any structure of stone in either land. You did just what you went to America to do, you have brought a great love between the people of these two countries. Your loyalty to Mr Hill, your love for Loie Fuller, your inviting the boy to dine with you on the Royal Train, your sweet graciousness to everybody, your beauty, quick intellect and always wise broad outlook will never be forgotten by our millions of real people. In a crisis they would rise up and be a friend. We thank you for coming and for bringing Prince Nicholas and Princess Ileana.. Our country needed to see how a Queen and a Prince and Princess have so happily together, and make everybody else happy. Oh, we shall never, never cease thinking of you and speaking of your visit to our country. I hope the <span data-pg='91'></span> Rumanian people were interested in everything that you have told them about the United States and that they love us much more and know much more about us now.

.......... How sorry I am the King could not come! Each day I think of him and pray for him, and for you. In these difficult hours of illness and great responsibilities, only God can help and comfort, and He does!

	<nd>

May 23-≠
.......... So many matters came, I could not write. After telegrams, letters everything today Russia refuses the viza [sic], so I cannot take these Teachings to Russia this year. It was not personal, but because I am an American. In this moment with that affair of the two Communists in Boston, they are very against us.

.......... There is a woman poet, Miss Isabel Grinevskaya, Prosp. Nabimson No. 10, log. 32, Leningrad. She wrote a drama 'Bab,' it was played before many thousands in Petrograd. Tolstoy saw it & became a believer. She has the letter from him. Also she has written (during the war) a tragedy 'Baha'u'llah' and a manuscript 500 pages in prose about her visit to 'Abdu'l-Baha when He was in Ramleh, out from Alexandria. She is said to be one of the great writers of Russia. She is ill, and she wished one to come and see her. I know two sisters who know Russian perfectly, know Esperanto and have translated poems into Esperanto and written poems. I thought they might translate 'Bab' into Esperanto and then it could be played all over the world. In Prague I met Count Tolstoy's secretary and he told me that Tolstoy said this was a great drama. Her works should be given to the world.

.......... Enclosed is a typed letter which I have sent my relations & a few friends, it is very personal, but will show you how the Baha'i Cause was received in these Baltic States. I may send you a magazine when the article appears quoting Mr Benes. He heard about the Baha'i Movement at the Races Congress in London in 1906, thinks Baha'u'llah's Principles are wonderful and has followed the Baha'i Movement with great interest ever since. Said he would be very glad to read the books I brought him. I had already given (sent) to President Masaryk your article, and Mr Benes would see it. When those Baha'i persecutions came a year ago in Persia, President Masaryk wrote me he had placed the matter before Mr Benes to do something. <span data-pg='92'></span>

.......... I think I wrote you that the Queen of Holland sent a letter of thanks (through Her Minister in London) for the book 'Baha'u'llah and the New Era'. Soon I will send you my speech for Danzig (Univers. Esper. Congress, July 28-Aug 3) on 'Baha'i Scientific Proofs of Life after Death'. I feel it would interest you because it is principally the exact words of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha and you might use some of those quotations in one of your syndicated articles. It is a subject that every one is interested in. Will send it written in English.

.......... O your Majesty, I hope you will be somewhere in Rumania where I may come and call upon you, perhaps the first week in October. Will write you later. If you would give me an inter≠view I would submit it to you before I sent it and it would do good for all countries, not alone Rumania and United States. But I want to come and bring you the holy lock of Baha'u'llah's shining hair. I love you and I want you to be the greatest Queen of this new cycle and you will be, and you will be honoured in all the worlds of God, and history for a thousand years and more will contain accounts of you, because you arose in this New Day to tell the people of Baha'u'llah's Principles. You are the first Queen to come out with these articles to the whole world. You are just guided by Baha'u'llah, He has raised you up, you are greater for this universal age than mere Mary Magdalene and John, the beloved disciples for their time. Capacity attracts and the more you use (or become used) this Divine Power the more brilliant becomes the intuition, the more cosmic the consciousness. You are not here just to be a good and great Queen to Rumania, you are here to mould the whole world. Your trip to America (which was flashed all over this earth) had a great spiritual significance, you will see or others will see before the century is over. 'Peace be upon those who follow Guidance!'

.......... Couldn't Princess Ileana take a trip to Haifa sometime? She certainly would love to meet Shoghi Effendi and the sister of 'Abdu'l-Baha and the daughters of 'Abdu'l-Baha. I wish you could go too. (But I feel you cannot leave.)

.......... Would you please tell your Lady-in-Waiting, Madame Lahovary about Miss Grinevskaya's drama 'Bab,' for Madame Lahovary heard about the Bab when she made a trip to Persia. Thanks. <span data-pg='93'></span>

.......... Whenever I see anything lovely in blues, I always wish I could buy it for you.

Good night, and love, and prayers.
Humbly, faithfully
In His Covenant

	On 23 May Martha wrote to Shoghi Effendi about her efforts to obtain a visa for Russia and offered an interesting premonitory statement:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Entre nous, some one said to me in the other Russian Consulate in Berlin: 'You better not mention that you know Queens and Kings, like Queen Marie, for we do not think much of them in RUSSIA!' I wondered if my article about Queen Marie had gone to Russia. [13]

[.///]
[.]

	At about this same time, Mr Herman Bernstein, Contributing Editor of {The Jewish Tribune}, was visiting Romania and requested an audience with Queen Marie to interview her about the situation of the Jews in Romania. In this fairly long interview, Queen Marie spoke about how appealing the Baha'i Faith was to her:

[.]
[.//]
.......... If I have something to give--sympathy, compassion, experience, thought--if I have a heart and a mind, must I suppress them because I am a queen?

.......... I have had to adapt myself to new surroundings, to a new environment, to a new language, to new customs, to a different religion, to a different standard of morality. My husband is a Catholic, I am a Protestant, and my children are Orthodox. The King doesn't like the idea that our children were brought up that way, but I have arranged matters so that we don't discuss religious questions... I have given much thought to the problems of religion and State. I am firmly convinced that both should do all to unite people, instead of dividing them. Otherwise religion and the State are a failure. But everything must be up to date, even religion. The religion of Christ was perfect when people wore sandals and lived the primitive life. To me Bahaism appeals most, because it does not require one to adhere to any special religious <span data-pg='94'></span> forms and aims to unite people of all faiths without asking them to desert the religions which they profess. To me all religions are alike, there is so much good in each of them. And it is the duty of the State and of religion to find a bond of understanding among the people, instead of creating strife and prejudice and hate.[14]

	On 12 July Martha responded to Shoghi Effendi's question about the advisability of sending condolences to Queen Marie in the event that the King's illness would take his life.

[.]
[.//]
.......... Yes, Shoghi Effendi, dearest Guardian, I think it would be very good if you sent the telegram in case His Majesty, King Ferdinand of Rumania passes on. I think she would expect it and appreciate it. I am hoping to go through Rumania in early autumn en route to Turkey.[15]

	Martha's letter was written only one week before King Ferdinand of Romania died. He had survived for just over six months after Queen Marie's return from the United States. Suffering for a prolonged period from cancer, he succumbed on 19 July 1927, leaving Romania with a six-year-old king, Mihai, and a regency comprising Prince Nicholas, the head of the Supreme Court and the Patriarch of the Church. Although Queen Marie worried about the future of Romania in these circumstances, she felt that she might be allowed to continue to offer her assistance and experience and generally believed that she would be well treated and respected. Before his passing the King had made provision for his wife to receive a regular income to cover all her needs.

	As news reached the Guardian on 20 July of the death of King Ferdinand, he immediately cabled Queen Marie, as agreed with Martha Root:

	In a letter dated 16 August 1927 to Shoghi Effendi, Martha makes no mention of the Romanian King's passing but speaks of a possible forthcoming visit with the Queen:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Also, perhaps it would be better to try to see Her Majesty Queen Marie this autumn, for I had written her that I hoped to come in September late September. I might leave here September 8--if they have everything arranged for public lectures, otherwise I must stay a little longer. But I shall plan to leave September 8. May stop and meet the Esperantists and give one lecture or two in Trieste. Then go to Belgrade and will try to meet the Serbian Queen, just as you suggest, then perhaps I would reach Bucharest September 20... I do not know how long I shall stay in Rumania, but after Rumania I will go to Sofia, Bulgaria...

.......... ...I long to send you a long cable to ask you if I shall start to Rumania first and do Germany and Antwerp Congress later, but you tell me to follow Divine Guidance and I know that, with or without the telegram the answer will come from you and from Baha'u'llah. If the Guidance comes to wire you, I will...

.......... My address will be Care of American Consul, Geneva, Switzerland. They will forward it if I have started on to Rumania. My address after September tenth I think will be Care of American Consul, Bucharest, Rumania.

.......... P.S. I feel it is not wrong to send you this telegram: 'Love. Prayers seems best Balkan trip starting early Sept., then three months Germany in spring before Esperanto Universal Congress Antwerp. If disapprove please wire. Martha.' It is so important for you to know so that you can wire me if you wish me to do differently, but this original (first) plan seems best. This is what I had intended to do & I had written Queen Marie last March.[17]

	On 19 August 1927 Shoghi Effendi directed his secretary to write a letter on his behalf to Martha Root about Queen Marie's response to his condolences on the passing of her husband:

[.]
[.//]
.......... He has with your approval sent a cable of condolence to Queen Marie--the following answer has been received: 'Grateful <span data-pg='96'></span> thanks to you and all yours with whom I feel spiritually so closely in touch.'

.......... He trusts that your next visit to her will serve to stimulate her to further action in a manner that will fulfil the hopes that the Baha'is cherish for her future work in the Cause. You will, he feels sure, assure her of our Guardian's deep sympathy and love as well as his earnest prayers for her welfare and success in facing the responsibilities of her high position ...[18]

	Shoghi Effendi appended a handwritten note to the above letter:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I trust you will do all you can to stimulate the ardour and faith of the Queen and infuse in her a desire to lend a helping hand to the sufferers in Persia. Only last week a fresh case of persecution in the town of Kirman has been reported to me, and the same indifference, neglect has been shown by the authorities. The hope of our downtrodden brethren in Persia lies in the action that the free and devoted servants of the Cause in the West can take on their behalf and I pray that you will continue in your unique mission of drawing the attention of those who are in authority to the incredible atrocities so frequently perpetrated in Persia.[19]
.......... [19. Unpublished note appended to ibid.]

	The continuing persecutions of Baha'is in Iran distressed Shoghi Effendi and he felt impelled to try to stop these by all means possible. He knew that pressure brought to bear by prominent persons could help alleviate the suffering of the Baha'is in the land of the Faith's birth.

	On 31 August 1927 Martha wrote to Queen Marie from Geneva to convey her own condolences on King Ferdinand's passing:

[.]
[.//]
To Your Beloved Majesty
Queen Marie of Rumania, Bucharest.

Precious Queen Marie:

.......... Allah-u-Abha! Deepest truest love to you, Revered Queen of all our hearts. During the days when you were praying beside your loved husband and immediately after his passing this humble sister, servant to Baha'u'llah was praying with you and <span data-pg='97'></span> for you. I shut myself in my room and prayed as many hours as I could each day. I was in Brussels.

.......... With this letter I am sending you my speech on Life After Death in Danzig, and under separate cover I mail you a little book which I have read this week, 'Our Self After Death' which gives the viewpoint from Christ's Teachings.

.......... I had such a wonderful vision of what it means to 'pass over', it thrills me every time I think of it and makes me so happy I could never be afraid to go. Oh, it is so glorious! But beloved Queen Marie, I know how lonely it is for those who stay on this earth! Each day I think of you and each member of your family and pray for you with all my heart and soul. I pray for you in your many responsibilities. Baha'u'llah is with you and you will succeed in everything because you have arisen in faithfulness and loyalty. You will find Him the Essence of faithfulness and loyalty to you. Shoghi Effendi loves and admires your splendid spiritual qualities and powers and always he is praying for you. All the Baha'is in the world and so many many other friends especially in the United States are praying for you and for your Kingdom of Rumania. All love you devotedly.

.......... In Danzig we gave out your article on the soul (printed in Esperanto) and this in English which I enclose I personally have had 3000 copies mimeographed and used them all. We had one thousand in Esperanto. Other friends in United States have also had many thousand and papers all over the world have copied it.

.......... I do not write often, dearest Queen, for I realize how busy you are, but so often I see clippings or thoughts which I feel may interest you.

.......... Today, too, I enclose Angela Morgan's poem on life after death. I knew her and was with her the day her mother passed. (I think I did send it to you a few months ago.)

.......... Am enclosing my home letter, sometimes I mimeograph it as I have so many friends.

.......... I expect to leave here about September 8, and will stop over a day or two in Trieste and then go to Belgrade. I shall be in Bucharest perhaps by September.[20] My address in Geneva, Belgrade and in Bucharest too will be care of American Consul.
.......... [20. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Queen Marie, 31 August 1927.]

.......... In Bucharest I will write you and send the letter to your Lady in Waiting Madame Lahovary who was so lovely to me the other time. I am bringing you this dear gift from Messhad <span data-pg='98'></span> Persia, the lock of Baha'u'llah's hair and a Tablet of His in Persian. In all Europe I do not think there is anything else that belonged to Baha'u'llah.

.......... I am so happy to think that it will be always in Rumania. Most gracious Queen, I am always loving you.

With prayers I am,
Yours faithfully
In His Covenant

Martha Root.

	<nd>

.......... Am speaking twice today in Geneva.

.......... If I see any booklets about the League of Nations work that I think may interest you I will send them. My friend wishes to copy 'Today is Resurrection' by Angela Morgan, therefore I will send it in a day or two.[20]
.......... [20. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Queen Marie, 31 August 1927.]

	This letter indicates how often Martha Root's thoughts turned to the Queen and how she wished to keep her informed of her activities.

	On 11 September Shoghi Effendi expressed his wish that Martha be assisted in her work in the Balkans:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I trust you will persuade Lady Blomfield to join you in the Balkans, as her sweet spirit of love and devotion will do a great deal for those souls who have been awakened by the call of the Kingdom. I will pray that the way may be opened and the means made available for her visit to the Balkans and particularly Rumania and Bulgaria.[21]
.......... [21. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 11 September 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Although Lady Blomfield did not manage to join Martha in the Balkans, she did meet Queen Marie seven years later in London.

	As the trip to Romania was finalized, on 15 September Martha conveyed to Shoghi Effendi further details about her visit. She was going without any certainty of seeing the Queen but trusting that the way would be opened if such an encounter was God's will:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I shall get to Bucharest about October first, but wish to pray a day or two and get ready before I write to Her Majesty. Of <span data-pg='99'></span> course one can only go trusting and praying, I have not asked for an interview but the other time I did not ask for one either. Inshallah!

.......... My address will be
.......... Care of American Consul,
.......... Bucharest, Rumania
and from October 15 to November 15 it will be Care of American Consul, Sofia, Bulgaria. I do not know how many days I shall stay in Bucharest. I leave it open[22]
.......... [22. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 15 September 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Prayer was always Martha Root's guiding force and she turned to it before making any decisions, minor or major. Her prayers in Room 35 of the Majestic Hotel in Bucharest led her to address the following letter to the Queen on 4 October 1927:

[.]
[.//]
To Her Majesty
Queen Marie of Rumania.

Beloved Queen Marie:

Allah-o-Abha! (Glory to God!)

.......... I am sure that Baha'u'llah is loving you, that the Hosts of the Supreme Concourse are standing with you. There is no problem they will not solve, there is no help they will not .give to you. They are with His Majesty King Ferdinand, he is in Gardens of Light and happiness.

.......... You raised aloft the Standard of Baha'u'llah, the first Queen of this world to proclaim His Message. Baha'u'llah is the Supreme King of Generosity, of Love, of Help. He is. royally directing all your affairs. He will comfort you and give you peace, and give you glimpses of Cosmic Consciousness to understand the why of life, the glory of passing through this Earth plane, that through evolution we are prepared for the Abha Kingdom. Light upon Light will come. His Majesty King Ferdinand will help you from the Other Plane, you will help him through your prayers.

.......... Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of our Cause, is praying for you, and he wishes me to assure you of their profound love, their constant prayers.

.......... How 'Abdu'l-Baha would have loved you! How tenderly He would have comforted you and given you hope! <span data-pg='100'></span>

.......... The very least, the humblest of the servants, I come to you, O precious precious Queen Marie, to bring you love in this your sad hour, to bring you our deepest thanks, to bring you the great gift of the Sacred Lock of Baha'u'llah's Shining Hair. I do not think that anyone in Europe or in the United States has a gift like this. It will bring you Power and Strength, you will feel yourself more and more Baha'u'llah's Channel; you will become even more a centre-of-love to all souls; you will have courage and a deep inner joy. You will do all you were sent to this earth to do. Mary of Magdala was the most wonderful woman in the time of Christ; I feel that Queen Marie of the Century of Baha'u'llah will be more penetrative, even more an inspiration to mankind, for you live in a universal cycle. When you can know more of the Mysteries of God
and do more.

.......... If it is God's Will, I should love to bring you this Gift of the Sacred Lock of His Hair. I should so love to see you again! And O your Majesty dear Queen Marie, how much you could help with your counsel about what I am to do in the Balkans! Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, Shoghi Effendi would love you for this help. O sweet and gracious Queen Marie, with forehead to the Threshold, this servant is praying that Baha'u'llah will aid her, that you in the Mystery of God will love her and counsel her.

.......... I have never passed on a letter which Shoghi Effendi has written to me personally, but perhaps I will enclose his last letter just received in Bucharest, so that you may see what he says about the Balkans. Oh, if the Balkans could bring into reality all these universal principles, how they could help the East and the West to understand each other! And what a good to the Balkans! In the time of Christ see how His Teachings lifted those nations that accepted them! It will be so in this cycle, the nations that accept Baha'u'llah's Principles will lead the world in divine civilization (and that is always followed by great material civilization). In the western world I think that the countries of the United States and Germany are very interesting.

.......... May I please send my love to your daughter Her Highness sweet Princess Ileana and to all your family.

With truest Baha'i love to you and prayers for you each day <span data-pg='101'></span> of my life, O lovely and lovable Queen Marie.
I am
Faithfully in His Covenant

Martha Root[23]

	Although the Queen's Lady-in-Waiting had told Martha that she doubted that Queen Marie would receive her as she was still in deep mourning for her husband, Martha felt compelled to persist in her attempt to see the Queen. She hoped that Queen Marie could advise her on how to spread the Faith in the Balkans, a region that the Queen had come to know fairly well. Unbeknownst to Martha, the Queen had retreated to Sinaia and, not receiving a response, Martha wrote to her again on 6 October:

[.]
[.//]
To your gracious Majesty
Queen Marie of Rumania

Deeply Beloved Queen Marie:

.......... Allah-o-Abha! This is our Persian greeting all over the world, it means the Glory of God and the other greeting is 'Ya Baha≠el-Abha!' means 'may the Glory of God be upon you!' So I breathe it as a prayer for you at this moment.

.......... I am sending a letter to Her Highness Princess Ileana and perhaps I will send this little package which I have prepared for you. The little blue scarf is from New York. I know you are In mourning, but it is your colour, and possibly sometimes you will use it and feel it is a little Baha'i warmth of love. It was given to me for my birthday but I have kept it for you. Please use it October 29 when you have your morning tea, and feel that 'Abdu'l-Baha has sent it just as a little sign of His Eternal Love to you. The little blue cup and saucer are from London but they have travelled with me in so many countries they are truly Baha'i. Sometimes when you are alone and wish a Baha'i cup of tea please use this simple cup and I will pray that His Majesty King Ferdinand and 'Abdu'l-Baha and Baha'u'llah will drink with you and that you will feel them close beside you. O beloved Queen may I please enclose two little pictures which sometime you might care to give to the dear mother of the <span data-pg='102'></span> darling little King, and one for His Majesty King Mihai; and two others, one for your son Prince Carol and one for your son Nicholas. The time may not be yet, but sometime you might wish to tell them of the wonderful life of 'Abdu'l-Baha.

.......... The gift of the Sacred Lock of Baha'u'llah's shining hair I am keeping until I hear from you. If I should have the great bounty of meeting you, I should be so happy to bring this rare gift to you in person. As God wills! We leave it in His Holy Judgement.

.......... You could help me so much with your counsel about the Balkans. Your capacity is infinitely greater. What you might advise me to do might have eternal results in the Balkans. I feel 'Abdu'l-Baha has sent me first to you. Personally I would not take one moment of your time, I would seek to save your time and strength. O blessed Queen Marie I could never serve you enough or love you enough. I just wish I had capacity to love and serve you!

Ya Baha-El-Abha!
Faithfully in His Covenant

	Never arriving without a gift, Martha Root had this time come to Bucharest with the precious relic of the lock of Baha'u'llah's hair which she wished to offer to the Queen who might later pass it on to Romania. Queen Marie summoned Martha to Pelisor Castle in Sinaia on 9 October 1927 and duly recorded their visit in her diary:

[.]
[.//]
Sunday October 9th 1927
Sinaia

......... The weather is struggling towards fine, but for the moment it is very chilly. Had no time to go out as had several people to see. Miss Root the Baha'i-adebt [sic] came with a heart-full of love, with books and an ardent desire to carry on her message. Ileana and I received her with affection and listened with interest to all she had to tell us about 'Abdu'l-Baha whose teachings we are so profoundly in sympathy with. Nikky also came to listen.[25]
......... [25. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished diary entry 9 October 1927, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Thrilled with the outcome of the Sinaia visit with the Dowager Queen, Martha described to Shoghi Effendi on <span data-pg='103'></span> 14 October 1927 what had transpired III the Queen's beautiful castle:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...I have such good news for you! Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania and Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana send you greetings! Her Majesty says: 'You can say there are two in this palace, mother and daughter, who have understood the blessed Message and they hope that through them it will be carried on.'

.......... O dear Shoghi Effendi, I feel they are DEEPLY interested and longing to do everything they can. One of the first questions Her Majesty asked me was about the persecutions in Persia. I did not need to ask her to do anything. Her heart is deeply touched over their great suffering, I feel she is and will do all that she can.

.......... This servant presented to her the wonderful gift from the Spiritual Baha'i Assembly in Mashhad,[26] Persia, the Lock of His Sacred Shining Hair. She felt Its Power and she was very happy to have this wondrous gift. Also, she said about the setting, the lovely Prayer and the work: 'it is in the most perfect taste of all the Orient; this polished gold, I know how rare and beautiful it is.' Only where that little flower was in the circle at the upper corner, she said: 'Would the Persians care if I changed it and had 'Abdu'l-Baha's picture in oval put just there?' I told her I was sure they would be delighted. It is strange, Shoghi Effendi, something MADE me put 'Abdu'l≠Baha's little photograph into that exquisite little package for Her Majesty. I could not understand why I felt this great urge. She caught up the little (brown) photograph and said: 'I love this picture of 'Abdu'l-Baha so much! This is the one I will have made into the oval and then I will have it (the lovely sheet with the prayer, the Lock, the sweet Persian work and the photograph) framed. I will choose just the proper frame for it.' She was very happy to have it. She asked me what the Persian Prayer is in English, but I could not tell her. Perhaps you could ask the friends and then you could write and send it to her. Dearest Shoghi Effendi, this servant did not mention that the Spiritual Assembly of Mashhad had sent the gift to her, the Queen does not know that it was sent to me, she thinks it was sent to her and she asks me to thank them -and would you, please, thank them when you write them in <span data-pg='104'></span> Persian? I loved their priceless gift, oh how I loved it and I thank them with all my heart, but like them, I passed it on in His Name and for His Sake. I felt it would make one more close connection with Persia, for she will always keep it near her. I know she will feel the POWER, I am so happy for her to have it for her own sake, for the deepening of her Confirmations. Also, loved Shoghi Effendi, please tell the Mashhad friends that I felt utterly unworthy of this stupendous gift, but it was a great bounty to have it for a little while, and a great honour to carry to Her Majesty and present it in their name and with their thanks for her great help to Persia. I told her how grateful all the Persian Baha'is were for her sympathy and her writing and speaking (from mouth to mouth) about these Teachings of Baha'u'llah and about tolerance. She said Mr Bernstein (from one of the leading New York papers, perhaps the Times) had been to see her about the Jews a few days before and she told him about Baha'u'llah's Teachings against prejudices and spoke with great enthusiasm of the Baha'i Cause. So you see she is trying to do all she can! She told Mr B. the Bah[a'i] Teachings were wonderful, so comprehensive and so broad they hurt no one's feelings (She said: 'I thought that was a good beginning with him.')
.......... [26. Martha Root uses different spellings for the name of this Iranian city: Mashhad, Meshhad.]

.......... She has given me a little interview to write for the 'Star of the West'. In it I will tell about the flowers which the American Baha'is sent her. She said it just went straight to her heart, the way the Baha'is sent her the lovely bouquets, nothing personal, never saying who had sent them, never possible to send thanks, yet ALWAYS there they were, these bouquets on her table! She said the people with her, NO ONE understood HOW MUCH those bouquets meant to her! So you see Shoghi Effendi, it made much more impression, for it was different from the way others did--the Baha'is I think must have done it perfectly and she loved the flowers and in my article I am to thank them all for Her Majesty. The Princess said the Baha'is were different from all others.

.......... Her Majesty says it is better to begin with the youth in promoting these Teachings. Says there is a young officer in the palace who is becoming interested. His name is Lt. Colonel Alexander Manolescu, A.D.C. to H.R.H. Prince Nicholas Palace Cotroceni, Bucharest. He read 'Baha'u'llah And The <span data-pg='105'></span> New Era' and loved it. They all like that book. Her Majesty and Princess Ileana both said they think that is the best one to give people who wish to read about the Cause.

.......... Her Majesty said about promoting the Cause here: 'The nearer East you come you will find the peoples on the defen≠sive. It is because they have been ill-treated, coerced, more betrayed than other countries. They are suspicious of anything that brings a new Message, afraid it is something underhanded -a catch in it to use the common expression.'

.......... She said when her daughter, Princess Ileana began (and even now a little) the work with the girls in the Young Women's Christian Association, the Greek Orthodox Church (Princess is a member of that) were a little suspicious even though they themselves are CHRISTIAN. Her Majesty said that when the booklets are well translated into Rumanian and printed she will give them to Ileana and Ileana will help a lot. She also said: 'Niky (her son Nicholas) will give them among the young men and the young officer who is becoming interested will help us'.

.......... She said to teach or to give anything, one must be a humble teacher, people who teach must not make you feel you are lower down than they are. Her own words: 'I carry it on humbly, I have been a groper and life has taught me many things. It was logical that this Message should come to me. I realize (I had said how much she helped) too that perhaps in one hour I can do more than perhaps some one else who would carry on for ten years.' She said something so beautiful to me, it brought the tears. I could never speak of it but it was a confirmation.

.......... It was sweet the way she spoke of her husband. He was a very devout, a very obedient Catholic. He did not quite see the Baha'i Cause but she said (when her son and daughter were with us in the drawingroom): 'Papa knows now, in the Other World, that it is not destructive but building.'

.......... She asked about the Temple in Chicago and its progress.

.......... I asked her if she could give me any addresses in the Balkans, and she gave me a note of introduction in her own hand≠writing to four friends in Constantinople. She calls them her 'faithful four'. They are Mr and Mrs Huntington, I think he is in the College, Mr and Mrs Teheran Damon. On the card she writes she is much interested in the Message I bring and that she has seen me twice. <span data-pg='106'></span>

.......... She said I could use her articles about the Cause in the Balkan papers. I was not sure whether she would wish this. The political situation is such that I thought she must be very careful, but she said I could use them!

.......... She said I could say in my article to the Star and I think also in the Balkans: 'Since these books came to me, next to the Bible they are my dearest spiritual reading and I am sure they will bring the same blessing to all those to whom they come.'

.......... I said how I wished Her Majesty and Princess Ileana could go to Haifa and Akka. She said she hoped later they could go to Haifa, Akka and Jerusalem and meet you and the Beloved's Family and go to the Holy Tombs.

.......... The Esperantists of Rumania wished me to ask Her Majesty if she would be the Honorary Patroness of the Esperanto Association of Rumania--they have wanted this for several years. So I asked her and she smiled and said: 'Yes, I will!' You can imagine the Esperantists were overjoyed. We met Esperantists at a Club 3 days later, and I spoke a little about the Baha'i Cause and the President of the Rumanian Society spoke about the Baha'i Cause and they thanked me as a body.

.......... When I left the Queen Princess Ileana came out of the drawingroom with me and invited me to her room on the third floor. Lovely artistic colours, a hundred pink roses in bloom in vases, a room where I felt much work is done. She seems very earnest. It was a lovely sunshiny room, all the pictures were Saints and madonnas and Joan of Arc--not a few were girlish pictures, one of a fete but on her little table by her reading couch was the little picture of 'Abdu'l-Baha which I had sent her in the letter. She said: 'I love it so much, I am going to get it framed at once.' She had never had His picture before.

.......... She said: 'Please tell me about 'Abdu'l-Baha. Please tell me how do you get to be a Baha'i?'

.......... She showed me the Baha'i little yellow booklet, that one of the lists of books. She said a young man in New York had said he would do anything for her and she said: 'Then please send me these books' but they have not come yet and she has waited all this time. She showed me her marked list of the ones she wishes so much. I asked her to give me the marked yellow booklet. I am going to send it to Roy and ask him please to ask the N.S.A. to send the Princess these books. Then if she has <span data-pg='107'></span> two sets (and she may never get those others) she will loan them all the time. She says she cannot keep any Baha'i books, her friends all want to borrow them.

.......... I asked her if the mother of the little King (the mother was the daughter of the King of Greece, not George, but it is all the same family. She is brilliantly educated and very cultured, Her Majesty told me so the other time. She is the wife of Prince Carol) was interested in our Baha'i Cause. The Princess replied: 'Well, she always seems to be carrying off my Baha'i books to read!'

.......... She spoke about Haifa and said she wished she could come and learn a great deal about this Cause. She said: 'I feel so alone. I feel I should know more. So many thousands of girls look to me.' I told her if she could go to Haifa Rumania has ships that go to Egypt so that would help their expenses. Rumania is in a great financial crisis. Ileana said: 'I would use my own money to go if they would let me.' I would take her and pay my own expenses. She said: 'I am afraid they would not let me go alone with you, they would send--' and she named who. (I think her mother would not permit her to go unless she went with her and it probably will not be for some time, but I told her to write me if I could ever serve her by going with her.) I know you would wish me to stand a true friend to this girl who will influence millions and for her own sake too. She is a very sweet, good girl, charming and she is very enthusiastic over the Cause and trying to serve it. She can be one of your greatest helpers. I loved her.

.......... Then we talked about the little booklet in Rumanian and she said how much she liked the little tiny blue booklet. She said if I could get some of them out in Rumanian, she would herself translate it and give it out. The Queen liked the one What Is a Baha'i? very much and while she did not say so I believe that she will direct its translation. The Lady in Waiting offered to see about it and the Queen said: 'It will be well done!' Well, Shoghi Effendi, once you said to me to let you know if you could help me. This is what I did. I had just received some money which I had sent and told my cousin I must have for the Balkans (he looks after my affairs). He sent me a check for one hundred and forty three dollars. I looked up about these booklets and it will cost $90. ninety dollars for ten thousand, five thousand of each kind, to be printed by the best book shop <span data-pg='108'></span> in Rumania and a place the Queen likes very much. They will send the MSS and everything will be perfect. I paid nine dollars to get out two thousand sheets in French just a page to explain What Is the Baha'i Movement? so that we could use here in Rumania and so that book shop would have it--and I will take some on to other Balkan States. So the book shop cashed my check and gave me forty four dollars and the receipt for $99. Nine was for the French and I wrote the Queen and the Princess that the ninety dollars was paid for the ten thousand booklets. It seemed too great an opportunity to lose. (I will pay the nine) I will try never to ask you again, but my expenses are terrific. I came third class all the way from Geneva, yet here in Bucharest it has cost me one hundred dollars. Things had to be done proper but I spent nothing for myself personally. I did not buy any meal except that day in the pension in Sinaia. I had to pay for my room in Bucharest when I went to Sinaia, otherwise I should have lost it. If you could not send it to me in Sofia, perhaps you could send it to me Care of American Consul, Athens, Greece. My address in Sofia will be Care of American Consul, Sofia, Bulgaria. I shall be in Sofia Oct. 18. and stay until November 15 and then go to Athens. If you do not have it now, I feel you will send it to me later if you find you can. I feel you will be glad I did it. I did not feel there was anyone in the world I could ask except you.

.......... I prayed hard about it and then decided to risk it and to turn to you, for I know your interest and that you will see what this might mean in the Balkan lands. No one could do so much as they to sweep this Cause.

.......... I do not explain how expensive it has been, but everything had to go by messenger, etc, etc, and after I paid ten dollars viza [sic] I had to go and pay five hundred leis more because I stayed longer than eight days, it is their law. I do not know what r must pay today, I have to go to the police to get the permit to leave Monday. I leave Monday Oct. 17 stop over five hours with the Esperantists in Ruschuck (Bulgarian Border where r stopped before, interesting city and a little interest) and leave there at ten P.M. and reach Sofia October 18. I have written the Sofia friends and they will meet me and have my room reserved.

.......... I wished so much to ask the Greatest Holy Leaf if she would please send the Queen and the Princess a Baha'i ring stone. I <span data-pg='109'></span> told them about her and about the stones. They had asked about the Greatest Holy Leaf. They said they would be very happy to have the stones. Do you think the prince and this young officer should have one too? It might be splendid if she could send four. Also, I wondered if you would care to send the Queen and the Princess a little medallion of 'Abdu'l-Baha, either a locket one or one to stand on the table. There is no hurry about these.

One addresses them
Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania,
Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana
His Royal Highness Prince Nicholas
Lt. Colonel Alexandru Manolescu, A.D.C. to H.R.H. Prince Nicholas
and send to Palace Cotroceni, Bucharest, Rumania.

.......... Princess Ileana asked me for your address and how to address you and she said: 'Would Shoghi Effendi think me very presuming if I should write him a letter?' I told her you would be happy to hear from her and to know of her great eagerness to serve this blessed Cause...

.......... I will write the Queen story to Mariam Haney and write a circular letter home but as yet have not been able to write a line. I would not wish anything published until I send the story to Mariam and I will write something for the Baha'i News Letter in New York, but you could use anything you wish from this for the Persian friends or in any way you wish--but you could tell the pilgrims with you not to print anything until it has been sent to the Star. Am sure they would not. This all sounds so impolite, I do not mean it so... I leave so much undone, so much unwritten.

.......... Many wonderful things came among the people here in Bucharest, perhaps another time can write about them all.

.......... Deep Baha'i love to you, the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Holy Mother Zia (I told the Queen all about Zia)...

.......... When I came to Bucharest, I telephoned to the Lady in Waiting to Her Majesty, the one who had been to Teheran when she was twenty years old and had heard about the Babis and had not heard any more until I came to Bucharest in January 1926. She said she did not think Her Majesty would see me because Her Majesty is in the Great Mourning. But she <span data-pg='110'></span> invited me to come to her home. She is one of the greatest families of Rumania. I went Wednesday Oct. 5 and took with me a letter to Her Majesty (in the letter I said I had come and that I had brought her the wonderful gift, the Lock of Baha'u'llah's Sacred Hair, that I had come to bring the love, the sympathy of the Baha'is in this her sad hour. Also, Shoghi Effendi, I said more about the Sacred Lock of His Hair. Perhaps I could copy and send you just what I said.) I took the Lady in Waiting some white chrysanthemums and some Baha'i booklets. We had a lovely talk and she said she would send my letter by courier to Her Majesty who with all the family, was at the Palace Peles in Sinaia, hours distant by Express train. The Lady in Waiting said Rumanians love Five little booklets and read them over and over. I asked her if I could pay for getting out some in Rumanian, could she translate 'What Is the Baha'i Movement?' She said she would be very happy to do it. She also said she would see how much the printing would be and would let me know. That was very kind of her. I felt her love, but I do not think she knows much about the Cause.

.......... The next morning, Thurs. Oct. 6. I wrote Her Majesty and did up some presents for her. (I did not wait to hear from her. I felt the urge to do it this other way.) I gave her 'Divine Art of Living' and 'Wisdom of 'Abdu'l-Baha' and said I thought she would find thoughts in them that would suggest something for her syndicated articles.

.......... Mrs True had given me a perfectly lovely blue wool scarf. It was the prettiest one I ever saw--pretty enough for a Queen! I thought 'I'll give her just everything I possess that I think she would like!' I knew she would LOVE that scarf for it was her favourite colours, blue and yellow. O Shoghi Effendi, there is almost nothing I would not have given when I think what Queen Marie has done for our blessed Cause. I told her just how it was a gift to me and that I had kept it for her. (I knew the day I received that exquisite scarf that I would give it to Her Majesty!)

.......... Also, I had a very lovely blue cup and saucer from London which I have used in many countries. I sent it to her as a Baha'i cup and told her the Prayer I would pray for her when she used it.

.......... I sent a Prayer Book, many kinds of little booklets and four more pictures of 'Abdu'l-Baha, one for her daughter Queen of <span data-pg='111'></span> Jugo-Slavia, one for her daughter Elisabeth (formerly the Queen of Greece) one for Prince Carol (father of the little King) and one for Prince Nicholas.

.......... Also I sent some flowers. Everything was beautifully done up in white tissue papers and white satin ribbons.

.......... Then I also wrote her Royal Highness Princess Ileana and sent her some gifts. (I wept to part with the Lock of His Sacred Hair) and felt too unworthy to have had it even a short time, but I did not send that to them Thursday. I decided to wait and take that if Her Majesty invited me. I wept hard to part with your picture beloved Shoghi Effendi. (It was the same little picture Her Majesty had held every minute when I talked with her before on January 30, 1926.[)] It is a little picture Mrs Nourse gave me. I felt impelled to send it to Princess Ileana! I wrote her how much I knew she could do for these Teachings. That I felt she would meet you and many of her friends would meet you and that they all would work with you for the promotion of these great Principles for world understanding. I told her about you. Also, I told her how modest you are, that there is no picture of you, you never even have seen this one, but that I loved her and trusted her and wanted to give her my dearest treasure and oh how I wished her to help you in your great task. Told her I knew she would never permit it to be published. (And I know dear Shoghi Effendi she never will!)--that picture has always been on my table, almost always went with me to all lectures, and always in my travels it went in my little valise I carried in my hand. But I knew that picture was to go to the palace, so I did it up beautifully as the first gift to Princess Ileana, I also gave her one of the American (brown) Prayer Books, and some little books, a photograph of 'Abdu'l-Baha, of these little brown ones, and some flowers. The Lady in Waiting sent these two letters and gifts the same day, Thursday by the courrier [sic]--but while these were going to the palace a letter was coming from the palace to the Lady in Waiting to arrange for me to come to the palace either Sunday or Monday, whichever day was the more convenient for me. I chose the first day--Sunday. This was Friday noon that I received the letter. I was to leave Saturday noon, spend the night in an hotel in Sinaia and meet Her Majesty Sunday morning.

.......... I had everything shining and perfect for that journey. (I had felt so ill in Bucharest, the weather turned very cold and raw <span data-pg='112'></span> and rainy and no fires. Baha'u'llah alone knows how I prayed for patience to bear the pain and that He would send the superhuman Power to help me. And He did!)

.......... I started to the train. I had two small cases, my suitcase and the little leather case I always carry in my hand. I had changed & put the Baha'i books into the larger case they were so heavy. But in a city I always used this little case to carry my books etc. around among people. I took a bouquet of nine wonderful white chrysanthemums (I remembered that the Baha'is in Seattle had sent Her Majesty to the train in Seattle, a bouquet of nine white chrysanthemums and she loved them, so I thought I would take these and present them in their name, or rather say I wanted to bring them for them). I took another package, four lovely sunshiny yellow roses, for Her Majesty. I took four pink roses, pale pink to the Princess, and four white roses to the mother of the little King Mihai, one lovely red rose to the little King and one little pot of maidenhair fern with a lovely red paper around it also for the little King.

.......... It was a pouring rain, cold sleet, an awful storm. When I got to the station and went to pay the cabman (I had to take the cab so many parcels and because of the storm) I still held on to Her Majesty's flowers for fear the porter would crush them, suddenly a thief snatched my little bag dodged in among the hundreds of umbrellas and was gone! My porter, no one could help me, there were hundreds of people in that crowd all with umbrellas pulled down close. I could not speak one word of Rumanian, they could not speak anything else. I had to think swiftly, if I stopped and tried to hunt the thief, I might fail, I would lose the train, I would miss the great audience with Her Majesty, and it would be unpleasant for her to know this happened in her country. I let the bag go, I took the porter and went to my train, went to Sinaia, and I never mentioned to her or to the police or to anyone of them this occurred. (I knew how hurt she would be.) I thank God it was not my gifts to the Queen, the Sacred Lock, the Baha'i books, or the Voice of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the record which I was taking to the Princess, nor the white dress which I was to wear at Court. The bag that was stolen contained my English Hidden Words & little black (American) Prayer Book, all my toilet articles, my silver lorgnette, a little clothing etc. The loss was about $30. (1 had to <span data-pg='113'></span> have a bag to travel on to Sofia and am getting one made for six dollars, the toilet things I am buying, the other things I will not replace but do without.)

.......... The thief took my lunch too, so I had a good fast. I have travelled all these years with many bags and never lost and then when I just had the two small bags, it was snatched in daylight. I thought how much Baha'u'llah had had stolen, He had lost everything.

.......... I assure you, Shoghi Effendi, I try to be very careful, especially in the Balkans, but this might have happened in New York or any place. I am not afraid, for Baha'u'llah will protect me.

.......... When I reached Sinaia, the rain came in torrents, but we climbed the mountain, just a short distance, to a pension, Villa Carola, which the Lady in Waiting had recommended. By 'we' I mean the porter from Sinaia station who helped me with suitcase and flowers. It was very expensive but I only stayed one night & day--and they had a FIRE in my room, so I was comfortable, and one had to take the meals, so I had a good dinner. (They do not give the room without the three meals). There was a nice place to put my flowers out, so they kept PERFECTLY. I prayed many hours even if I did not have a Prayer Book.

.......... Next morning I felt happy and thankful and READY. I was so Clean to start to Sinaia, my hair was perfectly curled, my nails perfectly manicured, pure water baths night and morning, I managed to get along without my toilet supplies! I wore a white silk dress with a white silk tunic made from a scarf which Sister Grace Challis had given me a year ago, the white kid gloves had been sent me a year ago by Lillian Kappes' sister, Anna Kappes (One MUST wear white gloves to meet Her Majesty, one must wear the left, carry the right glove and kiss Her Majesty's hand.) Everything I wore was white (cream). The nice porter from the pension carried the flowers but I carried the Baha'i books, the Voice of 'Abdu'l-Baha and the Sacred Lock of Baha'u'llah's Hair (I trusted those to no one) and we started to walk up the beautiful Carpathian Mountain to the palace, the walk is one half hour. It was all so BEAUTIFUL! I never dreamed that anything in Rumania was so beautiful as the approach to the great palace. But we did not go to the great palace, Palace Peles that was where King Ferdinand passed on, <span data-pg='114'></span> but close beside Palace Peles is a smaller (but immense!) palace which is the Queen's Palace 'Pelis or' and the whole family is living there during October. At present there are the Queen, Princess Ileana, Prince Nicholas, the mother of the little king, the little King, King George of Greece and his wife (you know he had to leave his throne, I think they have a republic there. King George I hear has gone into some business connected with England) they are all living with the Queen. They will come to the Bucharest palace the first of November. (I felt it was spiritually as proper to come to the Queen walking as to hire a motor car.)

.......... The Butlers (spelled with a Capital they were so imposing) met me at the door and took the flowers and I thanked the porter and told him not to wait I could go back alone, and I came in to a drawingroom where Ladies in Waiting met me and took my things. I asked if I could take my hat off (I do not like that hat at all but I did not want to spend any money for a hat) and they said certainly that Her Majesty would not care. They were very sweet. They said her Royal Highness Princess Ileana was at church early service but she had left word that she would like to see Miss Root. I sent to the Princess' room the gifts, the Voice of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the pink roses, a little Esperanto pin, and a little handkerchief which Helen (the Baha'i girl in Seattle who married Mr Bishop of California) sent me and she said: 'May I not hope that you will use it when you speak of our Beloved Lord!' I have used it only then. (Later I told the Princess the story of the handkerchief) I had not known that the Princess would see me. I had not asked for an audience with Her Majesty or with the Princess nor did I ask the other time, two years ago,--I wrote that I had brought the gift from Mashhad and if I saw her I would like to bring it to her but if she could not see me I would send the gift by Madame Lahovary, the Lady in Waiting here in Bucharest. This was in the first letter.

.......... One Lady in Waiting took the gifts for the Princess, another the gifts for the little King & his mother, and the other took me to the drawingroom upstairs to her Majesty. Just as I stepped into the drawingroom two great fine black dogs sprang forward--I could not go forward to meet the Queen, they barked and one caught my leg, she had to speak to them and <span data-pg='115'></span> call them back. Then she came towards me and I ran forward to her. I carried the four yellow roses and told her one was from the Bab, one from Baha'u'llah, one from 'Abdu'l-Baha and one from Shoghi Effendi. Tears came to her eyes and to mine as she thanked me. She held them to her heart a moment. She looked so beautiful, she was all in black except the white band about her face, the band of her long black veil, and white bands at the throat and wrists. I never knew that mourning clothes could be so artistic. She is an artist in everything, her clothing, her surroundings, she knows how to be a Queen. She led me to the chair and we sat down and I gave her the Great Gift, the Gift from Mashhad and I gave her your greetings. She thanked me and asked about you and the Holy Family and then she asked about those persecutions in Persia and we spoke of Persia.

.......... Later I explained and gave her the bouquet of nine white chrysanthemums and said I had chosen them and brought them for the Seattle friends. (The Lady in Waiting had brought them in and put them on Her Majesty's table.)

.......... Also I had brought the two volumes of Universal Peace and 'Some Answered Questions'. I said I had brought them to show her, but that perhaps she had them. She said she had 'Some Answered Questions' that I had sent her for Christmas last year but that Ileana so longed to have that book perhaps I would give this copy to her daughter. (Later I did and Ileana was so glad to have it.) The two volumes of 'Promulgation of Universal Peace' Her Majesty had not seen and she asked me if she could keep them to read. I gave them to her. (They were my own marked copies and I used them every day) (I just have one Baha'i book left).

.......... The Queen had been reading on a big couch before I came and all the books around her in this room were Baha'i books.

.......... I showed her the photograph of Ruhi Afnan, Roy Wilhelm and his mother[,] 3 together [,] told her who Ruhi is, told her if she ever comes to New York Roy will offer her the Log Cabin. He did offer it before if she wished to go out there for a little rest but he wrote me and I did not get her the letter in time to send her anyway she had not time to stop in U.S.A. they had such a terrific programme for her.

.......... I showed her the photograph of my dear friend, the Catholic Priest, the Esperantist and told her if she and the Princess <span data-pg='116'></span> Ileana learn Esperanto he is the best in Europe -and he is a Rumanian. She said: 'If we learn you think we had better have him as our teacher?' and I replied 'Yes.'
.......... Then the Princess and Prince came and we four talked together. Then when I said good bye to the Queen, I again kissed her hand, but she kissed me and I said very low 'Allah-o≠Abha!' O Shoghi Effendi, it must be very hard to be a Queen. Underneath all that formality is a courageous great loving soul, a soul that has suffered deeply, she is much more confirmed. She is a real Baha'i and she intends to serve our Cause. She loves you, she asked me about you, and I think she will come to see you when she can leave Rumania, but now they are in mourning. I do not know when they can come. I believe she has a great station that she has been raised up by Baha'u'llah, what Mary of Magdala was to Christ's Dispensation, perhaps Marie of Rumania can be in Baha'u'llah's Cycle, but I only say that to you and to her.[27]
.......... [27. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 14 October 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	It is in this account that Martha Root mentioned for the first time to Shoghi Effendi her belief that Queen Marie was a Baha'i.

	Martha's prayers and letters led to this second visit she had with the Queen of Romania. She presented the Queen with a set of books: {The Divine Art of Living}, {The Wisdom of Abdu'l≠Baha}, the two volumes of {The Promulgation of Universal Peace}, {Some Answered Questions} and a prayer book. She also noticed that all the books visible in the Queen's room were Baha'i books.

	It is clear from the statements of Queen Marie to Martha that she and her daughter were very committed to the spread of the Baha'i Faith and used every opportunity to inform those with whom they came into contact. Both used the printed word to spread the teachings. Martha told Shoghi Effendi that Princess Ileana had ordered all the Baha'i books then published and lent them to her friends. Princess Ileana mentioned specifically her wish to translate into Romanian the little blue book, a tiny pamphlet containing various quotations from the Baha'i writings. Queen Marie advised Martha Root to have {Baha'u'llah <span data-pg='117'></span> and the New Era} translated into the Balkan languages so that the people of these countries would have access to an introductory work on the Baha'i teachings. This important task would be carried out by Martha in the early 1930s and she had some valuable assistance from the Queen for the Romanian version. Of major significance too was Queen Marie's agreement that her open letters on the Faith be used in the newspapers of the Balkan countries which Martha was to visit.

	Having given the Queen Baha'u'llah's Tablet and lock of hair, Martha appended the following note to Shoghi Effendi's letter to her of 4 February 1927 in which he had described the gift:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I gave this precious relic to Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania in 1927, when I had an audience with her in her palace at Sinaia, out from Bucharest, Rumania.[28]
.......... [28. Unpublished, undated note added to ibid.]
[.///]
[.]

	The March 1928 issue of {The Baha'i Magazine, Star of the West} carried Martha Root's report of her meeting with Queen Marie at Sinaia. She described, as always, in moving terms the journey to reach the Queen and her impressions:

[.]
[.//]
Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania
Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana
Martha L. Root

.......... Coming from Geneva and the League of Nations, with stops at Trieste and Belgrade, the writer arrived in Bucharest on October 5, 1927. It was not this eager, colourful 'Paris of the Balkans'--so fascinating to tourists, so different from any other city--that had drawn her. Calea Victoria, Bucharest's fashionable thoroughfare, that is always so thronged one wonders how the many motor cars and bevies of horse-drawn carriages ever 'arrive' through such a narrow, picturesque moving picture of aristocratic Rumanian life, was just as interesting as before. She liked riding through it all again, coming up from the train to her small hotel.

.......... However, her real visit to Bucharest, aside from her lectures on Baha'u'llah's Principles and her newspaper articles, was to <span data-pg='118'></span> bring the love and the sympathy of Baha'is all over the world to Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania. The Queen at that time was in the period of great mourning for her husband, His Majesty King Ferdinand, who had passed on July 20.

.......... All the royal family was spending the month of October in Sinaia at the Queen's palace, Peleshor [Pelisor], which is just beside the greater palace, Pelesh [Peles]. The two are one estate, but Peleshor is especially the home of the Queen, where she has her books and does much of her writing in summer.

.......... Word came through Madame Simone Lahovary, Lady in Waiting, that Her Majesty would receive the visitor on October 9. This was purely a favour, because at this time the Queen was not seeing anyone. The writer went to Sinaia, four hours distant, by one of the fast express trains, the afternoon of October 8. There was a pouring cold rain, but through the storm one could catch glimpses of what magnificent forests, what glorious scenery, have these 'Transylvanian Alps', these Carpathian Mountains, whose heart is Sinaia.

.......... Next morning the air was fresh and bracing and the sun was shining lovingly over this Sinaia, one of the most beautiful little summer resorts of fashion. The villas grace the mountain slopes as jewels in a tiara of autumnal glory. The Baha'i decided to walk to the palace Pelesor to enjoy the thrill of passing through those enchanting roadways leading gracefully up and up, and to see at close range the splendid little seventeenth-century church and monastery, shining like a pearl of purest white in this diadem of mountain splendour. Deep in her heart, too, was the longing to go on foot and humbly to the first Queen of the whole world who had publicly written of Baha'u'llah's great Principles for this universal cycle. Her Majesty Queen Marie's grandmother, Queen Victoria, of Great Britain, had said openly of Baha'u'llah's Teachings: 'If these are from God, they will stand!' and she had preserved His Tablet (letter) to her for later generations to see and read. In the centuries ahead when Baha'u'llah's Teachings are lived and fully understood, the name of Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania will stand as the first Queen who wrote and explained the power of these universal principles to bring the permanent peace.

.......... Walking in that paradise of natural beauty, the writer ascended the roadway slopes and passed through that white <span data-pg='119'></span> court, where the Rumanian church stood in its ivory loveliness and the famous old monastery stood loyally beside it. It is the church of the Royal Family, where unnumbered prayers have been offered for Rumania, this country with its dramatic history, more tragic, more swift than the masterpieces of the poets. It is the church where His Majesty the little King Mihai goes to service and where his seventh birthday, October 25, would soon be celebrated in a very great way. Perhaps to this very spot Jesus Christ's trustworthy Disciple, Andrew, had come, for Rumanian tradition says that Andrew, from that faithful Band of Eleven, came to Rumania to bring the Glad-tidings of the Christ. How well he had done it! For this Sunday morning, after TWO THOUSAND YEARS, all Sinaia, all Rumania, had already gathered very early to sing praises to Christ!

.......... The roadway from the church led up directly into the great park, picturesque with broad, sweeping landscapes and century-old trees which showed their generations of care. The writer walked on past the magnificent immense Palace Pelesh, where King Ferdinand, with his Queen-wife's arms about him lifting him higher, had courageously passed from this home into the House of Many Mansions promised by His Lord, for King Ferdinand was a devout and true Catholic. How well the writer remembered seeing him two years before, that morning in Cotroceni Palace in Bucharest, where she was waiting a moment in a small drawing-room just before she was taken into the great music-room to be presented to Her Majesty the Queen! The King was about to pass through this small drawing-room with some friends, but seeing the American he took them through another salon. He had appeared so tall, so noble, so serious!

.......... Coming to the architecturally charming and colour-satisfying smaller Palace Peleshor, built by the late King Carol for King Ferdinand and Queen Marie and their children, the pedestrian found it situated in a perfect setting of terraced gardens. If the royalty of the world have more beautiful environment for country palaces than this in Rumania, the writer has never seen them.[29]
.......... [29. The original article includes a comment from the Editor: 'Miss Root has travelled in nearly all the countries of the world, with the possible exception of two.']

.......... Palace Peleshor is large--it isn't small, only it seems so, because it stands near the great Palace Pelesh. (The Palace <span data-pg='120'></span> Pelesh takes its name from the little mountain stream called Pelesh which passes through the place.)

.......... What a feeling of silent, unutterable sympathy one has coming to this palace where Her Majesty Queen Marie and Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana, where His Majesty the little King Mihai and Her Royal Highness Princess Helen, His Royal Highness Prince Nicholas, Their Majesties King George and Queen Elizabeth, of Greece, were staying for a few weeks, and each was deeply missing the loved one who had gone from among them!

.......... Ladies in Waiting stood in the great hall to receive the visitor. They were the same fine women who had greeted her two years before in Cotroceni Palace, but now they were dressed all in black. One explained that Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana was still at the church, but had left word she would receive the guest when she returned a little later. The other Lady in Waiting took the writer up the broad, circular open stairway to the Queen's drawing-room on the next floor.

.......... Her Majesty Queen Marie stood in the centre of this luxuri≠ous salon where the sunshine-yellow, soft colours blended into a harmony of pastels. How beautiful she was. All in black draperies, with bands of white about her head and binding the wrists! Only a great artist could have designed such a mourning costume as she wore that day, but the Queen is an artist in everything she wears, and does, and says. But it is the radiance in her eyes and the tender smile one loved most and will remember longest. Her welcome was solemn, sacred, cordial. When she heard the deep greetings from the friends she replied with a wonderful message to the Guardian of the Baha'i Cause, Shoghi Effendi, and to 'Abdu'l-Baha's sister, who is called The Greatest Holy Leaf, and to 'Abdu'l-Baha's wife, The Holy Mother. She added: 'Tell them, also, I hope some time to go to Jerusalem and 'Akka and Haifa. I should like to pray at both graves and to meet the Family of 'Abdu'l-Baha.'

.......... She sends this message to the Baha'is of the United States: 'I am so happy to be able to thank, through THE BAHA'I MAGAZINE, THE STAR OF THE WEST, all those Baha'i friends in America who sent me the lovely bouquets in all the cities through which I passed. How it touched my heart! Wherever I came, those nosegays always on my table, nothing personal, <span data-pg='121'></span> never saying who had brought them, never able to thank anyone, just sent with the love of the Baha'is of those cities, went straight to my heart! No one ever understood how much
those bouquets meant to me!

.......... 'I am so happy to think I have been able in any way to further a Cause which, I am sure, is destined to bring happiness, if not to the world, to all those who really have understanding of what is the real meaning of God.'

.......... Her Majesty Queen Marie, in her daily article during a year for an American syndicate, touched on all subjects, and the four articles which she wrote about Baha'u'llah's Teachings show the love the Queen feels for this Message that will bring so much happiness to the world. She could do in one hour what some people might work for ten years to accomplish. Yet she said: 'I carry it on humbly. I have been a groper and life has taught me many things. It is logical that this Message of Baha'u'llah should come to me. Ever since I received these books they have been my dearest spiritual reading next to the Bible. I am sure they will bring the same blessing to all those to whom they come.'

.......... She spoke about teaching the Cause and said that if one wishes to give another truth, he should do it humbly. People who teach should not make one feel he is lower down than they are. She admired so much the spirit of selflessness found in the Teachings. She, herself, certainly is evanescent in her service, this Queen who possesses one of the keenest intellects, who is deeply intuitive, who is outspoken in her manner, penetrating in her testimony, and always courageous in her stand. She said: 'With bowed head I recognize that I, too, am but a channel and I rejoice in the knowledge.'

.......... The writer told Her Majesty how these open letters had been translated into scores of languages and ten million people in one continent alone had read them. She explained, too, what a balm they had been to those suffering persecutions for the Cause. This gracious Queen replied: 'I am very thankful; I take it as a sign that God accepted my tribute.'

.......... Her Majesty Queen Marie, continuing, said that one must begin this Movement with the younger generation. She thought that the best book to give out to people explanatory of the Teachings is Dr J.E. Esslemont's book, 'Baha'u'llah and the <span data-pg='122'></span> New Era'. When the writer asked her about the Balkans and how to promote all these principles of universal education, universal auxiliary language, the new solution of the economic problem by which every child in every country may have education and the welfare of the peasants be improved, she replied: 'The Balkan lands, being nearer the East, are always on the defensive; it is because they have been ill-treated, coerced and more betrayed by other countries. They become suspicious of anything that brings a new message, fearing it may be underhand, that there may be some ill motive back of it all. One can make a good beginning by showing them and all the rest of the world how comprehensive these Teachings are, how they hurt no one's feelings. The booklets and books should be well translated and well printed in these different languages.'

.......... The Queen has read nearly every book that has been published on these Teachings. She studies them and knows their truth. Several of these books were beside her.

.......... Her Majesty Queen Marie received with very great pleasure, that morning, the sacred gift which the writer had brought and presented from the dear Baha'is of far-away Mashhad, chief town of that Province in Persia. It was an illumined sheet, on which was inscribed a Prayer of Baha'u'llah. It was adorned and blessed in the centre with a lock of Baha'u'llah's own shining hair. She loved it and will have a frame specially designed for it, and in the oval she will place a small photograph of 'Abdu'l≠Baha, she so deeply appreciated this treasure. It is indeed a glorious gift, for no one else in Europe has a similar remem≠brance from Baha'u'llah. Speaking, too, of the illumined work, the polished gold of the letters, the Queen said: 'It is in the most perfect taste of all the Orient! I know how rare and beautiful it is!'

.......... Then Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana came into the drawing-room, accompanied by her brother, His Royal Highness Prince Nicholas. They had just come up from the Rumanian Church a little after ten o'clock. (Services are early in Rumania.) The Princess is very young, very beautiful; she is serious, she is sweet. One saw at a glance that she is much inter≠ested in spiritual realities. She invited the writer to come up to her room on the third floor for a little talk. The room of this Rumanian Princess was charming and full of sunshine. There <span data-pg='123'></span> were, perhaps, more than one hundred pink roses in the different gold bowls and in crystal vases; they gave an exquisite charm and fragrance to the apartment. On the walls were pictures from the life of Christ, a portrait of Jeanne d'Arc and two artistic companion pieces of maidens dancing on the greensward. Beside the long couch close to the three great and very high windows stood a little, low table for books, with shelves underneath for more books. Princess Ileana, like her mother, is a great reader. On this little table was a tiny photo≠graph of 'Abdu'l-Baha which she had received the day before. Here, also, was a brass bowl of delicate-pink fragrant roses. With her religious and other books she had nearly all the works of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha which are published in English. A very beautiful picture of Christ hung above her couch. In an open bay-window alcove, also flooded with sunshine, was her writing desk. It was well-arranged and one could see that it is a place where much work is done. She said to her visitor: 'I do not see how you ever get so much writing and other work done! I am obliged to get up very early, mornings, to get my correspondence finished.'

......... Then a little heart-to-heart talk followed. This young Princess is enthusiastic and keenly eager to help the thousands of girls in her country. She does wonderful work in the Young Women's Christian Association, the Girl Guides and in the Rumanian Church, and she will translate two little booklets about Baha'u'llah's peace principles into the Rumanian language. She is devoted to the work of the Rumanian Church and to the Rumanian people; she tries to work with them and for them. She spoke of having given 'Baha'u'llah and the New Era' to one friend at Court and she added: 'He said he read it and loved it!'

.......... Her brother, His Royal Highness Prince Nicholas, came in two or three times during the conversation. He is pleasant and delightful, and so devoted to his mother and sister; he helps them in everything which interests them. So the morning was spent, and when the writer was leaving, this dear Princess said: 'I will come down with you, perhaps you may not know your way.' Just then His Royal Highness Prince Nicholas came from his study, which was near. He swung into step with a grace and ease that showed he must have been doing it like that all his life, and, smiling and courteous, he came with his sister. <span data-pg='124'></span>

.......... This little outer visit to Palace Peleshor in Sinaia had an inner significance. The real audience with Her Majesty Queen Marie and her young daughter, Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana, was that souls met that day and spoke together of the realities of this life and of eternity. The Queen said to her children that morning, as the conversation turned to life and death: 'Papa knows; he sees that all we are trying to do is constructive.' Just how constructive for Rumania, for all the Balkans and all the rest of the world the study of these Teachings of Baha'u'llah for world understanding really is, the future will soon show. These Royal radiant souls are planting seeds of spiritual world cooperation which, throughout eternity, will bear harvests.[30]

	It was during this visit with Martha Root that Queen Marie indicated for the first time her desire to visit the resting-places of Baha'u'llah, the Bab and 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Holy Land. She also told Martha that she complemented her reading of the Bible with readings from the Baha'i teachings and she admitted that: 'I, too, am but a channel.' The reverence with which she accepted the sacred relic of the lock of Baha'u'llah's hair, as well as her deep appreciation, were apparent from her plans to have the gift beautifully framed.

	Martha was particularly pleased that the young Princess Ileana wished to translate several short booklets about the Baha'i Faith. Martha expressed her delight at the Princess's interest in a letter of 22 October 1927 to Shoghi Effendi:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I wanted to get to Bucharest at the time I had told Her Majesty Queen Marie I would be there...

.......... Shoghi Effendi, dearest Guardian, I feel so very happy that Princess Ileana is so deeply in earnest in our Cause. I feel she is a soul of light[31]

	Shoghi Effendi himself wrote to Martha On 25 October 1927 expressing his extreme joy at her visit to Romania:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I am in receipt of your most welcome letters dated August 30, 18, September 15, and October 14[32] and I am thrilled by the news they contained, particularly your remarkable and historic interview with the Queen and Princess. I am sending you a number of Baha'i stones under separate cover to be presented <span data-pg='125'></span> or sent by you on my behalf to the Queen, the Princess and any other member of the Royal Family who you think would appreciate and prize them. You have been surely inspired in all that you have said and done, and the power and guidance of Baha'u'llah have been clearly manifested all throughout your visit to Bucharest...
.......... [32. There is a discrepancy in the dates here. It is certain that there were incoming letters from Martha Root dated 30 August, 15 September and 14 October.]

.......... Please assure the Queen and the Princess of our great love for them, our prayers for their happiness and success and of our warm and cordial invitation to visit the Holy Land and be received at the Beloved's home. The Princess would be most welcome to write to me and I would welcome any message from her.[33]

	On 31 October Martha Root wrote to Ella Cooper a brief description of her visit in which she Once again mentioned her feeling that the Queen was a Baha'i:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Will try to get out a typed letter after 3 months, I can't now, but everything was glorious in Bucharest. Her Majesty Queen Marie invited me to her palace in Sinaia. She is more & more interested, she is a Baha'i. I met Princess Ileana & Prince Nicholas & Princess Ileana invited me to her room for a long talk. She too is a real Baha'i and deeply interested. They both study the Teachings every day. I loved Princess Ileana, she is serious sweet, spiritual & so longing to learn and to do & to serve the world. (If you read in the papers that she ran away with an officer of the navy, there was no truth in it, an enemy to their country sent that out. The time they sent it, was the time when I saw her and she asked me to come & talk with her and tell her 'how does one become a Baha'i?' I do not know about her love affairs, but I know she wasn't running away with any officer--she was thinking of the girls of her country and trying to study the Baha'i Teachings to help them.) She is translating the tiny blue booklet (of Roy's) into Rumanian. This is not for publication. I will write about the visit for the Star & also write a typed letter if I can. But I certainly feel deeply thankful over the results in Rumania. Poor Rumania is so upset, the Queen does not have an easy life -but she did not say anything about the politics. Ella, I love the Queen, I admire her, and I believe she will stand for Baha'u'llah's Cause to the end of her life. <span data-pg='126'></span>

.......... She was so lovely to me, she kissed me twice and put her arm about me. It was a heavenly visit to Sinaia.[34] Shoghi Effendi included some Baha'i ringstones with a letter he sent to Martha on 2 November 1927:
.......... [34. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Ella Goodall Cooper, 31 October 1927, National Baha'i Archives, Wilmette: Ella G. Cooper Papers.]

.......... I am enclosing for the Rumanian Queen, Princess Ileana and any other person who you may think suitable, various stones of the Greatest Name. I trust they will reach you safely.[35]
.......... [35. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 2 November 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Martha Root in turn acknowledged in a letter of 10 November that she was awaiting the ringstones and her delight at having the Guardian's appreciation of her visit with Queen Marie:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...I am so HAPPY that you think everything was done all right in Bucharest and that you approved about the little booklets. Your messages to the Queen and Princess are so lovely and so beautifully expressed I shall copy your exact words and write to them just as soon as I can. I think they will appreciate them very deeply.

.......... The stones have not come yet, but when they do I will send them with a letter to Bucharest, thank you so much...

.......... Shoghi Effendi, thanks I am 'serene in faith and inner joy', am happy even in troubles or illness, for even then there is so much that is heavenly, but now I am so very pleased that you liked the Bucharest visit and that you approved of those little books (I prayed about those books many hours and the opportunity seemed too great to let it pass unused.)[36]
.......... [36. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 10 November 1927, International Baha'I Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	The booklets mentioned by Martha are the ones that Princess Ileana had offered to translate.

	Five days later, on 15 November, Martha sent Shoghi Effendi a further letter:

[.]
[.//]
.......... One picture of Ileana is not quite so good so I do not send it. It is good but I prefer these I enclose. I think I should keep one because she has given it to me & I appreciate it so I keep the one that is a side view.

.......... ...here is such a beautiful letter from Ileana that I wish you to receive it by the touching day of the departure of our deeply loved 'Abdu'l-Baha Centre of our Covenant.

.......... You may have the 3 pictures as I do have one of her. You could write her & say I had told you of the translations--or say anything <span data-pg='127'></span> that I mentioned. I send you their letters sometimes to show you their sweet lovable hearts. I believe Ileana will be one of the great souls who will help you always, dearest Shoghi Effendi. I feel sorry for her. I see how hard she is trying. I love her! ...[37]
.......... [37. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 15 November 1927, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	The ringstones eventually reached Martha safely and she wrote the Guardian on 18 November 1927 from Bulgaria to acknowledge their receipt:

[.]
[.//]
.......... If the Queen and Princess Ileana spread the Teachings in Rumania and you can get a strong group in Bulgaria that will be a big help in the Balkans...

.......... I wrote Ileana & sent the stones which came two days ago. I also sent two stones to the palace here to King Boris and his sister, I felt the urge to do it. I thank you deeply for the beautiful stones, they will do their work. I told Ileana perhaps I would come to Bucharest after a year or two & stay 4 or 6 weeks & give many lectures just as now in Sofia. Shoghi Effendi, I pray to be true to Ileana that she will be to you what Qurratu'l-'Ayn was to Baha'u'llah -may she be your co≠worker in all the years ahead!...[38]

	In a letter of 30 December 1927 Shoghi Effendi conveyed through Martha a message to Queen Marie and Princess Ileana. The Guardian also explained to Martha how important and meaningful her work was:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The letters addressed to you by Princess Ileana are most gratifying indeed. They have brought tears of joy to the eyes of the Greatest Holy Leaf, who has learned to love you, to admire you, and to appreciate to the full the significance of your work for the Cause. I trust you will convey to her and to her mother our sincerest appreciation of their sustained interest in the Cause as well as of our continued prayers for their welfare and happiness...

.......... I am enclosing for you six Baha'i ringstones to be disposed by you as you think best. I am sure you do not realize what you are doing for the Cause of God. Only future generations can adequately appreciate the extent and significance of your present services, the circumstances under which you labour, and the stimulating influence you are exerting throughout the Baha'i world.[39]

	On 24 November 1927 Prime Minister Ion I. C. Bratianu died and Queen Marie lost an ally and an admirer. Romania was suffering from an ineffective Regency. The Queen Mother, as Queen Marie was now known, began to wonder if Carol's return might not solve many of the country's problems. Despite her disapproval of her son's behaviour, she maintained contact with him. He in turn made repeated attempts to discredit his mother and ruin her reputation, probably owing to his jealousy of her popularity. It was not long before the Queen Mother learned that Carol had gone to Britain from where he attempted a failed coup to return to Romania. He was expelled from Britain and in his anger he once again heaped blame on his mother.

	At the end of December 1927 Queen Marie visited the grave of her husband, King Ferdinand, at Curtea de Arges. Her observation made later that day in her diary described clearly her view of life after death:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The church was friezingly [sic] cold and my heart was glad within me to know that our dear one is not there beneath the cold slabs; glad to know that his spirit has gone to a happier home and that only his suffering body lies there all alone, his suffering body which he was allowed to strip off like a worn out garment that he needed no more.[40]
.......... [40. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished diary entry 24 December 1927, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	These words of 'Abdu'l-Baha echo beautifully the condition the Queen herself described:

[.]
[.//]
.......... To consider that after the death of the body the spirit perishes is like imagining that a bird in a cage will be destroyed if the cage is broken, though the bird has nothing to fear from the destruction of the cage. Our body is like the cage, and the spirit is like the bird. We see that without the cage this bird flies in the world of sleep; therefore, if the cage becomes broken, the bird will continue and exist. Its feelings will be even more powerful, its perceptions greater, and its happiness increased. In truth, from hell it reaches a paradise of delights because for the thankful birds there is no paradise greater than freedom from the cage.[41]
.......... [41. 'Abdu'l-Baha, {Some Answered Questions}, p. 228.] <span data-pg='129'></span>
[.///]
[.]

	No doubt Queen Marie would have been comforted by these words of Baha'u'llah:

[.]
[.//]
.......... And now concerning thy question regarding the soul of man and its survival after death. Know thou of a truth that the soul, after its separation from the body, will continue to progress until it attaineth the presence of God, in a state and condition which neither the revolution of ages and centuries, nor the changes and chances of this world, can alter[42]

1928

	Despite an ever busy schedule, Martha Root did not fail to remember little details. In a letter to Shoghi Effendi of 5 January 1928 she made a note next to the date that it was Princess Ileana's birthday.

	On 21 January Martha Root was travelling in Yugoslavia, Kingdom of King Alexander and Queen Marie [Mignon], daughter of Queen Marie. The Queen Mother also happened to be in Belgrade with Princess Ileana visiting the royal family, who had just witnessed the birth of their second son. Received by Queen Marie and Princess Ileana, Martha imme≠diately informed Shoghi Effendi of her momentous visit:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Thanks so much for letter and ring stones. All went wonderfully in Greece & here. I had tea in this palace yesterday with them. They are glorious souls will write [them] soon, you will be happy. They like the article I have written about Sinaia best. I send it to Star tomorrow. Am writing two more & they will read them before they leave from Bucharest on Thurs. Am so happy.[1]
.......... [1. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 22 January 1928.]
[.///]
[.]

	She wrote a more detailed letter a few days later:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Alla-o-Abha! Love to you and now I will write you about our Queen and Princess. I came to Belgrade and sent them a note by messenger on January 18, to the Royal Palace, that I had come and was praying with them for the Queen of Jugoslavia. Shoghi Effendi, I closed my eyes a moment and asked Baha'u'llah to write that note and He did--have no copy of it, but He spoke to them--and assured them. They received the note at 3.30 in the afternoon and the babe was born at 1.20 the <span data-pg='131'></span> next morning, the nineteenth. Saturday at noon came the note from Ileana: 'Mama and I would be so glad to have you take tea with us this afternoon at four thirty o'clock.' (Meantime as I had arrived in Belgrade without having written one word of the Sinaia story, I concentrated on that and had sent it to the Palace Friday evening.) I had felt so terribly not to have written it long before, but I COULDN'T and now it was better this way, for I put in lots more than I should have dared write if she had not been going to see it--and this way she knows all and it pleases her, and that is the way it should be, for it might be very embarrassing for her to be misquoted at a time when her country is in such a state.

.......... You can see from the first half of the story how beautifully everything went--the second half of the story is about what Ileana said and about little Peter, the Crown Prince, four years old who came in near the end and brought his little tea set (toys) to have a tea party with us. I will write this part and send it to you in a later mail.

.......... O Shoghi Effendi, it was--if this were possible--the very happiest time of all with them. I felt their LOVE and their deep confirmation in our Teachings. They are GROWING and they STUDY THE TEACHINGS! They asked about you and about the Greatest Holy Leaf and the Holy Mother and they asked about the progress of the Cause. The Queen sends you all her best love and just at the last when Ileana and I were alone she said to me: 'Would you please tell Shoghi Effendi I am only too pleased to do as much of the work as I can, and it is a great help to me to know, that at the Shrines, they pray for me.' She spoke about her sister, the Queen here and all the Court, and she said 'You see we have to work slowly, we can not do everything all at once!' But they know. I told the Queen Marie of Rumania that I had brought 'Divine Art of Living' as a little gift to the King and Queen and had inscribed a little message in it. Queen Marie said 'That is a fine book for her and she will read it while she is in bed these weeks. She will like it. She knows Ileana and I are very interested in this Cause and she IS FRIENDLY TOWARDS IT!' Ileana said: 'Oh, I'm so glad you brought that book, I love that one and I know my sister will too!'

.......... Then you see by Ileana's letter to me how she has spoken to Prince Paul and Princess Olga of Serbia who live at the Royal <span data-pg='132'></span> Palace, at least they are there and they are the Cousins of the King, and they invite me to come and speak with them about the Cause. Perhaps they will advise me and help me very much here. And perhaps more will happen!

.......... I said to Ileana: 'You see how Baha'u'llah answers prayers! I have tried so hard to get the Cause to Jugoslavia and have been praying for a year. Now suddenly you and your mother come to the Royal Palace for a month and take the Cause right to the King and Queen!' I said to the Queen earlier that my heart is tranquil even if I cannot do much in Jugoslavia, I feel she and Ileana have SOWED SOME SEED IN JUGOSLAVIA. She said: 'Well, it is a beginning, anyway!'

.......... Shoghi Effendi, I intend to try to do all I can here, and just stay till I do do something after all this good start. I am going to stay longer than I planned when I came. This is the moment to concentrate on Jugoslavia. I may spend money and get out that little sheet 'What Is the Baha'i Movement?' in Serbian. Maybe I can get Princess Olga to translate it, can't decide anything till I meet them.

.......... Shoghi Effendi, the Queen kissed this servant three times when she said good bye to her & she put her arm about her. Her love is very sweet, each visit to the Queen is holy, it isn't just because she is a Queen that you will be drawn to her, Shoghi Effendi, of course you know that, but her charm is ineffable, transcendent. It will be a great meeting when you and she speak together, if you are both just yourselves. She and Ileana will always be your friends, please tell the Greatest Holy Leaf that I think one of the greatest helps to Shoghi Effendi is going to be the friendship of these two souls. You know I do not mean anything 'personal' I mean spiritual comradeship--what Jesus felt for Mary Magdalene, and Baha'u'llah and the Bab felt for Qurratu'l-'Ayn. The Queen has everything which attracts, wonderful charm of soul, brilliant mind, inner vision, beauty-≠if Roy would express it he would probably say: 'She has a way WIZ her!' Your soul will like her comradeship, Shoghi Effendi, she is the kind of woman who can UNDERSTAND! I'm sure you find there are so many lovely people in this world who can't understand at all your tremendous task. She does.

.......... Ileana is a wholesome, sweet, cheerful, practical girl just eager to do all the [sic] she can... You helped me so MUCH when <span data-pg='133'></span> you shared with me your letter to the Queen and hers to you. I never mentioned it, of course, but I told her you quoted a line from her letter when you wrote me, about being the 'channel' and it was so beautiful I asked her if she would tell it to me and permit me to use it in this article and she was very willing.

.......... So now I am sharing just with you, my letters to them, or some of them, I could not copy all. There was not time. It was one big rush and vibrations were high and I had to get these articles ready and do a thousand things. They lead such busy life, it is not EASY to be a Queen or a Princess!

.......... When I went that Saturday afternoon, I took a box of lovely candy to Ileana and a bottle of wonderful Jacqueminot rose perfume for both of them and told them it was rose like that they will inhale when they go to the Shrine of Baha'u'llah and explained a little about the peace of that beautiful place. I took lovely rose--red roses--for I thought it is a time of JOY for the babe has come and mother and child are doing well. I took some Greek newspapers with the Baha'i articles in, for they wish to carry them to Bucharest for Princess Helen and King George to see, I took the 'Divine Art of Living' to the Serbian King and Queen and some little booklets and Tablets to Queen Marie and Ileana, took Ileana 'The Dream of God' by Dr Watson for she loves poetry. She was delighted to have it. But I took them--just to loan while they were here--my precious little black leather book with some of my most treasured Tablets, Prayers and Words from 'Abdu'l-Baha. It is a book I seldom show because it contains my Tablets from 'Abdu'l≠Baha, but it has some beautiful things that have never been published. I felt inspired to take it to them and they kept it until the evening before their departure. (They sent other things back and forth, but they kept that until the very last.)

.......... That Saturday afternoon I took a little present to the Crown Prince, and was so glad I did, for you see he came in and he was just as happy as any other little boy who gets a present. We were all happy together--but just think Shoghi Effendi I was fifteen minutes LATE! All those guards could not read the English note signed 'Ileana'. I was very nervous as those moments passed and those men were so slow!

.......... Shoghi Effendi, Queen Marie said to me: 'I want to give you a gift, I have brought it for you from Bucharest,' and she <span data-pg='134'></span> excused herself and went to her room which opened next and brought it from the table. It is a beautiful little brooch [here the letter contains a drawing of the brooch] it is two little wings set with chipped diamonds and one little diamond exquisitely set, it is wrought of gold and silver, loveliest work. I just love it and I said: 'How I should love to keep this! But you know, Queen Marie, I give away nearly everything!' She smiled and said, 'I know you do! You are just like Loie,' and then she told me about giving the locket to Loie Fuller.

.......... But when I came into my room, the tears were in my eyes, I said: 'O Baha'u'llah, I didn't mean it! I do not wish to keep what would help your blessed Cause. I did not keep the ring from the Greatest Holy Leaf and that was my most precious gift and I give You the brooch!'

.......... Then I looked at the brooch--in the presence of the Queen I had not realized how BEAUTIFUL it is, I could only see the QUEEN HERSELF that wonderful afternoon. Well I wear it all the time and it pleases me so much, but am trying to get the Guidance where it will count for most. I wondered dear Shoghi Effendi, if I could do this: Just send to the United States and say that I do not know its value in dollars (I would not profane it by taking it to a jeweller) but it is a CROWN JEWEL from the first Baha'i Queen of this whole world! I should like to give it as a gift to some one who gives four hundred dollars, one for the Bab, one for Baha'u'llah, one for 'Abdu'l-Baha and one for Shoghi Effendi, I always do everything by four, and of this money, one hundred go to the Temple in Chicago, one hundred to the Girls' School which the Holy Mother loves so much and where she gave the land in Haifa, and the two hundred go towards the Baha'i Cause in Rumania and we would give the two hundred to our Little Princess Ileana and let her decide how she would like to spend it in her country for Baha'u'llah. The Queen has taken the Cause to the whole world, why would it not be a gracious tribute for us to send that little offering to HER country! I am not selling the brooch, I am giving the brooch to the one who gives these gifts. I wished so much to give to that Girls' School, I am always thinking about that school, but my part perhaps is to keep on heralding the Cause, others will build the school, others perhaps who have not yet heard about our Cause. The brooch <span data-pg='135'></span> belongs to Baha'u'llah, may He please show us what to do with it!

.......... Please tell the Holy Mother that Princess Ileana thanked me so much for the birthday present of the book, the Life of the Holy Mother, and she said she loved it very much.

.......... ...Ileana was wearing the Baha'i ring and she shyly showed it to me. I took her hand and told her how happy I was to see it. She looked at my hand to see why I do not wear one. I did not explain where mine is. But it taught me something, I think I ought to wear a ring because it helps promote the Cause. Ileana had hers on the engagement finger which I thought was sweet for it shows how close to her heart our Cause is. Sometime I will explain how we wear it on the little finger, or when she sees me again or some other Baha'i she may see that we use the little finger. Anyway you will know, Shoghi Effendi, how it touched my heart to see her wearing the Baha'i stone, she is one of us, our precious little sister! I thank you so much for these stones you sent. I want to give one to Vuk Echtner, such a beautiful Baha'i boy in Praha, and perhaps you will think it is all right for me to use one, sometime, when I can get it set. People so often ask about the stone and it gives one an opportunity to tell them of the Cause. It is a joy and a protection. Just think how many times Ileana will explain this Baha'i ringstone to her friends! The stones you sent are so lovely, I am deeply grateful and thank you with all my heart.

.......... They both asked about my plan. Later when Ileana and I were talking alone, she spoke again and I said: 'These are my plans, but if you wished me to come to Rumania I would change and come, I would do anything you wish. But now your country is so upset it does not seem the time to lecture.' She said: 'Yes, I think you are right. Perhaps we better give out the booklets now in Rumania and have the lectures when you come sometime later.' I know, Shoghi Effendi, that things are in a great state in R--- but the Queen is not afraid to say what she <span data-pg='136'></span> thinks. You would admire her courage. That was about all we said, but you see it leaves it open if you should wish me to go there again, perhaps next winter. Please do not mention this, I would not wish people to say: 'Oh, yes, she is going again!'

.......... Beloved Shoghi Effendi, here too is something I only wish you to know: 'I never said to anyone that you sent me the money, never said to anyone that I paid for the booklets. They were, well I wrote you about them, but now I wish to tell you that I spent the remainder of the money here in Belgrade. I wanted to give them some presents and I was thinking, thinking should I spend the money! That night I had a dream: I dreamed I was trying to help a lady. I climbed up a high ladder, but it was so dangerous to step over and so far, I could not reach it. A young man stood there to help me, but I saw I could not step over sideways to that narrow, narrow ledge. I came down and went another way, climbed some narrow stairs and reached this narrow ledge. There was a dinner, a delicious fish dinner, but I saw this lady, and I thought, oh she has so much! Why should I spend my money to pay for her dinner! She was so hungry, but I did not pay and she did not have the dinner. Then as I watched her, I had such remorse I decided to go to my room and make her a cup of tea and bring her a little food. I did not know how to take the time, I was so busy, and my lecture came in just a few minutes, but STILL I did it. I prepared the tray and took the tea (a little meal not a DINNER) up those narrow stairs and along that narrow ledge, but then she was busy, she had to go and had no time to eat, so she passed and went away hungry, and my heart was hurting.'

.......... No one but you would understand me, dearest Shoghi Effendi, good people scold me, so I would never want THOSE people to know, they would say why spend so much money, keep it! but I went out next day and bought the gifts and used what was left after the booklets & used two of my own gifts. I gave the Queen some lovely blue silk to make a drape for her room, it is her colour and just what she loves. I gave her a little thing in soft green silk which I know she will like. Gave her two large bottles of perfume, one of the lovely rose and the other a kind she likes very much, gave her a branch of white lilacs (just the same kind of flowers I carried to her at our first meeting). I wrote her a little note and said these are from the Baha'is same <span data-pg='137'></span> as in the United States, no name, never anyone to thank, just sent with LOVE to our Queen.

.......... I sent Ileana five smaller bottles of lovely perfume for her to have one (then of course she will have the bottle of rose which I took that Saturday, so she too will have two bottles of perfume, but not large bottles like her mother's. I gave the QUEEN the greatest). Then I wrote in the note to Ileana that she might like to give one bottle to her sister, Queen Marie Mignon and one to little Peter which he would share with his baby brother, Andrew, and then perhaps she would like to take one each as a little gift to Princess Helen and to Queen Elisabeth of Greece. I gave Ileana pink carnations and everything was tied with pink ribbons. The Queen's were done up lovely with gold ribbons and others with sunshine-yellow satin ribbon. They looked lovely! I sent a red carnation to little Peter. Then I gave Ileana a white tissue paper package with NINE beautiful, perfect tangerines. They were in a little mound, with fern fronds under, just as if they were served on the green ferns. On the card I wrote that tangerines like these grow in 'Abdu'l-Baha's beautiful garden in Haifa, and the card had the figure 9.

.......... There was great excitement, the Lady in Waiting was ill, some said they were going, others said they did not go! I sent a little note to Ileana at the Palace (to tell her I would pray for her faithfully this little Prayer she asked me) told the messenger to bring the note back if she had gone. He came back saying the Royal Party had left at seven o'clock that morning for Bucharest! So dear Shoghi Effendi, when Ileana sent the little book back and this note asking me to pray for her, I sent the gifts back by her messenger--my boy was just at the door to start, so my boy carried Ileana's and the King's messenger carried the gifts for our Queen. So the Queen and Princess would start on their journey with the love and gifts and every≠thing was just right, not too late, not too early. So everything has been happy and the perfume of the visit will I hope be a happy memory. The Queen loves perfume very much. Just between you and me, Shoghi Effendi, while they have palaces and jewels and all those things, I do not think they have such lots of money. So now if you write and tell me you approve and if you had been here you would have done just the same, my <span data-pg='138'></span> heart will be so happy. Life is so SHORT! Dangers are so many! We might not always have our Queen, and opportuni≠ties do not come every day. If Mary Magdalene had given the precious ointment out a drop at a time, Christ would have been crucified and the great opportunity GONE! Every day I watched the post, if that dear ABA had come from the precious friends in Baghdad, I would have given that too! But it has not come, so perhaps it was not meant!

.......... Beloved Shoghi Effendi, this servant loves you so much! May she not hope that you will be very happy and think all was done under Baha'u'llah's Guidance! One has to act so quickly!

.......... When her Majesty Queen Marie comes to Haifa and visits Shoghi Effendi, I believe he may write: 'Martha, you were mistaken! You sent the CROWN JEWEL to Haifa not to the United States!'[2]

Belgrade
January 23, '28

To your Gracious Majesty
Queen Marie of Rumania

O our Beloved Queen!

.......... Alla-o-Abha! The happiness of seeing you and Princess Ileana on Saturday was one of those great moments in life. I can not express through words my deep thanks for yourself, your beautiful inspired self. But I know you will understand that all my life, I shall love and serve others more tenderly, more understandingly, because I could meet and know your soul, and I saw the reality of Ileana's dear spirit!

.......... Baha'u'llah in His Bounty and for a reason, arranged this meeting. It will be a tea party for the whole world! It will refresh souls in every land! And every country will love your friend, Loie Fuller the more. Oh, how I love her now that I know, and I will pray for her each day, that Chosen and Favoured Angels will be her companions and that Baha'u'llah, in His Beauty, will <span data-pg='139'></span> give her one of the highest Stations in His Kingdom. She will help us here too! She is near, she is not far from us. She will continue to help you 'be a strength to the world'.

.......... About the dear gift, beloved Queen, that afternoon, I was so happy seeing you, I could not quite realize what a wonderful treasure you gave me. I knew how I loved it, your gift, and the symbol of those little wings pleased me so much! I said: 'Oh, I hope I won't give it away! I want to keep it always!'

.......... When I came back to the hotel before taking off my hat, I held out both arms to Baha'u'llah and prayed: 'O Baha'u'llah, I didn't really mean it, my inner heart wishes you to have the jewels, my highest joy is to feel that our Queen and this servant give the brooch to you, Baha'u'llah!'

.......... Then when I looked at this precious brooch, I felt that if you had searched a lifetime you could not have chosen anything that would have pleased me so much as this: it glows with a hidden fire; its wings suggest soaring, it adorns, delights! And it is very modest! Dearest Queen, I shall wear it joyously for a time -it gives beauty and refinement to others as well as to me. When people ask me about it, I will tell them of you our beloved Baha'i Queen (it will be a second little 'teacher' travelling with me!) but some day if a great urge comes to part with it in his Name and for His Cause, I will kiss it and send it on to its destiny! It will always carry blessing this glowing gift of LOVE! My heart thanks you, beloved Queen.

.......... Wearing the 'sacred fire' with its beauty, I prayed for you both, and just cried for joy that Shoghi Effendi has two souls like you! He works so hard, his responsibilities are so heavy and you have been his greatest help. I love to think how much happiness you bring to him!

.......... Beloved Queen, some day you will be led to the Holy Land. When you meet our precious Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, it will be one of the thrilling spiritual events even in your wonderful inner life. He is so great in spirit, so penetrative in his vision, so lovable personally, spiritually, and so just, you and Princess Ileana will find that Shoghi Effendi will bring a very great something into your lives.

.......... I feel, O great Queen, that you have the very greatest journey of your life still ahead! Baha'u'llah will pour His Knowledge into your heart. You have come into this world at His Call! <span data-pg='140'></span> At His Shrine He will speak to you. I love you so! I thank you for the kisses!

Most humbly, In His Covenant

Tea with a Queen and a Princess
Martha L. Root

.......... {Miss Martha Root, coming up from Greece to Jugoslavia, arrived in Belgrade, the capital, on January eighteenth. She knew that Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania and Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana of Bucharest were in Belgrade. She had written them she was going to Jugoslavia and the Princess had sent a note saying that they, too, would be in Belgrade early in January. They were at the Royal Palace, guests of Their Majesties King Alexander I and Queen Marie Mignon. The Jugoslavian Queen is the daughter of Queen Marie.--Editor}

.......... Going out into the principal thoroughfare of Belgrade, Kralya Milani, on Thursday morning, January nineteenth, one saw at a glance that it was a fete and the throngs were wild with joy. 'Why are all the people so happy?' the writer inquired, and a man who knew German replied in that language: 'A little Prince is born at the Palace!' So the little Prince had come! the second son to the King and Queen of Jugoslavia! This American visitor was so happy she said: 'I, too, am Serbian today, for I'm just as delighted as you are! Only I wish my education were Serbian, then I could read all these newspapers which have the Queen Marie Mignon's pictures on the front pages!'

.......... This was Thursday and Saturday came a little missive from the Royal Palace: 'Mama and I would be so glad to have you take tea with us at half past four,' and was signed, 'Ileana'. Then this is what happened; the writer who arrived at the gates of the Royal Palace five minutes before the hour was met by stern guards standing straight and unbending in their red and blue Serbian uniforms, and why not! They had two little Princes to take care of now! Then secret service men appeared quite <span data-pg='141'></span> unheralded and they escorted the caller to an office of the Superintendent situated to the right and still outside the grounds. There three stalwart officials in full uniform and several decorations carefully examined this little note signed 'Ileana' and written on the Royal stationery with the wide black border of mourning. One of the men then quickly took the visitor through what seemed to be a private gateway into the Royal Gardens, and with his hands he motioned back, the writer does not know whom or what, for she was looking straight ahead to the palace. Passing by several soldiers of the Guard, who bowed profoundly, she was taken through the Royal Palace entrance hall, then through a reception room up into another reception apartment where the rugs, the furnishings, everything was in splendid Serbian art designs, for this palace is new and its decorations are very interesting. A pleasant attendant with kindly eyes and dressed in the picturesque Montenegran costume with its wide, red, softly twisted girdle, helped her off with her wraps, and another attendant in conventional black took her up in an elevator.

.......... Rare for her, she was in panic because all this formality had made her a little late--and to be late to meet a Queen and a Princess! Upstairs suddenly she halted at the door of the lift, before coming out. Downstairs she had taken off the white kid glove from her left hand to arrange a nosegay, a moment more and she would have forgotten to put it on before entering the Royal drawingrooms! Still she remembered in time and slipped it on while the attendant in the stately black cloths had to smile and she did, too! Hurrying from the elevator to the apartments of her Royal Hosts an inner poise came, a glad ecstatic happiness, for she was going to meet them again!

.......... A cordial, low voice called as she came through a little reception room into the drawingroom where her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania and Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana arose to greet her.

.......... How dear they were! The Queen was perfectly beautiful in her black gown with its myriad draperies and the soft cream-whiteness of the bands about her head and the wide cream cuffs on the smart sleeves. Long strands of pearls heightened the pleasing effect. She was very happy, one could see in her smiling eyes how delighted she was that her daughter, Marie <span data-pg='142'></span> Mignon, and the new babe so fresh from God had come safely, this little Princeling for whom everyone had been anxiously waiting for nine days! Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana was smiling and looking very girlish in her frock of black wool.

.......... It was a wonderful tea party in that great drawingroom, all in soft grey furnishings with a few American Beauty-red roses in vases here and there. Later, during the hour Her Majesty Queen Marie spoke of the passing of her dear friend Loie Fuller. The guest asked if she might quote the words and send them to 'The Baha'i Magazine, Star of the West'. The Queen said: 'Yes, you may, but do not call it an interview with me, it is only a talk with you.' One could see how this great Queen, grand-daughter of the Czar Alexander II of Russia and grand≠daughter of Queen Victoria of Great Britain had truly loved and deeply appreciated the friendship of Miss Loie Fuller, sometimes spoken of only as 'the dancer'. 'It was the essence of soul in our friendship,' said Her Majesty, 'it had nothing to do with our situation in life, the fact that I was a Queen and she was a dancer. She was a creator of marvellous colour effects. She had one of the biggest minds of our century, and Loie Fuller was one of the most selfless women who ever existed. We knew each other for twenty-five years, through our fundamental love for humanity. She worked for me to help me be a strength to the world. Why can't we see the essence in each human being and not just the outside circumstances?'

.......... 'Well, since the death of Loie Fuller she is colossally recognized as the goddess of light and as the creator of marvellous dances which were a great contribution to art. Not only that, but she is honoured for her great work towards peace.'

.......... 'Inwardly I am free, I am not like those who have not the courage to see! Sometimes I write, and as I thought of the people who are not nice to me -(you see I have written it here) I would infinitely rather be nice to them while they are not nice to me, because if I'm not, I shall always be ashamed of myself for not being nice, yet I shall always be able to forgive them!'

.......... The conversation later again turned to incidents in Loie Fuller's life. The Queen related how Miss Fuller was always interested in getting museums started, thinking it helped bring better understanding among countries. Then a little incident came up about gifts and treasures and Her Majesty said: 'That <span data-pg='143'></span> was just like Loie, she always gave away everything, she kept nothing for herself! I once gave her a golden locket which had been a gift to me from one of the Emperors of Russia. In it was a little ivory miniature of me which she loved best. It was perfect and all hid in this little case of gold. To make her accept it, I said: "you wear it Loie, and then you can leave it to one of your museums!" It was stolen from her the next day, and she told me it was just a sign that she not possess anything just for herself alone!'

.......... The writer asked Her Majesty if Miss Fuller had known about Baha'u'llah's principles for peace, the Baha'i Movement? She said she did not know, but that Loie Fuller was very internationally minded in religion. 'I didn't have any opportunities in the United States to talk with her about these spiritual matters.'

.......... Then the Queen spoke about the real meaning of God and true religion and her Majesty made this wonderful statement:

.......... {'The ultimate dream which we shall realize is that the Baha'i channel of thought has such strength, it will serve little by little to become a light to all those searching for the real expression of Truth.'}

.......... Then Her Majesty Queen Marie was called to the room of her daughter, Her Majesty Queen Marie Mignon. She said good≠bye very tenderly and asked the writer to give her greetings to all the dear friends.

.......... Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana did not need to go upstairs to her sister. She said: 'I am free until my little nephew comes, then I shall be busy.' She told the writer about her Girl Guide work in Rumania. Her own words were: 'In Rumania the Girl Guide work is the one thing best for all grades of society. Perhaps you know, it was started by the Americans. Our girls always speak of the American secretaries with great love.'

.......... The Princess said there are two thousand Girl Guides in Bucharest alone, and there is a centre in Jassy. She added: 'And very soon we hope to organize the work in Constanza [Constanta], our port. Yes, and we have large canteens for working girls and a big canteen for workmen where about one thousand men can eat a whole meal for less than a sixpence!' <span data-pg='144'></span>

.......... Just then her darling little nephew, Crown Prince Peter, four years old, came in with his toy cups and saucers to have a tea party, too. He is a charming little boy, very slender, very alert. The Princess asked him to tell the writer whom he has upstairs to play with, thinking he would announce his new little brother whom he already loves devotedly. Instead he quickly said: 'Oh upstairs I play with my grandmother, with my Mama and with you!' and he smiled his happiness. Then he at once kneeled down on the rug by the table and became very busy arranging his cups and saucers and preparing his own party.

.......... So the Girl Guide conversation was continued: the writer liked what Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana said about the spiritual work with the girls. She said: 'The spiritual work with the girls is going beautifully, it is the most advanced part I can speak of. I also wish to have a physical department, but our work is not developed enough for that yet. We have some colonies (summer camps) in the mountains now, and we hope to start one by the sea if we can get the money to do it.' She explained how the girls can go for a month's holiday to these camps. She spoke especially of the Young Women's Christian Association and of the Children's Red Cross, for she is an indefatigable worker in both. She said: 'I think all these are very excellent to get at everybody generally, it is good for racial amity. But individually no activities compare with the more organized work of the Girl Guides. In the Girl Guide organi≠zation, one works directly with the girl--her heart, soul and brain.'

.......... The Princess also spoke with deep insight and love of the Young Women's Christian Association. She says it is under the patronage from the Rumanian Orthodox Church, and that both Orthodox and Protestants can be members. She explained: 'The Y. W. C. A. girls often come and sing in our Church (The Rumanian Orthodox Church). I find that girls of all sorts come into the Young Women's Christian Association. They come with great interest though often protesting, and sometimes just a bit sneeringly, but they soon change their attitude, because of our simple cheerful way. Sooner or later they become very good members.'

.......... 'I love my work very much indeed, and it has often helped me when I found things difficult both inwardly and outwardly.' <span data-pg='145'></span>

.......... This inspiring and very young Princess is the great ideal of the girls of Rumania. It IS certainly fine that she studies, thinks and works so hard to help the girls of her country. And though she only came to Belgrade, Jugoslavia, for a visit of three weeks she brought with her a great number of good books--books on religion, universal peace and service--and she loaned them to her young friends. of the Jugoslavian Court. (She does not know It but the writer later saw the rare and splendid fruits and the happiness. which the. visit of Her Majesty Queen Marie and Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana brought to Jugoslavia).

.......... Now suddenly the little Crown Prince has finished his play. He has gathered and put into the box all the toy cups and saucers. He stands up close beside the Princess and says: '0 Auntie, why does it take, you so long to eat?' and her Royal Highness replies to him: Because, Peterkins, we are almost as bad as you are sometimes, we talk instead of eat!' So very soon we three walked through the great hall where the Crown Prince Peter's little automobiles were waiting for him, but he passed them by, he wished to go upstairs to his little brother. Her Royal Highness held his left hand in hers, she took the writer's hand in her right and in a good-bye that will never be forgotten, she pledged her service, saying: 'I am only too pleased to do as much of the work as I can!' Thus came to a close this truly royal tea party![4]

	This was Martha Root's third meeting with Queen Marie of Romania and It appears quite extraordinary that the Queen and Princess Ileana took time from their busy family visit to receive her. During this visit Martha also met the young Crown Prince Peter, then four years old. Princess Ileana explained to Martha her deep commitment to the Christian work for young women and girls, the type of charitable work that many royal and other influential personages engaged in during those days. The work was rewarding and had been developed over a long period of time and it was thus very organized. It is quite understandable that Princess Ileana would have found this involvement more fulfilling than the slow work of the still infant Baha'i Revelation in the late 1920s. Compared with the work of the Baha'is, the results of <span data-pg='146'></span> Christian charitable efforts were much more visible, more obvious, and there was much being done in the area of social and economic development. Those engaged in and committed to the Baha'i Faith did not have the opportunity at that time to involve themselves in such creative activities, as the Faith was still little known and required propagation. Even today the social structure of the Baha'i Faith is still very much in development and this can be frustrating to new believers who are used to the social activities of the Christian churches.

	In April 1928 Queen Marie and Princess Ileana visited Cyprus and were the guests of Sir Ronald Storrs, Governor of the island. Sir Ronald had been a friend of 'Abdu'l-Baha and had through this relationship come to know Shoghi Effendi as well. The Guardian sent a telegram to Sir Ronald on 11 April:

Both her Majesty and Her Royal Highness the Princess Ileana are, as you may possibly be aware, greatly interested in the Movement.

.......... I enclose, for your interest, copy of the speech I hope to deliver to-morrow, together with my best wishes for a happy <span data-pg='147'></span> and prosperous Nu Ruz for yourself and Bahais all over the world.

	On 5 May 1928 Shoghi Effendi wrote to Martha Root acknowledging her report of her Serbian visit with the Royal families, informing her of his contact with Queen Marie through Sir Ronald Storrs and explaining the publicity the Cypriot visit had generated:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Your marvellous and historic interviews with the members of the. Rumanian and Serbian Royal families have inspired and thrilled us all, and their memory will illuminate the path of many a pioneer worker in future. The Rumanian Queen and her daughter Ileana were lately in Cyprus and were the guests of General Storrs, the Governor of the island. I cabled through him on behalf of the family and friends of the Master our deep and 'heartfelt appreciation of the noble tribute paid by them both to the ideals that animate the Baha'i Faith'. They transmitted their appreciative reply through General Storrs, who wrote me on their behalf. The papers here published the news of their intended visit to Haifa but nothing official or direct was received from them in this connection. The news, however, which has been widely circulated, has created a deep impression in all circles, and has greatly stimulated interest and inquiry among all classes both far and near. I wonder whether they had in mind such a visit and whether these premature disclosures deterred them from accomplishing their intended pilgrimage.[7]

	What joy Shoghi Effendi must have experienced at the thought that Queen Marie might carry out a wish expressed several times in her meetings with Martha Root to visit the Holy Land and pray at the Shrines of Baha'u'llah, the Bab and 'Abdu'l-Baha. How the press learned of the possibility is unknown. Even though the visit did not in the end take place, the Guardian was delighted that the press coverage provided further public acknowledgement of the association of the <span data-pg='148'></span> Queen with the Baha'i Faith and thus increased the Faith's prestige in some eyes.

	Always deeply interested m the translation and publication of Baha'i literature, Shoghi Effendi made the following request of Martha Root through his secretary on 19 October 1928:

[.]
[.//]
.......... He also wants you please to send a few copies of the booklets translated by H.R.H. Princess Ileana.[8]

	Martha Root spent the next seven months almost exclusively in Germany and then decided to request approval to go once more to Romania. Shoghi Effendi cabled her on 28 June 1929:

	With the situation deteriorating in Romania and the Regency continuing to be ineffective, the Dowager Queen was offered the possibility of becoming one of its Regents upon the death of Chief Justice Buzdugan. Efforts were made by Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu to convince her that her son Prince Nicholas must step down as Regent, as two members of the royal family in the three-member Regency would not be acceptable. Her refusal to accept the position is another strong indication of her unconditional love for and faith in her children, as she felt it best to leave this responsibility with Nicholas, who continued to carry it out ineptly and with indifference.

	The Great Depression which was sweeping Europe did not spare Romania, whose population was mostly rural agrarian, and hardship fomented increased discontent. The country was plagued by strikes, which further disrupted life for most. Martha Root's third visit to Romania occurred during this time. She was also greatly looking forward to a visit to the Holy Land but Shoghi Effendi's cable of 17 September 1929 requested her to make a temporary sacrifice for Romania: <span data-pg='150'></span>

[.//]
A Visit to Queen Marie of Rumania
Martha L. Root

.......... Her great and beloved Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania, the first Queen in this new universal cycle of civilization to arise promoting the Principles of Baha'u'llah for better world understanding, invited the writer for the fourth time into her presence to meet her and her youngest daughter, her charming Royal Highness Princess Ileana. The other audiences had been in Cotroceni Palace in Bucharest, in Pelisor Palace in Sinaia and in the Royal Palace in Belgrade when Her [M]ajesty was visiting there.

.......... But this fourth visit was the most lovely, unique and happiest of them all. It was an invitation to her summer palace 'Tenha≠Yuva' at Balcic, on the Black Sea.

.......... O reader, take the mental automobile and accompany me, and you will journey into a new landscape; see an extraordinary palace, marvellous architecturally and absolutely beyond compare in colour harmonies. It was designed by the Queen <span data-pg='151'></span> herself and it expresses her ideal of a little home to dwell in where every member of the household can live in perfect poise and joy and can be alone when he or she wishes to be. The palace is built on sheer, sternly rising. white cliffs overlooking the Black Sea, a sea so melodious in its surging, so malachite green at the foot of the cliffs, so black in the distance far out where it mirrors the low-hanging deep blue clouds.

.......... No one except Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania would have dared attempt to build a palace on that glorious but almost impossible site. I am sure no one except Her Majesty Queen Marie could have persuaded her husband and the Rumanian Ministers to let her try to do such a thing! But they must have been exceedingly proud of this splendid triumph; and proud of their Queen who had the brains, the courage, the architectural genius, the colour fineness to create this most original and fair 'pearl' of a palace, 'set' in the platinum grey of perpendicular rocks, and nearly circled by the sea. It is the most unusual setting and the most unusual palace in Europe.

.......... The writer was so longing to see Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania that she could hardly notice the exterior life of Balcic wonderful as it all was. Only subconsciously she noted and was pleased that this tiny little village of Balcic stretching around the rocks like a prelude to the palace setting, had flags flying at every door in honour of their precious Queen.

.......... She sat alone in the motor car halted at the royal entrance gate while her card was being sent on to the palace in the distance.

.......... Suddenly a bugler comes out on the cliffs far above and to the right and began to playa welcome. Yodelers on still higher rocks echoed the sweet sounds. What a hospitable welcome from a Baha'i Queen to the messenger who is bringing the greetings from the Guardian of the Cause Shoghi Effendi and the devoted good wishes of Baha'is from every land!

.......... The Commissar of the palace met the guest and showed her to a charming little palace which she thought was the Queen's home, but no, It was the guest palace! There are several little palaces so each one can have his own quarters here at 'Tenha≠Yuva.' There in the guest palace the writer was shown into a room full of autumn colours so warm, so vivid so fresh and vibrant with beauty! Surely the Queen must have arranged these flowers, they were so exquisite. I felt she had been there <span data-pg='152'></span> and placed them herself and her presence had blessed the apartment.

.......... The other guests came from their rooms and we went down the stone steps, admiring each terrace gay with perfect flowers, not too many but growing just in the right places. A pumpkin vine with its flat, round, yellow fruit rested over the roof of a little rest house. Blue larkspurs were charming along a yellow-grey wall and thousands of burnt-orange zinneas [sic] massed the lower terraces. Passing a great oak tree bending far out over the sea and just back of it a stream of sweet water, we came to the palace which is just at the edge of the sea.

.......... It is wondrously beautiful.

.......... In the long wide entrance hall with its white side walls adorned with tile mosaics in rare blue, the great dark oak table has a collection of very historic old pewter vases, pitchers, and bowls from Turkey. Brilliant red zinneas mixed with gold were the flowers in bowls here, giving just the rich touch of colour that brought out the beauty of the art treasures and furnishings.

.......... Then we go into the diningroom where the great windows overlook the sea. Such a diningroom! There colour and grace and harmony play together and please every eye. The long dark oak carved table is set with a Chinese blue silk cloth embroidered with silver eagles, and arranged on this are low bowls of glowing gold and orange-bronze flowers, rare silver pieces and crystal. The open fireplace has a cheerful warmth to offer and the whole room breathes welcome and great comfort With beauty unsurpassed. The walls are white and the furniture black walnut richly carved. Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana was here with some other friends who have come in just ahead of us. She was so friendly, so radiantly well, so beautiful and happy. She was dressed in her naval costume for she had just come in from the sea. She had on a white silk tailored shirt With collar and tie, a blue military coat trimmed with gold braid, a short cloth skirt and grey hose. The sister of Her Majesty, Princess Hohenlohe, who came from her feudal castle, Langenburg, in Wurtemberg, German~, was a guest that day:

.......... As all were conversing, I saw a moving sunshine-yellow silk curtain which was hung at the window back of the circular arch and in that moment down the circular open stairway, pausing in the white arch, came her dear Majesty Queen Marie of <span data-pg='153'></span> Rumania. She was beautiful, a little pale, and very slender. She was dressed in black with touches of white at the throat and cuffs of white peeped through the wider openings of her graceful black cloak or aba. She wore the wonderful ropes of pearls and each ear was adorned with one large round pearl. Her Juliet or rather Marie headdress was of white silk. One does not think of naming this Queen's attire as 'clothes'. They are not something that she just 'puts on'. They are a tout ensemble creation chosen by a consummate artist to express her moods, her spirit.

.......... People may say she loves clothes, but perhaps she is not dressing Just for herself, but for eyes to see perfect art and perfect beauty. She is born a great artist and to her it would be a crime not to express beauty in everything she arranges in her home. Certainly her gowns and her furnishings--some of which are very expensive and some inexpensive--delight and uplift every passing eye.

.......... But it is the lofty. great spirit looking out through the windows of her beautiful eyes that one sees first, and last, and remembers longest. She greeted the Baha'i visitor graciously and invited her to sit beside her at her left at table. Her Majesty's sister sat at the right. The conversation which was general, was in English, French and German. Her Majesty sat at one end of the great table and Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana at the other.

.......... Her Majesty in a little interlude explained to me that 'Tenha≠Yuva' is a Turkish word and means 'a solitary nest'.

.......... 'I saw the beautiful tree leaning over the sea,' she said, 'and the sweet water stream flowing back of it. The tree and the stream decided me to build here.'

.......... In the distance we saw the little yacht of her Royal Highness Princess Ileana close. to the warship and Her Majesty said: 'It is not really a yacht; It is a yawl and it is called {Isprava}, that means a {happy adventure}.'

.......... Then the conversation flowed back to other topics. Several kings and presidents were spoken of and each time Her Majesty praised their work for this generation. When the writer spoke of President Thomas G. Masaryk of Czechoslovakia what a savant he is, and how much he is admired and loved in university circles of Europe, Her Majesty responded: 'Yes, he <span data-pg='154'></span> is loved everywhere. He is one of the great humanitarians of this century.'

.......... Later in the luncheon conversation one of the men present said jokingly: 'Well, Ileana, what Prince have the newspapers engaged you to today?' 'Every day my poor Ileana is supposed to marry some one else!' said the Queen. 'I shall not let her go away in a hurry, if I can help it.'

.......... The writer told them of a country where the young men said: 'If you do meet Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana, tell her we all wish her to marry our King!'

.......... Anyway, whoever wins this sweet and serious girl will find that underneath the fun and gayety [sic] is a young woman who is trying her very best to help humanity. She is spiritual and her whole life is based upon religion. That is what impressed me most. She is genuine, very lovable, and she is full of enthusiasm.

.......... After the luncheon was over, Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania and Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana invited the writer upstairs to their drawingroom for a little talk alone, the others going over to the guest palace. Sitting in this glorious apartment overlooking the singing sea, the real meeting with Her Majesty and Her Royal Highness took place. The Queen asked about Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Baha'i Cause, and about the sister of 'Abdu'l-Baha, whose name is Bahiyyih, but who is known among the friends as the Greatest Holy Leaf. The Queen said she would like so much to meet them; she would like to go to Haifa and 'Akka and pray at the holy tombs of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha and visit the great prison where Baha'u'llah and His family and followers were imprisoned. Her loved Majesty said: 'Ileana and I will go to Egypt and Palestine this winter after the New Year and we shall surely go to Haifa.' Her Royal Highness Ileana told me: 'I am always looking forward to going to Haifa; I shall go when I can.'

.......... They asked about the long trip the writer is going to make to the Far East. Knowing that I came from Constantinople to bring the greetings of the Guardian and the friends throughout the world and to see her and say goodbye before I leave Europe and that I am returning at once to Constantinople, Her Majesty said: 'I hope as soon as you return you will be able to see the Ghazi Kemal Pasha. I know he has done such tremendous work for the development of his country, and he is so <span data-pg='155'></span> liberal in his thinking that the Baha'i Principles would lead him to that part he is still looking for--religion that is not fanaticism. The Baha'i Cause gives everything, without putting those barriers from which free thinkers with such difficulty have freed themselves. One is not chained by the Baha'i Teachings. There is a straight road to walk on in admitting all the great Prophets who have gone before.'

.......... Then we spoke of her lovely home in Balcic which she has created. No flowers in Constantinople or in Constanza were so fine as those grown in her cliff gardens (where it is difficult to grow anything). Her home designed by herself might almost be a holy house, for the tower rises up a little like those in the Rumanian churches. 'I love this home in Balcic so much,' she said, 'for in this region there are so many different nationalities united. We can smile on all equally and spread good understanding. Here in Balcic and round about no one has closed doors or windows to the country houses.'

.......... Mention was made of the Turks for there are some in that pan of Rumania, and Her Majesty added: 'I am very fond of the simple Turk. He is hard-working, frugal, honest and devoted.' Certainly the nationalities get along happily here.

.......... Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana has an atelier here in Balcic and she is modelling a Bulgarian, a Turk, a Rumanian and Russian. I was interested in this earnest and beautiful Princess who sat on the divan close to her mother.

.......... 'Whenever I have .a difficult mission which requires amiability and diplomacy, said the Queen, 'I send Ileana. I can always count upon her to do it as I would do it myself, and she has youth and strength, which are added assets. My daughter has a brave spirit to do. I can use for her the words in the Bible which I always use for myself: "Whatever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might."'

.......... Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana had to leave early. She was going out on the gunboat to do some manoeuvering, as she is just learning how to bring a ship to pier. 'The naval work is my pastime,' she said before she departed, 'but my real work is the Young Women's Christian Association and Girl Guides and I am very interested in all progressive social work, and all that will help for the future. I throw my whole soul into anything that will be helpful for the country.' <span data-pg='156'></span>

.......... They were so kind to give the photographs, autographed, which form the illustrations of this narrative. An Indian one (which may be published at another time) was taken in the United States, where the Indians called the Queen 'Morning Star, the woman we have always waited for!'

.......... Her beloved Majesty gave a beautiful picture to be sent to Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Baha'i Cause, and with it she sent a message of love and faith.

.......... And now, like the ceasing of music, the visit in its outer form comes to an end, but the Queen and the Princess, for whom Baha'u'llah and the Hosts of the Supreme Concourse have waited, have arisen to promote these Teachings for the New Day of God. One saw them doing it, right there in the little group of 'the solitary nest' and from those white cliffs that day went a message that may reverberate around the world and be acclaimed by the Angels of the Abha Kingdom![4]

	This time Martha's visit with Queen Marie and Princess Ileana took place in the splendid summer residence of Tenha-Juvah, a sort of Turkish pavilion which the Queen began constructing in 1925 on the Black Sea near the town of Balcic, now part of Bulgaria. Tenha-Juvah, meaning Solitary Nest, was a veritable haven for the Queen, with terraced gardens named after each of her children. Loving as she did the eastern influence, Queen Marie sought refuge in this spot where she could overlook the sea, where flowers grew in abundance and where she felt a spiritual affinity.

	Ever concerned about influential individuals having the opportunity to learn about the Baha'i teachings, Queen Marie mentioned to Martha how good it would be if she were able to pass on the message to the Turkish leader.

	The Queen reiterated her desire to visit the Holy Land and gave Martha an autographed and inscribed photograph of herself to present to Shoghi Effendi. She commented once again on the tolerant nature of the Baha'i Faith.

	Prompted by the receipt of the photograph, Shoghi Effendi wrote his second letter to Queen Marie on 3 December 1929, while Martha was visiting the Holy Land: <span data-pg='157'></span>

Her Majesty
The Dowager Queen Marie of Rumania
Bucharest

Your Majesty:

.......... I have received, through the intermediary of my dear Baha'i sister, Miss Martha Root, the autographed portrait of your Majesty, bearing in simple and moving terms the message which your Majesty has graciously been pleased to write in person. I shall treasure this most excellent portrait, and I assure you that the Greatest Holy Leaf and the Family of 'Abdu'l≠Baha share to the full my feelings of lively satisfaction at receiving so strikingly beautiful a photograph of a Queen whom we have learned to love and admire.

.......... I have followed during the past few years with profound sympathy the disturbed course of various happenings in your beloved country, which I feel must have caused you much pain and concern. But whatever the vicissitudes and perplexities which beset your Majesty's earthly path, I am certain that even in your saddest hours you have derived abundant sustenance and joy from the thought of having, through your glowing and historic utterances on the Baha'i Faith as well as by your subsequent evidences of gracious solicitude for its welfare, brought abiding solace and strength to the multitude of its faithful and long-suffering adherents throughout the East. Yours, surely, dearly-beloved Queen, is the station, ordained by Baha'u'llah in the realms beyond, to which the strivings of no earthly power can ever hope to attain.

.......... I have, immediately upon the publication of the second volume of 'The Baha'i World' by the American Baha'i Publishing Committee, forwarded directly to Bucharest, to the address of your Majesty and that of H.R.H. Princess Ileana, copies of this most recent and comprehensive of Baha'i publications. I will take the liberty of presenting in the course of the coming year the third volume of this same publication, which I trust will prove of interest to your Majesty.

.......... May I, in closing, reiterate the expression of profound appreciation and joy which the Family of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Baha'is <span data-pg='158'></span> in every land universally feel for the powerful impetus which your Majesty's outspoken and noble words have lent to the onward march of their beloved Faith.

.......... The Family also join me in extending to your Majesty, as well as to H.R.H. Princess Ileana, a most cordial welcome, should your Majesty ever purpose to visit the Holy Land, to 'Abdu'l≠Baha's home in Haifa, as well as to those scenes rendered so hallowed and memorable by the heroic lives and deeds of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha.
With deepest affection,

THE BAHAI PILGRIM HOUSE
CARE OF THE PERSIAN COLONY
HAIFA, PALESTINE

December 7, 1929

To your gracious Majesty
Queen Marie of Rumania
and your dear Royal Highness Princess Ileana
Bucharest

.......... O beloved Queen of all our hearts and precious Princess, Alla-ho-Abha!

.......... We all send you tenderest truest love and every day we speak of you and pray for you.

.......... Our loved Guardian Shoghi Effendi returned to Haifa on November 25. He is so radiant, so filled with the Power of the Holy Spirit, and his heart is so full of love, his insight is so great we just thank Baha'u'llah that we have such a Guardian as Shoghi Effendi. I know that you will love him and he will love you. It will .' be a great meeting when you come to Haifa.

.......... I arrived in the evening of November 25 and had the great joy to meet Shoghi Effendi and he lunched with us the next day at our beautiful new Pilgrim House. Then he went to Bahje to the Shrine of Baha'u'llah where he spent the night in prayer. The next day he returned and we had the most solemn and wonderful service in memory of the passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha. People came from many <span data-pg='159'></span> parts of the world, and in the very early evening we went up on Mt. Carmel. Prayers were chanted at the Shrine of the Bab, and at the Tomb of our beloved Centre of the Covenant 'Abdu'l-Baha. Then a tender service was chanted in the Garden amid the flowers and the lights. Tea was served and then all the friends returned to the Shrine of 'Abdu'l-Baha and prayers were chanted until two o'clock which was the hour of the passing of the Master (as multitudes of people so lovingly called Him.) It was a great baptism and a great moment in life to be there. Throughout eternity I shall remember the sweetness and the power of Shoghi Effendi's chanting. There was a heavy storm that night and Shoghi Effendi became ill with grippe and a very alarming throat. Four days ago the Doctor operated on his throat. Your picture dearest Queen was on his table by the bed in that hour, so you see you were with him in the hard hour as well as in the hours of joy. That same afternoon he wrote to you. (The Doctor said to take his writing materials and all his work away into another room but he would not permit his tables with his work to be removed. He keeps right on working.) We are praying very hard that he will soon be well. He is naturally very strong and has remarkable endurance.

.......... Yesterday I called upon the members of the Holy Family (but not on Shoghi Effendi, he is still too ill to see anyone). The Greatest Holy Leaf (sister of 'Abdu'l-Baha), the Holy Mother (wife of 'Abdu'l-Baha) and 'Abdu'l-Baha's daughters all said how happy they were to see the picture of our beautiful Queen Marie, said you have such a spiritual face and everything, your expression, the pose, the dress everything is so lovely. 'Abdu'l≠Baha's wife said: 'Her Majesty Queen Marie has the greatest riches, far greater than material wealth, for she has the hearts of all the Baha'is in the whole world. They are all loving her and speaking of her as our Queen.' They said: 'How happy Her Majesty Queen Marie must be! She however cannot realize what a great blessing it is to be the first Queen of the world to become a Baha'i. In future many Kings and Queens will be Baha'is, but her name will go down forever. People today still honour Constantine that he was the first King to accept Jesus Christ, so Queen Marie will be remembered with love all down the ages as the first Baha'i Queen of this universal epoch.' Perhaps you will never know until you reach the Abha Kingdom how phenomenal and glorious your work has been. <span data-pg='160'></span> In any country you are loved and your articles about the Cause are translated and spread. Every week since I saw you, I have seen articles about you and darling Princess Ileana, about your spiritual work. Everywhere I lecture comes the request please to tell them about Her Majesty Queen Marie and what she has said about the Baha'i Cause and then they ask about H.R.H. Princess Ileana. I know that all the Royalty in Egypt, the High Commissioner there and in Palestine and all the statesmen are becoming informed about the Baha'i Principles before you come, for they know you are interested.

.......... Precious Queen and Princess, this is a perfectly beautiful Pilgrim House (given by one of my dearest friends in Boston truly it cost so much he couldn't give it all, he has passed on and other devoted friends finished the work). It is palatial, pleasing colours, excellent bath, I think you and Princess Ileana would be very happy and comfortable here and they would love to have you as their guests. Shoghi Effendi would always dine with you and the place is just across the way from 'Abdu'l≠Baha's Home where Shoghi Effendi and the family of 'Abdu'l-Baha live. Your rooms would overlook the Holy Shrines of the Bib and 'Abdu'l-Baha on Mt. Carmel. Your balcony would overlook the ever changing ever charming Mediterranean Sea and directly in front of you is that holy White Spot 'Akka. There are dear little writing rooms where the sunshine pours in. So far the gardens are wonderful and each tray, each meal, is sweet and fragrant with a rare rose, or jasmine. The mandarins, the oranges are from His Gardens! You are welcome, very welcome, if you come here.

.......... In this Pilgrim House is a devoted Japanese young man named Fugeta who just knows how to do everything perfectly. There is a young woman from Melbourne, Australia Effie Baker, who will serve you with great efficiency, love and dear devotion. You will feel that Shoghi Effendi has arranged everything for your visit as only he or 'Abdu'l-Baha could have done it. My Dear Queen and Princess you will feel you have come home, come at last to the Home of your Lord! And when you rest your head at the Holy Threshold of Baha'u'llah's Sacred Shrine you will ~now you are in paradise and the cares, the hurts, the sorrows will all vanish away and only the Reality, the Love of God will remain. At This Threshold with your head bowed amid the jasmines <span data-pg='161'></span> you will hear with His Ear, see with His Eye, inhale the Fragrance of His Nearness, and drink His Cup. Such a peace will possess your heart, such a courage will come, such a joy to live and serve! And beloved Queen and Princess when you lift your heads from that dear Threshold perhaps you will find yourselves 'crowned'--for the jasmine flowers may cling to your tresses!

.......... Also you will feel 'Abdu'l-Baha taking your hand and speaking to you that He will always be with you when you kneel at His great Shrine.

.......... At the Shrine of the Bab you will feel His purity and His Sacrifice and the great longing to be worthy of all this spiritual heritage.

.......... I do not think that anything in this world would be more helpful to Shoghi Effendi this radiant youth Guardian of the Cause of the new divine civilization than to meet you, beloved Queen Marie. You can understand him, you will be en rapport with his ideals, his plans. You have the great honour and the great privilege to be his companion, his helper and co-worker in the establishment of this mighty new Day of God.

.......... History of this century may record friendships even greater than those of Mary Magdalene and Mary and Martha with Christ, it may record your eternal friendship with Shoghi Effendi, the first Guardian of the Cause of Baha'u'llah who so gloriously established the House of Justice, appointed the Hands of the Cause and promoted the divine word throughout every land. He needs you, and you need him. Your work is not with mundane affairs, some are called, but you are chosen!

.......... O blessed Queen and Princess, El-Baha be upon you in every thought, in every act of every day of your precious lives! Alla-ho-Abha!

With deepest warmest Baha'i love,
Most humbly in His Covenant,
your Martha Root

P.S. I leave soon for Baghdad and Persia. My address for letters is care of American Consul, Bombay, India.[6]

	This letter is particularly significant. Not only was it found among the Queen's papers, proving that she received it, but in it Martha clearly drew a comparison between Emperor <span data-pg='162'></span> Constantine and Queen Marie. Had this statement not suited the Queen, no doubt she would have brought this to Martha's attention.

	It appears that some time between 7 and 24 December Martha wrote another letter to Queen Marie, probably sharing some of Shoghi Effendi's comments to the pilgrims visiting the Holy Land; however, this letter has not been found. Martha referred to this earlier letter in another dated 24 December, in which, always wishing to be very precise and accurate, she clarified some very minor errors made in her previous letter.

Beloved Queen:

1930

	Several months later Queen Marie and Princess Ileana made plans to visit the Middle East. The trip was originally intended to have been taken with the young man Princess Ileana was to marry but a scandal surrounding his past shattered many hopes. It IS unfortunate that so many envious people seem to delight in the misfortunes of others and this broken engagement brought out the worst in those who saw this as a way to discredit the Queen and her daughter. The Queen decided it would .be good for her young daughter to take the trip, primarily to get away from the unkindness to which they were both being subjected and to provide the Princess with a change of environment. They intended to spend some time in the Baha'i shrines and meeting Shoghi Effendi and the Holy Family, as is obvious from Queen Marie's letter of 10 February 1930 to her friend Roxo Weingartner and from subsequent letters and diary entries:

[.]
[.//]
.......... .... we [are off] on the 20th. From Alexandria we emmidiately [sic] make our trip to the Nyle [sic] and Cairo afterwards... I shall go to Haifa & Jerusalem returning to Roumania about the first week in April and stopping a day or two at Balcic before going to Bucarest... What an emotion it will be to go to Haifa and Acca. I wish we could have gone together.[1]
.......... [1. Unpublished letter of Queen Marie to Roxo Weingartner, 10 February 1930, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	It is unclear who began spreading the rumour about Queen Marie's 'conversion' but it was picked up by the press and enthusiastically reported. Various articles appeared in different newspapers in February 1930 all reporting essentially the <span data-pg='164'></span> same story resulting from Queen Marie's expressed intention to visit the Holy Land to pay her personal homage to the shrines of the Baha'i Faith and to meet Shoghi Effendi. Among the newspapers reporting this was London's {Sunday Express}:

[.]
[.//]
QUEEN CONVERT
TO BAHAISM
CREED WITH MORE THAN
3,000,000 FOLLOWERS

.......... Marie, the Queen Dowager of Romania, and grandmother of the boy King Michael, who is now on her way to Jerusalem, is understood to have recently become a convert to Bahaism. The Queen's new religion has more than 3,000,000 adherents of all creeds, and they describe their faith as a 'union of all other religions'. They declare that their ultimate aim is to bring about the spiritual unification of mankind. Bahaism was founded in Persia in 1844 by a young reformer who announced himself as The Bab (The Gate). An attempt on the life of the Shah two years after the Bab's execution, made by a fanatical follower of the faith, opened an era of martyrdom in Persia. Between 10,000 and 20000 men and women members of the movement were killed with barbarous cruelty. Many of the martyrs were sawn m two while others were blown from guns, strangled, or chopped in pieces. A remarkable feature of Bahaism has been the passion for martyrdom of its adherents. Persecutions have continued up to a few years ago, and in 1920 one Hadji Arab was publicly hanged for his faith by the authorities of Sultanabad, Persia. Wealthy Persians who embraced the faith were stripped of their possessions and flung into dungeons. The movement was established in London in 1911, and many converts were gained. Bahaism is also strong in the United States.[2]
.......... [2. 'Queen Convert to Bahaism', {The Sunday Express}, London, 2 March 1930. Although it is true that since the inception of the Baha'i Faith and that of its vanguard, the Babi Faith, many thousands of followers have given their lives as martyrs, the statement in this article that a 'passion for martyrdom' is one of the Faith's 'remarkable features' is inaccurate. Many Babis and Baha'is chose to suffer martyrdom rather than to deny their Faith but they were not encouraged to seek this sacrifice.]

Dear Sir,

.......... It has been brought to our notice that the Queen-Mother Marie of Roumania has lately become a follower of the Bahai Movement.

.......... In view of her proposed visit to the Near East, considerable interest has been aroused here both in the Bahai Movement itself and in the Queen-Mother as one of its disciples.

.......... We should very much like to publish an account of the Movement and its distinguished convert. You being the best informed person in the country on these matters, we should appreciate it very much if you would write the article for our paper.

We remain,

Dear Sir,

.......... This is to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 13th instant in which you express your desire to devote the columns of your 'Bulletin' to an account of the rise and progress of the Baha'i Faith.

.......... I feel that the best I can do is to send you under separate cover a copy of the latest edition of 'The Baha'i World', a production which portrays, fully and faithfully, the manifold <span data-pg='166'></span> activities as well as the essential character and purpose of the Faith of Baha'u'llah.

	This correspondence resulted in an article in {The Palestine Bulletin} on 18 February, once again quoting the open letters Queen Marie had written almost four years before and clearly demonstrating the editor's interpretation of the reference material provided by Shoghi Effendi:

[.]
[.//]
Queen Of Romania
May Become A Bahai

.......... The beautiful Queen Marie of Romania is coming to Palestine at the end of this month or early next month, unless her present plans are changed. Together with this news comes the report that the Queen Mother is to become a member of the Bahai and will visit Haifa for the purpose of meeting Shoghi Effendi the leader of the Bahai throughout the world. It will be remembered that a similar report, afterwards denied, of the conversion of the Ex-Queen of the Afghans to Catholicism and that had gone [sic] to Rome in order to be admitted into the Roman Catholic Church.

.......... The present rumour, however, is much better founded. Four years ago the queen wrote in the most whole hearted fashion in support of Bahais. 'A woman brought me the other day a Book,' wrote Queen Marie. 'I spell it with a capital letter because it is a glorious Book of love and goodness, strength and beauty. She gave it to me because she had learned I was in grief and sadness and wanted to help... She put it into my hands saying: "You seem to live up to His teachings." And when I opened the Book I saw it was the word of Abdul Baha, prophet of love and kindness, and of his father the great teacher of international good-will and understanding--of a religion which links all creeds. <span data-pg='167'></span>

.......... 'Their writings are a great cry toward peace, reaching beyond all limits of frontiers, above all dissension about rites and dogmas. It is a religion based upon the inner spirit of God, upon that great, not-to-be-overcome verity that God is love, meaning just that. It teaches that all hatreds, intrigues, suspicion, evil words, all aggressive patriotism even, are outside the one essential law of God, and that special beliefs are but surface things whereas the heart that beats with divine love knows no tribe nor race. 'It is a wondrous Message that the Baha'u'llah and his son Abdu'l-Baha have given us. They have not set it up aggressively knowing that the germ of eternal truth which lies at its core cannot but take root and spread.

.......... 'There is only one great verity in it: Love, the mainspring of every energy, tolerance towards each other, desire of understanding each other, knowing each other, helping each other, forgiving each other.

.......... 'It is Christ's Message taken up anew in the same words almost, but adapted to the thousand years and more difference that lies between the year one and today. No man could fail to be better because of this Book.

.......... 'I commend it to you all. If ever the name of Baha'u'llah or Abdu'l-Baha comes to your attention, do not put their writings from you. Search out their Books, and let their glorious, peace-bringing, love-creating words and lessons sink into your hearts as they have into mine. One's busy day may seem too full for religion. Or one may have a religion that satisfies. But the teachings of these gentle, wise and kindly men are compatible with all religion, and with no religion.

.......... 'Seek them, and be the happier.'

.......... On another occasion she wrote: 'God is certainly not the old Fatherly gentleman with a long beard that in our childhood we saw pictured sitting amongst clouds on the throne of judgement, holding the lightning of vengeance in His hand.

.......... 'God is something simpler, happier, and yet infinitely more tremendous. God is All, Everything. He is the Power behind all beginnings. He is the inexhaustible source of supply, of love, of good, of progress, of achievement. God is therefore Happiness.

.......... 'His is the voice within us that shows us good and evil.

.......... 'But mostly we ignore or misunderstand this voice. Therefore did He choose his Elect to come down amongst us upon earth <span data-pg='168'></span> to make clear His word, His real meaning. Therefore the Prophets; therefore Christ, Muhammad, Baha'u'llah, for man needs from time to time a voice upon earth to bring God to him, to sharpen the realization of the existence of the true God. Those voices sent to us had to become flesh, so that with our earthly ears we should be able to hear and understand.'[5]

	Eager for the Queen and her daughter to visit the Holy Land, Martha Root had sent some rosaries from there to the Queen. Shoghi Effendi enquired about these in his telegram to Martha of 2 March 1930, probably in order to learn whether Martha had had any recent communication from the Queen:

[.]
[.//]
MARTHA ROOT CARE MILANI, TEHERAN
HAVE YOU RECEIVED ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ROSARIES YOU SENT FROM HERE? WIRE ANY NEWS
LOVE.[6]
.......... [6. Unpublished telegram of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 2 March 1930, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	On 3 March 1930 Martha cabled the Queen about her projected journey:

[.]
[.//]
LOVE. FAITHFUL PRAYERS. HOPE YOU BOTH CAN GO HAIFA[7]
.......... [7. Unpublished telegram of Martha Root to Queen Marie, 3 March 1930.]
[.///]
[.]

	But the Queen's itinerary was destined to be altered. It seems a Queen could not be permitted to pay public homage to the founder of a new religion. On 6 March she wrote to Roxo Weingartner that her plans had been changed:

[.]
[.//]
.......... But my heart is heavy. I am afraid that because of 'Unruhe,[8] in Palestine we shall not get to Aka [sic] or Jerusalem.[9]
.......... [8. Unrest. This may refer to the unsettled state that existed in Palestine following serious disturbances which took place across the territory in August 1929 in which 133 Jews and 116 Arabs were killed. See Great Britain and Palestine 1915-1945, pp. 44-5.]
.......... [9. Unpublished letter of Queen Marie to Roxo Weingartner, 6 March 1930, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	The Queen explained her own understanding of the situation to her diary two days later. It is clear that she realized that as royalty she was not always free to do as she wished. In this instance she was quite uncharacteristically submissive:

[.]
[.//]
Saturday March 8th 1930 Aswin to Dakka

.......... But everything in this world is complication. Of all things my sympathy for the Baha'is is also being brought up as a political <span data-pg='169'></span> complication. This has been taken up from the English side. Who would ever have imagined such a thing. They consider it political propaganda! It is really sometimes a curse to be a Queen. And one meets with almost no comprehension. The world wishes to rule everything on hard-cut lines, there is to be no enthusiasm, no deeper thought, no privacy, no poetry, no ideas only dry reason and selfish calculation. How discouraging it is. I would never have thought that even this would be made a question of, but Hiott even wrote about it from Bucarest. Je ne comprends plus le monde [I no longer understand the world] and more and more a desire comes to me to detach myself from everything to live a nun's life far from everything and the exceeding malveillance du monde [ill-will of the world].[10]
.......... [10. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished diary entry 8 March 1930, Romanian State Archives.]

	On the same day Shoghi Effendi forwarded to the Queen an official invitation to visit the World Centre of the Baha'i Faith:

[.]
[.//]
HER MAJESTY, THE DOWAGER QUEEN MARIE OF ROMANIA, ABOARD MAYFLOWER, ASWAN

FAMILY OF ABDULBAHA JOIN ME IN RENEWING THE EXPRESSION OF OUR LOVING AND HEARTFELT INVITATION TO YOUR GRACIOUS MAJESTY AND HER ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCESS ILEANA TO VISIT HIS HOME IN HAIFA. YOUR MAJESTY'S ACCEPTANCE TO VISIT BAHAULLAHS SHRINE AND PRISON-CITY OF AKKA WILL APART FROM ITS HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE BE A SOURCE OF IMMEASURABLE STRENGTH, JOY AND HOPE TO THE SILENT SUFFERERS OF THE FAITH THROUGHOUT THE EAST. OUR FONDEST LOVE, PRAYERS AND BEST WISHES FOR YOUR MAJESTY'S HAPPINESS AND WELFARE.[11]
.......... [11. Unpublished telegram of Shoghi Effendi to Queen Marie, 8 March 1930, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	But this invitation was destined to be refused. On 13 March Queen Marie wrote again to her friend Roxo Weingartner:

[.]
[.//]
.......... No Jerusalem .and no Aka alas. This is a huge disapointment [sic]. But Imagine they were turning my admiration for Abdu'l≠Baha into a political complication. How difficult is life for a queen![12]
.......... [12. Unpublished letter of Queen Marie to Roxo Weingartner, 13 March 1930, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Surely this unfortunate turn of events was not meaningless to Queen Marie, as she wrote about it frequently. In a letter of <span data-pg='170'></span> 19 March 1930 to Roxo Weingartner she unburdened her heart once more:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Alas Jerusalem and Aka have been struck from our programme so no holy tombs alas.[13]
.......... [13. Unpublished letter of Queen Marie to Roxo Weingartner, 19 March 1930, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Concerned that he had received no acknowledgment from Queen Marie of his invitation, and suspecting that the numerous newspaper articles about the Queen's 'conversion' may have created impediments to her visit, Shoghi Effendi once more cabled her, this time in Egypt, on 26 March 1930:

[.]
[.//]
HER MAJESTY, QUEEN MARIE OF ROMANIA, HOTEL SEMIRAMIS, CAIRO

.......... FEARING MY FORMER LETTER AND TELEGRAM IN WHICH FAMILY OF ABDULBAHA JOINED ME IN EXTENDING INVITATION TO YOUR MAJESTY AND HER ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCESS ILEANA MAY HAVE MISCARRIED, WE ARE PLEASED TO EXPRESS ANEW THE PLEASURE IT WOULD GIVE US ALL SHOULD YOUR MAJESTY FIND IT FEASIBLE TO VISIT BAHAULLAHS AND ABDULBAHAS SHRINES AND THE PRISON≠CITY OF AKKA. DEEPLY REGRET UNAUTHORIZED PUBLICITY GIVEN BY THE PRESS[14]
.......... [14. Unpublished telegram of Shoghi Effendi to Queen Marie, 26 March 1930, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	A response finally came on 28 March but it neither arrived directly from the Queen nor did it reflect her own wishes, as expressed in her letter to Roxo Weingartner of that same day. The telegram to Shoghi Effendi was signed by the Romanian Minister in Cairo, Philip Lahovary:

[.]
[.//]
.......... HER MAJESTY REGRETS THAT, NOT PASSING THROUGH PALESTINE, SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO VISIT YOU.[15]
.......... [15. Unpublished telegram of Philip Lahovary to Shoghi Effendi, 28 March 1930, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	In her letter to Roxo Weingartner the Queen explained that she was not even free to write to Shoghi Effendi, a clear indication that the whole issue was related to her association with the Baha'i Faith:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I have had trouble about the Baha'is. Somewhere it was started in the papers that I had become a Baha'i. Here in the East every seckt [sic] is mixed up with politics. There is Unruhe in Palestine, so I <span data-pg='171'></span> could not go to Jerusalem and had also with great regret to give up Aka, had even to be very careful what message I sent Shoghi Effendi who had invited us. It is certainly d___d[16] hard to be a queen, & the world has got its knife into me.[17]
.......... [16. Queen Marie wrote this word like this, leaving the underlined blank space between the two letters d.]
.......... [17. Unpublished letter of Queen Marie to Roxo Weingartner, 28 March 1930, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	This letter was a very angry one: the Queen went so far as to curse her lack of freedom. Her remark in the last sentence certainly does not seem in any way to fit the attempt on the part of the authorities to pass the whole thing off as a political risk. The 'knife' may refer to force having been applied as a last resort to command obedience where words had failed but certainly indicates that the Queen felt she was under attack. The Queen further confided to her diary on 29 March:

[.]
[.//]
Saturday March 29th 1930 Cairo & departure

.......... Landed at El Cantara we were suddenly in Palestine under English care. Good-bye to Egypt. We had loved it all and every good-bye is a break.

.......... We are now more or less in the hands of [illegible] Yacher head of the Egyptian railways. It was he who planned and helped to arrange this trip as I was to avoid Palestine as much as possible, only skirt it so to say which is a great disappointment. To be so near & not go to either Jerusalem or Akker [sic] is indeed hard. But the authorities were afraid the visit of a queen might stir up passions & the state of the spirits is excited and unsettled. Besides some stupid press campaign stated that I had become a Baha'i & the Baha'is being considered a sect around which politics intrigue the whole thing has bouched [sic] up & I even had worry from at home on the subject. Unjustifiable nonsense, but food to that curr [sic] of a Filipescu. Everything is disagreable [sic] for me at home just now; they have got their knife into me & behave like ungrateful servants.[18]
.......... [18. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished diary entry 29 March 1930, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Despite what .was said to the Queen, she obviously did not believe any of it and knew well that she was being manipulated by various agencies. Her categorical evaluation of the accusations made against her was that they were 'unjustifiable <span data-pg='172'></span> nonsense'. She once more mentioned that 'they' had 'their knife' into her, this time pinpointing her attackers as Romanians.

	On 30 March the Queen further explained to her diary the circumstances surrounding her arrival and precipitate departure from Haifa, revealing that the Romanian Minister told an untruth in his telegram to Shoghi Effendi, as Queen Marie recorded that she did in fact arrive in Haifa and travel through Palestine:

[.]
[.//]
From Haifa to Alepo March 30th to April 8th [1930] Constantinople

.......... We have been travelling about in conditions which made writing difficult, early rising, primitive accomodation [sic] insufficient light huried [sic] arrivals and departures. On March 30th we arrived at Haifa, early in the morning icognito [sic] as I was not supposed to travel through Palestine, but I could not reach Syria except through part of Palestine unless I took a ship which would have been more complicated. My heart ached at Haifa not to be able to stop and greet Shoghi Effendi now head of the Baha'is who had sent me a warm invitation to be their guest, because although I am not a Baha'i I am deeply interested by Abdu'l-Baha's teachings and I would have loved going to his grave.

.......... The stupid fuss the papers raised made this alas impossible and I felt like a coward creeping past their holy shrines without giving sign of life. No one understood this except Ileana. Those who look at you principally as Queen, a representative understand very little and care less for what you feel as Mensch or what are your inner loyalties. They protect your outward prestige, so to say guard you from making foolish mistakes but know none of the inner ache their reasonableness leaves in your heart. I do not blame them, they are there for that, their conscience is at rest, they have canalised their rash & impulsive Queen's impulses, have spared her future trouble so they have done their duty, therewith all is well. It is no good expecting Roumanians to understand any subversive religious aspirations or even quite plausible ones, religion plays a small part in their plan of life & religious thoughts seldome [sic] trouble them. But I am their Queen. I have no right according to them to <span data-pg='173'></span> compromise them through my ununderstandable ideas & ideals, I belong to them and they are there to protect me against myself. I honour their intentions, their acts are logically m accordance with their lights which are of a more practical mind than mine. I bow my head & submit, keeping my disappointment to myself. Ileana alone understands what I feel and at certain moments Cella[19] nearly does though is a glad little Pagan.[20]
.......... [19. Cella was the wife of the Romanian Minister Philip Lahovary.]
.......... [20. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished diary entry 30 March-8 April 1930, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Although Queen Marie wrote of her 'inner loyalties', an 'inner ache' and her 'religious aspirations' and 'thoughts', and she was deeply disappointed and frustrated that she did not have the right to express her 'ideas and ideals', she recognized that as Queen she had grave responsibilities towards her people that often meant her own plans and aspirations were thwarted, and to this she was resigned. She was still the people's Queen despite the fact that her grandson was now King. She had been Romania's most active Queen and had loved and served her country to the utmost of her ability. Her one comfort was that Ileana understood and shared her predicament.

	Disappointment was not the Queen's alone. Shoghi Effendi and the Holy Family tried very hard to understand what had prevented the meeting with Queen Marie, as the Guardian explained in his letter to Martha Root on 2 April 1930:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I am now writing to you quite confidentially regarding the projected visit of the Queen to Haifa. Unfortunately it did not materialize. The reason, I absolutely ignore. Although I sent her two wires, renewing my invitation to her already expressed in the letter I wrote her when you were here, and deploring the unauthorized publicity given by the Press in Palestine, England and America, I have had no reply from her whatever. All I received was a wire from Cairo on March 28 from the Romanian Minister, Lahovary, who wired as follows: 'Her Majesty regrets that, not passing through Palestine, she will not be able to visit you'. I do not know whether my letter of December last, which I showed you, and in which acknowledged receipt of her photograph, as well as my two <span data-pg='174'></span> wires to her after her arrival in Egypt, have been intercepted or miscarried. The two wires I sent her were as follows ...[21] 'Deeply regret unauthorized publicity given by the Press.' I should not be surprised if these communications as well as your letters and the rosaries have not reached her at all. I so much wish to know the real situation, whether any malicious propaganda has not damped her enthusiasm, or whether she is unable to communicate with us. Reporters who called on me, representing the United Press of America, telegraphed to their newspapers just the opposite I told them. They perverted the truth. I wish we could make sure that she would at least know the real situation! But how can we ensure that our letters to her Majesty will henceforth reach her. I feel that you should write to her, explain the whole situation, assure her of my great disappointment. I hope your letter will reach her... I cherish the hope that these unfortunate develop≠ments will serve only to intensify the faith and love of the Queen, and will reinforce her determination to arise and spread the Cause. Please, let me know of any news you receive. I thirst for news and find all ways to her barred and blocked.
.......... [21. For text of these wires, see above pp. 169, 170.]

.......... Be not sad or distressed, dearest Martha. The seeds you have so lovingly, so devotedly and so assiduously sown will surely germinate. 'Abdu'l-Baha is guiding you and will bless your heroic efforts. Persevere, and never lose heart.[22]
.......... [22. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 2 April 1930, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Characteristically and despite his own disappointment, Shoghi Effendi consoled Martha, wishing to ensure that she did not feel she had failed in any way.

	Princess Ileana remained in the Middle East after the departure of her mother and had another chance to visit Haifa and 'Akka. But the Princess's proposed visit was no more successful than her mother's.

	On 8 April she wrote to Queen Marie from Beyrouth where she was staying with Philip and Cella Lahovary: 'We leave directly after lunch & I hope tomorrow to see Bahaulah's [sic] grave.'[23]
.......... [23. Unpublished letter of Princess Ileana to Queen Marie, 8 April 1930, Romanian State Archives.]

	The following day Ileana wrote again to her mother on Jerusalem Government House letterhead: <span data-pg='175'></span>

[.]
[.//]
.......... The drive from Acre to Haifa is beautiful across the wet sand round the bay. The sea was calm as calm could be just giving that gentel [sic] lap so dear to our ears. The sun set beyond the waters turning the deep into every colour of red and orange & finally into deep purple. We drove write [sic] up the Mount Carmel to a quite nice little hotel. Mr Shaker and I went out to see the bay from above in the moonlight it was wonderful seeing it from above. It was so full of peace. I had before been possest [sic] by fear of what is still before me but this made me all still again & alas there was no possibility for me to go to the grave because it would be shut so early in the morning and also because we knew that Cella and Philip would never get over it as they are so convinced of the Bahai's wrong doings. I felt so sad about it & such a coward. But somehow I have been so hit of late that I just don't expect things to be natural anymore.[24]
.......... [24. Unpublished letter of Princess Ileana to Queen Marie, 9 April 1930, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	In another letter to her mother dated 11 April Ileana triumphantly shared some joyful news of a meeting she had in Jerusalem:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I have just seen the head of the police here & he tells me that all one says about the Baha'is is noncence [sic] & they are what we think them only that much below what Abdul Baha was. I am going to talk to the High Commissioner about it because I'd like to convince Philip & Cella. Because they are so savage about it. Cella and I very nearly came to a fight just now upon the question.[25]
.......... [25. Unpublished letter of Princess Ileana to Queen Marie, 11 April 1930, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	During this time a number of troubling situations arose to add to Queen Marie's difficult existence. Her daughter-in-law, Princess Helen, now divorced from Carol, appeared to try to take out her resentment of her unfortunate plight on the Queen Mother by keeping her away from the young King Michael. The relationship between grandmother and grandson became extremely strained. The Queen's diaries reveal her great sadness over the imposed separation from Michael whom she loved and felt certain she could help with her own experience. To make things worse, Prince Nicholas also decided to turn his back on his mother, encouraged by those with whom he associated. <span data-pg='176'></span>

	In the meantime, Shoghi Effendi, in a letter of 20 May encouraged Martha to visit Romania once again:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I feel that on your return to Europe, you should concentrate your efforts on Germany and the Balkans. I hope and pray that in the Balkans you may be enabled to establish Baha'i centres where the believers may be able to carry on the work which you have so gloriously and devotedly initiated. I feel also that you should make an attempt to meet the Queen, who has already expressed the hope to see you. I will continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart.[26]

[.]

	Unbeknownst to Queen Marie, her youngest son had been plotting a new coup with his brother Carol, and during one of the Queen's trips abroad Carol returned to Romania. It was felt by many in Romania that the difficulties the country was experiencing could be overcome with Carol's return and an agreement was worked out by which he was to become a Regent and would guide his son, the King. Carol, however, had other plans: his personal ambition and that fostered by his entourage now made him aspire to the kingship. He had the immense advantage of being much liked by the army and when he returned at the beginning of June 1930 he immediately declared himself King of Romania. Upon learning this, the Queen Mother was somewhat relieved, as she also sin≠cerely believed that it might all be for the best.

	Within a short period King Carol began to dismiss people in the government while his paranoic distrust of those around him caused him to enlist spies who reported directly to him. In a further attempt to control his mother, he broke his father's will, which had provided a comfortable income for the Queen for the rest of her life. King Carol expropriated his mother's entire income and she began to experience financial difficulties. Queen Marie became completely dependent upon her son's good grace and whatever she could earn from her writing. For a woman used to being materially independent and accustomed to a certain life style, this theft presented considerable hardship. <span data-pg='177'></span>

	Carol's persecution was not limited to his mother. His hatred of his former wife Helen drove him to place her under house arrest as he tried desperately to control everyone around him. He also requested Queen Marie and Princess Ileana not to associate with Princess Helen, something neither woman agreed to accept.

	Although an agreement had been reached by those who helped him return that Carol should not allow his mistress Elena Lupescu to come back to the country, the two of them arranged for her to follow him secretly shortly after his arrival in Romania. It was not long before Queen Marie learned that the woman she considered an undesirable companion for her eldest son was successfully doing her share to influence Romanian politics from her hiding place in the King's palace.

<span data-pg='178'></span>

1931

	Queen Marie slowly came to the realization that King Carol had no scruples and would stop at nothing in his attempt to gain unshared popularity. It is reputed that he arranged for his sister Ileana to meet Archduke Anton of Austria in the spring of 1931 in the hope of getting her out of Romania. She, like her mother, was very popular in the country and Carol resented this deeply. The King also hated her for not breaking off her friendship with his former wife. His ready consent to the marriage between Ileana and the young Archduke brought great joy to the couple and to the Queen Mother, as the young man was very well suited to the Princess, but soon after the wedding it became clear that Carol would force them to live outside the country and curtail their visits to Romania as much as possible. Queen Marie had hoped that they could settle near her so that she would continue to benefit from the closeness and companionship of her youngest daughter.

	Princess Ileana and Archduke Anton married on 27 July 1931 at Sinaia and it marked the last time that mother and daughter would live together in Romania. The couple settled in Austria and largely had to content themselves with only periodic visits from Queen Marie.

	Prince Nicholas in turn married a Romanian divorcee named Jeanne Doletti and was promptly exiled by the King, who conveniently forgot the role that his younger brother had played in his return to the throne of Romania.

	One year after the aborted visit to the Holy Land, in June <span data-pg='179'></span> 1931, Queen Marie of Romania wrote a letter of explanation to Martha Root:

[.]
[.//]
Balcic
June 28th 1931

Dear Miss Root,

.......... Was so glad to hear from you again and learn of your different activities also of the touching fate of my very modest little brooch.

.......... Both Ileana and I were cruely disapointed [sic] at having been prevented going to the holy shrines and of meeting Shoghi Effendi, but at that time we were going through a cruel crisis and every movement I made was being turned against me and being politically exploited in an unkind way. It caused me a good deal of suffering and curtailed my liberty most unkindly. There are periods however when one must submit to persecution, nevertheless, however high-hearted one may be, it ever again fills one with pained astonishment when people are mean and spiteful. I had my child to defend at that time; she was going through a bitter experience and so I could not stand up and defie [sic] the world.

.......... But the beauty of truth remains and I cling to it through all the vicissitudes of a life become rather sad.

.......... The happiness of my child also means separation and you know what wonderful friends and companions we have been. However she is marrying a man with no special political obligations so that will leave them much freer to go backwards and forwards.

.......... Beautiful Balcic becomes an empty nest without her. But I am exceedingly fond of the man she has chosen, he is strong, reliable, magnificently upright and a hard worker.

.......... I am glad to hear that your travelling has been so fruitful and I wish you continual success knowing what a beautiful message you are carrying from land to land.

Marie

.......... I enclose a few words which may be used in your Year Book.

.......... The Baha'i Teaching brings peace and understanding. It is like a wide embrace gathering together all those who have long searched for words of hope. It accepts all great prophets gone <span data-pg='180'></span> before, it destroys no other creeds and leaves the doors open. Saddened by the continual strife amongst believers of many confessions and wearied of their intolerance towards each other, I discovered in the Baha'i Teaching the real spirit of Christ so often denied and misunderstood. Unity instead of strife, Hope instead of condemnation, Love instead of hate, and a great reassurance for all men.
Marie[1]
.......... [1. Unpublished letter of Queen Marie to Martha Root, 28 June 1931.]

	The passing of a year from the attempted visit to the Baha'i World Centre had not lessened the Queen's sadness. Had it not been for the need to protect her child, she suggested, she would have stood up, defied the world and made the visit to the Baha'i holy places. With so much now lost to her, she had clung to the one thing that no one could take away from her, the 'beauty of the truth', rather like one clings to a life preserver when adrift in the sea in a terrible storm. Significantly, Queen Marie concluded her letter with a statement, spontaneous and unsolicited, about the Baha'i message, once again providing a demonstration of her tender feelings for the teachings which had, in their turn offered her, the 'beauty of truth'.

	Shortly after Princess Ileana's marriage to Archduke Anton of Austria, Shoghi Effendi conveyed his happiness about the Queen's letter and his appreciation in a cable to Martha Root of 3 August 1931:

[.]

	He expanded upon this in a letter to Martha dated 22 August:

[.]
[.//]
.......... No words can adequately express my pleasure at the receipt of your letter enclosing the precious appreciation which will constitute a valuable and outstanding contribution to the forthcoming issue of 'The Baha'i World'... I shall retain it until I receive the manuscript of 'The Baha'i World', and will insert it myself in its proper place. You will I am sure express our <span data-pg='181'></span> deepest thanks to her for her response. You will, I presume, acquaint Mrs French with this noteworthy contribution to the work in which she is so devotedly engaged.

.......... I hope that you will be able before you leave the States to send to Mrs French a graphic and illuminating report of your world≠wide and unique activities during the past two years. I am certain that next to the Queen's appreciation, your article will be regarded as the most noteworthy and inspiring contribution to the book.[3]

1932

	The time came for work to begin on translations into different languages of the popular book which Queen Marie had received from Martha Root in 1926, {Baha'u'llah and the New Era} by J.E. Esslemont. The Queen had, in fact, encouraged the translation of this book into the Balkan languages when Martha had asked her how the Faith could be spread more efficiently in this region. Shoghi Effendi considered these translations to be essential and guided and supported Martha in her endeavours to have the work done and the books pub≠lished. What distinguished the Romanian translation of this introduction to the Baha'i Faith and its teachings was the involvement of Queen Marie herself from the earliest stages of the work to its publication.

	On 14 February 1932 Shoghi Effendi brought to Martha's attention the need to see to these translations immediately:

[.]
[.//]
.......... From Geneva I feel you should concentrate your attention on Central Europe and then on the Balkans. Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland are the countries which stand in the greatest need of your valiant support. The utmost effort should be exerted to establish Baha'i centres in those countries. We already have centres in Bulgaria, Albania and Austria but none in Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Greece. I would urge you to take the necessary steps to have Dr Esslemont's book translated into the language of anyone of these above-mentioned countries. I would be so glad to assist in their translation and printing. You need not wait until a believer can undertake to translate the book. I am enclosing a small sum <span data-pg='183'></span> which I trust will be of help to you in your vast and historic work for the Cause.[1]
.......... [1. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 14 February 1932, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	As intensive teaching of the Baha'i Faith was being undertaken in various European countries, Shoghi Effendi wrote to Martha again only a month later, on 14 March 1932, re-emphasizing the need for Esslemont's book to be translated quickly:

[.]
[.//]
MARTHA CARE BAHAI GENEVA

FEEL STRONGLY NECESSITY PROMPT TRANSLATION ESSLEMONTS INTO CZECH, HUNGARIAN, ROMANIAN, GREEK AS PRELIMINARY INTENSIVE TEACHING CAMPAIGN EUROPE. EAGER ASSIST FINANCIALLY AWAITING ESTIMATES. LOVE.[2]
.......... [2. Unpublished telegram of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 14 March 1932, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	He wrote again on the same theme on 8 April 1932:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I trust that you will be in a position to ensure the early translation of Dr Esslemont's book into the languages I have suggested.[3]
.......... [3. Unpublished letter of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 8 April 1932, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	But it was not only these translations which were important to Shoghi Effendi. On 3 May, in a letter written on his behalf, he provided the reasoning that has been the basis for the external affairs work of the Baha'i Faith ever since, helping Martha and those who have followed her to understand and appreciate fully the need to share the Baha'i Faith with prominent people and how this affects the processes leading to world peace.

[.]
[.//]
.......... Your letters with the wonderful reports of your activities in teaching the Cause and interesting distinguished persons always bring him much joy and pleasure.

	In his own hand Shoghi Effendi added this significant paragraph:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Even though the men you contact do not immediately embrace the Cause and whole-heartedly support it, yet the word of God that has penetrated their mind and heart will not remain idle. <span data-pg='184'></span> They will be bound, once they read something or lend an attentive ear, to unconsciously modify their views, for the message will be gradually working in their subconscious mind and thereby moulding their views and interests. One day the Cause will pass the threshold of their consciousness and they will become completely converted. But even before that day, they will be expressing that spirit in their deliberations and thereby helping the progress of the cause of peace throughout the world.[5]

	Martha had been working in this area for some time. Among those she had reached directly and made aware of Baha'u'llah's teachings with varying degrees of receptivity were Queen Marie of Romania, King Zog of Albania, King Boris II of Bulgaria, King Faisal of Iraq, King Haakon of Norway, President Thomas Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, President Herbert Hoover of the United States, Prince Paul and Princess Olga of Yugoslavia and Princess Ileana of Romania.

	In another letter to Martha Root written on his behalf on 24 May 1932, Shoghi Effendi stressed the importance of her work in Europe and wished to present through her to the Queen of Romania his recent translation of the epic narrative {The Dawn-Breakers} written by Nabil, a follower of both the Bab and Baha'u'llah:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Europe, especially Central and Eastern Europe, is a wonderful field for work. The great difficulties they have passed through these last years have made the people there peace-seeking and more ready to listen to a spiritual message proclaiming universal brotherhood. They are far more ready than the Latin countries that still possess the arrogance of victory in the last war.

.......... Shoghi Effendi wishes to send a copy of the de luxe edition of 'The Dawn-Breakers' to Queen Marie. As he is not sure whether it will reach her if sent directly from here, he is sending it over to you. You could use your own judgement whether to send it to her by mail or wait and take it yourself when you go to see her during your visit to the Balkans. So he is sending it to you under separate cover ...[6]

	The Guardian added this note:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I will mail a copy of the de luxe edition of 'The Dawn-Breakers' to your address in a few days, bearing an inscription for Queen Marie. May the Beloved guide you in the manner of its presentation to Her Majesty.[7]
.......... [7. Unpublished note appended to ibid.]
[.///]

	When the book was posted, Shoghi Effendi confirmed this to Martha on 31 May 1932:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I have mailed to your address in Warsaw one copy of the de luxe edition of 'Nabil's Narrative', bearing an inscription for Queen Marie, and trust that it will reach you safely.[8]

	The introduction to The Dawn-Breakers describes the great contribution this narrative makes to the Baha'i Faith and to humanity:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The Baha'i Movement is now well known throughout the world, and the time has come when Nabil's unique narrative of its beginnings in darkest Persia will interest many readers. The record which he sets down with such devoted care is in many respects extraordinary. It has its thrilling passages, and the splendour of the central theme gives to the chronicle not only great historical value but high moral power. Its lights are strong; and this effect is more intense because they seem like a sunburst at midnight. The tale is one of struggle and martyrdom; its poignant scenes, its tragic incidents are many. Corruption, fanaticism, and cruelty gather against the cause of reformation to destroy it, and the present volume closes at the point where a riot of hate seems to have accomplished its purpose and to have driven into exile or put to death every man, woman, and child in Persia who dared to profess a leaning towards the teaching of the Bab. Nabil, himself a participant in some of the scenes which he recites, took up his lonely pen to recite the truth about men and women so mercilessly persecuted and a movement so grievously traduced.

.......... He writes with ease, and when his emotions are strongly stirred his style becomes vigorous and trenchant. He does not present with any system the claims and teaching of Baha'u'llah and His Forerunner. His purpose is the simple one of rehearsing the beginnings of the Baha'i Revelation and of <span data-pg='186'></span> preserving the remembrance of the deeds of its early champions. He relates a series of incidents, punctiliously quoting his authority for almost every item of information. His work in consequence, if less artistic and philosophic, gains in value as a literal account of what he knew or could from credible witnesses discover about the early history of the Cause.[9]

	Martha Root confirmed receipt of the book on 11 June 1932 and conveyed to Shoghi Effendi further information about Queen Marie's failed attempt to visit him and the Holy Shrines in 1930:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Thank you very much that you have sent this beautiful book [The Dawn-Breakers] for Her Majesty Queen Marie. I shall write to her and learn just where she is and where I shall send the book and then I will send it to her registered. I think she would not wish me to wait until I go to the Balkans. Of course it is just possible I might see her in Europe. Sometimes she stops in Praha on her way to England.

.......... Shoghi Effendi dearest Guardian. I wish you could have heard Mr Titus ZBYSZEWSKI who was Polish Consul or Consul General in Jerusalem in 1930 when the Queen wanted to come to Haifa and to Palestine. He said she wished to come but all the government officials felt that it was too dangerous, felt they could not protect her sufficiently. They felt she should not come at that time. He was so interested to hear all about her being a Baha'i and I came upstairs and to get her statement that she wrote for the 'Bahi'i World'. Marion Little had just returned it to me all beautifully mounted in blue and gold. He was delighted to read it.[10]

	On 1 July Martha Root once again acknowledged receipt of the book for Queen Marie, perhaps forgetting that she had done so one month before: 'The beautiful book for Queen Marie came safely. I shall see that she receives it.'[11]
.......... [11. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 1 July 1932, International Baha'i Archives.]

	Anticipating a possible fifth visit with Queen Marie, Martha wrote to Shoghi Effendi on 9 July 1932 from Prague:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Today I read that Princess Ileana leaves Bucharest very soon for Vienna where she is expecting a child this month. I feel sure her mother will go to Vienna with her, so I wish to write and ask if I may come to Vienna to see her and to bring her the book... <span data-pg='187'></span>

.......... I wish I could go to Vienna to see the Queen before I go to the Congress. I shall write to her tonight or tomorrow...

.......... If I see the Queen I shall speak with her about the translation into Romanian [of {Baha'u'llah and the New Era}].[12]
.......... [12. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 9 July 1932, International Baha'i Archives.]

	Martha wrote again on 16 July, full of confidence, and with the translation uppermost in her mind:

[.]
[.//]
.......... If I meet Queen Marie, I shall ask her what she would advise about the Romanian translation...

.......... I wanted to hold this letter thinking I might hear from Her Majesty Queen Marie, but then the letter might miss the mail ships. So I send it, but I feel Queen Marie has that same love, as always, for our Cause.[13]

	As Martha hoped, the Queen wished to see her again and cabled an invitation to her on 24 July 1932:

	Martha quickly informed Shoghi Effendi through Munavvar Yazdi on 29 July 1932 of the Queen's invitation:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...Today I received the following telegram from Queen Marie: 'Shall be glad to receive you at MOEDLING any day you can come. Marie.'

.......... Moedling is just out from Vienna. I am going to try my utmost to go from here direct to Vienna as soon as this Congress is over and then after I see her, I shall go at once to Praha. I feel she may not be there very long, so I must go as soon as the Congress finishes or I may not be able to see her. I feel that Shoghi Effendi will be very glad if I go...[15]

	Shoghi Effendi, however, was in extreme grief following the death of his beloved great-aunt, the Greatest Holy Leaf, daughter of Baha'u'llah and sister of 'Abdu'l-Baha on 15 July 1932. More than just a member of his family, Shoghi Effendi <span data-pg='188'></span> called her 'my sale earthly sustainer, the joy and solace of my life'.[16] When Queen Marie was expected as a guest in Haifa the Greatest Holy Leaf had awaited her with Shoghi Effendi and had shared his disappointment at her inability to pay the visit hoped for by all. Shoghi Effendi's moving epitaph to the Greatest Holy Leaf was a fitting tribute to the outstanding woman whom the Guardian called the 'last remnant of Baha'u'llah':[17]

.......... Dearly-beloved Greatest Holy Leaf! Through the mist of tears that fill my eyes I can clearly see, as I pen these lines, thy noble figure before me, and can recognize the serenity of thy kindly face. I can still gaze, though the shadow of the grave separate us, into thy blue, love-deep eyes, and can feel, in its calm intensity, the immense love thou didst bear for the Cause of thine Almighty Father, the attachment that bound thee to the most lowly and insignificant among its followers, the warm affection thou didst cherish for me in thine heart. The memory of the ineffable beauty of thy smile shall ever continue to cheer and hearten me in the thorny path I am destined to pursue. The remembrance of the touch of thine hand shall spur me on to follow steadfastly in thy way. The sweet magic of thy voice shall remind me, when the hour of adversity is at its darkest, to hold fast to the rope thou didst seize so firmly all the days of thy life.

.......... Bear thou this my message to 'Abdu'l-Baha, thine exalted and divinely-appointed Brother: If the Cause for which Baha'u'llah toiled and laboured, for which Thou didst suffer years of agonizing sorrow, for the sake of which streams of sacred blood have flowed, should, in the days to come, encounter storms more severe than those it has already weathered, do Thou continue to overshadow, with Thine all-encompassing care and wisdom, Thy frail, Thy unworthy appointed child.[18]

	The meeting between the Queen and her spiritual mother took place at the beginning of August. Martha felt it was successful and that news of it was sure to delight the Guardian, despite his profound grief. She wrote to him on 14 August 1932: <span data-pg='189'></span>

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...I have never read anything so beautiful as your tribute to the Greatest Holy Leaf, except 'Abdu'l-Baha's Marriage Tablet, both give us the very essence of the very highest love. I see your soul at its highest as well as the great spirit of the Greatest Holy Leaf in your tribute. I thank you beloved Shoghi Effendi for the three copies. I am sending one to Queen Marie and one to President Masaryk (I do not believe anyone will appreciate that tribute more than President Masaryk) and I know the Queen will long to have it...

.......... Loved Shoghi Effendi, after the Universal. Congress of Esperanto in Paris I went to Vienna. Queen Mane of Romania who is in Moedling just out from Vienna invited me to tea. She and Ileana met me alone and we talked a little before tea. I gave them your dear greetings and told them of the passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf. The Queen asks me to give you this message: 'We both understand his love for this great woman and we wish him to know how much we think of him and how sorry we are that we could not go to meet him.' (She means herself and Ileana.) Oh, they were so disappointed not to come to Haifa to see you! I saw it in every word they expressed. The Queen expressed how first in Egypt they had been very 'nasty' about Ileana's broken engagement, and then when they planned to go to Haifa (strictly between you and me, the Romanian Government made a gesture and also the government and officials in Palestine thought it was unsafe.) They just wouldn't let her go. I also explained to her what the Polish Consul (or Consul General) who was at that time in Palestine told me recently in Warsaw. He said it was so dangerous they all felt she must not go. She said she was very glad to hear, because she couldn't understand why they absolutely refused it. (I think, between you and me, her life is more and more complicated these days and she has to be very careful.) Ileana said she got to Palestine but they wouldn't let her call on you. She asked one young man to call upon you and explain and take to you her greetings. I told her I feel sure you did not receive this message and she seems very surprised that you had not heard from her.

.......... Queen Marie said: 'You know a Queen has to be so careful. Everything I do, they think It is something political, and it isn't anything political at all.' Just between you and me, Shoghi <span data-pg='190'></span> Effendi, I do not think I ever saw the Queen look so sad. I believe the times are very critical.

.......... She kissed me twice when I came and in the midst of the afternoon and when I left I have always just kissed her hand, but when I left I kissed her when she kissed me.

.......... I took her some white rose perfume, nine of the French 'Economics' by Horace Holley and two of the English 'Economics' and the French copy of your letter 'The Goal of a New World Order' and nine lovely yellow roses. She was pleased, I saw it in her eyes, she showed them to Ileana and said 'you see how she always brings me these lovely gifts.'

.......... I explained in the very beginning that the beautiful book from you 'The Dawn Breakers' I had left in Praha, because not hearing from her I had taken the book out of my suitcase and left it in Praha. I thought I would not see her and that perhaps she was in England (as Countess Cantacuzene had told me that the Queen and Ileana were going to England and the baby would be born in London.) The Queen said: 'I understand, and I know you will send it to me as soon as you reach Praha' and I said yes, that I would! She thanks you very much for this book 'The Dawn Breakers'. (I had so much to carry for the Congress, my bags were terribly heavy and I knew I could not go to London to see her, so please know how sorry I was not to have that book with me.)

.......... When I saw her I had not yet seen your Tribute to the Greatest Holy [Leaf] but from here I am sending it and sending an English copy of 'The Goal of a New World Order'.

.......... I also took her another copy of 'Baha'u'llah and the New Era' and asked her if she could tell me who in Romania she thought would be best to translate it. She gave me the name of a lady who would do it well, but she said she must be given a little something for her work because of the woman's circumstances. I said I thought one hundred dollars could be given for a complete perfect translation but it would be impossible to give more. She said the woman would [do] it gladly for that and she gave me the address of this woman and told me to use her name. (I have not yet written to the woman, I thought I would wait until I write you, for in this fearful crisis, I do not know whether you will feel you can pay the $100 for Romanian translation. (Also, I think I can get wonderful translations in Serbian <span data-pg='191'></span> and Greek, but I would need to pay $100 each for them--that would make $300 for the Romanian, the Serbian and the Greek. I could let the two latter go for some months or year until I go to those countries or can order them now.)

.......... ...I just feel sick when I think how I gave $99 to that Romanian publisher and he promised to get out Ileana's booklets within ten days, and he literally stole the money and did nothing. Now I will never pay for anything until it is actually in my hands. Only Baha'u'llah knows how I sacrificed to get that $99.

.......... I think the Queen loves the Teachings best of anything in her life, but I feel she has to be very careful. Ileana was so friendly and kind and girlish; I felt the warmth of her genuine friendship, but she is married into a Roman Catholic family. I said to her 'you are an internationalist in religion, you are Greek Orthodox and Baha'i and Roman Catholic' and she laughed and said yes! Anyway, it is wonderful for our Cause that they love our Cause and do what they can. Perhaps later they can do more. I said to Queen Marie that I wished she could go to the United States again and meet Roy Wilhelm and Horace Holley and all our N.S.A. and a number of our believers and she said she wished she could! I do not think she can because of the economic situation and also as Queen she has to be careful--I am wondering if she has to be more careful with her son on the throne!!

.......... I asked her if she could give a statement for our Baha'i Magazine and she said yes, tell them

.......... 'I admire the work you are doing Miss Root, I wish you every success in it, for I know it is the work for universal peace!' She added 'What more could I say than I have said about the importance of these Teachings in the article (letter in her own handwriting will appear in the 'Baha'i World' embossed in gold and blue and she is very pleased). She gave me her picture and Ileana gave me hers, both are autographed.

.......... Then the maid came and said tea was ready; when we went into the other room she introduced me to Queen (Marie) Mignon of Yugoslavia (I had not met her when I was in Belgrade), her baby was two days old when I was in the palace to see Queen Marie and Ileana in Belgrade. Also, the Queen introduced me to a Duke and Duchess (young people) of the House of Hapsburg, Ileana's brother-in-law and sister-in-law, <span data-pg='192'></span> and we all had tea together. They passed the cake and each cut his own. I took such a small piece, Queen Marie of Romania herself cut me a larger piece and put it on my plate and she smiled at me. I sat at her right. She told them about my travels as a Baha'i and she asked me many questions about the work in different countries (so they all heard the Message!). The Queen from Yugoslavia said: 'I remember when you came to the palace (in Belgrade her home) to tell Paul and Olga about the Baha'i Teachings.' The Duchess was a lovely young woman, I do not think the Duke understood much English. He ate quickly and went out with some young men friends. Soon after tea, I left, but you know Shoghi Effendi how one knows intuitively if one is a loved guest or not and I felt that each one of them received me with loving thoughts.

.......... So after it was all over, I think what a glorious opportunity it was. I spoke of you at the table. At the end we mentioned Esperanto but not much, almost every word of our conversation was the Cause. (They just asked about the Congress and if I think Esperanto is making great progress.)

.......... When I came back, I had to go at once to Mr Skrach (President Masaryk's Secretary) and when I told him I had met these Queens he was thrilled that I had met the Queen of Yugoslavia and that they had asked about President Masaryk & Dr Alice Masaryk and sent greetings through me to them. The relations between Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are very, very close and it is a very great help to me here that I met and talked with the Queen of Yugoslavia. Also, it may help me very much when later I go to Belgrade.

.......... I think it was so gracious and good of Queen Marie to arrange that tea so that I did meet the Queen of Yugoslavia. They are not in the same villas--they have two or three villas close together, but Queen Marie arranged this little party. It was very beautiful and Queen Marie looked so beautiful, she is the greatest of them all.

.......... I took Archduchess Ileana four lovely pink roses. They expect to stay at this place until September fifth. The Queen's address is

Dowager Queen Marie of Romania
ROSEGGER-WEG 3
MOEDLING,
Bei Vienna, Austria <span data-pg='193'></span>
And her telephone number is
Moedling 282

.......... Franz Pollinger went with me on the bus to Moedling to show me the way and waited for me. [19]

	Martha was able to use this visit with the Queen to consult her about the Romanian translation of {Baha'u'llah and the New Era}, an effort which Queen Marie wholeheartedly endorsed. The Queen referred Martha to the English/Romanian translator of her own books, Miss Margarita Miller-Verghy who, she assured Martha, would do an excellent job.

	It is certain that news of this visit brought joy to the Guardian but he felt unable to respond directly to Martha owing to his profound grief and he therefore communicated his gratitude to her through his secretary on 15 September 1932:

[.]

.......... He was too sad and exhausted by this terrible blow to be able to acknowledge promptly the receipt of your stirring communications. The news you gave him, the progress of your work in the teaching field, your interviews, your association with the Esperanto Congress, the steps you have taken for the translation of Dr Esslemont's book, the reception accorded to you by the Queen, your words of sympathy addressed to himself--above all the continued evidences, each more remarkable than the previous one, of your high and ceaseless endeavours in the service of the Cause--all served to lift the burden of his grief and to assuage the anguish of his soul,[20]

Do not feel perturbed, and never allow any happening, within or outside the Cause, to becloud the radiance of your manifold activities or to lessen the scope of your eminent and meritorious services. Regarding the translation of the 'New Era' into Hungarian, Romanian and Greek, I leave, with absolute confidence, the whole matter to your discretion and judgement, as to the person, the time and place where the work should be undertaken.

	Martha forwarded the originals promptly to Shoghi Effendi with a letter on 31 October 1932:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Enclosed are the telegrams. I have never telegraphed Queen Marie without your name in it. You said in one letter to me that you would pray for her--I feel your prayers for her, and I felt you would join me in this greeting for her birthday, October 29. (Possibly I wrote you October 28, but I know it is October 29). I send you copy of my 'night letter' which I sent Oct. 27 (so that it could be forwarded if she would be out of Bucharest) and this is her prompt reply. I shall write to her this week and tell her that I am sending her dear message to you, and tell her that you have arranged for the translation of 'Baha'u'llah and the New Era' into Romanian. I hope that she will personally do everything she can and that she will write the Foreword. I feel she is very sad over conditions, I do not believe her life is so happy in these days of King Carol, but that is entre nous. Your prayers will be her joy and comfort. She loves you, Shoghi Effendi. I do not ask it, but if you would wish to send me two little bottles of the wonderful Persian Attar of Rose, could I please give one to her and one to President Masaryk? I believe Queen Marie would appreciate that very much, she loves perfume so deeply and knows its spiritual value.[26]

	An interesting episode began at this time, continuing over several months, concerning the attar of rose. On 17 November Shoghi Effendi sent a letter to Martha written on his behalf:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The Guardian has already sent you a large bottle of attar of roses. He could not find beautiful small bottles here in which he could pour it. You could there find better ones and divide the quantity as you deem best. As the attar is very volatile you should be very careful in choosing the bottles. <span data-pg='196'></span>

.......... The Guardian fully endorses your plan of having the Queen write a foreword to the Romanian translation of Dr Esslemont's book. It will surely have great effect in helping the spread of the book and raise it in the esteem of the public...

.......... The Guardian would very much like to know how the Queen will receive Nabil's narrative; so in case she writes you anything to that effect please let Shoghi Effendi know about it. He sincerely hopes that the reading of that book and acquaintance with those heroic lives will deepen her faith and strengthen her bond with the Cause. It is surely impossible for a noble and altruistic soul to read those accounts of self-sacrifice and not become deeply stirred, or find a complete change in his outlook ...[27]

I only wish to add a few words in person, immersed as I am in a sea of correspondence, and assure you of my ever-deepening admiration for the spirit and manner in which you are promoting the interests of our beloved Faith. I feel that a prolonged stay of two years in central and south-eastern Europe would be most valuable and I would leave it to your discretion as to the time you should spend in the countries and cities in that part of Europe. May the Beloved bless richly your high endeavours∑[28]

[.]

.......... ...I thank you so much for the wonderful perfume! I shall wait a few days to see if I hear from you that it is for Queen Marie. I did not dream you would send such a large bottle of this rare attar of rose. I fear it has been a very great expense for you, dearest Shoghi Effendi. But I believe it will bring a wonderful blessing. I would rather send it to Queen Marie than to give it to President Masaryk--because I have done and do other things for him and I know Queen Marie would love it and appreciate it so deeply. Perhaps you have written what you wish me to do with it, so I wait till I see if I receive a letter from you, but if not, I shall be so happy to send it to Queen Marie and to write her that you have sent it from Haifa. I feel she needs your love, your prayers and I know she loves the Cause and she loves you very much ...[29]

	On 29 November Martha also reconfirmed that she had found a Romanian translator for {Baha'u'llah and the New Era}:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The Romanian translation the Queen has told me whom to have translate it. (I asked about that when I made the trip to Vienna to see her in August.) You had said to me in your letter May 20, 1931: 'I feel that you should make an attempt to meet Queen Marie who has already expressed the hope to see you.'[30]

	Wanting everything to be befitting and done with the utmost care, Martha further explained, on 1 December 1932, what she was doing with the attar of rose:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I find that Praha has perfectly beautiful tiny bottles for the Attar of Roses. They are in all blue or in all yellow, or all green, or all crystal! They are the prettiest I have ever seen. The blue one is just Queen Marie's colour. I may take the Attar to their perfume shop to pour it in if I find they could seal it better than I. But I think I can do it.[31]

1933

	During this period Martha kept in contact with Princess Ileana, as she explained to Shoghi Effendi in a letter dated 8 January 1933:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I wish to write to Princess Ileana today to ask her if she will act as patroness of an Artists' Benefit in Vienna & I feel she will. Indirectly that will help our Cause because a Princess in Vienna who knows of our Cause is having the event in her home. I think Princess Ileana would be glad to do it and Vienna asks me to ask her. It does not involve any money. It is only to be the Honorary President or Patroness.[1]
.......... [1. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 8 January 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	The episode with the attar of rose continued, as Martha wrote to Shoghi Effendi on 27 January 1933:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...I am so sorry to tell you: I bought 3 little bottles for the Attar of Rose. I took the bottle to the perfume shop where the bottles were for him to pour it. I had never touched the cork (the tin top cover either). He looked [at] it, opened it & said there was no perfume that honey had been substituted he thought. Anyway something had happened & there was no attar! So he took the bottles back; and I wrote a good letter to Pres. Masaryk, Q. Marie, & P. Ileana and explained how we had wished to send the attar of rose, and what had happened & asked them please to accept the 'thought'. I tried to word it beautifully, so I feel in God's sight it is accepted. What we cannot help, dear Guardian, we must accept. I am sure you see I was careful, so careful that I took it to the dear perfume man in Praha to open & pour it. (I have the bottle with the honey in it, I keep the bottle as something precious, but there was no perfume in it and it had been opened. Inshallah!)[2]

	Just a few days later, on 31 January 1933, the next meeting between Queen Marie and Martha Root took place at the Queen's daughter Ileana's home in Modling, Austria, as the Queen records in her diary:

[.]
[.//]
Tuesday Jan 31st 1933
Modling

.......... Eager little Martha Root of the Baha'i came to lunch. Wonderful how that thin inconspicuous little middle-aged woman manages to spread the teaching, to publish books and get into touch with so many, to hold conferences, to make her quiet way and in many ways to succeed. It is admirable. She is a touching person and today we had her to ourselves.[3]
.......... [3. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished diary entry 31 January 1933, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	It appears that Martha Root was somewhat delayed in sending a report to Shoghi Effendi about this January 1933 meeting with Queen Marie. Her first indication of it to the Guardian was in a letter dated 4 March 1933:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Jan. 31, I had lunch with Dowager Queen Marie & Princess Ileana in Modling. They send you greetings & she liked the 'Dawn Breakers' very much--I shall write you fully, and we further discussed the translation & publication. They are our 'friends', Shoghi Effendi; they love our Cause, but the situation is hard in all countries politically.[4]
.......... [4. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 4 March 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	The letter was followed one day later by another, more detailed one:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...I wish to write you about Dowager Queen Marie. At my first lecture in Vienna, the American Women's Club, I heard that Q. Marie was in Modling. After the lecture I wrote her a letter & Franz Pollinger went with me to the P. Office to mail it 'express' at midnight. Next morning at 9 o'clock Ileana telephoned and invited me to lunch. (Mrs Kaufmann, a Polish Baha'i in Vienna came and showed me the way to Modling so that I could arrive in time--and she waited for me and took me on to my other two lectures).

.......... The Queen said:

.......... 'Please tell Shoghi Effendi that we three met, I, my daughter Ileana and Miss Root and we talked of him. We wish to send him our best greetings with hope of success in all his undertakings.' <span data-pg='200'></span>

.......... She said she liked 'The Dawn Breakers' very much.

.......... During luncheon she said: 'If people would use as much energy for loving as they do for hating, the world would not be so wrong and so disagreeable. This great lesson of loving is in the Baha'i Teaching.'

.......... She also said it was in Christianity but she only hopes it will get through! (she means that she hopes in the Baha'i Teaching it will really be liked.)

.......... We spoke about the translation and the publication of Dr Esslemont's book. She said that Mademoiselle Miller Verghy will be a very good translator. She said that her own Lady≠in-Waiting Madame Lahovary would help see about the publi≠cation -1 had asked that if I couldn't come to Bucharest and if the book could be published would she the Queen help me see about the publication? And she said: 'Madame Lahovary would see about it, you remember she always helped you and she was very kind.' (Madame Lahovary was lovely to me. She is very staunch Greek Orthodox but she went to Teheran when she was 17 years old & while there she heard a great deal about the Bab. She has always been kind to me and helped me--she sent my letters immediately to the Queen ...)

.......... The Queen as much as said that this time I wouldn't lose the money! (I never told her that Mr Fischer the Bucharest pub≠lisher took the money $99 then didn't print the two little Romanian booklets, but I had told Ileana -and so I know the Queen knows it.) I made it very clear that I didn't wish to pay until the work was finished -with this translation.

.......... I promised to pay one hundred dollars for the Romanian translation and I told her you had given it to me to do this for Romania and that it is in the Bohmische Union-Bank, Praha.

.......... I said it didn't look as if it could be printed now but if she would help me so that it could be done as economically as possible and I was sure of the publisher, I would see if later it could be published--and it was then she said that this time I wouldn't lose, and that Madame Lahovary would look after it.

.......... I asked her about the Foreword and she and Ileana both said it would be impossible because of the political situation. She said if it were some other country it would be easier! (that is entre nous) When I spoke with Franz Pollinger about it, he said there might be a great wisdom in the book being published <span data-pg='201'></span> without any foreword there because one never knows what may happen--anywhere!

.......... I hesitate to write even this much. Conditions are very difficult everywhere. I think it is for Queens & Princesses--and everybody.

.......... Q. M. said: 'The B. [Baha'i] Movement has no frontiers.' She spoke of the Latins being ironical which is worse than tyrannical.

.......... Christian Science, we spoke of it, and Q. M. said that the Christian Scientists are enormously contented. I said what Baha'u'llah taught and Ileana said: 'Yes, why not use the Doctors too for science also is God-given.' Q.M. also said that the Christians always [illegible] the money side--and the Baha'is do not!

.......... Q. M. said: 'I am a Protestant. I built a small Greek Orthodox Church on my grounds at Balcic, and a Turkish woman (Muhammadan) comes to worship.'

.......... Q. M. said: 'I found so many religionists nasty in the name of religion--it was a parody of religion!'

.......... Ileana said: 'What I like about the B. Teaching is that one does not need to renounce his own religion.'

.......... She also said: 'I am too Oriental, I like the church and the music.

.......... The sun shone out so brightly and Q. M. said: 'My Dear, you have brought us Persian sunshine!'

.......... As we left the table I admired the beautiful hyacinths and Q. M. said: 'I love the hyacinths. 'Abdu'l-Baha loved the hyacinths too, didn't He?' And she lovingly caressed the blooms. I said it speaks of the hyacinths in the Holy Words.
.......... I said how much I love colour and that she wears such beautiful colours--I told her how lovely the Greatest Holy Leaf always looked. She asked me to tell her more about the Greatest Holy Leaf, then at the close the subject once more turned to colour and Q. M. said: Loie Fuller, my dear friend, loved colour and she said love of colour is a sign of vitality. People have a necessity of colour.

.......... Again we spoke of the Greatest Holy Leaf and she said: 'There are people who just radiate good. It is like a clear atmosphere, they do not realize the good they do.'

.......... After luncheon Q. M. spoke of the Baha'i Teachings on Life after Death and she asked me to tell her more about them too. <span data-pg='202'></span>

.......... Then Ileana brought little Stefan her darling little son born Aug. 14 and little Stefan held out his little arms to his grandmother and smiled and wished to go to her! (It was the same In Belgrade Palace, little Peter the Crown Prince, then only 5 years old when I was there, had such a wonderful love for his grandmother Q. Marie.)

.......... Dearest Shoghi Effendi, I felt their love for the Baha'i Cause, their love for you, their interest to hear about Haifa and the Greatest Holy Leaf and 'Abdu'l-Baha's wife and His daughters.

.......... They again said how sorry they were they could not come to Haifa. And when I asked about the Foreword for the Romanian translation they both said--you remember how it was about the trip to Haifa! I think they have to be more and more careful, life is not easy. Strictly between you and me perhaps it is not very easy for Ileana to go [to] Bucharest.

.......... One thing pleased me, Ileana's husband doesn't make her be a R. Cath., he wishes her to believe just what she wishes in religion--I think he is a very liberal, good husband.

.......... Q. M. gave me such a large beautiful new picture of her taken with little Stefan. I think I will mail it tomorrow to the friends in Teheran. It is autographed. Also, she gave me a small one of her which is beautiful and Ileana gave me one. These two I may use if I write something--and afterwards I shall send them to you. I know you would say to use them where they will help our Cause most. And I know you have the one which she sent to you.

.......... It would be wonderful if that book could come out in Bucharest now in the time when Q. M. is there. She is very loved by the people...

.......... P.S. I do not need to tell you that I wrote Q. Marie and also Prince Paul about Howard and Marzieh. I so wished to have them go too, but no mention of them was made in the invitation to me--and the American Legation Minister said it would be utterly impossible. The political crisis is so great--I know they only saw me because they know me well ...[5]

	During this visit it became clear that the difficulties which Queen Marie and Princess Ileana had encountered during their visit to the Holy Land had not abated after three years. They both had to watch very carefully what they said and did. <span data-pg='203'></span>

	A letter to Martha of 18 March 1933 written on Shoghi Effendi's behalf, stated: 'Also he would like you to hasten the completion of the Romanian translation...'[6]
.......... [6. Unpublished letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 18 March 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]

	The last paragraph of this letter Shoghi Effendi found a moment to write himself, despite the great burden of his work, telling Martha Root how greatly he appreciated her efforts:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Pressure of voluminous, ever-increasing correspondence con≠stantly interferes with my immediate acknowledgement of your soul-refreshing letters. How much each one of them contributes to the removal of the obstacles, material, mental and spiritual that stand in my way! How much they alleviate my cares and sorrows! How intensely they brighten my vision of the future glory, the present vitality of our beloved Faith! I am mailing to your address a small bottle of attar of rose, and am deeply sorry that such a mistake has been made. Where and how it occurred it is impossible to tell.[7]
.......... [7. Unpublished note appended to ibid.]
[.///]
[.]

	The gift of attar of rose continued to be of concern. To ensure that no one tampered with a new bottle that Shoghi Effendi wished to send, his secretary wrote on his behalf to Martha on 24 March:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Shoghi Effendi wishes me to write you this short note to inform you that he is not going to send you the bottle of attar of roses as he promised to do in his last letter. The mail is unsafe and they may do this time as they did the last time, for it is almost sure that it is in the post office that the bottle was opened and the attar changed into honey. He will wait until some person is found who is likely to meet you, and will give him the bottle to hand it to you personally. This way there will be no risk incurred.[8]
.......... [8. Unpublished letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 24 March 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Martha continued to make every effort to complete the translations of Dr Esslemont's book, as a series of letters to Shoghi Effendi demonstrates. On 12 April 1933 she wrote:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Queen Marie has sent me a beautiful story she has written about Ileana. (If I could get time to copy it, I shall send it to you. I wish to write an article about the Queen and use it.) <span data-pg='204'></span>

.......... I shall try to hurry the translations: I am going to write the Queen to see if perhaps she could be in Belgrade when I am there June 1-10.[9]
.......... [9. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 12 April 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	On 1 May she foresaw the advisability of a prolonged stay in Bucharest to see the work carried out properly:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I shall write to Queen Marie to see if perhaps she could come to Belgrade while I am there. She may not be in Bucharest in summer. Perhaps she could get the book published if you sent the money to her Lady-in-Waiting--but a book is a lot of work and perhaps it would be better if I went and remained just as I did in Praha & here in Budapest until the book is out. But of course there may not be money to print them.[10]
.......... [10. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 1 May 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	and again on 7 May:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I understand that Q. Marie has been away. I do not think the Romanian translation will be ready by June first, but I think it will be ready perhaps by August.[11]
.......... [11. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 7 May 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Always extremely concerned about the limited resources of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi requested his secretary to make the following suggestion to Martha on 15 May:

[.]
[.//]
.......... As regards the translations of Dr Esslemont's book: He has already asked you to send him 50 Hungarian and 20 Czech copies. When the Romanian and Serbian are also published please send him fifty copies of each of those editions.

.......... The Guardian is enclosing a draft on London for £100; this is to cover the translation and publication of the Romanian and Serbian editions. He believes that with all the expenses the Cause has, especially in connection with the Temple, we should be very careful in spending our funds. He wants you therefore to find out whether we cannot publish these books at a lesser cost, for example whether we can arrange with a publisher to publish the book at his own cost and we buy from him only a certain number of copies. The publisher could benefit from any profit made on the sale and we will have the book available to the public. Another advantage in such a method is that the publisher will help the sale and distribution of the books. This is only in case such a method will make us undertake less <span data-pg='205'></span> financial responsibility. The Guardian wishes you to use your own judgement but take this matter also into consideration.[12]
.......... [12. Unpublished letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 15 May 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	The Guardian added to the letter the following suggestion:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...After attending to the Greek translation in Greece you could go to Albania for a short visit and then return to Bulgaria and visit Romania.[13]
.......... [13. Unpublished note appended to ibid.]
[.///]
[.]

	To ensure that money reached Martha, the Guardian's secretary, in a letter of 16 May, told her of the further precautions that had been taken:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Yesterday I wrote you a letter on behalf of the Guardian and enclosed in it a draft for £100 to cover the expenses of the translation and publication of Dr Esslemont's book into Romanian and Serbian. I addressed it care of the American Consul, Belgrade. Please write him a note and ask him to keep it until your arrival. Shoghi Effendi asked me to address the letter to Belgrade thinking you might find some difficulty in taking money out of Budapest with you.[14] .......... [14. Unpublished letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 16 May 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Meanwhile, Martha managed to meet other members of Europe's royal families and Shoghi Effendi expressed his pleasure in a letter written on his behalf on 10 July 1933:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Shoghi Effendi was delighted to receive your letter of June 15th, 1933 together with the enclosed message addressed to him by Princesses Elizabeth and Marina of Greece and Prince Paul of Yugoslavia.

.......... He was particularly glad to witness how effectively God is guiding your steps and is assisting you with His blessings all through your significant and wellnigh unique contacts with important Court personages and he feels confident that through your zeal, devotion and perseverance some of them will be increasingly confirmed in the Cause. The long and most interesting conversation you have had with their Royal Highnesses at the Royal Palace in Belgrade was fully indicative of their profound interest in the Teachings. They have most probably read the Queen's eloquent and touching appreciation published in Volume IV of 'The Baha'i World' and must have been <span data-pg='206'></span> inspired by it. It is hoped that their interest will be increasingly deepened and that it will lead them to pay a similar tribute to the beauty, power and uniqueness of the Baha'i Revelation. You will find enclosed a letter addressed to them by Shoghi Effendi and written in his own handwriting. May Baha'u'llah open still further their eyes that they may fully realize the Divine Bounties bequeathed by Him to the world...[15]
.......... [15. Unpublished letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 10 July 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	The Guardian appended a note to this letter in which he requested Martha to review a letter he had written: 'I am enclosing a letter to the Princesses which I trust you will find proper and suitable. After reading it you will kindly forward it to their address.'[16]
.......... [16. Unpublished note appended to ibid.]

	Martha Root arrived back in Bucharest in August 1933 for her fourth visit to Romania and wrote to Shoghi Effendi on 15 August to keep him informed of the steps she was taking to complete the Romanian translation of {Baha'u'llah and the New Era}:

[.]
[.//]
.......... In Bucharest I did nothing with the Esperantists except the Esperantists and young men interested in our Cause. I met at once with Mlle. Miller-Verghy. She is very sweet, very spiritual, very intelligent, she is blind and very poor. She lives in a house (she has two rooms) given free to poor gentlewomen, then all she has is what she earns from translating. She translates the Queen's books, she is a friend of the Queen. I found she had only translated seventy pages, the first 3 chapters, she is so eager to have the money, she needs it, I have not sent it yet, but I shall soon. I feel she would translate it for nothing if she could but she is in great want. We must (and that time Mr Kinkoff came too to see some publishers & then we went to her room to tea Mr D. had a talk with her. [sic] The cheapest publisher demanded $250, cash in advance to publish the book & then he must have the first $140 worth of books sold before he would get anything--which means he would charge $250 + $40 = $290 for publishing. It was the biggest publisher and newspaper in Romania. Miss Miller-Verghy writes me she has found another publisher who will do it for $250 (but she wrote me that before I went to Bucharest, so I think it is best to have Madame Lahovary the Queen's Lady-in-Waiting decide about <span data-pg='207'></span> the publisher and we give the money to Madame Lahovary & she pay the bill. I do not wish to lose it all again with a Romanian publisher. The Queen said to speak to Madame Lahovary & trust it to her. Madame Lahovary is not a business woman I imagine but she will do it if the Queen has said so. [)] Princess Ileana & husband and Madame Lahovary were in Norway when I was in Bucharest. Entre nous, the stork is coming again to Ileana's home.

.......... I feel the Queen & Ileana are our true friends... I am writing the Queen this week, if I possibly can...
August 17.

.......... ...About Bucharest, I have the money to pay Mile Miller≠Verghy and I shall send it soon... I doubt the Romanian edition can be published for $250. I did not find any publisher who would and then there would be the expense of sending it out.

.......... If you send a check to me for Bucharest for 70, I will see if it can be done for that, and if it is any less I will send the money right back to you, but I found Bucharest fearfully expensive, and Mile Miller-Verghy doesn't know. She wrote me she had a publisher who would do it for $250 and that publisher told me when I went that he wouldn't do it at all, they were too busy. I think the only way we can do it is to cooperate with Madame Lahovary & the Queen. The Queen doesn't stay much in Bucharest any more, but I shall try to go when she is there. Please let me know if both books can be published and if not which one must be published first.

.......... I shall write Queen Marie within four days, and perhaps I can hear from her when she will be in Bucharest.[17]

	The day finally arrived when the Romanian translation of {Baha'u'llah and the New Era} was completed, as Martha Root joyfully communicated to Shoghi Effendi on 18 September 1933: 'The Romanian translation is finished ready to
print.'[18]
.......... [18. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 18 September 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]

	Realizing the frightful costs in Romania, Shoghi Effendi felt it important for the publishing work to go ahead and requested a response to be sent to Martha on his behalf on 5 October 1933: <span data-pg='208'></span>

[.]
[.//]
.......... Concerning the Roumanian translation of Dr Esslemont's book, the Guardian wishes me to inform you that it meets with his full approval. He will send you, in the early days of November, the sum of seventy pounds for its immediate publication, and hopes to send you later on an equal sum for the translation and publication of this same book into Greek. But at present he wishes you to concentrate on the Roumanian version...[19]

	Never forgetting her suffering co-religionists in Iran and always eager to bring some joy to them, Martha wrote to Shoghi Effendi on 7 October 1933 from Belgrade:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Today I mailed you the pictures for Volume V or rather just as suggestions. As I had no 'backing' I used the envelope and cardboard for Persia. Perhaps you can send Q. Marie's picture the large one in the envelope on to Tihran or give it to a pilgrim returning.[20]

	Certain that Martha Root's presence in Bucharest would facilitate the publication of the Romanian edition of {Baha'u'llah and the New Era}, Shoghi Effendi asked his secretary to write to her on 3 November 1933:

[.]
[.//]
.......... As to the Romanian translation of the same work, he would be very grateful if you let him know when and where you would like him to forward to your address the sum necessary for its publication. He fully approves of your intention to go back to Sofia after your return from Adrianople, and thence to Bucharest, where your presence, besides being very helpful to the cause of teaching, will greatly ensure the speedy publication of the Romanian version of Dr Esslemont's book...[21]

	The following note Shoghi Effendi added himself: 'I trust I will soon be able to forward the sum required in addition to the £70 for the Romanian version.'[22]
.......... [22. Unpublished note appended to ibid.]

	Martha was hopeful that Queen Marie would provide another appreciation for volume five of {The Baha'i World}. The two women had discussed this during their last meeting in January and Martha was eager for the Queen to offer <span data-pg='209'></span> such a statement in time for its publication, as she informed Shoghi Effendi on 8 November 1933:

[.]
[.//]
.......... No word yet from Q. Marie enclosing article for Vol. V. Perhaps I may write her again. I wrote her from Adrianople & said if she had been too busy to write it before Nov. 1, that if she sends it any time in November, I hope it will still be in time.

.......... Jacky [Marion Jack] asks me if I will stay a month in Sofia now. I waited here a week for her, & also I was in Ruse 10 days, & you said for me to go to Bucharest to bring out the book, so I had expected to start for Bucharest Dec. first. I love Sofia, but I plan to stay here now during November and possibly a few days in Dec. and then go to Bucharest just as you told me to do.[23]
.......... [23. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 8 November 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]

	Martha then made plans to depart for Romania, as she described to the Guardian on 15 November:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I leave Dec. 13 for Bucharest and I can see about publishing the book immediately if you find you can send the £70, to reach me about December 15. I can not make any contract until the money comes--they won't print anything until the funds are in the bank there. Bucharest is not an easy city in which to work--but a Queen arose from there!

.......... I am worried I do not hear from her for our Vol. V. The first moment I get [there], I shall write her once more.
My address in Bucharest will be

.......... Concerning the Romanian translation, he wishes you to send him fifty copies when the book is published.

[.]
[.//]
.......... You will be interested to know that we have already twenty-five printed versions of the 'New Era', and I feel, in no small measure, indebted to you for so great an achievement. I am eager to receive the Romanian and, eventually, the Greek versions. More power to your elbow![26]

	Funds were despatched on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root on 4 December 1933:

[.]

.......... He is sending you enclosed a cheque for 70 pounds for the immediate publication of Dr Esslemont's book in Romanian. He hopes that this will enable you to start the work without any delay...

.......... P.S. Will you please send the Guardian 20 copies of the Czech translation of the 'New Era' and 50 copies of the Romanian as soon as it is published.[27]

	Shortly before her departure for Romania, Martha Root wrote to the Guardian on 11 December 1933:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I leave for Bucharest early Wednesday morning Dec. 13. Alas, the Queen is in Moedling (near Vienna) with Princess Ileana but she told me to go to her Lady-in-Waiting Madame Lahovary, & Madame L. would help me & advise me. I still hope it may be possible to get something from the Queen for Vol. V. but I know she is very rushed & conditions there in Romania are very grave. I will try to send you something & trust you can use it even if it comes late.[28]
.......... [28. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 11 December 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	A week after her arrival in Bucharest, Martha was able to tell Shoghi Effendi how the Romanian translation of Dr Esslemont's book was progressing:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...Thanks so much for your beautiful letter of Dec. 4 and for the checque [sic] for the publication of 'Bahi [sic] and the New Era' into Romanian. I am working very hard to try to get it arranged and shall write you as soon as it is settled--it is very complicated, and am trying to decide what is best to do and am seeking the advice of Madame L., the Lady-in-Waiting etc. etc. ...

.......... Two days ago I met a lovely young woman, niece of Madame Lahovary, young woman, pianist, friend of the Queen and this <span data-pg='211'></span> young woman told me the Queen has read to her parts from Baha and the New Era, the little talk with her made me happy.

.......... Another happiness after all these years about 6 years, like a miracle. we have found the Mss. of the tiny blue booklet and 'What is the B. Movement?' that Princess Ileana translated-≠and they were never published. They were in the attic of that printer's place With a lot of other Mss. and an Esperantist little friend of mine, IONESCU CAPATANA, found them. I am moving very slowly but I hope they can be published...

.......... I see great possibilities and I intend to stay at least two months for it will take at least two months to get the book out, and it would be so good If we could really get a group established...

.......... Yesterday,. I wrote the Queen and Princess I. [Ileana] a letter and mailed it to Moedling, just a note of love, but I told her I am sure you will find it is still in time if she can write the appreciation for Vol V. any time in January. I know she will write it unless she can not because of political reasons.

.......... This young woman I met told me the Queen hopes to be back in Bucharest by Jan. 10 or 15.

.......... I do not write you about the printers for I do not know. An orthodox Priest wants to print it. I meet him tomorrow at home of Mlle Miller-Verghy the translator. The Priest is a friend of Madame Lahovary and of Ileana--I do not know whether he has machinery or only hand press, he is just beginning. But dearest Shoghi Effendi, I am going to consult Madame Lahovary and bring out that book with the printer she advises if I can. I have written her this afternoon as I couldn't write her until I had everything ... and in perfect order to go in to her presence, now I am ready.

.......... Madame L. has been to Persia, to Teheran. Madame L. is very rich, has many properties and this smaller hotel to which I came by chance 8 years ago & every time since I heard last night is one of her properties, you see how God guides us to the places He wishes. Madame L.'s husband has passed on last year. In my note to her, I also spoke of the Teachings of immortality. Also that I would send her the Tahirih Mss. to read.

.......... It is fearfully expensive in Bucharest, everything is three or often four times more than in Bulgaria--but I think perhaps Abdu'l-Baha may have thought New York City was very expensive, but He didn't run away from His Task. I haven't <span data-pg='212'></span> ever run away from anything yet. I think the book won't be
more, at least I'll do my utmost. I wish I could get it for a little
less but I do not think it is possible.

.......... With everything unsettled, still dearest Shoghi Effendi, don't you feel a thrill of hope that something good can come. I do, it is a good confirmation to find the Mss. of our Princess, and to hear that our Queen read aloud from 'Baha and the N. Era' to this young friend![29]
.......... [29. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 18 December 1933, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	This meeting with the young niece of Madame Lahovary confirmed to Martha Root that Queen Marie still had an intimate connection with the Baha'i writings as she had read aloud to this young woman from {Baha'u'llah and the New Era}.

	As with all publications, there were delays, as Martha Root described to Shoghi Effendi on 25 December 1933, but Princess Ileana had recommended a particular publishing house which had agreed to print the book:

[.]
[.//]
.......... About the book nothing is settled yet, and no one can begin until Jan. 2. but I think I shall sign the contract to have the Orthodox Priest, a friend of Princess Ileana & one of the great priests here print the book. I have written the Queen about it. I have worried about that book every day. I am sorry I can not tell you it is definitely settled yet--it is the most complicated here of any place so far since I began seeing about these publications, but Baha'u'llah will guide me, and you are praying for me.

.......... I hope that printer who never printed those two booklets that Ileana translated will print them now. If he does, there will be five thousand of each of them. He has promised, Inshallah!

.......... It will take at least a month to print the Esslemont book and another month to try to get it placed in bookshops etc. and perhaps they can't get (it] out in one month, so I shall be here until the end of Feb. and I do not know how much longer.

.......... IONESCU CAPATANA, 18 years old, is my dearest helper. He is an idealist and he starves to promote his ideas. He is a pioneer of vegetarianism but he is attracted to our Teachings. Had it not been for him we never should have found the Mss. of Ileana and it is IONESCU who urges the printer now to print them and IONESCU will read the proofs and help in all ways to get those booklets out. It was IONESCU who told Mr Relgis that I am here. <span data-pg='213'></span>

.......... I do not try to write more but am doing as much as I possibly can. I know you are praying for the work here and for me and it gives me courage. Perhaps you ask why do I have the Priest print the book? (He doesn't know one word what is in the book.) Because destiny just seems to move for him to print it. If he would and if the book carries the name of that printing house, it means the book would be acceptable in Orthodox Romania. It is a great thing if it succeeds. Please pray specially for this publication, beloved Shoghi Effendi. Please pray for the Queen and the Princess and for this whole country of Romania.[30]

1934

	On 1 January 1934 Queen Marie wrote from Austria to Martha Root, who was in Romania, to offer a further appreciation of the Baha'i Faith. She also indicated her desire to meet Martha again:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Will these words do for Vol. V? The difficulty was not to repeat myself.

.......... I shall be back at Cotroceni end of January; shall I still find you there.

.......... Thanks many times for the dear little handkerchiefs and also for your letters.

.......... The new little Life-Bud is there! Such a darling, little Marie Ileana. She gave some trouble to her mother before she came, but now she is pure and lovely joy.

.......... Ileana sends you an affectionate greeting and blessings on your work of love.

.......... I hope you have found kind helpers.

.......... We have been horribly upset by the news of Mr Duca's cruel death. If we could only spread love in the world instead of hate.

.......... Little Marie Ileana is to be christened on the fifth, her mother's 25 birthday.

.......... On the 10th I go to Belgrade for 10 or 14 days and then, so God wills, back to Cotroceni.

.......... I admire you [sic] patient and ceaseless work. May strength be given you to carry on.

[.///]
[.]

	As in this letter, the Queen several times expressed her admiration for Martha Root and it is unlikely that she did so <span data-pg='215'></span> insincerely. Indeed, she continued to write appreciations of the Baha'i Faith, evidently pleased to accede to Martha's requests.

	This most recent appreciation was to be included in volume five of {The Baha'i World}. It is possible that with advancing age and a very trying existence, Queen Marie was thinking more and more of the rest her soul would have after passing from this world:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The Bahai teaching brings peace to the soul and hope to the heart.

.......... To those in search of assurance the words of the Father are as a fountain in the desert after long wandering. Marie 1934[2]

	After the assassination of Prime Minister Duca, the situation in Romania deteriorated and Martha Root was not spared from the ensuing restrictions in Bucharest, as she described in her letter to Shoghi Effendi of 3 January 1934:

[.]
[.//]
.......... About the publication here, it is not yet arranged. I went to see Madame Lahovary and she is so efficient, so lovely, I feel her love and know she will do everything she can to help me. She had heard from your friend in Moedling about the book and she told me perhaps she would telephone her the next day. But there is so much to be considered and I am waiting to see what they think is best to be done. Then the Prime Minister, Mr Duca, was assassinated and nothing could be done until after the funeral. I am to telephone her at 10 a.m. tomorrow. I am considering two or three different printers, I do not go into details, but I know you trust me and if you were here I think you would do as I am doing, I pray so many times in the day that God will choose the printer. I think it can be done and will be done and also the 10,000 little booklets after six years' waiting, I think they will be printed with the money I paid them six years ago.

.......... The passing of Mr Duca is very serious, you will have seen in the papers that there is martial law, censorship, and all meetings, lectures, groups, forbidden. That does not mean that <span data-pg='216'></span> one's friends can not call, one or two or three sometimes. 1love Romania and pray to be a true friend to this nation.

.......... I can not see about the publication more quickly, I am doing all I can, but I know it is better to wait until I am sure which printer would be the best. Now it will be necessary to ask the censorship board about the publication and the booklets. I am glad and thankful Madame L. is my friend and that the Queen is my true friend. As soon as matters are arranged I shall write you -but I write now to tell you about Draga, and also to tell you how lovely Madame L. is to me and the good news that she had heard from your friend in Moedling and your friend asked her to help me. Baha'u'llah is very good...

.......... Since this tragedy it will be much harder to help Romania as much as I wished, but to do what I can, and do it well, may Baha'u'llah bless it to bear a rare and beautiful fruit!

.......... Please continue to pray for us all, dearest Guardian Shoghi Effendi. I wish I could always write you happy letters, but I think this letter does carry joy to your heart that your friend in Moedling sent word to Madame L. about the book, and that Madame L. rec'd this servant with love. Madame L. is not a Baha'i. She is Orthodox Church (the State Church), but 1like her very, very much. (She was in Persia when she was 17 yrs. old). I took the pictures of the Bab and 'Abdu'l-Baha and showed her. Her friend wrote about Persia & mentioned the Bab in the book. I shall try to find out about this book & let you know.

.......... I told her I liked the little hotel where I am staying because it was here that I rec'd the first letter from Her Majesty. Madame L. told me that her brother owned this hotel (I didn't ask but I think her brother passed on last year.) Madame L. said: 'Life is very difficult.' I said: 'yes, but sometimes in the difficulties the soul goes forward to its greatest progress.'

.......... I had hoped the Queen would return about Jan. 15, but now I do not know, perhaps. Please pray for her very specially, for I think life is very difficult for all, even for Queens.[3]

[.///]
[.]

	Further details followed in Martha's letter to Shoghi Effendi of 8 January 1934:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...Here is our Foreword or where ever you wish to place it from Her dear Majesty. It has just come today and I hasten to <span data-pg='217'></span> send it to you, together with copy of her dear letter. Oh, I am happy to have it!

.......... Shoghi Effendi, generally I send you the original of her letters, but I feel guided to keep the original of the letter to me and only send you the copy of it but I send the original of the Foreword. The times are very very ___ [Martha Root left this word out] owing to the assassination of the Prime Minister and it might be a great help to me to have her personal letter to me. I do hope you can give her statement a good place as you did before and also have it translated into Persian. Cotroceni = is her palace here in Bucharest where I met her that first time. I think it was Jan. 30, 1926.

.......... The two little handkerchiefs I sent to her and to Princess Ileana, one was from my cousin in Pennsylvania and one was from Jessie Revell, my Christmas presents that came early. I wished so much to send them something and so I sent what I could. Dear Shoghi Effendi when I touched the tiny piece of the Coat of Baha'u'llah (rather the fur, I have a very tiny piece) I felt that impulse to give the handkerchiefs, for I was so longing to give something. I only tell this to you, for I know your heart would understand.

.......... Today I went to the Army headquarters to get permission to publish the book and the booklets. Oh, the soldiers, the people, the Generals! I do not speak of it, but I saw the Colonel with the great help of the letter from the Queen's Lady-in-Waiting and I did get the permission to publish the book and the two booklets (tiny blue booklet and 'What is the B. [Baha'I] F.[Faith]?' booklet.) Then I went to the American Consul for the mail--all the way thinking 'oh how I wish I had come to Romania sooner, two months ago!' Then at the Consulate I found Her Majesty's good letter and the Appreciations for Vol. V. and the letter and article from Prof Katzaroff in Sofia. I was very uplifted!

.......... I returned & telephoned please to start printing the booklets (these booklets are paid for by me six years ago, printing the book if they will[)]--the money hasn't come for the book the check had to go to London & back and I fear they didn't start it soon because of the holiday season. It was supposed to go to London Dec. 18, but that is a detail. It will come & I feel it will be here tomorrow & the work begin. <span data-pg='218'></span>

.......... Also, there was a new law after this tragedy, murder, that no group of more than 3 could meet, so I obeyed it and only had 3 people at a time here in my room. Today, I asked the Lady-in-Waiting & she said I could have 6 or even 9, and if the hotel said anything to tell them to come to her. The hotel people know me and what I am doing, but still I shall be very careful, I may not have more than 3 until the Queen comes. I wish to do everything just as the government says.

.......... Also because of these new laws of censor I had to go to the Army headquarters to ask permission and I thought best to go myself and take the books & explain. I was afraid they might say no if the printer went who didn't understand the teachings.

.......... I shall try to send you something from Mr Relgis the Romanian writer. I expect to go to see him Wednesday.

.......... I do not write more today, but all is well for you see Baha'u'llah is helping us. Your prayers are being answered, loved Guardian. Have been seeing the friends two at a time and doing all I could. Please keep on praying for this dear country and for this servant's strength and courage...

.......... ...but of course I do not think I can hurry things here, for I do not know how long it will take to get the book out--at least a month (in Budapest they promised it one month & were more than two months! In Belgrade they promised it in one month and had it out on time). It will take me nearly or all of four weeks to get the book in bookstores, libraries etc. after it is ready, for the Priest only prints it. Do you not think if the Queen would give them out we should give her 200? She would do more with them than anyone and the time is very short our days are quickly passing. I hope to send some to Transylvania...

.......... Shall do my best here and then go to Athens and how thankful I am that these books can be published for there is great need of them...

.......... Please pray for Mlle Miller Verghy of Bucharest... She translated the book, loves it, but she is so engrossed in her Roman Catholic religion, I am not sure that she would become a believer. I do not know...

.......... If you wish to write to Her Majesty and H.R.H. Princess Ileana (Archduchess Anton) I would be very happy to take Her the letter. It is Ileana's translations of those booklets that we are using after six years. And you see in her greetings she <span data-pg='219'></span> wished 'blessings for the work'. I think they are true, true friends, but times are difficult to express one's self.[4]

[.]

	The printing of the pamphlets and the booklet did go ahead once approval was received from the military censor. Considering the restrictions in Romania after the assassination of the prime minister, this accomplishment is perhaps even more incredible than it might at first appear. Martha wrote to Shoghi Effendi about the progress of the work on 22 January 1934:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The Esslemont book--more than 100 pages are printed ready to bind, they print 16 pages each day.

.......... Today I took the typed proofs of the two little booklets to the Censor again & he sends them to a General (the army does the censoring now) and I am to go again on Thurs. I have to take the book too, when all the pages are set up. They were very kind to me. It takes much time, I made two trips there today.

.......... The printer, .who rec'd the money six years ago & now promises to, print the booklets, doesn't feel very happy about It, he doesn't want to buy the paper. You see what kind of a man he is, he failed me six years ago and I do not feel sure he will keep his word now. I have two written statements from him that he will print them, but I know he doesn't wish to (he only has to buy the paper, it didn't cost him anything to have them set up (for he has to pay his printers anyway, so much each week and they are not busy all the time.) The two booklets are set up ready to be struck off (printed & bound). Psychologically, the printer (owner) is rather cross with Ionescu that. he unearthed these Mss. & urged that they be printed. He is perhaps a little cross that I didn't give him the Esslemont book to print. I thought those booklets were to be all finished last Saturday--so now I do not know. When people do not keep their word I can not count on anything. (I paid him $99 six years ago, an enormous price, but I did it because he was considered the best and I wanted them to be very, very beautiful, for I was going to give four thousand of each to Princess Ileana, they were to be excellent paper--but now he will only use the cheapest paper and he even wants one to buy that, for he says he is too poor. He is poor for he is very much in debt. He is not a reliable man. <span data-pg='220'></span>

.......... I wish to say that money was something of my father's and if he had printed the books at that time (as he promised & I have his written promise) then Her Majesty was queen & she & P. Ileana were very enthusiastic & telling their friends. Now the world is changed, she is not the Ruler & Ileana is away and as you know there is martial law. I do not wish to bother you with details, but in these difficult days, I am doing the very utmost I can...

.......... I am so glad the Queen will come.[5]

23 January 1934

Your Majesty,

.......... I am deeply touched by the splendid appreciation your Majesty has graciously penned for 'The Baha'i World', and wish to offer my heartfelt and abiding gratitude for this striking evidence of your Majesty's sustained interest in the Cause of Baha'u'llah.

.......... I was moved to undertake its translation in person, and feel certain that the unnumbered followers of the Faith in both the East and the West will feel greatly stimulated in their unceasing labours for the eventual establishment of the Most Great Peace foretold by Baha'u'llah.

.......... I am presenting to your Majesty, through the care of Miss Martha Root, a precious manuscript in the handwriting of Baha'u'llah, illuminated by a devoted follower of His Faith in Tihran.

.......... May it serve as a token of my admiration for the spirit that has prompted your Majesty to voice such noble sentiments for a struggling and persecuted Faith. With the assurance of my prayers at the threshold of Baha'u'llah for your Majesty's welfare and happiness,

I am yours very sincerely,

	Shoghi Effendi directed a letter to be written on his behalf to Martha Root on 24 January:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...He was particularly delighted to witness that you have succeeded in obtaining from Her Majesty the Queen such a <span data-pg='221'></span> befitting statement for 'The Baha'i World', and he wishes me to inform you that he is planning to use it, together with the photograph of the grave of the Greatest Holy Leaf, as a frontispiece for volume five of that Biennial. He has himself addressed to the Queen a letter of appreciation, and has forwarded it, together with an illuminated manuscript in the handwriting of Baha'u'llah, to your address that you may offer them to Her Majesty in person. He has also requested the American National Spiritual Assembly to address a similar letter of appreciation to the Queen, and to send it to you, that in case you find it advisable, it should be presented through you to her. He hopes that these written expressions of profound gratitude will encourage the Queen in her efforts to serve the Cause, and will convince her of the wide effectiveness of her eloquent tributes to the Faith.

.......... Shoghi Effendi has also read with much interest the copy of the communication addressed to you by the Queen. But as you have only sent the second page of that letter he is sending it back to you that you may ascertain whether the whole text of the letter has been forwarded to him or not. He wishes you also to find out whether the Queen has read the copy of 'The Dawn-Breakers' sent to her through your care. He has as yet received no acknowledgement from her. Please let him know also whether she has seen the last volume of 'The Baha'i World'? ...[7]

	Martha Root confirmed receipt of the precious manuscript on 11 February:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...Thanks for your dear letter, it made me very, very happy! The letter to Her Majesty was beautiful. I sealed It. The illuminated Manuscript is glorious. It came safely, and I am so delighted you have sent it. I expect to hear from the Queen this week, perhaps tomorrow, for I feel sure [she] will invite me to come to see her and I shall take your letter and the handwriting of Baha'u'llah. I sent her a little note of welcome and told her I have them & told her that today I would have the meeting (for I thought best to tell her or she might have invited me today and I was very eager to have the meeting). She only came Friday and perhaps she went to Sinaia today to see members of her family. I told her in my letter I hoped the Esslemont book would be ready tomorrow night and also the booklets. I wrote the letter very carefully and said exactly what I wished to say and I have faith that she will invite me to come to her within the next few days.

.......... Saturday I was so busy all day with the book. I just take the steps one after another of the most important... After all, I am getting those 10,000 booklets that I should have had seven years ago, 1927. Tonight I am working on the addresses to send out the Romanian book. I have made the contract to put 600 on sale at a good bookstore who will place them in 150 bookstores all over Romania. Mr Relgis helped me with that. I am so happy to see about these publications, so rejoiced to have them, but so many difficulties come, I just have to go to the American Consulate & consult--and first of all pray and then in the end everything seems to get settled beautifully.

.......... I thought I had lost the booklets entirely, that he wouldn't print them but suddenly Friday he began to print them, It was a miracle of God...[10]

	The translations finished and printed, Martha Root made plans for their dissemination in Romania, as she wrote in her letter to Shoghi Effendi of 12 February 1933:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...The books came tonight and I have done up 50 in packages of 5 each ready to send to you registered. I hope you will like them, dearest Guardian.

.......... No word yet from the Queen. I held your letter until tonight thinking I might hear, for I know you will be disappointed not to have news--but I have faith, Shoghi Effendi, that Baha'u'llah who could get those booklets printed and get this book pulled through its difficulties will help her and help us to whatsoever He wishes. I know all will be well. I trust her and I love her. She must be very busy just getting home and perhaps she is in Sinaia over the week-end. I think next letter I can write you happy news of a message from her. I did not send your letter & gift for you hoped I could present it in person and I believe I can.

.......... I am so happy to see the book a reality and I think its blue and white cover is attractive and it is what Romanians like and that is why I chose it.

.......... Today I received the vegetarian magazine printed by Ionescu, it has an article on 'Abdu'l-Baha's views on diet. I translated it from English into Esperanto, & he from Esperanto into Romanian as he does not know English. Also, in the magazine is an announcement of the booklets and where to write to the 'Baha'i Committee' for information and in each magazine is enclosed a leaflet 'What is the B. [Baha'i] Movement?' I shall mail it to you...

.......... My room is lovely, full of books (Romanian 'B. & N. E.' [{Baha'u'llah and the New Era}]) and carefully done up is the illuminated Tablet of Baha'u'llah, it is thrilling to have it in my room, and gives a Power! And your letter. The tiny blue booklets will be ready in two days, at least he promises so I'm happy that all is so good for Romania.

.......... It is all right about the books. I shall place them and get them done up by the end of this week.[11]

	On 14 February Martha Root informed the Guardian of the disposition of the books: <span data-pg='224'></span>

[.]
[.//]
.......... P.S. I hope to interview the Queen & write something about the Spiritual Life of Q. M. Her views.

.......... ...Today Madame Lahovary, the Lady-in-Waiting, invited me to her home. I took your letter & the illuminated manuscript and she will give them to the Queen today--her 'Valentines' spelled with a capital V.

.......... I also took one hundred and one books for the Queen and nine for Madame Lahovary. Madame Lahovary said she had not taken my letter to the Queen at once because she couldn't go to the palace but when the Queen read it she said immediately: 'I wish to see Miss Root.' So Madame L. will speak with her tomorrow and said: 'I think she will try to see you before Sunday if you are going to leave on Sunday evening.' So it is a confirmation that Baha'u'llah is doing everything. I thought she would invite me--because her letter had been so cordial. Madame L. thinks the book is beautiful & we had a good talk about the Cause. She is orthodox church but she was in Persia when she was 17 years old and she is a little attracted, and she was pleased to have the books. She has helped me so much, given me letters to the Censor, etc. & she telephones them too, that I am coming. (She lives near me, but not near Cotroceni Palace.)

.......... I mailed registered SO books to Haifa, yesterday 10 packages, five in a package, most are addressed to you, but I sent one package addressed to Mr Ahmad Yazdi, Persian Colony and one to Sohail Afnan, Persian Colony. I thought it might be better to use two or three addresses. I sent yours to P.O. Box 155.

.......... I have nearly finished arranging about the books and have sent them widely where they should go, fifty newspapers, libraries, & to all the people I know etc. etc.

.......... I think best to leave. I have done what I came to do and it is very expensive in Bucharest. Of course I would not leave until I meet the Queen but I do not think I would see her but once if I did stay longer--I hear she is going away soon, but only for a short stay, a few days.

.......... Hope you will like the book. I wish to send you an inscribed copy signed by the friends. I go to Mlle Miller-Verghy tomorrow to lunch & I shall ask her to sign it first as she is the translator... <span data-pg='225'></span>

.......... Queen Marie here with the books can do much more than I could do. Mr Relgis and lonescu can both do an immense work here & a few others are very attracted. Now they have the literature & they will sow the seeds. I thank you with all my heart that you got out these books for the Balkans, it is the greatest help they could have. Also, the ten thousand booklets I am giving to the Queen & to Mr Relgis & Ionescu to use as they deem best.

.......... Shoghi Effendi, I was alarmed about Princess Ileana in Moedling so near Vienna, but they had a wireless that it is quiet at Moedling but I am not writing her or sending the book until the situation in Austria is better.[12]

	Martha must have received the invitation to visit with Queen Marie after sealing the letter as the front of the envelope bears a note: 'P.S. I am invited to see our friend at 5 P.M. tomorrow Feb. 16.'

	The Queen recorded the visit with Martha in her diary on 16 February 1934:

[.]
[.//]
Friday Feb. 16th 1934
Cotroceni

.......... Received Miss Root, more touching and absurdly excelent [sic] than ever. She has worked herod'cly and though tired and rather ailing her enthusiasm is quite undaunted. Nothing discourages her, no difficulty or sacrifice makes her falter. She is 'bewunderungswiirdig' [admirable].[13]

	Martha Root described the visit in a letter to Shoghi Effendi of 28 February 1934 written from Belgrade after her depar≠ture from Romania upon completion of the mission the Guardian had entrusted to her:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Her Majesty Q. Marie of Romania sends you love & thanks. She was so happy to receive the illuminated Tablet of Baha'u'llah and she is having it framed at once and will have it hung in her room. It was a sweet & happy interview. She said: 'In my heart I am entirely Baha'i.' I think these Teachings mean most to her of anything in religion. She wrote this in a letter to a friend, Loie Fuller in 1926, found it the night before I visited Her Majesty & she says I may use it: <span data-pg='226'></span>

.......... 'Lately a great hope has come to me from one, 'Abdu'l-Baha. I have found in His and in His Father, Baha'u'llah's Message of Faith all my yearning for real religion satisfied. If you ever hear of Baha'is or of the Baha'i Movement which is known in America, you will know what that is, what I mean: these Books have strengthened me beyond belief and I am now ready to die any day full of hope. But I pray God not to take me away yet for I still have a lot of work to do.' She has given me a photo≠graph for the Vol. V. I enclose it to you now. I shall write the interview as soon as I can & mail it to you hoping you may find it available for Vol. V. in addition to the Foreword.[14]
.......... [14. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 28 February 1934, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	That Queen Marie brought out for Martha Root the letter she had written to her friend Loie Fuller in 1926 and gave her approval for its use was indeed a further confirmation to the world of her feelings and attitude, an attitude that had not changed in eight years.

	Martha gave further details of her visit with the Queen to Shoghi Effendi in her letter of 1 March 1934:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Queen Marie said she had read the Dawn Breakers and Baha'i World Vol. IV, she did not say much about them but I know she liked them. She said a Baha'i (girl or lady) threw a note in to her carriage as she passed through the streets in Hamburg. The little note read: 'I am so happy to see you, because you are a Baha'i' and was signed 'a Baha'i'. I asked Her Majesty if she liked this, if she thought it was all right and she replied: 'Yes, they recognized me as a Baha'i and it showed the spirit of unity among Baha'is.'

.......... I am going to write what she said to me and send it to her to see first (I always show her the articles first) and then I shall mail it to you. I hope you will like it. My subject is
Queen Marie of Romania
Her Spiritual Life

.......... ...Also, Roy & Mrs Wood sent me a nice copy of 'Divine Philosophy' and I shall give it to her [Queen Marie Mignon of Yugoslavia] (they gave me two copies and I gave the other to our Queen Marie of Romania)...

.......... Did I tell you I gave my large picture of the Shrine of the Greatest Holy Leaf to the Queen in Bucharest? I felt that I <span data-pg='227'></span> should and I have the little one which is also very lovely. I explained it to her. She always speaks of the Greatest Holy Leaf and on that first visit too, she asked me to tell her all about 'Abdu'l-Baha's sister. It is mystic and significant that you are using the photograph of the Shrine and the Queen's words as the Foreword to Vol. V.[15]

	In a letter dated 10 March 1934 Shoghi Effendi asked his secretary to convey a message to Martha:

[.]
[.//]
.......... In one of his last letters Shoghi Effendi requested you to send him the first part of the Queen's message to you, as you had only sent the page bearing number two. This made him think that there must be a first page to that letter, and which you had probably forgotten to enclose. So, please let him know of that and in case you have no objection he would prefer to have the original text of the Queen's communication ...[16]
.......... [16. Unpublished letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 10 March 1934, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	The Guardian appended the following paragraphs to the letter in his own hand:

[.]
[.//]

.......... I wish to add a few words in person in order to assure you of my very real and profound appreciation of the success that has attended your efforts in Romania. Greece, I trust and pray, will be as responsive...

.......... Will you kindly send me 200 two hundred copies of the splendid Romanian folder translated by Princess Ileana? I will distribute some of them in Palestine and place a few in the Mansion at Bahjf.[17]
.......... [17. Unpublished note appended to ibid.]
[.///]

	The Guardian's pleasure must have made Martha very happy and spurred her on continually. On 19 June 1934 she had a visit with Archduchess Anton, formerly Princess Ileana, in Modling. She described the meeting to Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on the same day:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...This morning I had an audience with Archduchess Anton, Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana at the home of her Lady≠in-Waiting Madame LICHTENSTERN in GRINZINGER 62, Vienna XIX. Princess Ileana has moved from Modling near Vienna and lives at a castle in Sunberg, 40 kilometres from Vienna. (I have <span data-pg='228'></span> left the name of the castle at the house). Will send it to you in letter tomorrow.

.......... She asks me to send you, Shoghi Effendi, her greetings and all
good wishes for the Baha'i work. I asked her if she would give us a statement for the 'Baha'i World' Vol. V. and she gives the following:

.......... 'I like the Baha'i Movement because it reconciles all Faiths and teaches one that science is from God as well as religion, and its ideal is peace.'

.......... Please do not put her personal greeting to you into Vol. V. not because she does not have the courage to say what she wishes and believes, but because the times are very upset at this moment. I know you understand.

.......... She is so sweet, wholesome, kind, just the same Ileana always. I had asked if she would be in Vienna because I did not think I could go to the castle (one has to go by motor car, a great expense), and the Romanian Legation informed me she would come to Vienna & meet me at the home of Her Lady-in-Waiting.

.......... She says: Yes, I am very happy. My husband and I understand each other and our children are very dear to us. I say I hope all married people are as happy as we are.

.......... 'My husband is a devoted Roman Catholic, I am Orthodox. I like the Baha'i Teachings very much.' We spoke of the Cause and she is very glad that the little booklets in Romanian are now published. She was very pleased to have the Baha'i books. I gave her two Romanian Esslemonts, the Goal of a New World Order and a few English What is the Baha'i Movement? and a few of the Romanian What is the Baha'i Movement? I saw she was delighted to have the books. Perhaps you might send her 'The Dawn Breakers' inscribed to her and the new 'Iqan', perhaps better send them through me, you could send them to Stockholm. I think she would appreciate them very much. She loves the Baha'i books & we haven't sent her very much since her marriage.

.......... I gave her the Attar of Rose which you sent me & told her you had sent it from Haifa and her heart was very touched. She held it in her hand (I had tied tiny silver cord around the top, every gift was tied with this silver cord & the books too.) I gave I her a box of chocolates from Athens and a lovely little Athens <span data-pg='229'></span> embroidery bag. Everything looked so pretty and she loved them. She said: 'I thank you a thousand times you are always so sweet and so good to me. I love you.'

.......... So we had a beautiful little heart to heart talk. She only knew Saturday that I was in Vienna, and she came today, Tuesday morning. I have always found her so kind.

.......... I have just telegraphed you the words she gave for Vol. V. and I will write to Horace & mail them tomorrow, June 20, to New York. I will say: Archduchess Anton of Austria, who before her marriage was H.R.H. Princess Ileana of Romania, in an audience with Martha L. Root, June 19, 1934, in Vienna gave the following statement appreciation for Volume V. 'Baha'i World'. She said she thought this would be a good way to introduce her statement.[18]
.......... [18. Unpublished letter of Martha Root to Shoghi Effendi, 19 June 1934, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Shoghi Effendi appreciated immensely the words Archduchess Anton of Austria provided for volume five of {The Baha'i World} and conveyed this to Martha Root in a letter to her of 6 July 1934, written on his behalf:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Your telegram addressed from Vienna, and conveying Princess Ileana's appreciation for the forthcoming issue of 'The Baha'i World' has also been received and deeply appreciated. The Guardian is directing Mr Holley to include it in the manuscript, as the latter has already been forwarded to America for publication.

.......... It is, indeed, very kind of the Princess to pay such a beautiful and warm tribute to the Faith, and for this the Guardian, nay the Baha'i world at large, is deeply grateful. Shoghi Effendi hopes, as soon as he is back in Haifa, to offer through you to the Princess copies of the Iqan and of 'The Dawn-Breakers' which you have suggested would be suitable material for her studies on the Movement ...[19]
.......... [19. Unpublished letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Martha Root, 6 July 1934, International Baha'i Archives.]

	The Guardian's handwritten note was appended to this letter:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I am deeply thankful to you for the text of the appreciation which. you have wired and will myself arrange for its proper insertion in the manuscript of 'The Baha'i World'. What you are achieving is indeed marvellous. Its value can never be over≠estimated.<span data-pg='230'></span> You have, more than any individual or Assembly throughout the Baha'i world, contributed to enrich the material for the forthcoming volume. I heartily congratulate you.[20]
.......... [20. Unpublished note appended to ibid.]

	Always eager to encourage Queen Marie and her daughter to help spread the Baha'i teachings, and having heard of their forthcoming visit to England, Martha wrote to Shoghi Effendi on 20 September 1934:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Also, Shoghi Effendi, I am going to write to Queen Marie & Princess Ileana who are going to London for three weeks and I hope Queen Marie, our Queen, will speak to 'Cousin George' about these Teachings. I believe she would If I asked her. I think she really wishes to do anything she can...

.......... Entre nous, Princess Ileana is awaiting another little life-bud in her home, so these are the days when she will be much at home & have time to read. Her birthday is Jan. 5, so the books will arrive before then and I will write her & tell her about you and your dear gift & that you pray for her.[21]

	In 1930, when Shoghi Effendi had learned that Queen Marie of Romania intended to visit the Holy Land, he requested that the Baha'is in Iran have Baha'u'llah's Tablet to her grandmother, Queen Victoria, beautifully calligraphed and illumined. When the visit did not take place, the Guardian entrusted the gift to Lady Blomfield, who had been in Haifa at the time. When Queen Marie visited London in 1934, Lady Blomfield requested to be received by the Queen, who recorded the meeting in her diary on 3 October:

[.]
[.//]
Wednesday Oct. 3rd 1934 London

.......... Then I received a Lady Bloomsfield [Blomfield] a charming old lady who came to bring me a very interesting parchment, the message Baha'u'llah had sent to Queen Victoria, a beautiful little book painted in vellum with Persian designs. When I accepted receiving her I did not know that she was a Baha'i. She was a perfect old lady.[22]
.......... [22. Queen Marie, personal diary, unpublished diary entry 3 October 1934, Romanian State Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Lady Blomfield referred to her visit with Queen Marie in a letter to Shoghi Effendi of 4 October: <span data-pg='231'></span>

[.]
[.//]
.......... At last I am able to tell you that the precious illuminated Tablet has been given into the hands of the august lady, for whom you had entrusted the packet to my charge. She accepted it with graciousness, and expressed herself as appreciating the beauty of the gift and the honour conferred by its presentation. She asked me to convey that message to you. Wishing to know why it came into my hands to present, I told her that I was in that country a few years ago, when you (and all of us) were hoping to see her--and our disappointment when that hope was not realized.

.......... She also and her daughter were disappointed, as they did wish to meet you and to visit the Shrines. How often personages are hedged round by conditions over which they have no control, and misunderstandings which it is wise not to provoke!

.......... The friends had sent some flowers to greet her on her arrival in London. I was asked to tell them (just those few who had given them) that she was very pleased with their floral gift and to thank them for her.

.......... Imagine how the friends in many places, which she visits, find out and send flowers to her. She is pleased with that graceful attention.

.......... I wish I could depict the charm, the beauty, and the serenity, of this wonderful lady, whose perception of the great significance of the glorious 'wholeness' of the Baha'i Message is so marvellous.[23]
.......... [23. Unpublished letter of Lady Blomfield to Shoghi Effendi, 4 October 1934, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	Deeply grateful for Lady Blomfield's efforts, Shoghi Effendi asked that a letter be written to her on his behalf on 31 October:

[.]
[.//]
.......... The Guardian has just been in receipt of your long-awaited and inspiring message of October 4th, and has taken great pleasure in reading it. He has learned with profound satisfaction and joy of your interview with Queen Marie of Romania, as well as of the floral gift which the London friends have made to her on the occasion of her last visit to that centre. It was, indeed, very thoughtful of them to avail themselves of this wonderful opportunity for conveying to her their unbounded appreciation of the great historic services she has been able to render the Faith through her publications. <span data-pg='232'></span>

.......... Shoghi Effendi was also deeply gratified to learn that you have been able to present to the Queen the illuminated Tablet of Baha'u'llah. You must have surely been guided and inspired in taking such an action, which must have surely deeply impressed the Queen. The Guardian feels, indeed, very happy and grateful to you for having had the faith, courage and confidence to approach that Lady, and to renew to her the sincere, profound interest and appreciation with which the entire community of the believers throughout the world view her noble efforts for the propagation of the Message.

.......... You will certainly be interested to know that the Queen has lately written a beautiful appreciation for special publication in 'The Baha'i World'. It will be reproduced together with her photograph, in the forthcoming issue of the Biennial.

.......... With the renewed assurance of Shoghi Effendi's deep-felt appreciation of your precious labours for the Cause, and of his continued prayers on your behalf.[24]
.......... [24. Unpublished letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Lady Blomfield, 31 October 1934, International Baha'i Archives.]

	The Guardian added a paragraph in his own hand to this letter:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I trust my cable expressing deep-felt appreciation of your outstanding services to our beloved Cause has reached you. I wish to add a few words in person to reaffirm my deep sense of indebtedness to you. I am enclosing a reproduction of the latest tribute paid by the Lady to the Cause and written specially for Volume V of 'The Baha'i World'. The volume will be published before the end of this year. I will gladly send you a copy as a token of my great and abiding attachment to you and gratitude for your manifold kindnesses and services to the Cause of God. Wishing you good health and happiness from all my heart.[25]

	On 9 October 1934 King Alexander of Yugoslavia, Queen Marie's son-in-law, was murdered during an official visit to France. His young son Peter became King, and Prince Paul, whom Martha Root was to meet in 1935, became Regent. Assuming that Queen Marie would want to be near her tragically widowed daughter, Martha wrote on 11 October 1934 to Shoghi Effendi: <span data-pg='233'></span>

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...I know the sad news of the passing of King Alexander of Jugoslavia, but as yet I have no English papers to know all the circumstances. But we know Prince Paul who will be the Regent for little Peter knows of our Teachings. They all know. As the Queen is to have a little child, I believe that Queen Marie of Romania, her mother, will spend much time in Belgrade during the next few months. Perhaps Ileana will go too, for a little while.[26]

I had written her for her birthday, Oct. 29, as I always do, and in it I spoke of Baha'u'llah's Teachings. His words of comfort about life after death. I sent a message of love to each one of them. I told her I know you are praying for her, I feel sure that some day she will visit you.

Belgrade, Jugoslavia,

To
Her Majesty
Dowager Queen Marie of Romania,
Bucharest

Our most beloved Queen:

.......... Allah-u'Abha! Truest, tenderest love to you always! Today I mailed to you the book 'Promise of All Ages,' (perhaps you did receive it from London a few months ago, but as I am not sure, am sending this one), the November 'World Order' our Baha'i magazine which has my audience with the King of Norway, and a little yellow hand-woven scarf-shawl which I bought in Helsingfors, Finland, for your birthday, October 29. It was woven by an artist. I tried to get you a blue one, it was not possible; but 'Abdu'l-Baha says 'yellow is the colour of love'.

.......... Mr Roy C. Wilhelm wished to send you 'Gleanings' the wonderful new book, and probably you have received it from him. Then yesterday I heard from Shoghi Effendi and he tells me he has sent you 'Gleanings'. Very good, for then perhaps you could give Mr Wilhelm's copy to your sister whom you love so much. Shoghi Effendi has just sent me a copy which he asked me please to send to H.R.H. Princess Ileana, as her address is unknown to him. I mailed it to her yesterday c/o the Romanian <span data-pg='236'></span> legation, Vienna; and today mailed her a letter and copy of 'Promise of All Ages' and the November 'World Order'. I wish they would reach her by January fifth, her birthday.

......... I shall write a note and send a copy of Gleanings to your daughter, Her Majesty Dowager Queen Mignon of Jugoslavia.

.......... Beloved Queen, last winter I was very ill, almost passed from this world, had a terrific fall, brain concussion, followed by long influenza, but in the summer in Iceland the June bracing air helped me. Now I am much better, but still need to be very careful. On April 18, I dictated a joint letter to you, to Princess Ileana, to Prince Paul and Princess Olga, but it had some of the names incorrectly spelled and so I never sent them--but now I enclose it to show you that I tried to write to you.

.......... 'The Baha'i World' Vol. V. that has your beautiful appreciation as a lovely frontispiece has not yet reached me; it has been so delayed, but it will not occur like that again. I had a letter from New York on November 20, stating that they thought the book would be off the press and mailed to me by Dec. 14, so each day am hoping it will come.

.......... I wish so much to ask you, dearest Queen Mane our great Queen,--see p. 212, 'Gleanings' only instead of King substitute the word Queen, and you will understand what you are to us-≠if once more you would please give us an appreciation for 'Baha'i World' Vol. VI. Shoghi Effendi does not know that I did not ask you many months ago, and I know he was more delighted with what you wrote than with anything else in the whole book, and it does the most good, for it impresses Iran, India and the entire East that a Queen of the West has given this high tribute to the Baha'i Teachings. It impresses the West too. Shoghi Effendi wrote that the frontispiece is very lovely. It is combined, with the Shrine of the Greatest Holy Leaf and your words, perhaps it is in the Persian illumined work. as before. Perhaps in the book 'Gleanings' you will get a great inspiration--Baha'u'llah will help you, I have faith, so that it Will not be too hard to write an appreciation, tribute (even about the book 'Gleanings') which could be a frontispiece in 'Vol. VI. We should have it soon, if possible, for this book Will be printed much more promptly, in May I think. Please forgive me that I have been such a tortoise, but perhaps you understand how my illness one has to leave so much undone--and perhaps now through this very book 'Gleanings' the thought, the inspiration <span data-pg='237'></span> will come! I pray it will come easily, precious Queen, for I realize how much you have to do each day. If you could mail it to me written on one piece of paper as you did before, then it could be photographed, and would be in your own handwriting. You would be doing it for Baha'u'llah, and He will bless you in all the worlds of God.

.......... You know, dear Queen, after that great tragedy occurred at Sinaia railway station in late Dec., 1933, it came to me in vision that you will never lose your life in such a way, you will be protected by Baha'u'llah because you arose to promote His Teaching.

	<nd>

Jan. 3. Interrupted.

.......... How. much I long to see you precious Queen Marie! I expect to remain here until Jan. 17 (I could remain longer if I thought you would be coming to Belgrade, or could stop here again returning from Sofia.) I think to leave here Jan. 17 and go to Sofia for two or three weeks. I wrote Princess Ileana how much I hoped you would visit her in Austria or your daughter in Belgrade and once more would graciously give me an audience. I could stop in Vienna in March if you would be in Austria--and I shall stop if Princess Ileana Will be able to see me. But if you will not be in either city, Belgrade or Vienna Austria I mean I would try to come to Bucharest from Sofia if you could see me in Bucharest. Life is very short and also the war clouds are looming large, so beloved Queen I wish to do everything I can.

.......... I know you do too, and you will be guided just what is best to be done. If it would be much more convenient for you, I would change .the plan and go from here to Bucharest on Jan. 17. Would it be asking too much, dearest Queen Marie, to ask you if you could please send me a note or a telegram to tell me if in any of these cities, the audience could be arranged, then I would plan my programme with that in view.

.......... I realize. how busy you are, and if only one is possible, the 'appreciation' would be greater for the whole world than the audience and what I might write in 'World Order', but both would be a tremendous impulse to the promotion of Baha'u'llah's peace Teachings. I know you will do what you can. (If I would meet you, I would try to write out some full notes before & have them ready to show you & perhaps they could be incorporated in the audience-interview.) <span data-pg='238'></span>

.......... You are a pioneer Queen clearing away the rocks on the pioneer path where millions yet unborn will walk.

I am

I only hope you did not see the outside of the package. But I liked the idea that everything has to be opened, for it is safer to know what is going through the mails.[1]

It was so awfully kind of you to think of giving me such pleasure. Once more please accept my most heartfelt thanks,
Archduchess Ileana.'[2]

To Their Royal Highnesses Prince Paul and Princess Olga of Jugoslavia.
To Her Royal Highness Princess Ileana (Arch Duchess Anton of Austria.)

My loved Friends,

Allah-u-Abha! (The Glory of God be upon you!)

.......... I am writing you this joint letter because I have been very ill for some time and I could not write. I had a very serious fall in the Grand Hotel In Stockholm and later here in Oslo I had Influenza, and after 4 months I am beginning to get well. I expect. to remain In Northern Europe until autumn. I worked much in Sweden. I shall also go to Finland and Lithuania via Stockholm and return via Stockholm to Oslo, and then go to Iceland and later to Copenhagen. If I am able, I shall return and go through the Balkans in the late autumn and winter.

.......... The article about H.R.H. Prince Paul's Art Museum has just appeared In our magazine, and I am mailing him copies. 'The Baha'i World, volume V' they tell me will be ready in two weeks; I am planning to have it sent to you each one immediately from New York. I hope you will like it, and it has articles about each one of you which you graciously gave me permission to use. They have asked me to see about articles for the next volume which will appear in May 1936. I am so hoping that later you will permit me to write something for that volume also. These books go to every continent and are in many of the universities of the world.

.......... Our magazine 'The Baha'i Magazine' and 'World Unity' of New York City, which has an Important Foundation behind it are uniting in May, and the new magazine will be called: 'World Order'. It will be a very important magazine, larger and better <span data-pg='240'></span> in every way. I am to write for this new magazine, and I hope I can write something about each one of you.

.......... I am in the midst of the Oxford Group Movement here in the North. I think it is a very good idea, but I feel that our Baha'i Movement is much greater, because it collaborates as well with all the religions, and offers new teachings for this universal day. I think you would be very interested in writing [reading] the book 'For sinners only', for it gives a most interesting and inspiring 'romance' of the whole Oxford Group Movement.

.......... I think of you each one and of H.M. Queen Maria of Jugoslavia and His Young Majesty, dear little Peter. I pray for you and I love you and I pray for your dear countries. I only hope I live and can travel again and several times during your countries.

.......... The Baha'i Cause is making great progress every where, and I know that in this century it will establish the permanent universal peace even though the clouds may be dark just now.

.......... I give you the greetings of our dear Guardian Shoghi Effendi, who loves you and prays for you fervently. .

.......... With the deep and abiding love for you, each one, and with thanks for all your help to the Baha'i movement and to Its servant, I am,
faithfully in His Covenant,

	In May 1935 Queen Marie received a letter from a very old friend from her Malta days, Lilian Barron, now Lilian McNeill. 'Little Lilian', as she was affectionately known to the four daughters of Prince Alfred, was the daughter of an English army officer posted to Malta at the same time as the Duke of Edinburgh. The five girls had been playmates, although Lilian was one of the youngest. Lilian's letter revealed that the two women had more in common than just wonderful childhood memories of Malta:

[.]
[.//]
Your Majesty
Marie, Queen of Roumania

.......... Beloved friend from childhood's happy days in Malta. I have been longing to write to you for some time but hesitated to <span data-pg='241'></span> intrude [?] your great grief & sorrow. Also I wanted to be quite sure of a safe .channel by which a letter would reach you so I am entrusting this letter [Illegible] Lady Dering...

.......... Through all these years I have treasured your beloved memory m .my heart and been with you in spirit -in all your great sufferings & your photograph has always been with me.

.......... It was a bitter disappointment that we did not meet here. All your plans for your visit to Palestine were upset. I was actually in Haifa that morning when you passed through like a flash & were gone again into another land!

.......... Now we have another great joy in common, the comfort & blessing of the Bahai teaching and I often go to the Bahji where your letters are framed and read there over and over again. I pray in my heart that you may be strengthened and comforted always.

.......... I am told that you have Esslemont's book. If you will read again the account of the coming of Baha'u'llah to live at the palace called Mazra'ih (about page 41), when they first came out of prison in Acre,--that house is this house in which my husband and I are now living. It was in a deplorable state and we rented it, restored it--from years ago when he retired from the service. You will appreciate what the atmosphere of such a sacred spot can be and how it is my great joy to have made it beautiful With flowers and all loving care. The Guardian of the Cause, Shoghi Effendi, is our great friend & knows that I am writing to you & has asked me to send you warmest greetings. You can avail yourself of me as at any time as a sure link in the strong chain that binds us all together...[5]
.......... [5. Letter of Lilian McNeill to Queen Marie, 14 May 1935.]

	Queen Marie immediately answered Lilian McNeill in a letter dated 2 June 1935, written from Ileana's home in Sonnberg Austria:

[.]
[.//]
Dear 'little Lilian'

.......... It was indeed. nice .to hear from you and to think that you are of all things having in Haifa and are, like I am, a follower of the Bahai teachings!

........... And we had planned, Ileana, my youngest daughter & I to visit the holy graves, Shoghi Effendi was expecting me, then <span data-pg='242'></span> there were political intrigues, (it was after the death of my husband and people were being nasty with me) and I had, under pressure, to give it up and it was a great sorrow to me for more reasons than one. Yes, certainly it interests me that you are living in that special house, the Teachers so loved flowers, and being English, I can imagine what a lovely garden you have made in that Eastern climate.

.......... Malta! yes, it has always remained a dream of happiness, and I was so glad to write about and thus for many, awake all the precious souvenirs and make the dear time live again. Having facility with my pen, I felt the urge to tell my own story as my life has been interesting & varied.

.......... Joy & pain, light & shade--and nearly always the unexpected. I felt I must write as I have a kindly spirit, and am conciliating-- too many like to spread strife, alas.

.......... Certainly the times we live in are not easy to understand for those who were brought up as we were; so much has been over≠thrown, so many conceptions have changed. One sees it in one's own children, but Ileana, my youngest daughter, understands me and my thoughts and principles, marvellously -there does not seem to be a difference of a generation between us...

.......... My eldest daughter Lisabetha ... denies our beliefs... Nevertheless, although our creeds are different, we are good though not intimate friends.

.......... About Carol you know--difficulties, much patience needed, but also many tears, a lot of difficult readjustment, a desire to help--but helping those who think they know best is no easy task--needs tact every hour of the day.

.......... In writing I have found much happiness...

.......... I hope you are happy in your Eastern home?...

.......... I am so pleased you wrote. I hope you receive this safely & if
you do please write again. I shall be leaving in two weeks for home. Cotroceni Bucarest is the safest address, my letters are always sent on.

.......... I shall be 60 this year! I enclose a small picture so that you should be able to visualize my face of today.

With much love
Marie

Please give S. Effendi a warm greeting from me.[6]

	Certain that sight of the publication of their appreciations would be encouraging to the authors, Martha requested copies of the latest volume of {The Baha'i World} from Shoghi Effendi on 22 November 1935:

[.]

.......... It would help me immensely if I had some copies of 'Baha'i World' Vol. V. to show Queen Marie, Prince Paul, and Princess Ileana. I do not like to ask them for any more appreciations until I can show them that we used those they did give us. Also, I wish to give them Gleanings. Perhaps these will be out soon.[7]

.......... Ditto for H. M. Queen Marie of Romania. I am hoping I shall see her & get her to give us a tribute. But if I can get Vol. V. to show them it will be a great help...

.......... I expect to go and spend two weeks (and possibly three) with Jacky [Marion Jack] in Sofia and then come back stopping in Vienna, hoping to see Princess Ileana in Vienna and I hope I can see her mother Q. Marie of Romania either in Vienna or Belgrade without taking the long and expensive trip to Bucharest, but I would go to Bucharest if it seemed very important for our Cause.[8]

1936

On 12 January 1936 Queen Marie wrote again to her childhood friend Lilian:

[.]
[.//]

Dear 'little' Lilian,

.......... It was nice indeed to hear from you and to think that you are of all things living near Haifa and are, as I am, a follower of the Baha'i Teachings. It interests me that you are living in that special house; the Teachers so loved flowers, and being English, I can imagine what a lovely garden you have made in that Eastern climate. I was so intensely interested and studied each photo intently. It must be a lovely place and those southeastern landscapes and gardens attract me with a sort of homesickness ever since our Malta days. And the house you live in, so incredibly attractive and made precious by its associations with the Man we all venerate...
Marie[1]
.......... [1. Letter of Queen Marie to Lilian McNeill, 12 January 1936, International Baha'i Archives.]
[.///]
[.]

	This letter provides perhaps the most explicit statement of Queen Marie concerning her allegiance to the Baha'i teachings. She recognized that the specialness of the house at Mazra'ih was due to its association with Baha'u'llah. As Lilian McNeill suggested, Queen Marie had no doubt read in Esslemont's {Baha'u'llah and the New Era} 'Abdu'l-Baha's description of how His father came to live at Mazra'ih:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Baha'u'llah loved the beauty and verdure of the country. One day He passed the remark: 'I have not gazed on verdure for nine years. The country is the world of the soul, the city is the world of bodies.' When I heard indirectly of this saying I realized that He was longing for the country, and I was sure that whatever I <span data-pg='245'></span> could do towards the carrying out of His wish would be successful. There was in 'Akka at that time a man called Muhammad Pasha Safwat, who was very much opposed to us. He had a palace called Mazra'ih, about four miles north of the city, a lovely place, surrounded by gardens and with a stream of running water. I went and called on this Pasha at his home. I said: 'Pasha, you have left the palace empty, and are living in Akka.' He replied: 'I am an invalid and cannot leave the city. If I go there it is lonely and I am cut off from my friends.' I said: 'While you are not living there and the place is empty, let it to us. He was amazed at the proposal, but soon consented. I got the house at a very low rent, about five pounds per annum, paid him for five years and made a contract. I sent labourers to repair the place and put the garden in order and had a bath built. I also had a carriage prepared for the use of the Blessed Beauty. One day I determined to go and see the place for myself. Notwithstanding the repeated injunctions given in successive firmans that we were on no account to pass the limits of the city walls, I walked out through the city gate. Gendarmes were on guard, but they made no objection, so I proceeded straight to the palace. The next day I again went out, with some friends and officials, unmolested and unopposed, although the guards and sentinels stood on both sides of the City Gates. Another day I arranged a banquet, spread a table under the pine trees of Bahji, and gathered round it the notables and officials of the town. In the evening we all returned to the town together.

.......... One day I went to the Holy Presence of the Blessed Beauty and said: 'The palace at Mazra'ih is ready for you, and a carriage to drive you .there.' (At that time there were no carriages in Akka or HaIfa.) He refused to go, saying: 'I am a prisoner.' Later I requested Him again, but got the same answer. I went so far as to ask Him a third time, but He still said 'No!' and I did not dare to insist further. There was, however in 'Akka a certain Muhammadan Shaykh, a well-known man with considerable influence, who loved Baha'u'llah and was greatly favoured by Him. I called this Shaykh and explained the position to him. I said, 'You are daring. Go tonight to His Holy Presence, fall on your knees before Him, take hold of His hands and do not let go until He promises to leave the city!' He was an Arab... He went directly to Baha'u'llah and sat down close to His knees. He <span data-pg='246'></span> took hold of the hands of the Blessed Beauty and kissed them and asked: 'Why do you not leave the city?' He said: 'I am a prisoner.' The Shaykh replied: 'God forbid! Who has the power to make you a prisoner? You have kept yourself in prison. It was your own will to be imprisoned, and now I beg you to come out and go to the palace. It is beautiful and verdant. The trees are lovely, and the oranges like balls of fire!' As often as the Blessed Beauty said: 'I am a prisoner, it cannot be,' the Shaykh took His hands and kissed them. For a whole hour he kept on pleading. At last Baha'u'llah said, 'Khayli khub (very good)' and the Shaykh's patience and persistence were rewarded: He came to me with great joy to give the glad news of His Holiness's consent. In spite of the strict firman of 'Abdu'l-'Aziz which prohibited my meeting or having any intercourse With the Blessed Perfection, I took the carriage the next day and drove with Him to the palace. No one made any objection. I left Him there and returned myself to the city.[2]

.......... Princess Ileana sends lovely note of thanks & says she will write you. (I shall send you copy of her letter.) She says she will come to Vienna to meet me when I come & we shall talk about Vol. VI. then. It was such a cordial letter. So you see I feel sure we shall have the 3 appreciations

[.///]

	Shortly after this Queen Marie sustained two terrible losses, one of which Martha knew about and the other she learned of during her penultimate meeting with the Queen on 4 February 1936 at Cotroceni. The first loss was that of King George V of England on 20 January 1936, to whom the Queen had very nearly been betrothed. The other was that of her closest sister Victoria Melita [Ducky], who passed away a few weeks later. Hearing of the death of King George, Martha Root wrote to Shoghi Effendi on 23 January from Bulgaria:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I had expected to leave here Jan. 31, to go to Bucharest to see Her Majesty Q. Marie, she sent me a telegram--but now that King George of England has passed, I feel quite sure she has started to England (and perhaps Ileana would go with her.)

.......... I sent the Queen two letters today, one to Bucharest, one to her care of Romanian Legation, London. (and I think I too, shall hear from her.) If she is in Bucharest, I shall go to Bucharest Jan. 31. If she is not there, I shall start from here Jan. 31, and go to Belgrade...

.......... Then returning from Athens, I think I could meet Q. Marie either in Vienna or in Belgrade; or if not, I would go from Belgrade to Bucharest after she returns home.[5]

	Martha wished to be absolutely sure of Queen Marie's whereabouts, as she explained to Shoghi Effendi in her letter of 30 January 1936 written from Sofia:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Today, to avoid any misunderstanding (for several newspapers said Q. [Queen] Marie had gone to London to funeral, I telephoned to her palace in Bucharest & she is in Bucharest & I start to Bucharest early tomorrow morning.)

	From Bucharest Martha wrote to Queen Marie on 2 February 1936 to inform her of her arrival. Never one to hide her intentions, she explained to the Queen what she hoped to do as a result of this meeting:

[.]
[.//]
Room 58,
Hotel Majestic,
Bucharest,
February 2, 1936.

To Her Majesty
Queen Marie of Romania,
Cotroceni Palace.

Most beloved Queen Marie:

.......... Allah-u-Abha! Deep love to you, precious Queen! How much I am looking forward to seeing you, if you find you have time, I have come to Bucharest hoping! I realize you are very busy, <span data-pg='249'></span> dearest Queen Marie and I appreciate it from the depths of my heart that you sent me the telegram that you will be in Bucharest, so I know you will arrange the audience if you can.

.......... Today I have written these notes for an article about Queen Marie of Romania, Her Spiritual Self Attitude. In our magazine 'World Order' we often have a quotation or explanation in italics just above the article; I think this one would be beautiful.

.......... Perhaps after the next audience I could begin my article with that one and then follow with these other incidents; I can tell after our talk, and perhaps you will suggest--I beg you to help me with your wonderfully clear insight and good judgement so that it will be the best article yet, a glory to Baha'u'llah and His great Cause. After I meet you, I will write the article incorporating the audience and these thoughts and send it to you for your approval before I mail to Shoghi Effendi and to New York. I am so eager that it will be a great article worthy of Baha'u'llah and of you. Also, in the centuries ahead it will stand as an historical record of the first Queen who arose to promote Baha'u'llah's Faith.

.......... Also, loved Queen Marie, Shoghi Effendi wishes so much that you will give him another appreciation in your own handwriting that can be used on our page and illumined in gold and colours. When I wrote to him of your telegram and Princess Ileana's letter and that Princess Olga would receive me, immediately he wired me: 'Delighted. Praying success. Shoghi.'

.......... He is young to carry such heavy world tasks as Guardian of the Baha'i Cause; he works so hard and the Greatest Holy Leaf always asked the friends to make him happy. I am sure that nothing in Vol. VI. could give him so much joy as your appreciation. In Iran too, it has tremendous influence that you, a Queen, speaks. I do not believe that anything has given the Persian believers so much courage as your words.

.......... Again, beloved Queen, could I please have one more autographed picture? My editor, Mr Horace Holley, has asked specially. Thank you so much for everything.

With love and prayers, and hoping to see you dear Queen Marie, I am,
Very humbly,
In His Covenant

	On 4 February 1936 Martha recorded briefly for Shoghi Effendi the most important statements the Queen had made to her:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Words of Queen Marie of Romania, in Cotroceni Palace, Bucharest, February 4, 1936, to Martha Root, to tell Shoghi Effendi:

.......... 'I have a friend, Lilian MacNeal [sic] in 'Akka, Palestine, who is interested in the Baha'i Faith and she knows Shoghi Effendi intimately'--she seemed very pleased that her friend knows you well--. She lives at Kasr Mazraa 'Akka.--she rang the bell and had Her Lady-in-Waiting bring the letter to be sure the name of the house was spelled correctly. I told her I think I know the house, for when we went to 'Akka to the Sacred Shrine, in December 1929, we passed a place which belonged to an English lady and I feel sure her name was MacNeal--. 'I have not seen her since she was a little girl, she was a playfellow of my younger sister, her name was Barron, we met in Malta.'-≠she said to me again in the conversation what I have written in my article that Lilian MacNeal was a playfellow of hers.

.......... 'When I was in London Lady Blomfield showed me the original Message[9] sent to Queen Victoria by Baha'u'llah; it was all in gold leaf-≠
.......... [9. This is the illuminated copy of the original Tablet sent by Baha'u'llah to Queen Victoria which Shoghi Effendi had had specially prepared in Iran for Queen Marie. He had intended to present it to her when she visited him in Haifa.]

.......... 'I am so happy you came to see me again and that through you as a channel, I am able to send Shoghi Effendi a loving greeting.'--I think she also said she did send you a greeting through Lilian MacNeal and that you had sent her a greeting. When I wrote her from the hotel as soon as I reached Bucharest, I told her of your telegram: 'Delighted your letter. Praying success. Love. Shoghi.' and explained that in my letter I had told him [S.E.] of her telegram inviting me to Bucharest, and of the letter from P. Ileana saying she would come to Vienna to meet me when I come to Vienna, and of the invitation from P. Olga. I hope dearest Guardian you will send her a letter of greetings and of assurance of your prayers and thanks for this 'Appreciation', you could send it through me, or to her direct, or through L. MacNeal. (I may possibly see her again as I said I could not be in Vienna to see P. Ileana until March, and she said she would be at Ileana's home in the latter part of March.)

.......... 'I am so glad Lilian MacNeal is living at 'Akka amongst them as she had been a playfellow of mine when we were quite young.' <span data-pg='251'></span>

.......... 'Tell Shoghi Effendi too, I think how disturbed he must be to see how the peoples of the world are still so full of unrest. I myself do not believe in war and I hope that he, as I will, will use whatever spiritual influence he has, to continue the work for peace.'

I believe that always this servant will be more kind, more thoughtful to every one whom she even meets because she saw how charming you are. Thanks with all my heart for the dear audience yesterday, I shall remember it always! Always too, beloved Queen Marie, I pray for you.

.......... Shoghi Effendi prays for you each day, and how happy he will be to have your beautiful greeting. He will be so delighted too, about the 'Appreciation' for Vol. VI, and the audience and the article will be good news to him. I shall write to him every word you said, for I know he thirsts to hear from you, for just you are the soul who can understand Shoghi Effendi. I am sure that when you two meet, you will be close friends all your lives. You will admire his spirit, his brain, intellect, his understanding, his courage. Life is so short and not many people can be a companion to your soul--nor to his--you fly too high in the spiritual realms, but he will be. When you meet him, you will be sorry you did not go to Haifa sooner. Some day you two will meet--and Baha'u'llah will do the rest. I do not mean just outer friendships, <span data-pg='252'></span> pleasant as they are, but I mean soul friends, who see life and eternity and act to bring again tranquillity to humanity.

.......... I prayed so much for the one in your household who is so soon to pass to the Heavenly World. I was very touched.

.......... Here are the notes of the audience yesterday, but I shall rewrite them and 'polish them like diamonds' if I can, but I shall not say anything that is not in these notes. If there are any changes in these two sheets, would you please correct & resend them when you send the 'Appreciation' before I leave Saturday. (I should like to wait and go on the evening train Saturday if I can.) Perhaps I shall just mail you a carbon of the retyped story, just to be sure it is exactly right.

.......... Now I shall try to see some few friends here if I am able, & especially see Mr Eugene Relgis and write something about his book.

.......... With dearest love to you and again thanks, most beloved Queen Marie, 'our Queen' (when I left you, I glanced to be sure no one was in the hall, and I left a little kiss on your door).

Yours most humbly
In His Covenant,

Martha L. Root[11]

	The next day Martha joyfully acknowledged receipt of a new appreciation of the Baha'i teachings from Queen Marie:

[.]
[.//]
Thursday Morning

Beloved Queen:

.......... Allah-u-Abha! Love! A thousand thanks for the beautiful appreciation for the 'Baha'i World' Vol. VI. Our Guardian Shoghi Effendi will be so happy when he receives it. He will write you. It is glorious! Once again you have done this great service for Baha'u'llah and He will bless you a hundredfold.

.......... Thanks for your dear note. Of course I shall leave it out, the part about ___; I would not wish to wound ___,' I pray Baha'u'llah to bless and help ___.

.......... I went to see Mr Eugen Relgis yesterday and invited him and his family to come to me tonight. I do not know his book yet, but shall look it over carefully today, shall try to write something <span data-pg='253'></span> about it. He says he has received more than one hundred letters from other countries about this book & many of them asked about the Baha'i F. He will show me some of the letters tonight. Enclosed is his book with Chapter IX. indicated.

.......... I pray for the one in your Palace who is so ill.

.......... Deep and abiding love to you, beloved Queen Marie of our hearts.

In His Covenant,

	Queen Marie had penned the appreciation for volume six of {The Baha'i World} on the back of an autographed photograph of herself looking downward out a window:

[.]
[.//]
.......... More than ever today when the world is facing such a crisis of bewilderment and unrest, must we stand firm in Faith seeking that which binds together instead of tearing asunder.

.......... To those searching for light, the Baha'i Teachings offer a star which will lead them to deeper understanding, to assurance, peace and good will with all men.

	Throughout her life Queen Marie had been witness to so much which had caused her pain and consternation. She had mentioned this very openly in her letter of June 1935 to her friend Lilian McNeill: 'Certainly the times we live in are not easy to understand for those who were brought up as we were; so much has been overthrown, so many conceptions have changed.' Her appreciation of the Baha'i Faith is particularly significant because it strongly conveyed the Queen's recognition of the religion's capacity to help humanity out of the gloomy darkness into which it had fallen.

	On 10 February Martha Root sent news from Belgrade to Shoghi Effendi of her meeting with the Queen:

[.]
[.//]
.......... ...Your dear prayers are answered, for I did have a lovely visit, audience with Queen Marie & she has written appreciation for Vol. VI. and I send it at once to you. I think I better not give it out to anyone so it will be fresh for Vol. VI. when it appears later. <span data-pg='254'></span>

.......... She asked about you and sends you the message which I enclose on separate sheet. She said to me: 'Are you not going to Haifa?' (and in the beginning of the audience she said 'Have you been to Haifa to see Shoghi Effendi?') I said to her: 'No, I do not expect to go to Haifa to see Shoghi Effendi, but to continue working in Europe as long as I can, but if you could ever go to Haifa, and I could serve you in any way, I would go to Haifa with you, and I would pay my own travelling expenses.' I felt it is so important for her to meet you, I feel It would develop into a close friendship -you would like her so very much, you would understand each other -and she could do so much to help you in your stupendous work. I urged her to go, and told her that when you two [meet], Baha'u'llah will do the rest!

.......... But, beloved Guardian, her life is not easy. Between you and me, I heard from others close to her, not from her, that she has been very criticised for speaking, writing, working so strongly for the B. Faith when Romania has a state religion & she replied that B.F. is pure Christianity. Anyway, she is courageous, for she does speak of it & you can see in the article she has given her approval to all that I have written. I admire her that she has done this much.

.......... I do not need to tell you, you know how matters are in that country, and now her son is King.

.......... The Queen said to me: 'Did you see my daughter Mignon in Belgrade?' Her daughter is the Queen of Jugoslavia. I did not see her but I sent her 'Gleanings' & sent little King Peter a box of candy & the latest picture postcard of the Temple! (I have brought as a gift for Q. M. of Jugoslavia a box of candy from Bucharest, just the same kind as I took the Queen M. of Romania. I keep on always being kind and [illegible] to the .Queen of Jugoslavia, she may be closer to our Cause than we think.[)]

.......... I took to the Queen, on Feb. 4, a little rustic basket, moss on top, two lovely white hyacinths growing, they will be fragrant & nice for nearly 3 weeks. Took her a tiny bottle of rose oil perfume from Bulgaria, a small bottle of exquisite other perfume. (She loves the rose) She says it is the best. I told her Baha loved rose. (But the other two, had a spiritual significance, so I took it too, took her another 'Garden of the Heart,' Esty for I know she likes that.) Took four copies the new <span data-pg='255'></span> mimeographed Economics (pale green, just out); took Jan. 'World Order' & also my typed copy of 'The Soul of Iceland' which is more intimate than the article which she & Ileana will appreciate because they were in Iceland in the Summer of 1933; took Mr Eugen Relgis book & explained about it; took typed copy of Prof. Ryka article as he has just come from Iran. I took her a Hair from the Blessed Head of Baha'u'llah and stamped Seal of Baha and a stamped seal of 'Abdu'l-Baha which the members of the Bab's Family had given me in Shiraz in 1930, also gave her a hand-written [illegible] copy of the Prayer for Protection that Roy carried many years and then he sent it to me and I have carried it many years. I explained it will be her protection. The Hair, the Seals, the perfume I placed in a nice blue silk handkerchief the colour she loves most.

.......... A nurse in her household for 44 years is very near to eternity. I prayed for her & her passing. I was there on Tues. & the nurse passed on Thurs. night.

.......... A Queen's life has much sadness & many, many duties to her country.

.......... She was so sweet, so dear. She came to meet me, kissed me & said: 'You have been so ill, are you better now, my dear?' We had such a good talk. I love her, and I believe she loves and trusts me & she studies the Teachings and they mean the most of anything in her life. She spoke of 'Gleanings', she likes it so much and I told her I believe I like it the best of all the books, it says the most to my soul. I mean, dear Guardian, she loves me because I brought her the Teachings -and she always says she admires that I keep on so faithfully promoting them.

.......... It has taken ten years to build this great friendship. Europe is not changed in a day. I shall always be so glad I went to Bucharest this time, and I hope to see her again in March. I feel Baha and you too, beloved friend, wish me to do all I can to serve her.

.......... There was sent to my hotel a ticket for the first class from Bucharest to Belgrade so I had a most comfortable journey. They have done that for me each time. It helped me a lot for my health & also financially because it was so very expensive in Bucharest.

.......... In Bucharest I had such a fearful headache for 3 days, but Baha helped me & I did get everything done & now my head is all right again. I took cold in the journey from Sofia to Bucharest. <span data-pg='256'></span>
Questions

.......... p. 1 --I feel sure it was Jan. 30, 1926, that the Audience took place. If you look in the bound volumes of 'The Baha'i' Magazine' 1926, you can see for sure if it was the thirtieth.

..........p. 1 --My notes are in my valise in Prague. I think it was Czar Alexander II to whom Baha'u'llah sent the Tablet. Could you please cut out the words--both of whom rec'd Tablets from Baha'u'llah--if it was not Alexander II. Anyway Czar Alexander II was Q. Marie's grandfather.

.......... p. 2. I can't remember which month (line 3.) that article appeared

.......... p. 4. not a question, but a comment. She said to me: 'Did not Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha love hyacinths? They spoke of them in their Writings.' She loves hyacinths, I knew that and I took her hyacinths the last time.

.......... p. 5. That appreciation in the centre of the page she wrote on Jan. 1, 1934 and mailed it to me before she came to Bucharest, but I have said here that she gave it to me--it sounds as though she gave it to me during the audience. She sent it earlier because we had to have it as soon as possible. I did not give it out to 'Baha'i' Magazine' or 'World Order' until now because I thought you wished it to appear first in the 'B. World' Vol. V.

.......... p. 6. I think it would be more correct to say 'the way the different peoples seem to misunderstand one another'.

.......... Shoghi Effendi, Her Majesty saw this article, read it over very carefully & approves it.[14]

	It is obvious from the notes of this meeting that Queen Marie admired in Martha Root precisely the same quality she herself possessed: perseverance. Her affection for the Baha'i woman and her thoughtfulness are apparent from the travel arrangements she made on several occasions for Martha: first class travel was something Martha could never have aspired to on her limited budget but which she appreciated greatly.

	The article Martha Root wrote was, as she mentioned to Shoghi Effendi, approved by Queen Marie. The Queen's approval, with only one change--the omission of a name of <span data-pg='257'></span> a person she did not want to hurt--implies that the Queen believed Martha's account to be completely accurate. Written not long before the Queen's death, the article was eventually used as a tribute to her in volume eight of the publication for which the Queen had provided several appreciations of the Baha'i Faith, {The Baha'i World}:

QUEEN MARIE OF RUMANIA
By Martha L. Root

.......... 'How great the blessedness that awaits the king who will arise to aid My Cause in My Kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Me! Such a king is numbered with the companions of the Crimson Ark--the Ark which God has prepared for the people of Baha. All must glorify his name, must reverence his station, and aid .him to unlock the cities with the keys of My Name, the omnipotent Protector of all that inhabit the visible and invisible kingdoms. Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous ornament on the brow of creation, the fountain≠head of blessings unto the whole world. Offer up, O people of Baha, your substance, nay, your very lives, for his assistance.'[15]
.......... [15. Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, p. 212.]

.......... The first Queen of the world to study and to promote Baha'u'llah's great Teachings has been Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania, one of the queens of this twentieth century who stands highest in intellect, in vision, in clear understanding of the new universal epoch now opening. Her Majesty received the book {Baha'u'llah and the New Era} by Dr J. E. Esslemont and a note from the writer of this article who first visited Bucharest, Rumania, in January, 1926. The Rumanian Queen, grand-daughter of the renowned Queen Victoria of the British Empire and of Czar Alexander II of Russia, both of whom received Tablets from Baha'u'llah in their day, read this volume until three o'clock in the morning and two days later, on January 30, 1926, received me in audience in Cotroceni Palace in Bucharest. Her first words after the greeting were, 'I believe these Teachings are the solution for the world's problems today!' The account of that historic morning appeared in The Baha'i Magazine in Washington, in June, 1926, but very illuminating letters written by Her Majesty that same year show how deep was her confirmation. Here is one written to her loved <span data-pg='258'></span> friend Loie Fuller, an American then residing in Paris, which after these ten years can be published for the first time:

.......... 'Lately great hope has come to me from one, 'Abdu'l-Baha, a personal follower of Christ. Reading, I have found in His and His Father Baha'u'llah's Message of Faith all my yearnings for real religion satisfied. If you ever hear of Baha'is or of the Baha'i Movement which is known in America you will know what this is! What I mean, these books have strengthened me beyond belief and I am now ready to die any day full of hope; but I pray God not to take me away yet, for I still have a lot of work to do.'

.......... Other letters record that first of all she was teaching her young daughter Ileana about these beautiful truths. For ten years Her Majesty and her daughter, H.R.H. Princess Ileana (now Archduchess Anton), have read with interest each new book about the Baha'i Movement as soon as it came from the press.

.......... As we know she wrote three marvellous articles about these Baha'i peace Teachings in 1926, and as they were syndicated each article appeared in nearly two hundred newspapers in the United States and Canada. Many millions of people were thrilled to read that a Queen had arisen to promote Baha'u'llah's plan for universal peace. Quickly these articles were translated and published in Europe, China, Japan, Australasia and in the Islands of the seas.

.......... Received in audience by Her Majesty in Pelisor Palace, Sinaia, in 1927, after the passing of His Majesty King Ferdinand, her husband, she graciously gave me an interview, speaking of the Baha'i Teachings about immortality. She had on her table and on the divan a number of Baha'i books, for she had just been reading in each of them the Teachings about Life after death. She asked the writer to give her greeting to Shoghi Effendi, to the friends in Iran and to the many American Baha'is who she said had been so remarkably kind to her during her trip through the United States the year before. Also, she graciously gave the writer an appreciation of these Baha'i Teachings in her own hand-writing, for Volume IV, of the BAHA'i WORLD.

.......... Meeting the Queen again on January 19, 1928, in the Royal Palace in Belgrade, where she and H.R.H. Princess Ileana were guests of the Queen of Jugoslavia--and they had brought some <span data-pg='259'></span> of their Baha'i books with them--the words I shall remember longest of all that Her dear Majesty said were these: 'The ultimate dream which we shall realize is that the Baha'i channel of thought has such strength, it will serve little by little to become a light to all those searching for the real expression of Truth.'

.......... Another happy audience was in Her Majesty's lovely summer palace 'Tehna-Juva', at Balcie, on the Black Sea, in October, 1929. Again in the home of Archduchess Anton at Modling near Vienna she and mother received me on August 8, 1932, and in February, 1933, and Her Majesty made this great state≠ment which was used as the frontispiece to BAHA'I WORLD, Volume IV.: 'The Baha'i Teaching brings peace and understanding. It is like a wide embrace gathering together all those who have long searched for words of hope. It accepts all great prophets gone before, it destroys no other creeds and leaves the doors open. Saddened by the continual strife amongst believers of many confessions and wearied of their intolerance towards each other, I discovered in the Baha'i Teaching the real spirit of Christ so often denied and misunderstood. Unity instead of strife, Hope instead of condemnation, Love instead of hate, and a great reassurance for all men.'

.......... Then in the audience in Cotroceni Palace on February 16, 1934, when Her Majesty was told that the Rumanian translation of Baha'u'llah and the New Era had just been published in Bucharest, she said she was so happy that her people were to have the blessing of reading this precious Teaching.

.......... How beautiful she looked that afternoon--as always--for her loving eyes mirror her mighty spirit; a most unusual Queen is she, a consummate artist, a lover of beauty and wherever she is there is glory. Perhaps too, a Queen is a symbol, people like to have their Queen beautiful and certainly Queen Marie of Rumania is one of the most lovely in this world today. Her clothes, designed by herself, are always a 'tout ensemble' creation so harmonious in colours they seem to dress her soul. She received me in her private library where a cheerful fire glowed in the quaint, built-in fireplace; tea was served on a low table, the gold service set being wrought in flowers. There were flowers everywhere, and when she invited me into her bedroom where she went to get the photograph which I like so much, as <span data-pg='260'></span> I saw the noble, majestic proportions of this great chamber with its arched ceiling in Gothic design, I exclaimed in joy, 'Your room is truly a temple, a Mashriqu'l-Adhkar!' There were low mounds of hyacinths, flowers which Baha'u'llah loved and mentioned often in His Writings; there was a bowl of yellow tulips upon a silken tapestry in yellow gold, a tall deep urn of fragrant white lilacs, and an immense bowl of red roses. Cotroceni Palace is the most beautiful palace I have seen in any country in the blending of its colours and in its artistic arrangements.

.......... Her Majesty is a writer as well as an artist, and Her Memoirs entitled 'The Story of My Life' were just then being published in The Saturday Evening Post. She told me she writes two hours every morning unless her time is invaded by queenly duties, charity duties, family duties. She was pleased with the sincere letters that were pouring in from all continents giving appreciations of her story. She told me the American people are so open-hearted and that from the United States children, professors, farmers' wives and the smart people had written to her, the tone in all their letters revealing Her Majesty's entire sincerity and the deep humanity of her character. One teacher wrote Her Majesty that in her childhood each one lived through his own childhood: another said, 'All who read your story have their own lives stirred!' The Queen remarked, 'And this is a very sat≠isfactory criticism for an author.'

.......... A most pleasing letter had just arrived from Japan from a girl there who thanked God Who had allowed her to live in a period in which such a wonderful book had been written! 'This,' said the Queen, 'is one of the nicest appreciations I have ever heard.'

.......... Then the conversation turned again to the Baha'i Teachings and she gave a greeting to be sent to Shoghi Effendi in Haifa. Later she mentioned an incident in Hamburg when she was en route to Iceland in the summer of 1933. As she passed through the street, a charming girl tossed a little note to her into the motor car. It was: 'I am so happy to see you in Hamburg, because you are a Baha'i.' Her Majesty remarked that they recognized a Baha'i and this shows a spirit of unity in the Baha'i Movement.

.......... Her Majesty said to me, 'In my heart I am entirely Baha'i,' and she sent me this wonderful appreciation: 'The Baha'i Teaching brings peace to the soul and hope to the heart. To <span data-pg='261'></span> those in search of assurance the Words of the Father are as a fountain in the desert after long wandering.'

.......... And now today, February 4, 1936, I have just had another audience with Her Majesty in Cotroceni Palace, in Bucharest. As I was starting, to walk up the wide ivory toned stairs carpeted with blue Iranian rugs to the third floor suites, at that very moment over the radio came the rich strains of the Wedding March from 'Lohengrin', played by an orchestra. It seemed a symbol: the union of spiritual forces of the East and Europe! Again Queen Marie of Rumania received me cordially in her softly lighted library, for the hour was six o'clock. She was gowned in black velvet and wore her great strands of marvellous pearls. The fire in the grate beamed a welcome with its yellow-glowing fragrant pine boughs and large bowls of yellow tulips adorned the apartment.

.......... What a memorable visit it was! She told me she has a friend in 'Akka, Palestine, who knows Shoghi Effendi and this friend recently has sent her pictures of 'Akka and Haifa; the two were playfellows when they were children and met in Malta. She also told me that when she was in London she had met a Baha'i, Lady Blomfield, who had shown her the original Message that Baha'u'llah had sent to her Grandmother Queen Victoria in London. She asked the writer about the progress of the Baha'i Movement especially in the Balkan countries.

.......... 'Since we met two years ago,' said Her Majesty, 'so many sad events have happened! I look on with a great deal of sorrow at the way the different peoples seem to misunderstand one another; especially now that I have become very lonely in my home, I have all the more time to think over these problems, and I'm sometimes very sad that I can do so little. However, I know that the right spirit and the right thoughts go a long way towards that unity of hearts which I haven't given up the hope to see before I pass on.'

.......... She spoke, too, of several Baha'i books, the depths of {Iqan} and especially of {Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah} which she said was a wonderful book! To quote her own words: 'Even doubters would find a powerful strength in it, if they would read it alone and would give their souls time to expand.'

.......... Her Majesty promised to write for BAHA'i WORLD, Volume VI, a special appreciation and to send it after four days. <span data-pg='262'></span>

.......... I asked her if I could perhaps speak of the brooch which historically is precious to Baha'is, and she replied, 'Yes, you may.' Once, and it was in 1928, Her dear Majesty had given the writer a gift, a lovely and rare brooch which had been a gift to the Queen from Her Royal Relatives in Russia some years ago. It was two little wings of wrought gold and silver, set with tiny diamond chips and joined together with one large pearl. 'Always you are giving gifts to others, and I am going to give you a gift from me,' said the Queen smiling, and she herself clasped it onto my dress. The wings and the pearl made it seem 'Lightbearing', Baha'i! It was sent the same week to Chicago as a gift to the Baha'i Temple, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, and at the National Baha'i Convention which was in session that spring, a demur was made--should a gift from the Queen be sold? Should it not be kept as a souvenir of the first Queen who arose to promote the Faith of Baha'u'llah?--However, it was sold immediately and the money given to the Temple, for all Baha'is were giving to the utmost to forward this mighty structure, the first of its kind in the United States. Mr Willard Hatch, a Baha'i of Los Angeles, California, who bought the exquisite brooch, took it to Haifa, Palestine, in 1931 and placed it in the archives on Mt. Carmel where down the ages it will rest with the Baha'i treasures.

.......... Inadequate as is anyone article to portray Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania's splendid spiritual attitude, still these few glimpses do show that she stands strong for the highest Truth, and as an historical record they will present a little of what the first Queen did for the Faith of Baha'u'llah.[16]

[.]

.......... ...When Marie of Romania comes to visit her [Princess Olga] early in March, she will be pleased to show her that she (Olga) also has a 'Gleanings' from Shoghi Effendi. Q. Marie will be pleased too, for it was the Queen Marie and Ileana who first told Princess Olga and Prince Paul about the Teachings in 1928, in January-≠and sent me a note that Prince Paul and Princess Olga would receive me to hear about the B. Teachings...

.......... ...Under separate cover I mail you this dear picture of Princess Olga. If you do not use it in Year Book will you please mail it at <span data-pg='263'></span> once to Horace [Holley], and send me a line that you mailed it to him? I will enclose two typed sets of the few words in her interview. If it could be used with her picture in 'World Order' soon, and if Queen Marie's story could be used in 'World Order' soon, it would help me very much in getting audiences with other Royalty here in Europe, and those articles could be a feature of 'World Order' during the next few months...

.......... I will mail Horace a carbon of the Queen Marie story (but not the new frontispiece) & a different picture of Queen Marie[17]

	In appreciation of the words penned for the latest volume of The Baha'i World, Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Faith she loved and served, wrote for the last time to Queen Marie on 18 February 1936.

Your Majesty,

.......... Miss Root has transmitted to me the original copy of the appreciation penned by Your Majesty for the forthcoming issue of 'The Baha'i World'. I am deeply touched, and feel truly grateful for this further evidence of Your Majesty's sustained interest in and admiration for the Baha'i Teachings.

.......... Baha'i Communities the world over will ever recall, with feelings of pride and gratitude, these beautiful, impressive and historic testimonies from the pen of Your Majesty-≠testimonies that will no doubt greatly inspire and hearten them in their continued labours for the spread of the Cause of Baha'u'llah.

.......... I am so pleased and encouraged to learn that Your Majesty has derived much benefit from the reading of the 'Gleanings', and I feel that my efforts in translating these extracts have been fully rewarded.

.......... I am presenting to Your Majesty through the kindness of Mrs McNeill the latest photograph recently received from America <span data-pg='264'></span> showing the progress in the construction of the Baha'i House of Worship in Wilmette.

.......... May the Spirit of Baha'u'llah ever bless and sustain Your Majesty in the noble support you are extending to His Cause.

He wishes me specially to express his profound gratification at the success of your last audience with Queen Marie of Romania, and for having obtained such a remarkable appreciation from her for the next issue of 'The Baha'i World'.

Marie will be there, and to Prague to see Dr Benes and get the articles also in Central Europe before the middle of April, so that they can be used for Vol. VI... <span data-pg='265'></span>

.......... P.S. Dear Guardian, it may just be possible that Queen Marie of Jugoslavia [Romania] will be in Belgrade during the first two weeks in March. If so, perhaps she would arrange for me to meet the Queen of Jugoslavia. So you see why I keep my schedule just as it is. She, the Q. Marie of Romania told me she expects to be with Ileana in Austria the latter part of March.[21]

	A visit to Vienna brought hope of a meeting with Archduchess Anton, as Martha told Shoghi Effendi in a letter of 15 March 1936:

	To her great and unexpected delight Martha had a brief visit with Queen Marie in Vienna. This she described to Shoghi Effendi in a letter dated 3 April 1936. It was to be their ninth and last meeting:

[.]
[.//]
.......... When I talked with Queen Marie and Princess Ileana in Vienna on March 20, they felt that Ileana could not say anything this year because of the political situation, her husband would rather she did not. I can understand how they feel about it. I know her husband is very kind, but he is a Catholic, but it isn't the religious part, but because the country is so upset. I couldn't speak as much as I wished to Princess Ileana, I was to meet her in the Ambassadors Hotel in Vienna at 3.15 P.M. She was three≠fourths hour & more late--they came in from her castle, forty miles distant by motor car, and other people were waiting to meet them and they were to go some place else. When they came, the Queen came too; I did not know she was in Austria, and I did not know that her sister had just passed on. I was so shocked by the news and we spoke about the sister and the 'Gleanings' and the words about Life after death, and then they told me they thought perhaps it was better at this moment for Ileana not to say anything. (I was very disappointed.) I took the Vol. V and was going to give it to Ileana to give to her mother when the mother came to Austria, but I had the bounty to give it to the Queen herself. When she opened it, she looked long at <span data-pg='266'></span> the picture of the Greatest Holy Leaf and of the Shrine and said: 'How beautiful!!!' When she saw her own picture and the foreword and the design with the Persian words, she was very pleased with it and said 'beautiful!!' They were very lovely to me and they saw me first, but there was not much time and I didn't have as much conversation with P. Ileana as I had hoped, but she is very kind and sweet--and she arranged to come in and meet me as soon as she knew I had come to Vienna. After all, dear Shoghi perhaps it is not words that count, they must have seen how sorry I was for them, for it just struck my solar plexus to hear of her, the Queen's sister 'Ducky' passing.

.......... This was how it was: I came promptly to the hotel and was waiting in a little room just off the lobby: [a little drawing of the room and lobby appears in the letter at this point] after three-fourths of an hour suddenly I saw everybody bowing and great excitement and our Queen passed through the lobby with Madame Lahovary her Lady-in-Waiting. I saw the Queen, but I did not speak (it would not have been proper), but she saw me and turned and came into the little room and greeted me; then she said: 'We have had such sorrow!' I did not know and I asked and she said: 'Did you not read that my sister has passed?' I said 'No, was it Ducky, the sister you love so much?' and she 'Yes'. I took her hand and she told me a little of the illness and I kept telling her Words of Baha'u'llah and that we shall see and speak and be with our loved ones; Baha said the Words, His Words from the 'Gleanings'. Then she said good bye, said that Ileana would soon come and she left me and went into the lobby and upstairs. Then I thought I should not see her again, so I wrote her a little letter and finishing it, my name was paged and the Queen's man invited me to come up to her suite. (She does not live there, she had just come in for an hour.) When I went up to the suite I met Ileana, but a moment later the Queen and the Lady in Waiting came and we spoke a little. I had brought four lovely pin roses for Ileana and two little silk handkerchiefs, one for Ileana and one for her to give to her mother, and had brought the Vol. V (You see I thought the mother was coming soon to Austria but did not know she was in Austria then.) The way I missed knowing about the sister's passing, it happened when I was just starting from Athens (March 2, but the papers come five days later) and en <span data-pg='267'></span> route I could not buy the English papers, I ALWAYS read the papers every day of my life, unless it happens that I cannot procure them.

.......... The Queen was very sweet and I believe she understood how sorry I was. But we did not have a long quiet talk as we did in the audiences, we could not, because they were late and many matters were crowding but they did see me first. (To show you how careful a Queen is, she went upstairs and dressed in afternoon dress before she received me, Ileana did too, they did not receive me in their travelling dress, motoring dress.)

.......... When I left them, I came back to my room, prayed, then went out and sent you the telegram asking you please to pray, when I came back Baha'is were waiting for me and I went at once to the Baha'i Hall where I was to give a lecture. Monday I wrote the Queen and sent her a blue embroidered cover for her book 'Gleanings'--Miss Daisy Vedova of Athens has given it to me for my 'Gleanings' and because it was so lovely I gave it to our Queen but I did not tell her from whence it came. I telephoned Tuesday evening to say good by, but I just missed them because they had gone to another city, they came in to Vienna that night. When your dear telegram reached me, it was forwarded to Prague, giving your sympathy, I sent it to her with a little note. If you would care to send Princess Ileana Vol. V. her address is:

Archduchess Anton
Schloss Sonnberg
Hollabrunn N.O.
Austria

.......... I told her if you did not send it to her, I would send her one, but I thought perhaps you would send it from Haifa, just as you had sent her the 'Gleanings' and told her I knew she would like it lots more if it came from our Guardian. So I am waiting to see if you send it. If I hear from them I shall write you, they may send me a letter. Perhaps you sent a Vol. V to the Queen, but if you did she can send mine to her daughter the Queen of Jugoslavia.[23]

	Shoghi Effendi always kept Martha Root informed of his actions regarding Queen Marie and never kept the Queen and her daughter wanting for the latest Baha'i publications. Shoghi Effendi's secretary wrote to Martha on the Guardian's behalf on 11 April 1936:

[.]

.......... The Guardian also wishes me to inform you that he has presented Queen Marie with a copy of volume five of 'The Baha'i World' which he has specially inscribed. The book was sent her through the courtesy of Mrs McNeill.

1937

	In March 1937 Queen Marie fell ill and her doctors were unable to diagnose the cause of her internal haemorrhaging. The illness took its toll on her and she was kept 'immobile on a starvation diet of cold liquids'.[1] Martha Root was travelling for much of the year in the Far East and India and had no communication with the Queen. Not knowing of the Queen's illness and despite the great distance that separated the two women, Martha sought to enlist the Queen's help once again, as she wrote to Shoghi Effendi on 13 July 1937 from Shanghai:
.......... [1. Pakula, {Last Romantic}, p. 409.]

[.]

.......... I think I shall write to Queen Marie very soon and ask her if she will please write another good appreciation for our Faith. If the material for this next 'Baha'i World' must be sent to U.S.A. (Mrs French) by Oct. or Nov. I hope I can send Mss. to you later--send it right to the very last moment as I did other years.

.......... When the new 'Baha'i World' is out--and perhaps it is now-≠I hope you will send Queen Marie a copy. I have not seen it yet[2]

1938

	No doubt Martha Root learned of Queen Marie's illness from the newspapers in India but as the seriousness of the Queen's condition was understated, she decided to try once more to obtain from Queen Marie an appreciation of the Baha'i Faith. On 7 March 1938 Martha wrote a letter addressed to the Guardian and his new wife, Ruhiyyih Khanum:

[.]
[.//]
.......... I am mailing to Queen Marie of Romania (sending it via Belgrade Palace asking please to forward. Q. M. is now in Italy where she has gone for her health.) today a letter asking her if she feels able, could she please mail to you direct by air mail to Haifa, a message which could be used as a frontispiece. I feel she will if she is able. I had written to her Nov. 30 but as she was very ill I did not send it--but yesterday I enclosed the Nov. 30 letter with this last one. In it I had told her of the special meetings of prayers held in India for her. I worded it with love. I'm ashamed I did not see about this sooner, but she was ill and I was ill & it just didn't get done.

I mailed the letter

.......... I sent your love and the letter was straight from my heart. I told Queen Marie that I am mailing a note to you same time that I mail her letter telling you I have asked her if she could please send it to you direct to reach you by April 15.[1]

The Passing of the Queen

	The Queen's illness was very serious and, owing to the attitude of her son, King Carol II, she did not perhaps receive as quickly as she might have done the treatment she required. On 18 July 1938 the Romanian Queen died in Sinaia at the age of 63.

	One of the last and perhaps most significant entries In Queen Marie's diary was written just before her passing:

	Martha Root learned of Queen Marie's death while still in India and she wrote of it to Shoghi Effendi and Ruhiyyih Khanum from Karachi on 4 August 1938:

[.]

.......... When I read in the paper about the passing of Queen Marie, that very hour I sent a cablegram to Princess Ileana Cotroceni Palace:

.......... 'Tenderest love, prayers from all Baha'is. Martha Root.'

Princess Ileana,

Romania

.......... I thought she would not receive it & I couldn't afford to cable again--but she has rec'd. I enclose her answer 'Thank you with all my heart. Ileana.'
.......... I pray for Queen Marie & know that you do. Allah'u'Abha![2]

	Shoghi Effendi, in a letter to Martha written on his behalf on 7 August, explained his actions on learning of the passing of the revered Queen:

[.]
[.//]
.......... Regarding the late Queen Marie of Romania, her sudden and quite unexpected passing was a real shock to the friends, who cannot but profoundly mourn her loss. Memorial meetings were held in her honour in many centres, and the occasion was seized by the believers to give fresh publicity to the Cause through the press.

.......... The Guardian himself, immediately upon hearing of the Queen's death, wired in the name of all the Baha'is a message of condolence to her daughter, the Dowager Queen Marie of Yugoslavia, and in reply received from her a telegram expressing her 'sincere thanks to the followers of Baha'u'llah'.[3]

[.]

	The Queen's body was laid to rest in the church at Curtea de Arges, next to that of her husband and in proximity to the earthly remains of King Carol I and Queen Elisabeth. Queen Marie had not liked this church but once again ritual prevailed and her wish to be buried elsewhere, in a place with which she felt more affinity, was to be ignored. She left instructions, however, to have her heart removed from her body and buried in a small jewelled casket at the little church at Balcic. When the Bulgarians took back the area, the small casket was removed and buried on the grounds of Bran castle. For reasons unknown, it was moved again in recent years and is now being kept in the Museum of Natural History.

Treasured Memories
By Lilian McNeill

.......... In an article written by Martha L. Root in World Order, June, 1936, giving an account of various visits to her (late) Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania, I found the following passage: 'What a memorable visit it was! She told me she has a friend in 'Akka, Palestine, who knows Shoghi Effendi, and this friend has recently sent her Baha'i pictures of 'Akka and Haifa. The two were playfellows when they were children and met in Malta.'

.......... I have the great happiness of being that friend and I would like Baha'is all over the world to share with me some treasured memories.

.......... In the winter of 1888-89, five happy little girls played together in the lovely, sunlit orange gardens of the palace of San Antonio, Malta. They were the four daughters of H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh, second son of Queen Victoria, afterwards∑ Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who was at that time the Commander in Chief of the British fleet in the Mediterranean; and myself, daughter of Major Harry Barron, Royal Artillery, in later years Major General Sir Harry Barron, Governor of Malta for a short period, and then successively Governor of Tasmania and of Western Australia.

.......... Our ages ranged from thirteen years to five. I was youngest but one, and being rather delicate, on account of a fall from a pony, could not indulge in the wildest of the games and was taken great care of by the elder sisters, and always called 'little' Lilian, a name used ever afterwards by Queen Marie.

.......... When in due course we all left Malta, our games were renewed in the gardens of Buckingham Palace and at Clarendon House, their home in London. But we all always treasured those Malta days in our memories as a dream of happiness unforgettable. Those times are fully described in Queen Marie's book, {Story of My Life}. We all married very young and our ways lay apart for many years, though we kept in touch.

.......... Queen Marie and I were reunited in close affection through the Baha'i teachings, with which we both became acquainted about the same time, she in Rumania, I in Palestine.

.......... Nearly ten years ago, making a voyage of discovery in this neighbourhood, across country where then only the roughest <span data-pg='275'></span> [e-note: photographs between pages 274 and 275] of tracks existed, I came upon an old house, neglected, some parts almost ruinous. Two gigantic cypress trees, said to be hundreds of years old, stand sentinel beside it. An inside courtyard was surrounded by a thick, high wall. Outside was a little paved terrace through which flows the aqueduct which supplies the orange gardens and the town of 'Akka, and steps leading down to further terraces of gardens. There was a Bedouin family living in a tent in the garden, and the olive pickers from a village near Carmel had been allowed to live in the lower floor of the house three winters running during the olive harvest, so the state of the place can be imagined!

.......... Nevertheless I saw the possibilities and the poor old house with its vaulted lower rooms had an intense and almost weird fascination for me.

.......... This is how I found the house which in Dr Esslemont's book, {Baha'u'llah and the New Era} is described as the 'palace of Mazra'ih'. There Baha'u'llah and the whole family lived for about two years after leaving the town of 'Akka before the Mansion of Bahji became their residence. (In a somewhat similar manner and at much the same time, Queen Marie discovered her castle in Transylvania that she called 'Brana the Beloved'.)

.......... It was in May, 1931, when my husband retired from Government service that we took a lease of this house and it was our great privilege to be able to restore it, and make a garden--a proper setting for a dwelling with such sacred associations. Although we found it a good deal altered on the second floor from its condition at the time when Baha'u'llah lived there, the main features are unchanged, the vaulted rooms on the ground floor particularly.

.......... There is a rough cement floor in the room downstairs which was Baha'u'llah's own special room. This I left as I found it, in the belief that His feet may have trodden it.

.......... Queen Marie was greatly interested in all we had done to the house, and we always hoped it would be possible for her to come here. This is our 'jubilee' year, fifty years this autumn (1938) since we first met, and we had hoped somehow for a reunion. But her serious illness and the unsettled state of this country (Palestine) made it impossible to plan, and now...

.......... No one who ever had the privilege of personal or intimate acquaintance with Queen Marie could fail to be impressed by <span data-pg='276'></span> the greatness of her mind and spirit. Her own life story reveals so well her ardent and joyous nature, the depth of feeling that accompanied every thought and action. Professor Seton-Watson in his History of the Roumanians has paid eloquent tribute to her heroism, devotion and courage in the Great War. Nobody is perfect and there are always critics, but I generally notice that the latter are almost invariably people who had never come into personal contact with her or perhaps never even seen her at a distance. What she did for Rumania is now history and can be best glimpsed in the touching last message to her people. The world is the poorer for the passing of such a noble lady, and a blank, impossible to fill, is left in the lives of those who knew her personally. She had passed through and suffered so much, even her wonderful health was too sorely tried and we must be thankful in spite of the great loss to us all that she is at rest and spared any further suffering. Her spirit is surely near us still and we must try to follow her noble example of great endurance and courage to face whatever may await us in these troublous times.

.......... The following extracts are taken from various letters to myself in recent years, and through these her own words we surely can feel that Queen Marie speaks to every one of us.

.......... 'Dear "little" Lilian, it was indeed nice to hear from you and to think that you are of all things living near Haifa and are, like me, a follower of the Baha'i teachings. It interests me that you are living in that special house; the Teachers so loved flowers, and being English, I can imagine what a lovely garden you have made in that Eastern climate. I was so intensely interested and studied each photo intently. It must be a lovely place and those south-eastern landscapes and gardens attract me with a sort of homesickness ever since our Malta days. And the house you live in, so incredibly attractive and made precious by its associations with the Man we all venerate. Certainly the times we live in are not easy to understand for those who were brought up as we were. So much has been overthrown, so many conceptions been changed. The methods used today are different from those in our times, and I refrain from criticism though I cannot always admire. Everything seems to have become so much more vulgar somehow, so mercenary, so wanting in a fine ideal. Also money has changed hands, the rich of today are another <span data-pg='277'></span> class. Life has been hard on royalty ever since the war and yet countries do not seem to have become more prosperous without them. Times are troubled, alas, and this unfortunate ... war (Ethiopian) has made all things so inflammable and events seem so out of control that one cannot help being anxious.

.......... 'And yet who wants war?... Who could stand a war today materially or even morally? I really hope that I shall die before there is another war!

.......... 'I lead a very quiet life, my household has become small but I have the feeling of being well loved in the country. My people and I are old associates, we have shared good and bad through forty-three years, and that counts!

.......... 'I wonder if I shall ever travel your way again? For the present I have no plans, I sit still and watch the black clouds, and pray for peace. With love and blessing, Marie.'[4]

	Shoghi Effendi, in a letter of 27 February 1940 written on his behalf, requested George Townshend to write an article about Queen Marie of Romania and her relationship with the Baha'i Faith. This article was also published in The Baha'i World. George Townshend was undoubtedly the person most suited to evaluate Queen Marie's allegiance to the religion. He had been a Canon of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin and Archdeacon of Clonfert and had come to the decision to leave the Church for the Baha'i Faith.[5]

.......... The Guardian wishes me .now to request you to kindly prepare a detailed article concerning the late Queen Marie of Romania which he wishes to reproduce, together with some of the; material regarding her, in the next issue of 'The Baha'i World'. He would like you to send him the article in about a month's time, and if not .he can wait a month more. As you have already contributed articles to the previous volumes of the Biennial (Volumes II, III, IV, V, VI and VII), and these have been widely appreciated by the friends, he thinks you would be encouraged to undertake writing the article in question.

.......... As material for your study he would suggest the following:

.......... 1. The Queen's own statements published in Volume VII of 'The Baha'i World', pages 498-501. <span data-pg='278'></span>

.......... 2. Tribute paid to Her Majesty by the Guardian and reproduced in Volume II of 'The Baha'i World', pages 173-174.

.......... 3. Article by Miss Martha Root in 'Baha'i World' Volume VI, pages 580-583.

.......... 4. Enclosed article by Mrs McNeill, a childhood friend of the Queen, published in 'World Order' magazine.

.......... 5. Enclosed letter addressed to the Guardian by Her Majesty, dated August 27, 1926. Special reference should be made to that letter in view of the far-reaching significance of its references to the Faith.

.......... The Guardian would further recommend that the following facts and data should be incorporated into your article:

.......... 1. The late Queen Marie was the granddaughter of both Queen Victoria and Czar Alexander II of Russia, to both of whom Baha'u'llah revealed Tablets in which He appreciatively referred to them, unlike His Tablets to Napoleon III, and His references to the King of Prussia, and the Emperor of Austria in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. The illuminated copy of Baha'u'llah's Tablet to Queen Victoria was presented to her by Lady Blomfield in London.

.......... 2. The Queen and her daughter intended to visit the Baha'i Shrines in Bahji and on Mount Carmel, and they reached Haifa with that intention, but were deterred from doing so, as testi≠fied by the Queen herself in the following passage of a letter she wrote Miss Martha Root on June 28, 1931: 'Both Ileana and I were cruelly disappointed at having been prevented going to the holy Shrines and of meeting Shoghi Effendi, but at that time we were going through a cruel crisis and every movement I made was being turned against me, and being politically exploited in an unkind way. It caused me a good deal of suffer≠ing and curtailed my liberty most unkindly... But the beauty of truth remains and I cling to it through all the vicissitudes of a life become rather sad.'

.......... 3. In July 1938, in connection with the Queen's death, the Guardian on behalf of all the Baha'is sent a message of condolences to her daughter, the Queen of Yugoslavia, to which Her Majesty replied expressing 'sincere thanks to all Baha'i followers'. <span data-pg='279'></span>

.......... 4. Baha'is in various countries held memorial gatherings in her honour. In the U.S.A. flowers were sent for the memorial service in Washington. The letter sent on behalf of the American National Spiritual Assembly to the Romanian Minister in Washington is enclosed for your information.

.......... 5. The Queen has made unequivocal assertion in one of her seven statements of her faith of the divine authority of both Baha'u'llah and the Prophet Muhammad, as a result of her study of the Baha'i Writings. The Guardian wishes you to quote the passage in one of the seven statements referring to Prophet Muhammad.

.......... 6. The following passage from another letter addressed by the Queen to Miss Martha Root, dated June 8, 1926, should be incorporated in toto in your article: 'The beautiful truth of Baha'u'llah is with me always, a help and inspiration. What I wrote was because my heart overflowed with gratitude for the revelation you brought me. I am happy if you think I helped. I thought it might bring truth nearer because my words are read by so many.'

.......... With renewed thanks from the Guardian for your invaluable
help, and with his warmest love and greetings...[6]

	George Townshend prepared a moving survey of the last twelve years of Queen Marie's life and an exposition of the significance of her encounter with the Cause of Baha'u'llah, a Cause she openly and publicly promoted and appreciated:

[.]
[.//]
Queen Marie of Rumania
and the Baha'i Faith

.......... Among the Baha'i treasures in the International Baha'i Archives at Haifa there lies an exquisite and precious brooch, preserved as a memorial of the first of the queens of the world who recognized and acknowledged the Revelation of Baha'u'llah.

.......... Queen Marie of Rumania did not hesitate about this recognition nor was she diffident about giving it expression. She was at the time in bitter need, in profound, overwhelming sorrow. The sweetness, the tenderness, the depth of sympathy and helpfulness which she found at once in boundless measure in <span data-pg='280'></span> the Divine Message made an instantaneous appeal and opened her heart to seek and welcome the knowledge of its manifold beauty and truth. She felt the precious, warm loving-kindness of the Heavenly Teachers, the perfection of their understand≠ing. Her soul was satisfied. Here at last was that for which she had hungered. Here was peace, the reality of peace: a breath upon a fevered world from that guarded inner shrine where peace has its inviolate home.

.......... She was in bitter need. Those who were near and dear to her surrounded her with love and sympathy and consolations; for they too knew grief and pain and felt with one who suffered so acutely as she. But anguish of spirit had awakened in her a desire for something other than the sincerest human condo≠lence. She faced the mystery of death and love. No word, no touch, however gentle, that came only from a knowledge of this fleeting human life could suffice her now. Loneliness had broken the hold of earth on her. She longed, as she had never longed before, for God.

.......... And God came.

.......... Jesus divided those to whom the Divine Message is communicated into four classes: those who are too self-absorbed to receive any impressions, those who are able to receive only a shallow impression, and those who are deeply impressed by the truth but are also impressed by things not true, and finally those who are single-minded in the love and service of truth. It was the unique distinction of Queen Marie that, living in a special sphere where the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches are at their maximum, she accepted and held fast to the New Revelation. She was the first to walk in that narrow path in which, when it is made broader, all the kings and queens and rulers of the earth will follow her.

.......... The time of an Advent is and ever has been an epoch of the severest test for humanity. 'Who may abide the day of His coming?' cried the ancient prophet; 'and who shall stand when He appeareth?' For none is the test so hard as for the great and rich. 'Know ye in truth,' said Baha'u'llah, 'that wealth is a mighty barrier between the seeker and his desire, the lover and his beloved. The rich, but for a few, shall in no wise attain the court of His presence nor enter the city of content and resignation.' For none among the great and rich is the test so <span data-pg='281'></span> hard as for royalty. Alone among those of royal blood, alone among her sister-queens, Marie of Rumania recognized the dawning of the Day of Days and acclaimed in Baha'u'llah the glory of the Father. Therefore this signal privilege has been accorded her; and the ornament which she presented as a sign of gratitude to the Baha'i teacher who brought her the Divine message is honoured with a place among the holy relics of the early heroes of the Cause who first upheld among man the Banner of the Manifest King of Kings.

.......... Marie, the eldest daughter of the Duke of Edinburgh, was born in the purple; but she had this special distinction that in her veins ran the blood of the only two royalties to whom Baha'u'llah, when He announced His Advent to the world's rulers, addressed words of commendation. She was on her mother's side the granddaughter of Czar Alexander II, who abolished serfdom, and on her father's side of Queen Victoria; both of whom Baha'u'llah addressed in words different from the stern or minatory terms used by Him towards the King of Prussia, the Emperors of Austria and France, and the Sultan of Turkey and the Shah of Persia.

.......... She was herself an outstanding and radiant personality, vigorous and daring, devoted to idealistic and humanitarian projects. A traveller who in 1909, before her accession to the throne, visited her summer home in Sinaia, Rumania, at a time when it was unoccupied by her, wrote afterwards in {The Baha'i Magazine}:

.......... 'We were deeply impressed with the spiritual atmosphere of her living apartment furnished largely with her own handiwork, the carving of the furniture, the paintings, the beautiful altar, all made by herself and all indicative of a deeply spiritual nature. Her books, her thoughts, as one gleaned in a hasty passage through her home, were such as to indicate the kind and spiritual ruler she had become.'

.......... After her death, an old friend who had known her since they played as girls together in Malta in 1888 wrote of her ...[7]
.......... [7. See above for tribute by Lilian McNeill.]

.......... The first tidings of the Baha'i Teaching were brought to her in the early days of 1926 when her Majesty was in Bucharest and owing to personal sorrow was living in retirement. Martha Root, the best known of the pioneers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, sent her a short note with a copy of Dr Esslemont's {Baha'u'llah and <span data-pg='282'></span> the New Era}. The Queen accepted the book and was at once so keenly interested by its message that she sat up over it into the small hours, and the next morning she sent an invitation to Martha to visit her in the Palace on the following day at twelve o'clock.

.......... So quick and strong was the impression made through that interview that the Queen gave it utterance that same year in many ways public as well as private. She found a ready response to her enthusiasm in her young daughter Ileana, afterwards Archduchess Anton, to whom she taught these truths. She wrote to an American friend of hers in Paris, 'I have found all my yearnings for real religion satisfied... I am now ready to die any day full of hope; but I pray God not to take me away yet for I still have a lot of work to do'...

.......... In May and in September 1926 {The Toronto Daily Star} published from her pen two glowing tributes to the Baha'i Faith ...[8]
.......... [8. See chapter 3 above for Queen Marie's statement.]

.......... To the {Philadelphia Evening Bulletin} in September the same year she contributed an article on the Faith in the course of which she testified expressly to her acceptance of the truth of a succession of Revelations, a succession of Prophets--'Christ, Muhammad, Baha'u'llah,' she wrote; continuing, 'those voices [of God] sent to us had to become flesh so that with our earthly ears we should be able to hear and understand ...'

.......... These three articles being syndicated were printed in nearly two hundred American newspapers, and afterwards appeared in several newspapers in the East.

.......... The Guardian of the Baha'i Cause gratefully acknowledged these spontaneous appreciations. 'Moved by an irresistible impulse,' he wrote in the Baha'i World for 1926-8, 'I addressed her Majesty in the name of the Baha'is of both East and West a written expression of our joyous admiration and gratitude for the queenly tribute which her Majesty has paid to the beauty and nobility of the Baha'i Teachings .. .'

.......... The following is the letter which he received in reply:

[.]
Bran, August 27th 1926

Dear Sir,

.......... I was deeply moved on reception of your letter. Indeed a great light came to me with the message of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha...[9]
.......... [9. For the text of this letter see chapter 3 above.]
[.] <span data-pg='283'></span>

.......... Martha Root also wrote to her Majesty, and in the reply which she received were these words: '... The beautiful truth of Baha'u'llah is with me always, a help and an inspiration. What I wrote was because my heart overflowed with gratitude for the revelation you brought me. I am happy if you think I helped. I thought it might bring truth nearer because my words are read by so many...'

.......... In the following year (1927) her Majesty gave another audience to Martha Root; a third audience in 1928 when with her daughter the Princess Ileana she was the guest of the Queen of Yugoslavia in Belgrade; and a fourth in 1929 in the Summer Palace at Balcie. She contributed an encomium of the Cause, charged with warm feeling and beautifully expressed, to the fourth volume of the Baha'i World; and another more brief but not less significant to the fifth volume. 'The Baha'i Teaching', she wrote, 'brings peace to the soul and hope to the heart. To those in search of assurance the words of the Father are as a fountain in the desert after long wandering.'

.......... It had been for some time her Majesty's wish and aspiration to visit in person the sacred shrines upon Mount Carmel and to meet in person Shoghi Effendi. In the year 1931 the opportunity, as it seemed, arrived. Accompanied by her youngest daughter her Majesty travelled to the Holy Land and arrived at Haifa with the intention of fulfilling her cherished desire. But fate had ruled otherwise. Unfriendly influences intervened. She did not reach her goal. In a sad letter to Martha Root dated June 28th, 1931, she told of her frustration and of the unwelcome pressure to which she had been subjected ...[10]
.......... [10. For the text of this letter see chapter 8 above.]

.......... Early in 1934 her Majesty again received Martha Root in audience in the Cotroceni Palace in Bucharest and expressed her delight that the Rumanian translation of Baha'u'llah and the New Era had just been published in Bucharest and that her people were to have the blessing of reading this precious Teaching. In the course of the interview the Queen told of an incident which had happened in Hamburg some months earlier when she was en route to Iceland. As she was driving down the street a girl tossed into the car a little note, and when her Majesty opened it she read the message, 'I am so glad to see you in Hamburg because you are a Baha'i.' <span data-pg='284'></span>

.......... Martha Root's sixth and final interview took place in February 1936 in the same Palace, and was in some respects the most touching and significant of all. Her Majesty spoke of various Baha'i books, for she used to purchase them as they came off the press. She spoke of the depth of the Iqan, and of the wonderful radiant force of Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah. 'Even doubters', she said, 'would find a powerful strength in it if they could read it alone and would give their souls time to expand.' She told how in London she had met a Baha'i, Lady Blomfield, who had shown her the message that Baha'u'llah had sent to her Grandmother, Queen Victoria. She told, too, of a dear friend of her girlhood who lived in 'Akka, Palestine, and knew Shoghi Effendi and had sent from there pictures of 'Akka and Haifa. This friend (Mrs McNeill) published afterwards a letter which the Queen wrote to her at this time...[11]
.......... [11. For the text of this letter see 'Treasured Memories' above.]

.......... Four days after this, the Queen sent for the BAHA'I WORLD, her last public tribute to the Faith of Baha'u'llah. It was in due course reproduced in facsimile as a frontispiece to Volume VI, 1936-38 .. [12]
.......... [12. For text, see chapter 13 above.]

.......... The end was drawing near. Her health undermined by her many troubles began to fail. After some months of illness, in July, 1938 she passed away, and leaving this world where for all her royal rank she had known so much of grief and tears she entered that Great Beyond of which she had thought so often and so deeply.

.......... Her death and obsequies were attended with all the ceremo≠nial that befits the passing of a Queen. But who can tell what was the greeting that awaited her on the other side where she learned in an instant how true had been her intuitions of the manifestation of God and where she saw unobscured now by any mortal veil the white eternal splendour of the Truth that she, alone among the earth's queens, had risen to acclaim.

.......... The Guardian of the Cause and the Baha'is generally recognized the distinction of her spiritual station and the greatness of her service to the Cause. In July, 1938 the Guardian on behalf of all the Baha'is sent a message of condolence to her daughter the Queen of Yugoslavia to which her Majesty replied expressing 'sincere thanks to all Baha'i followers'. To the Memorial Service held in the Cathedral of Washington, D.C., <span data-pg='285'></span> U.S.A. the Baha'is of the United States and Canada sent a tribute of flowers. The following sentences are from an account of that ceremony:

.......... 'On July 25th, 1938, the first anniversary of the death of Queen Marie of Rumania, an impressive memorial service was held in her honour at the Cathedral of Washington in the national capital of the United States. In Bethlehem Chapel on this mid-summer afternoon national dignitaries and humble citizens paid loving tribute to a royal personage whose name stands out with an especial lustre in the history of her time. The spiritual beauty of the service expressed the character of this noble Queen--the first member of royalty to embrace the Faith of Baha'u'llah.

.......... 'Arranged by the Rumanian Minister Radu Irimescu, the service was conducted by the Reverend Doctor Anson Phelps Stokes, canon of the Cathedral and former Secretary of Yale University. Among the diplomatists present were the British, French and Italian Ambassadors and representatives of other European embassies and legations. The Secretary of State, Honourable Cordell Hull, headed the American delegation which included government officials and representatives of the Army and Navy...

.......... 'Directly opposite the altar in this intimate chapel stood the imposing floral tribute "from the Baha'i Friends of America"--a cross ten feet in height with a nine-pointed star at its centre. This emblem was designed by Charles Mason Remey and presented in consultation with the National Spiritual Assembly. It was beside the Baha'i tribute that the Rumanian Minister stood at the conclusion of the service to greet the audience as they passed out, according to the continental custom on such occasions.

.......... 'Not only did Queen Marie as the Dowager Queen of Rumania attest her faith in the Divine Cause through private letters; she claimed the spiritual bounty of calling the Teachings to the attention of others.'

.......... In these dark and troublous times, this Day (or is it not rather this Night?) of judgement, when there is no open vision and when the gift of spirituality is not esteemed, the connection of Queen Marie with the Baha'i Faith may seem to be but a small matter, the least episode among the multifarious activities of a crowded and brilliant life. But when this sleep in which the <span data-pg='286'></span> world's soul is shrouded ends at last; when men's spirits awakening behold the glories and the bounties and the opportunities that have lain about them, unwelcome and unregarded, all these many years, then they will look back upon the past with a new and horrified understanding. They will gaze with amazement and indignation and pity upon the incorrigible blindness of the mighty ones of Europe who despite the manifold warnings of God led their people through misery upon misery and flung them at last into the ultimate abyss of war. But amidst that universal darkness of failure and misrule that fills the palaces and chancelleries of the world men will see one solitary light shining in lone splendour and will acknowledge the true majesty of that one redeeming soul whose high faith caught and reflected far the glory of the breaking Dawn of God.

.......... In later times, when the prophecies of the Bible are fulfilled openly before the eyes of all, when the New Jerusalem estab≠lished in the top of the mountains and 'the nations of them that are saved walk in its light and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour into it'; then men will see treasured among the sacred relics of the first champions of the Baha'i Faith one royal ornament, a brooch of silver and diamond, the memorial of the first Queen who recognized and acclaimed the Glory of Baha'u'llah; and the name and the deed of Queen Marie of Rumania will be on the lips of men forever.

Epilogue

	In the International Baha'i Archives in Haifa, among the precious relics associated with the history of the Faith, in a cabinet along the balcony which faces the city of 'Akka across the bay, lies prominently displayed for all Baha'i pilgrims to see a copy of the first Romanian translation of "Baha'u'llah and the New Era: Baha'u'llahsi Era Noua" It is the translation arranged by Martha Root with the assistance of Queen Marie and bears the following inscription to Martha:

	After the passing of Queen Marie, Romania's fortunes con≠tinued to decline. King Carol II proclaimed himself royal dictator and outlawed all political parties in an attempt to stave off the dangers of the Fascist movement of the Iron Guard and calm extreme popular discontent. The country was surrounded by the simmering difficulties of the rest of Europe. Abandoned by the countries it had considered its protectors, Romania once again suffered great territorial losses in 1940: Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to Russia, northern Transylvania to Hungary and southern Dobrogea to Bulgaria. King Carol abdicated on 6 September 1940 and his son Michael, not yet 19, once again sat on the Romanian throne. The Iron Guard returned briefly to rule the country with General Ion Antonescu. They shared only a hatred of <span data-pg='288'></span> democracy and a year later General Antonescu grabbed power for himself and proclaimed the country a military dictatorship until the Russian Red Army occupied Bucharest in 1944. Backed by the Soviet Union, the unpopular Communist Party forced itself into a position of power that lasted nearly a half century. On 30 December 1947 King Michael was forced to abdicate and Romania was proclaimed a People's Republic. Contact with the West was effectively broken off and the people's freedoms were curbed, including religious freedom. Many of Romania's spiritual leaders were persecuted and imprisoned and books of a spiritual or religious nature were banned.

	Little did Queen Marie suspect in 1934, when she inscribed Martha Root's copy of Baha'u'llah and the New Era, that her people would not only fail to receive the blessing she had wished for them but would be cruelly oppressed for many years.

	As so often happens when a person suffers certain deprivations, his determination to have what others prevent him from having is strengthened. Many Romanians clandestinely fostered their spiritual lives so that when the Communist leader Nicolae Ceaucescu was overthrown in 1989 and certain aspects of the people's existence began to regain some semblance of normality, it was found that large numbers thirsted for religion.

	A thriving Baha'i community is emerging in Romania, one of the 235 countries, territories and dependencies in which the Baha'i Faith is established.[2] With its national governing council, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Romania, and its 21 local spiritual assemblies[3] to look after national and local affairs respectively, the spread of the Baha'i Faith has been quite remarkable for a country in which most people have been officially taught to believe that God and religion do not exist. There are over 7,300 Baha'is living in nearly 700 localities throughout Romania. The Romanian people now do have 'the blessings' of 'this precious teaching' and of joining the rapidly growing worldwide community that has recognized <span data-pg='289'></span> Baha'u'llah as the messenger of God for this day, just as Romania's beloved Queen did publicly over 70 years ago. Queen Marie carried out her own investigation of Baha'u'llah's Faith through an in-depth study of its teachings and fought courageously to preserve her belief in spite of outside pressures on her to conform to more a popular creed.

.......... [3. Figures for Romania are for 1999.]

	Queen Marie's portrait was hung by Shoghi Effendi at the threshold of the room in the mansion at Bahji in which Baha'u'llah passed away. In 1993 the Universal House of Justice had a beautiful portrait of the Romanian Queen hung in the reception area outside the council chamber in its seat on Mount Carmel, next to the portrait of the most recent monarch to accept the Baha'i Faith, His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II, Head of State of Western Samoa. As the kings, rulers and ministers of state increasingly recognize in their turn the truth of Baha'u'llah's message and seek the guidance of the Universal House of Justice, they will pass before that portrait of the Queen whose last public statement is as relevant today as it was during her lifetime:

[.]
[.//]
.......... More than ever today when the world is facing such a crisis of bewilderment and unrest, must we stand firm in Faith seeking that which binds together instead of tearing asunder.

.......... To those searching for light, the Baha'i Teachings offer a star which will lead them to deeper understanding, to assurance, peace and good will with all men.[4]

Appendix I

Tablet of Baha'u'llah to Queen Victoria

	O Queen in London! Incline thine ear unto the voice of thy Lord, the Lord of all mankind, calling from the Divine Lote≠Tree: Verily, no God is there but Me, the Almighty, the All-Wise! Cast away all that is on earth, and attire the head of thy kingdom with the crown of the remembrance of thy Lord, the All-Glorious. He, in truth, hath come unto the world in His most great glory, and all that hath been mentioned in the Gospel hath been fulfilled. The land of Syria hath been honoured by the footsteps of its Lord, the Lord of all men, and North and South are both inebriated with the wine of His presence. Blessed is the man that inhaled the fragrance of the Most Merciful, and turned unto the Dawning-Place of His Beauty, in this resplendent Dawn. The Mosque of Aqsa vibrateth through the breezes of its Lord, the All-Glorious whilst Batha (Mecca) trembleth at the voice of God, the Exalted, the Most High. Whereupon every single stone of them celebrateth the praise of the Lord, through this Great Name.

	Lay aside thy desire, and set then thine heart towards thy Lord, the Ancient of Days. We make mention of thee for the sake of God, and desire that thy name may be exalted through thy remembrance of God, the Creator of earth and heaven. He, verily, is witness unto that which I say. We have been informed that thou hast forbidden the trading in slaves, both men and women. This, verily, is what God hath enjoined in this wondrous Revelation. God hath, truly, destined a reward <span data-pg='291'></span> for thee, because of this. He, verily, will pay the doer of good his due recompense, wert thou to follow what hath been sent unto thee by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. As to him who turneth aside, and swelleth with pride, after that the clear tokens have come unto him, from the Revealer of signs, his work shall God bring to naught. He, in truth, hath power over all things. Man's actions are acceptable after his having recognized (the Manifestation). He that turneth aside from the True One is indeed the most veiled amongst His creatures. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Almighty, the Most Powerful.

	We have also heard that thou hast entrusted the reins of counsel into the hands of the representatives of the people. Thou, indeed, hast done well, for thereby the foundations of the edifice of thine affairs will be strengthened, and the hearts of all that are beneath thy shadow, whether high or low, will be tranquillized. It behoveth them, however, to be trustworthy among His servants, and to regard themselves as the representatives of all that dwell on earth. This is what counselleth them, in this Tablet, He Who is the Ruler, the All-Wise... Blessed is he that entereth the assembly for the sake of God, and judgeth between men with pure justice. He, indeed, is of the blissful...

	Turn thou unto God and say: O my Sovereign Lord! I am but a vassal of Thine, and Thou art, in truth, the King of Kings. I have lifted my suppliant hands unto the heaven of Thy grace and Thy bounties. Send down, then, upon me from the clouds of Thy generosity that which will rid me of all save Thee, and draw me nigh unto Thyself. I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy name, which Thou hast made the king of names, and the manifestation of Thyself to all who are in heaven and on earth, to rend asunder the veils that have intervened between me and my recognition of the Dawning-Place of Thy signs and the Day Spring of Thy Revelation. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Bounteous. Deprive me not, O my Lord, of the fragrances of <span data-pg='292'></span> the Robe of Thy mercy in Thy days, and write down for me that which Thou hast written down for thy handmaidens who have believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and have recog≠nized Thee, and set their hearts towards the horizon of Thy Cause. Thou art truly the Lord of the worlds and of those who show mercy the Most Merciful. Assist me, then, O my God, to remember Thee amongst Thy handmaidens, and to aid Thy Cause in Thy lands. Accept, then, that which hath escaped me when the light of Thy countenance shone forth. Thou, indeed, hast power over all things. Glory be to Thee, O Thou in Whose hand is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth.[1]

Appendix II

Tablet of Baha'u'llah to Czar Alexander II

	O Czar of Russia! Incline thine ear unto the voice of God, the King, the Holy, and turn thou unto Paradise, the Spot wherein abideth He Who, among the Concourse on high, beareth the most excellent titles, and Who, in the kingdom of creation, is called by the name of God, the Effulgent, the All-Glorious. Beware lest thy desire deter thee from turning towards the face of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Most Merciful. We, verily, have heard the thing for which thou didst supplicate thy Lord, whilst secretly communing with Him. Wherefore, the breeze of My loving-kindness wafted forth, and the sea of My mercy surged, and We answered thee in truth. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Whilst I lay chained and fettered in the prison, one of thy ministers extended Me his aid. Wherefore hath God ordained for thee a station which the knowledge of none can compre≠hend except His knowledge. Beware lest thou barter away this sublime station... Beware lest thy sovereignty withhold thee from Him Who is the Supreme Sovereign. He, verily, is come with His Kingdom, and all the atoms cry aloud: 'La! The Lord is come in His great majesty!' He Who is the Father is come, and the Son (Jesus), in the holy vale, crieth out: 'Here am I, here am I, O Lord, My God!' whilst Sinai circleth round the House, and the Burning Bush calleth aloud: 'The All-Bounteous is come mounted upon the clouds! Blessed is he that draweth nigh unto Him, and woe betide them that are far away.' <span data-pg='294'></span>

	Arise thou amongst men in the name of this all-compelling Cause, and summon, then, the nations unto God, the Exalted, the Great. Be thou not of them who called upon God by one of His names, but who, when He Who is the Object of all names appeared, denied Him and turned aside from Him, and, in the end, pronounced sentence against Him with manifest injustice. Consider and call thou to mind the days whereon the Spirit of God (Jesus) appeared, and Herod gave judgement against Him. God, however, aided Him with the hosts of the unseen, and protected Him with truth, and sent Him down unto another land, according to His promise. He, verily, ordaineth what He pleaseth. Thy Lord truly preserveth whom He willeth, be he in the midst of the seas, or in the maw of the serpent, or beneath the sword of the oppressor...

	Again I say: Hearken unto My Voice that calleth from My prison that it may acquaint thee with the things that have befallen My Beauty, at the hands of them that are the manifestations of My glory, and that thou mayest perceive how great hath been My patience, notwithstanding My might, and how immense My forbearance, notwithstanding My power. By My Life! Couldst thou but know the things sent down by My Pen, and discover the treasures of My Cause, and the pearls of My mysteries which lie hid in the seas of My names and in the goblets of My words, thou wouldst, in thy love for My name, and in thy longing for My glorious and sublime Kingdom, lay down thy life in My path. Know thou that though My body be beneath the swords of My foes, and My limbs be beset with incalculable afflictions, yet My spirit is filled with a gladness with which all the joys of the earth can never compare.

	Set thine heart towards Him Who is the Point of adoration for the world, and say: O peoples of the earth! Have ye denied the One in Whose path He Who came with the truth, bearing the announcement of your Lord, the Exalted, the Great, suffered martyrdom? Say: This is an Announcement whereat the hearts of the Prophets and Messengers have <span data-pg='295'></span> rejoiced. This is the One Whom the heart of the world remembereth and is promised in the Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. The hands of the Messengers were, in their desire to meet Me, upraised towards God, the Mighty, the Glorified... Some lamented in their separation from Me, others endured hardships in My path, and still others laid down their lives for the sake of My Beauty, could ye but know it. Say: I, verily, have not sought to extol Mine Own Self, but rather God Himself were ye to judge fairly. Naught can be seen in Me except God and His Cause, could ye but perceive it. I am the One Whom the tongue of Isaiah hath extolled, the One with Whose name both the Torah and the Evangel were adorned... Blessed be the king whose sover≠eignty hath withheld him not from his Sovereign, and who hath turned unto God with his heart. He, verily, is accounted of those that have attained unto that which God, the Mighty, the All-Wise hath willed. Ere long will such a one find himself numbered with the monarchs of the realms of the Kingdom. Thy Lord is, in truth, potent over all things. He giveth what He willeth to whomsoever He willeth, and withholdeth what He pleaseth from whomsoever He willeth. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.[1]
