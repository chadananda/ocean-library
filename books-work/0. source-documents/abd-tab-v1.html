    <h3 class='title'>Introduction</h3>
  </div>



 <p id='i' class='nodropcap'> This book <span data-pg='i'></span> is a reproduction of the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as contained in the archives of the House of Spirituality <a data-fnid='1'></a> of Bahá’ís of Chicago. These Tablets are letters written by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and received by individuals and assemblies throughout America, many of them being in answer to questions. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn1'> This Tablet bears the following superscription: “To the members of the House of Justice, the servants of the Covenant, the faithful worshipers of the Holy Threshold of the Beauty of Abhá.” This tablet and the following eighteen are to the House of Spirituality of Chicago. </aside>

 <p id='i.2'> These copies of Tablets have been gathered by the House of Spirituality of Chicago from the recipients for the purpose of safe preservation in accordance with the purpose mentioned in the following letter sent out by that Body: </p>


 <p id='i.3' class='blockquote verse'>	March 21, 1908
 To the Friends of God in the Light of Abhá, throughout America. </p>

<p id='i.4' class='blockquote'> Greeting: — For a number of years the House of Spirituality has been gathering copies of Tablets, received by the Friends in America from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás, for sacred preservation in its archives, in accord with permission from him to do so in a Tablet addressed to it dated April 21, 1903, as follows: “As to the compiling of the Tablets in a Book for the House of Spirituality, this depends upon the consent of the receivers of the Tablets; if the owners of the Tablets consent, copies should be kept and collected in the House of Spirituality and it will be acceptable.” </p>

<p id='i.5' class='blockquote'> Although many Tablets, both published and unpublished, were known to be in circulation among the believers, and notwithstanding <span data-pg='ii'></span> the restriction to collect only copies sent in with the consent of the recipients, yet, in the spring of 1907, through the hearty response and co-operation in this endeavor about 500 copies of different Tablets had been received, acknowledged and filed with data concerning each in a safety deposit vault equipped with all modern appliances for protection. </p>

<p id='i.6' class='blockquote'> We believe the Friends everywhere will be further interested in knowing that at that time a draft of the Tablets was made by the Librarian of the House of Spirituality for the Bahá’í Publishing Society (who contemplated issuing same in book form), with all references to personalities eliminated, and said compilation was taken by Mr. Agnew to the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who inquired especially as to elimination of all names of persons and everything of a clearly personal nature, and as to whether the recipients of the Tablets had consented to publication of them, etc.-to all of which he gave approval and instructed the Publishing Society to proceed with the work. </p>

<p id='i.7' class='blockquote'> The purpose of this communication is therefore twofold: First, that the endeavor be continued to preserve a copy of every Tablet obtainable; and second, that it be accomplished at the earliest possible moment in order to make the forthcoming Volumes of Tablets (now being prepared by the Publishing Society) as complete as possible, for only the Tablets in the archives of the House will be used, as therein is recorded the desire of the recipients. </p>

<p id='i.8' class='blockquote'> In sending copies of Tablets, kindly see in so far as possible that together with each is given: (1) Full name of recipient (2) present address, mentioning street number, city or town, and state, (3) on or about date translated, (4) name of translator, (5) clearly state whether or not permission to publish all or only a portion of same is granted. Should there be any doubt as to whether or not a copy of any certain Tablet is already in the archives, you may be assured in knowing that every Tablet received has been acknowledged on a special printed form, signed by the Librarian. </p>

<p id='i.9' class='blockquote'> Concerning this important matter the following words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will be of interest to all: “Verily know, that the Tablets (Book) of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his address is a hidden mystery and concealed fact; no one is informed of its greatness and importance at these times. But in the course of times and future centuries, the signs thereof will be manifested, the lights thereof will dawn, the fragrance thereof will be diffused, and the greatness, the importance <span data-pg='iii'></span> thereof will be known. The truth I say unto thee, that each leaflet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will be a wide-spread Book; nay, rather, a glistening Gem on the Glorious Crown. Know thou Its value and hold great Its station!” </p>

 <p id='i.10' class='signature verse'>Thanking you in advance, we are your fellow-servants in the Vineyard of Abhá,
 THE HOUSE OF SPIRITUALITY. </p>

<p id='i.11'> A sufficient number of Tablets having been gathered together, they have been entrusted to the Bahá’í Publishing Society for publication in this concrete form for the enlightenment of the English-speaking world. </p>

<p id='i.12'> The Tablets appear in the book in the order received and filed in the archives. i.e., the first to respond to the above letter sent out by the House of Spirituality appear first in the book, and, so far as possible. all the Tablets to any one person or to a family or to an assembly have been placed together. </p>

<p id='i.13'> Regarding publications, the following Tablet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was received by this Society in October, 1906: </p>

<p id='i.14' class='blockquote abd'> HE IS GOD! </p>

<p id='i.15' class='blockquote abd'> O ye heavenly Assemblage! </p>

<p id='i.16' class='blockquote abd'> Your letter was received and its contents became known. Ye have written concerning the printing and the publication of the Tablets. </p>

<p id='i.17' class='blockquote abd'> The translation of the Súratu’l-Haykal <a data-fnid='2'></a> is of the utmost difficulty. It must be translated by a committee who are exceedingly efficient both in Persian and English, exercising the closest and most minute attention. <span data-pg='iv'></span> Otherwise the text would not become intelligible. The same rule applieth to other Writings and Tablets. For the present the organization of such a committee of translators is not possible and there is no other means than the translations made by individuals. In the future, God willing, means will be brought about. Translations will be made by a committee composed of two most erudite Persians and two learned Americans, all of them having the utmost proficiency in both languages and possessing a certain knowledge of sciences and arts. Then others from among the scholars and thinkers must assist. At that time Tablets will be translated correctly and published. What ye have in your hands and what is already printed will impart a certain degree of information. Whatever matter the spiritual Boards of Council in New York, Chicago, Washington and Kenosha unanimously deem advisable to print and publish, ye may print and publish; and have the utmost unity and oneness with each other. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn2'> Súratu’l-Haykal by Bahá’u’lláh, a portion of which was translated by Anton Haddad, published in 1900. The retranslation of this book has not yet been undertaken. </aside>



 <p id='i.18' class='blockquote abd'> Regarding the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: Each of them is important. Print ye those which are in detail. </p>

<p id='i.19' class='blockquote abd'> As to the question of annihilation and destruction of the spirits<a data-fnid='3'></a>: Mr. Phelps hath not fully understood the matter or else the translator hath made some mistake. It was not intended to convey the idea that the unbelieving souls are absolutely annihilated. Nay, rather, it was meant that the existence of the evil spirits in comparison to the existence of the sanctified souls was like unto annihilation. As you clearly behold, the existence <span data-pg='v'></span> of mineral in comparison with the existence of man is like unto non-being. When the body of man is destroyed and disintegrated, it returneth to the mineral. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn3'> Referring to passage in “The Life and Teaching of ‘Abbás Effendi” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá), by Myron T. Phelps, published by G. P. Putnam’s Sons,New York. </aside>



 <p id='i.20' class='blockquote abd'> Concerning the income of the printing and publishing society, as ye write, it must be expended for charitable purposes. </p>

<p id='i.21' class='blockquote abd'> O ye believers of God! I am pleased with you and seek for your assistance and confirmation. I hope that ye may, day by day, add to your love, steadfastness, purity of intention and service to the Cause of God. </p>

<p id='i.22' class='signature abd verse'> Upon ye be greeting and praise!
 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás. </p>



<p id='i.23'> These Tablets were originally written in Persian and all bear the caption, <q class='abd'>“He is God!”</q><a data-fnid='4'></a> and close with expressions of good will, such as, <q class='abd'>“Upon ye be greetings and praise!”</q> These expressions have been omitted from this compilation; also such portions as are clearly of a personal nature, as well as names of persons, as instructed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn4'> This is a usage of the people of the East. The purpose is that in every matter the commencement should be in the Name of God. </aside>

 <p id='i.24'> Omission of names of persons has been designated by the sign, thus ______; omission of purely personal portions of text have been designated by the sign, thus ... . The translator’s interpolations are enclosed in parentheses, thus ( ); editors’ interpolations are enclosed in brackets, thus [ ]. Messages and quotations are shown by the usual sign, thus “ ”. </p>

<p id='i.25'> The great labor of translating these Tablets from the original language has been entrusted to the following translators,<span data-pg='vi'></span> whose inestimable service is hereby gratefully acknowledged: Anton Haddad, Mirza S. M. Raffie, Mirza Housein Roohey, Ali Kuli Khan, Dr. Ameen U. Fareed, H. S. M. Taki Manshadi, Mirza Ahmad Esphahani, Mrs. Getsinger, Miss Barney and Mirza Moneer Zane. </p>

<p id='i.26'> The House of Spirituality desires to thank all who have assisted in this matter of gathering in copies of Tablets for preservation in its archives, and requests the Bahá’ís everywhere to continue the endeavor as outlined in the circular letter sent out by that Body, as herein quoted. Address such communications to the Librarian of the House of Spirituality, P. O. Box 283, Chicago, Ill. </p>

<p id='i.27'> Only a portion of the Tablets now on file with the House of Spirituality are contained in this volume. Other volumes will be issued as soon as possible. Tablets coming in will take their place in order according to the date received and appear in forth-coming volumes. </p>

<p id='1.4'> O party of the Covenant! Verily, the Beauty of Abhá hath promised the most great assistance to the beloved who are firm in the Covenant and to confirm them through the mightiest power. Ye will surely find in your luminous assembly such signs as will shine within hearts and souls.

Make feet firm, strengthen hearts and rely upon the everlasting bounties which will successively pour on you from the Kingdom of Abhá. Know, verily, the lights of Bahá will shine forth unto you during your gathering together in the brilliant Paradise. </p>

<p id='1.5'> It is incumbent on you to have union and harmony. It is incumbent upon you to have affinity and accord, so that you may become united in body and soul as the Pleiades, and as strings of brilliant pearls. Thereby your foundation will be laid, your argument will become manifest, your stars will beam forth and your souls will be comforted. </p>

<p id='1.6'> When ye enter the spiritual meeting of Consultation, chant the following commune, your hearts beating with the love of God and your tongues purified from aught else save the commemoration of God; so that the Most Mighty Power may confirm you by the greatest assistance: </p>

We are servants who have sincerely turned our faces unto Thy grand face, severed ourselves from all else save Thee in this great day and are assembled together in this glorious meeting, of one accord and desire, and unanimous in thought to promulgate Thy Word amid Thy creatures. </p>

<p id='1.8'> O my Lord! O my Lord! Suffer us to be signs of guidance, standards of Thy manifest Religion throughout the world, servants of Thy Great Covenant — O our exalted Lord! — appearances of Thy oneness in Thy <span data-pg='3'></span> Kingdom, the Abhá, and stars which dawn forth unto all regions. </p>

<p id='1.9'> O Lord! Make us as seas rolling with the waves of Thy great abundance, rivers flowing from the mountains of Thy glorious Kingdom, pure fruits on the tree of Thy illustrious Cause, plants refreshed and moved by the breeze of Thy gift in Thy wonderful vineyard. </p>

<p id='1.10'> O Lord! Cause our souls to depend upon the signs of Thy Oneness, our hearts to be dilated with the bounties of Thy Singleness, so that we may become united as are ripples on a waving sea; become harmonized as are the rays which shine forth from a brilliant light; so that our thoughts, opinions and feelings become as one reality from which the spirit of accord may be diffused throughout all regions. </p>

<p id='2.6'> Verily, I hope, through the kindness of my Lord and His mercy, bounty and generosity, to be suspended in the air in His path and that my breast may become the target to be pierced by thousands of bullets; or that I may be cast into the bottomless seas, or thrown into the wilderness and plains of barrenness. This is my utmost aim, my supreme desire, the animation of my <span data-pg='5'></span> spirit, the healing of my bosom and the sight of my eyes. </p>

<p id='2.7'> As to you, O friends of God: Make firm your feet in the Cause of God with such firmness as cannot be shaken by the most great disasters of the world. Be not troubled by anything under any condition. Be as lofty mountains, dawning-stars from the horizon of existence, brilliant lamps in the assemblies of oneness and lowly souls, pure hearted, with the friends. </p>

<p id='2.8'> Be signs of guidance; lights of piety; severed from the world, holding fast to the firm rope; spreaders of the spirit of life; abiders in the ark of safety; manifestations of mercy; dawning-stars of the mysteries of existence; points of revelation; day-springs of light; strengthened by the Holy Spirit; attracted toward God; sanctified from all things and from the (natural) qualities of people, and characterized with the attributes of the angels of heaven — so ye may attain to the greatest gift in this great century and new age. </p>

<p id='2.9'> By the life of El-Bahá! No one will obtain this great favor save he who cuts himself from this world, being attracted by the love of God, who is dead to the desires and appetites of self, sincere to God in all things and meek, humble, imploring, pleading and lowly before God. </p>

  </div>

 <p id='8' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! </p>

<p id='8.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read your reports with great joy. They are a cause of spirituality and fragrance and a source of dilation of souls. If the Spiritual Meeting, by the divine fragrance and heavenly confirmation, be firmly established (or continued) it will become a source of great signs and will be confirmed in matters of paramount importance. </p>

<p id='8.3'> The Spiritual Meetings, which are organized in this cycle of God and this divine century, have never had their simile or likeness in bygone cycles. For the great meetings (organizations) were under the protection of aristocratic men, while these meetings (or organizations) are under the protection of the bounty of Abhá. The helper or supporter of those (organizations) was either a prince or a king; either a priest was the principal, or a great republic (the cause); but the Helper, the Assistant, the Confirmer and the Inspirer of these spiritual meetings (or organizations) is His Majesty the Everlasting God. </p>

<p id='8.4'> Consider not the present condition, but rather foresee the future and the end. A seed in the beginning is very small, but in the end a great tree. One should not consider the seed, but the tree and its abundance of blossoms, leaves and fruits. </p>

<p id='8.5'> Consider the days of Jesus, when there was only a small body of people, and then observe the great tree which grew from that seed and what an abundant fruit it produced. This is greater than that, for as much as it is the calling of the Lord of Hosts and the Voice of the Trumpet of the Living God; it is the summons unto the harmony and unison of the world, and it is the banner <span data-pg='11'></span> of faithfulness, trustworthiness and friendship among the different nations and sects of the universe; it is the light of the Sun of Truth and the spirituality of the Majestic One. Verily this great cycle (dispensation) will encompass all the horizons and ultimately all the nations will gather together under this standard. </p>

<p id='8.6'> Therefore, know the importance of this seed which was planted in the divine field by the heavenly Gardener, watered with the rain of grace and nurtured by the heat and light of the Sun of Truth. Thus, O ye friends of God, give thanks unto His Majesty, the One, that ye became (or were made) the manifestation of such a gift and the recipient of such favor. </p>

<p id='8.7'> Blessed are ye! Good-tidings unto you for this great blessing! </p>

  </div>

 <p id='10' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye who are attracted by the Fragrances of God! </p>

<p id='10.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read your letters which uttered your steadfastness in the Cause of God, your firmness in His Religion and your joy by the breezes wafted from the garden of the Kingdom of God. </p>

<p id='10.3'> The truth, I say unto you: “Verily, the Supreme Concourse utter praise upon you, because ye forsook the desires of self, were illumined by the light of guidance, clothed yourselves with the garment of sanctity and called in the Name of Abhá among the people. Verily, ye shall reap what ye sow and obtain the fruits of what ye plant. This is a pre-ordained fact.” </p>

<p id='10.4'> O ye beloved of God! When the winds blow severely, rains fall fiercely, the lightening flashes, the thunder roars, the bolt descends and storms of trial become severe, grieve not; for after this storm, verily, the divine spring will arrive, the hills and fields will become verdant, the expanses of grain will joyfully wave, the earth will become covered with blossoms, the trees will be clothed with green garments and adorned with <span data-pg='13'></span> blossoms and fruits. Thus blessings become manifest in all countries. These favors are results of those storms and hurricanes. </p>

<p id='10.5'> The discerning man rejoiceth at the day of trials, his breast becometh dilated at the time of severe storms, his eyes become brightened when seeing the showers of rain and gusts of wind, whereby trees are uprooted; because he foreseeth the result and the end (of these trials); the leaves, blossoms and fruits (which follow this wintry storm); while the ignorant (short-sighted) person becometh troubled when he seethe a storm, is saddened when it raineth severely, is terrified by the thunder and trembleth at the surging of the waves which storm the shore. </p>

<p id='10.6'> As ye have heard of the former times, when (for example) Christ — glory be to Him! — appeared, a storm of trials arose, afflictions appeared, the winds of tests blew, the thunder of temptation descended and hosts of people (Pharisees) surrounded the houses of the friends; then the weak ones were shaken and were misled after once being guided; but the disciples withstood the hardships and endured the storms of ordeals, remaining firm in the Religion of God. Then observe that which occurred after the storm and what appeared subsequent to that severity, whereby the members (followers) trembled. </p>

<p id='10.7'> God changed the sorrow to joy, the destructive darkness of calamity into the shining light from the Supreme Concourse. The people at the beginning persecuted and reviled the believers in God and said of them: “These are the people of aberration.” Then, when <span data-pg='14'></span> their light appeared, their stars shone and their lamps illuminated, the people returned into love and affinity; they prayed to them, offered words of glory night and day (in their name) and remembered them in eulogy, reverence, honor and majesty. </p>

<p id='10.8'> Therefore, O ye beloved of God, be not grieved when people stand against you, persecute you, afflict and trouble you and say all manner of evil against you. The darkness will pass away and the light of the manifest signs will appear, the veil will be withdrawn and the Light of Reality will shine forth from the unseen [Kingdom] of Abhá. This we inform you before it occurs, so that when the hosts of people arise against you for my love, be not disturbed or troubled; nay, rather, be firm as a mountain, for this persecution and reviling of the people upon you is a pre-ordained matter. Blessed is the soul who is firm in the path! </p>

 <p id='17' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye spiritual friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! </p>

<p id='17.2' class='dropcap'> Your long letter was considered and its contents were a source of happiness. Thank God that ye, western friends, have become dawning-points of the love of God and stars of knowledge leading to Him; night and day are ye thinking of imparting life to souls and of educating people of discernment. </p>

<p id='17.3'> Regarding the blessed word, the Greatest Name: Its writing or spelling is according to its pronunciation (i.e., it is spelled as it is pronounced) in the Persian language. <u>Bahá</u> is correct; <u>Beha</u> is incorrect. However, <span data-pg='21'></span> this question must not cause inharmony and grief among the friends. The truth shall become manifest. </p>

<p id='17.4'> Should ye attribute a mistake to a person, it will be a cause of offense and grief to him — how much greater would this be if it is attributed to a number of people! How often it hath occurred that a slight difference hath caused a great dissension and hath been made a reason for division. Now, you write <u>Bahá’u’lláh</u>, but do not object to any person. All will eventually follow the correct spelling. </p>



 <p id='17.5'> In all matters, endeavor not to cause grief to any one. Strive firmly to establish unity and harmony. The least difference today may cause great difference in the future. </p>

<p id='17.6'> O ye beloved ones of God! The manifestation of the Light of Unity is for binding together the people of the world. If this unity is not attained, the tree of life is made fruitless, the heavenly bounty is not utilized. The blessed blood (of the saints) was shed for bringing about unity and harmony. These souls gave their lives as sacrifice in order to produce the love that bindeth the hearts of all the people. Therefore, ye should all spend your efforts in uniting and reconciling (the people), so that the light of God’s love may permeate the universe. </p>

<p id='17.7'> The Spiritual Meeting of men (House of Spirituality) and the Spiritual Meeting of women (Assembly of Teaching) in Chicago are indeed endeavoring to serve. If they unite, as they should, they will produce great results. Especially, if the Spiritual Meetings of <span data-pg='22'></span> Chicago unite with those of New York and become bound together, in a short while the fragrance of the divine garden, which giveth life, will perfume all regions. </p>

This is the station of the sincere. This is the quality of those who are firm. This is the illumination of the faces of those who are near. </p>

<p id='18.8'> Therefore, O ye friends of God, ye must in perfect purity attain spiritual unity and agreement to a degree that ye may express one spirit and one life. </p>

<p id='18.9'> In this condition physical bodies play no part; the command and authority are in the hand of the spirit. When the spirit becometh all inclusive, the spiritual union shall be attained. Night and day endeavor to attain perfect harmony; be thoughtful concerning your own spiritual developments and close your eyes to the shortcomings of one another. </p>

<p id='18.10'> By good deeds, pure lives, humility and meekness be a lesson for others. </p>

 <p id='19' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye dear friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! </p>

<p id='19.2' class='dropcap'> The blessed letter indicating the election of the Spiritual Meeting was received and proved a source of joy. Thank God, the beloved of that city, in perfect unity, love and oneness, held the new election and were confirmed and strengthened to elect such holy souls as are near the divine Threshold and known by the republic of the beloved to be firm and steadfast in the Covenant. </p>

<p id='19.3'> Now they (the members of the Spiritual Meeting) must, in perfect spirit and fragrance, in sincerity of <span data-pg='24'></span> heart, in attraction by the fragrances of God and by the confirmations of the Holy Spirit; engage in service; in the promotion of the Word of God; the diffusion of the fragrances of God; the training of souls; the promulgation of the most great peace. They must raise the Banner of Guidance and become the host of the Supreme Concourse. </p>

<p id='19.4'> Indeed, blessed souls have been elected. When I read their names, spiritual joy was immediately realized, for, praise be to God! certain souls have appeared in that continent who are servants of the Kingdom, self-sacrificing ones of the Peerless Majesty. </p>

<p id='19.5'> O ye friends of mine! Illuminate the meeting with the light of the love of God, make it joyful and happy through the melody of the Kingdom of holiness, and with heavenly food and through the “Lord’s Supper”<a data-fnid='19'></a> confer life. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn19'> A term synonymous with heavenly food. </aside>



 <p id='19.6'> Congregate in the utmost joy and happiness and commence with this commune: </p>

<p id='19.7'> O Lord of the Kingdom! Although we are assembled, yet we are Thy scattered ones; captives of Thy Shining Face. Although we are incapable, yet we anticipate the manifestation of Thy Strength and ability. Although we are without capital and commodity, yet we are aided by the treasury of the Kingdom. Although we are a drop, yet we emanate from Thy sea of seas. Although we are an atom, yet are illumined by Thy most Bright Sun. </p>

<p id='19.8'> O Lord! Confirm us so that each one in this gathering become a bright candle, a witness of the meeting, <span data-pg='25'></span> a caller to the Kingdom; that the world of matter become the mirror of heaven. </p>

<p id='19.9'> O ye dear friends of mine! The assemblies of those regions must be connected with one another and must communicate (correspond) with each other. Even communicate with the assemblies of the East, so that this may become the means of the great unity and concord. </p>

<p id='19.10'> O ye spiritual friends! Firmness (constancy) must reach a degree that if all the souls (Bahá’ís) be destroyed by the evil wishers and there remain but one, that one singly and alone should be capable of withstanding all who live on earth, and of spreading the fragrances of holiness. </p>

<p id='19.11'> Therefore, when any terrible news or calamitous tidings reach you from the land of desire (‘Akká), ye should not grow cold, sad, or be affected thereby. Nay, rather, ye must immediately in the utmost firmness, arise for the service of the Kingdom. </p>

<p id='19.12'> This servant of the Threshold of His Majesty the eternal God, hath always been and is in danger; there hath never been a hope for rest. The utmost of his hopes is that in the arena of martyrdom the cup of grace become replete and the wine of great bounty lend the wondrous ecstasy. This is the utmost of my hopes and desires. </p>

<p id='19.13'> The Tablets of I<u>sh</u>ráqát, Ṭarázát, Bi<u>sh</u>árát, Tajallíyát and Kalimát,<a data-fnid='20'></a> according to what is heard have been <span data-pg='26'></span> translated and printed in those regions. Hasten to become imbued with the qualifications and attributes set forth therein. </p>

 <p id='19.14'> And this letter <a data-fnid='21'></a> will close with reverential greetings, in the utmost kindness, from me to the beloved ones and to the maid-servants of the Merciful. </p>

<p id='20'> Thou hast written <a data-fnid='22'></a> concerning the Board of Consultation. It is very proper thou shouldst exert thyself with heart and soul so that this assembly shall become a source of merciful events, and enter the shadow of the protection and preservation of His Highness, the One God. The more this gains strength and becomes effective, the greater will become the penetration of the Word of God, and the more will the doors of confirmation be opened. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn22'> Extracts from a Tablet to Mírzá Asadu’lláh, at the time of the organization of the House of Justice, and the Assembly of Teaching of Chicago, in September, 1901. </aside>



 <p id='20.2'> As to the Assembly of Teaching, the revered members of which are the maid-servants of the Merciful, they are also assisted by the help and the providence of the Beauty of Abhá. They will soon discover that they are strengthened by the invisible hosts, and rendered successful by the abundant bounty of the Kingdom of the Forgiving Lord. They will set such a flame to the regions as will kindle the heart of the universe, and will cause the pillars of the world to tremble. But all of their mention and thought in their meeting should be confined to teaching the truth, and to <span data-pg='27'></span> constantly persuade people in pure and divine brilliancy and in absolute godlike spirituality. They should not interfere with the affairs which have regard to the Board of Consultation, because confusion of thought conduces to division and causes disturbance to the mind, and then pure spirituality would cease. But if all mentions are turned into one mention, and all thoughts concentrated in one point, then man will find (a higher) spirit, and witness ( a higher) confirmation. His power and penetration will increase, and his armies and hosts will gain successive victories. By this it is intended that the assembly of the maid-servants of the Merciful should be with pure spirituality and with absolute brilliancy, and become a torch of that blessed fire, a center of the merciful feelings. </p>

<p id='20.3'> The Assembly of Teaching is in this day of the first importance, and is promised to be assisted and protected through the assistance of His Highness, the One God. </p>

<p id='20.4'> Announce infinite glad-tidings to the revered maid-servants of God — the members of the merciful assembly, so that they may arise with the utmost tranquility (to further) prosperity and success, because ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is their strong and firm assistant through the help and the providence of the Lord of Hosts. </p>

<p id='20.5'> Concerning organizing Houses of Justice of men and Assemblies of Teaching of maid-servants of God, the more endeavor is made, the more agreeable it will be. It is very useful. Likewise, electing men and women teachers, and their traveling and journeying in all parts, and their going and coming in cities and villages, is greatly conducive to the solidity of the Cause. <span data-pg='28'></span> ... </p>

Know that, verily, this day is the day of teaching, this day is the day of diffusing the fragrances of God, being severed from aught else save God, attracted to the Word of God, and clinging to the Covenant of God. There is no work greater than this. Be ye entirely spiritual, purely brilliant, cut your dependence from any other mention, thought or purpose, and confine your mentions, thoughts and occupations to spreading the fragrances of God, and devote your attention to this great work. By God, the True One, verily, the Sun of Truth will cast forth its lights in your assemblies and will make you shining lamps, glittering stars, brilliant signs, and as souls attracted to the Holy Spirit. This is the great prosperity! This is the manifest light! </p>

<p id='21.4'> Upon you be greeting and Praise! </p>

O God, strengthen us through the fragrances of Thy sanctity, that we may become sanctified from the stain of egotism and lust, baptized with Thy Holy Spirit, with the fire of Thy love and the water of Thy bounty. </p>

Exert yourselves in (furthering) unison and harmony, in diffusing the fragrances of God, in preaching the Beauty of Abhá, and promoting the word of God.

 <p id='26' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye my divine friends! <a data-fnid='30'></a> </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn30'> Revealed in response to a supplication signed by 422 believers in America and sent July 4, 1905. </aside>



 <p id='26.2' class='dropcap'> At a time when the sea of tests had become tempestuous and the waves of calamity were heaving and the hosts of nations were in the utmost violence and the people of oppression dealt with infinite injustice, some of the calumniators, uniting with our unkind brother, wrote a letter replete with false accusations and engaged in seditions and calumnies. </p>

<p id='26.3'> They confused the mind of the government and agitated the state authorities. From this it is evident how a prisoner in this ruined walled city would fare and how the conditions are so full of perplexity and confusion as to baffle all description! Notwithstanding, this imprisoned exile is in the utmost firmness and calmness, trusts in His Highness the Peerless God, and wishes for every calamity and affliction in the path of the love of God! (To us) the arrow of oppression is a rich flow of divine bounty, and deadly poison is a swift-healing antidote. </p>

<p id='26.4'> We were in such a state when a letter came from the friends in America. The whole of its contents showed an agreement on their part to be in unity and harmony in all respects, and it was signed by all, determined to be self-sacrificing in the path of the love of God, in order thus to secure eternal life. </p>

<p id='26.5'> Upon perusing that letter and looking at the names signed to it, such a joy and gladness came over ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as is beyond description, and he thanked God that such friends are found in that country, who in utmost joy and fragrance are in union and accord and <span data-pg='36'></span> one in agreement with each other. The more this Covenant is strengthened, the happier, the better, the sweeter it will be and it will thus attract the divine confirmations. If the friends of God are wishing for confirmation in order to enjoy the friendship of the Supreme Concourse, they must exert themselves to confirm and strengthen this Covenant; for the making of a covenant, and an alliance for brotherhood and unity is like unto the irrigation of the tree of life which is conducive to eternal life! </p>

<p id='26.6'> Briefly, O ye friends of God! Make your feet firm, make a firm compact, and in union and accord endeavor to diffuse the fragrance of the love of God and to spread the divine teachings, in order that ye may impart life to the dead body of this world, and bestow a real healing on every one diseased (in soul). </p>

<p id='26.7'> O ye friends of God! The world is like the body of man — it hath become sick, feeble and infirm. Its eye is devoid of sight, its ear hath become destitute of hearing and its faculties of sense are entirely dissolved. The friends of God must become as wise physicians and care for and heal this sick person, in accord with the divine teachings, in order that — God willing — it may perchance gain health, find eternal healing and that its lost powers may be restored; and that the person of the world may find such health, freshness and purity that it will appear in the utmost beauty and charm. </p>

<p id='26.8'> The first remedy is to guide the people, so that they may turn unto God, hearken unto the divine commandments and go forth with hearing ear and seeing eye. After this swift and certain remedy hath been applied, then according to the divine teachings, they ought to <span data-pg='37'></span> be trained in the conduct, morals and deeds of the Supreme Concourse, encouraged and inspired with the gifts of the Kingdom of Abhá. The hearts should be purified and cleansed from every trace of hatred and rancor and enabled to engage in truthfulness, conciliation, uprightness and love toward the world of humanity; so that the East and West may embrace each other like unto two lovers, enmity and animosity may vanish from the human world and the universal peace be established! </p>

<p id='26.9'> O ye friends of God! Be kind to all people and nations, have love for all of them, exert yourselves to purify the hearts as much as you can, and bestow abundant effort in rejoicing the souls. Be ye a sprinkling of rain to every meadow and a water of life to every tree. Be ye as fragrant musk to every nostril and a soul-refreshing breeze to every invalid. Be ye salutary water to every thirsty one, a wise guide to every one led astray, an affectionate father or mother to every orphan, and, in the utmost joy and fragrance, a son or daughter to every one bent with age. Be ye a rich treasure to every indigent one; consider love and union as delectable paradise, and count annoyance and hostility as the torment of hell-fire. Exert with your soul; seek no rest in body; supplicate and beseech with your heart and search for divine assistance and favor, in order that ye may make this world the Paradise of Abhá and this terrestrial globe the arena of the Supreme Kingdom. If ye make an effort, it is certain that these lights will shine, this cloud of mercy shall rain, this soul-nourishing breeze shall waft, and the scent of this most fragrant musk be <span data-pg='38'></span> diffused. </p>

<p id='26.10'> O ye Friends of God! Be ye not concerned with the events transpiring at this Blessed Spot, and give no thought thereto. Whatever may happen is good, for calamities are bestowal itself, hardship is the reality of mercy, discomposure of mind, and sacrifice of like is a manifest gift. Whatever may happen is a bounty of God, the Most High. Be ye engaged in your own affairs; be employed in guiding the people; train the souls in the qualities and nature of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and convey the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of Abhá to the people. Do not seek rest during the night and day and sit not tranquil for a minute. Bring these glad-tidings to the hearing of mankind with the utmost exertion, and accept every calamity and affliction in your love for God and reliance on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Endure the censure of enemies and bear the reproaches of the people of oppression with patience. Follow the example of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and at every moment wish to offer yourselves in the path of the Beauty of Abhá. Shine ye like unto the sun and roar and move like unto the sea; impart life to mountain and desert like unto clouds, and similar to the vernal breeze, bestow freshness, grace and elegance on the trees of human temples. </p>

<p id='27.4'> I desire for you all that you will have this great assistance and partake of this great bounty, and that in spirit and heart you will strive and endeavor until the world of war become the world of peace; the world of darkness the world of light; satanic conduct be turned into heavenly behavior; the ruined places become built up; the sword be turned into the olive branch; the flash of hatred become the flame of the love of God and the noise of the gun the voice of the Kingdom; the soldiers of death the soldiers of life; all the nations of the world one nation; all races as one <span data-pg='40'></span> race; and all national anthems harmonized into one melody. </p>

<p id='27.5'> Then this material realm will be Paradise, the earth Heaven, and the world of Satan become the world of Angels. </p>

 <p id='28' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O ye Cohorts of God!  <a data-fnid='32'></a></p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn32'> Revealed in response to a supplication signed by 489 believers in America during the period of the 19-day fast in 1906. </aside>



 <p id='28.2' class='dropcap'> A letter which was signed by you in general was received. Its content was of the utmost beauty, sweetness, eloquence and perfection. While reading it the utmost happiness was produced. It spoke of fasting during the month of the Fast. Happy is your condition for you have executed the divine command; and have arisen to fast in these blessed days. For this physical fasting is a symbol of the spiritual fasting, that is, abstaining from all carnal desires, becoming characterized with the attributes of the spiritual ones, attracted to the heavenly fragrances and enkindled with the fire of the love of God. </p>

<p id='28.3'> Likewise your letter was an evidence of the union and affinity of the hearts. I hope that through the bounty and favors of the Most Glorious Lord, in this new age, the regions of the West become the East of the Sun of Truth, the believers of God become the dawning-places of lights, the manifestors of the signs, be protected and guarded from the doubts of the heedless ones, remain firm and steadfast in the Covenant and Testament, and strive day and night in order to awaken those who are asleep, to make mindful those who are heedless, to make confident of the mysteries of the Kingdom those who are deprived, to confer a <span data-pg='41'></span> share from the never-ending outpouring upon those who are helpless, to become the heralds of the Kingdom and to call the inhabitants of this terrestrial world to the Celestial Realm. </p>

<p id='28.4'> O ye Cohorts of God! Today in the present world each community is wandering in a wilderness, moving in accord with some passion and desire, and running to and fro in pursuance of his own imagination. Among the communities of the world, this community of the “Most Great Name” is free from every thought, keeping aloof from every project and scheme, arising with the purest designs and intentions, and striving and endeavoring with the utmost hope to live in accordance with the divine teachings in order that the surface of the earth become the delectable paradise, the nether world become the mirror of the Kingdom, the universe become another universe, and the human race attain to higher morals, conduct and manners. </p>

<p id='28.5'> O ye Cohorts of God! Through the protection and help of the Blessed Perfection — may my life be a sacrifice to His beloved ones! — you must conduct and deport yourselves in such a manner that you may stand out among other souls distinguished by a brilliancy like unto the sun. If any one of you enters a city he must become the center of attraction because of the sincerity, faithfulness, love, honesty, fidelity, truthfulness and loving-kindness of his disposition and nature toward all inhabitants of the world, that the people of the city may all cry out: “This person is unquestionably a Bahá’í; for this manners, his behavior, his conduct, his morals, his nature and his disposition are of the attributes of the Bahá’ís.” Until you do attain to this <span data-pg='42'></span> station, you have not fulfilled the Covenant and the Testament of God. For according to the irrefutable texts, He has taken from us a firm covenant that we may live and act in accord with the divine exhortations, commands and lordly teachings. </p>

<p id='28.6'> O ye Cohorts of God! Now is the time when the signs and the perfections of the “Most Great Name” become manifest and clear in this golden cycle in order that it may become demonstrated and established beyond doubt that this period is the period of the Blessed Perfection, and this cycle is distinguished from all other cycles and epochs. </p>

<p id='28.7'> O Ye Cohorts of God! If you observe that a soul has turned his face completely toward the Cause of God, his intention is centralized upon the penetration of the Word of God, he is serving the Cause day and night with utmost fidelity, no scent of selfishness is inhaled from his manners and deeds, and no trace of egotism or prejudice is seen in his personality — nay rather is he a wanderer in the wilderness of the love of God, and one intoxicated with the wine of the knowledge of God, occupied wholly with the diffusion of the fragrances of God, and attracted to the signs of the Kingdom of God; know ye of a certainty that he is confirmed with the powers of the Kingdom, assisted by the heaven of Might; and he will shine, gleam, and sparkle like unto the morning star with the utmost brilliancy and splendor from the horizon of the everlasting gift. If he is alloyed with the slightest trace of passion, desire, ostentation or self-interest, it is certain that the results of all efforts will prove fruitless, and he will become deprived and <span data-pg='43'></span> hopeless. </p>

<p id='28.8'> O ye Cohorts of God! Praise be to God! — that the Blessed Perfection hath freed the necks from the bonds and fetters and released all from the racial attachments by proclaiming, “Ye are all the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch.” Be ye kind to the human world, and be ye compassionate to the race of man, deal with the strangers as you deal with the friends, be ye gentle toward the outsiders as you are toward the beloved ones, know the enemy as the friend, look upon the satan as upon the angel, receive the unjust with the utmost love like unto a faithful one, and diffuse far and wide the fragrances of the musk of the gazelles of Kheta and Khotan <a data-fnid='33'></a> to the nostrils of the ravenous wolves. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn33'> Kheta and Khotan are two cities in China celebrated for having large numbers of musk-producing animals. The reference here symbolizes the severed and detached believers who are diffusing the fragrance of the Word of God. </aside>



 <p id='28.9'> Become ye a shelter and asylum to the fearful ones, be ye a cause of tranquillity and ease to the souls and hearts of the agitated ones, impart ye strength to the helpless ones, become ye a treasury of wealth to the indigent ones, be ye a remedy and antidote to the afflicted ones, and a physician and nurse to the sick ones. Serve ye for the promotion of peace and concord and establish in this transitory world the foundation of friendship, fidelity, reconciliation and truthfulness. </p>

<p id='28.10'> O ye Cohorts of God! Strive ye that this human world may be changed into a luminous realm and this mound of earth become the Paradise of Abhá. Darkness hath environed the world upon all sides. Savage tempers and inclination predominate. The human world has become the battlefield of the rapacious savages <span data-pg='44'></span> and the arena of the heedless and ignorant ones. The souls are either bloodthirsty wolves or beasts with degenerate reason. They are either deadly poison, or worthless plants. There are a few souls who in reality have some humanitarian intentions and are thinking of the well-being and prosperity of human kind. You must in this instance (that is, service to humanity) sacrifice your lives, and in sacrificing your lives celebrate happiness and beatitude. </p>

<p id='28.11'> O ye Cohorts of God! His Highness, the Supreme <a data-fnid='34'></a> — may my life be a sacrifice to Him! — hath given up His life, and at every moment the Blessed Perfection <a data-fnid='35'></a> in His own life sacrificed hundreds of lives, endured dire calamities and oppressions. Laden with fetters He was thrown into the dark dungeon, He was exiled and banished to distant lands and finally passed His days in the Most Great Prison.<a data-fnid='36'></a> Likewise a multitude of friends drank the sweet chalice of martyrdom and sacrificed soul, possession, family and relatives for the Cause. How many houses were overthrown! How many residences were pillaged and rapined! How many buildings were razed to the foundation and how many magnificent palaces were turned into a desolate tomb! All these phenomena transpired only that the world of humanity may become a luminous realm; ignorance be changed into wisdom, human souls become merciful, warfare and bloodshed be destroyed to their very foundation, and the Kingdom of Peace become paramount over all men. Now strive ye, that perchance this Beloved of Hopes appear in the assemblage of the world and this Providence become a <span data-pg='45'></span> realized fact. </p>

 <p id='28.12'> O ye Cohorts of God! Beware lest ye offend the feelings of anyone, or sadden the heart of any person, or move the tongue in reproach of and finding fault with anybody, whether he is friend or stranger, believer or enemy. Pray in behalf of all and entreat God for forgiveness and bounty for all. Beware, beware that any soul take revenge or retaliate over another even if he be a bloodthirsty enemy. Beware, beware that any one rebuke or reproach a soul, though he may be an ill-wisher and an ill-doer. Do ye not look upon the creature, advance ye toward the Creator. Behold ye not the rebellious people, turn your faces toward the Lord of Hosts. Look ye not upon the ground, raise your eyes to the world-illuminating Sun, which hath transformed every atom of the gloomy soil into bright and luminous substance. </p>

<p id='28.13'> O ye Cohorts of God! In the moment of catastrophe, find ye patience, resignation and submission. </p>

<p id='28.14'> The more the calamities are intensified the less become ye disturbed. Withstand ye, with perfect assurance, the flood of trials and calamities, through the power of His Highness, the Almighty. </p>

<p id='28.15'> Last year some of the known and unknown, friends and strangers, slandered, calumniated and presented false accusations against these exiled ones, before the throne of His Imperial Majesty, the Padeshah of the Ottomans; while these oppressed ones were entirely free from those calumnies. The government, conformable with prudent measures, arose to investigate these calumnies and dispatched some commissioners (or examiners) to this city. Therefore it is evident that the field which was found by the ill-wishers and the flood <span data-pg='46'></span> which was brought about by them, can neither be written nor explained. However, relying upon God, we conducted ourselves with the utmost patience and submission, resignation and calmness; so much that if one did not know anything about these matters, he would have thought that we were in perfect ease of soul, enjoying the tranquility of heart mind, and were engaged in happiness and felicity. The matters reached to such an issue that the plaintiffs and calumniators entered into alliance and intrigue with the officials, in regard to the carrying out of the work of investigation. Consequently, the plaintiff, the magistrate and the witness became as one single soul. Therefore it is clear what things transpired! But here one witnesses the fairness and impartiality of His Imperial Majesty, the Padeshah of the Ottomans, who so far has not given any consideration to these slanders, statements, stories and calumnies, but has dealt with the utmost justice and equity. Truly, I say, if there had been any other person except this Padeshah, no trace of these exiled ones would remain. This is the truth! We must not overlook justice. In reality today in the Asiatic world, the Padi<u>sh</u>áh of the Ottoman Empire and the <u>Sh</u>áh of Persia, Muẓaffar-i-Dín, are peerless and have no equals. If you could realize the degree of the malignity of the enemies, and the wickedness and mischief done by the ill-wishers, especially by the unkind brother, both here and in Persia, and that notwithstanding these seditions and villainies, these two kings have treated us with tranquillity and mildness, ye would undoubtedly feel sure that both are just. If they were like kings of bygone ages, unquestionably <span data-pg='47'></span> every day thousands of souls would have been deprived of life in Persia. Therefore pray ye earnestly in behalf of these two kings, beseech for them protection and confirmation in the threshold of the Almighty, and ask for them, from God, victory and triumph; especially for the Padeshah of the Ottoman Empire, who has dealt at all times in justice with these exiled ones. </p>

<p id='28.16'> O Thou Omnipotent God! Perfume the nostrils of the friends in the Occident with the breaths of the Holy Spirit; and illumine the horizon of the West with the light of guidance. Make the remote ones the near ones, change the strangers into compassionate friends, awaken those who are asleep, and make heedful those who are heedless. </p>

<p id='28.17'> O Thou Glorious Lord! Confirm and assist these noble friends with Thy good pleasure, suffer them to become the well-wishers of the known and unknown, enter them in the world of the everlasting Kingdom, confer upon them a share from the outpouring of the Realm of Might, make them real Bahá’ís and sincere godly ones, deliver them from superficiality and establish them in Truth, make them the signs of the Kingdom and brilliant stars in the horizon of the world, make them the cause of the prosperity and composure of the world of humanity and the servants of the universal peace, intoxicate all of them with the wine of Thy commands and exhortations and grant to all good morals and conduct in the path of Thy teachings. </p>

<p id='28.18'> O my God! The desire of this Servant of the Threshold is to see that the friends of the West have embraced the beloved of the East, and the individuals <span data-pg='48'></span> of the world of humanity are with the utmost kindness the members of one assemblage, the drops of one ocean, the birds of one rose-garden, the pearls of one sea, the leaves of one tree and the rays of one sun. </p>

 <p id='43' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art uttering the praise of God! </p>

<p id='43.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read thy letter, which expressed thy surprise at some of the commandments of the law of God, such as that concerning hunting of innocent animals. Be not surprised at this. Ponder over the contingent realities, their mysteries, wisdom, connection and relations. The world is harmonious in all things and the connection therein is mighty and nothing is missing. All things are eaters and eaten in the physical creation. The plant sucks from the mineral, the animal eats and swallows the plant, and human eats the animal. Then the mineral (in turn) eats the human body. Physical bodies are transferred from death to death and life to life. Therefore, all things are subject to transfer and change except the Cause of existence, which cannot be changed or transferred, because it is the foundation for life in all kinds and species and in all possible realities in the world of creation. </p>

<p id='43.3'> If thou observest closely through a microscope the water which man drinks and the air which he breathes, thou wilt see that in every breath which man breathes, that breath contains numerous animals, and in every draught of water great numbers of animals exist. This could not be prevented because the existent beings are eaters and eaten and, by this, existence is caused; otherwise, <span data-pg='56'></span> the relations between existent things would cease. When a thing decomposes and decays, being bereft of life, it becomes promoted to a world of life greater than the former. For instance, it ceased in a mineral life and was promoted to the vegetable life; then leaves the vegetable life and is elevated to that of the animal; then leaving the animal life it advances to the human, and this is on account of the favor of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement. </p>

<p id='43.4'> I ask God to strengthen thee in comprehending the mysteries deposited in the reality of existence, to lift up the veil from before thee and thy sister, so that the concealed mystery and the hidden reality become manifest as the sun at noon, and to confirm thy sister and thy husband in entering the Kingdom of God, and heal thee from all physical and spiritual disease in the world of creation. </p>

<p id='95.3'> How many souls advanced unto God, entered the shadow of the Word of God and became celebrated in the world, as Judas Iscariot. Then, when the tests became severe and trials great, their feet turned from the path; turned from confession to denial; changed from love and affection to severe enmity. Then the power of tests, whereby the foundations shake, were manifested. </p>

<p id='95.4'> Judas Iscariot was one of the greatest disciples, was called unto Jesus; he thought that Jesus increased his kindness to Peter, the disciple, when saying to him: “Thou art Peter; upon thee I shall build my church.” This speech affecting Peter with special impression whereby envy was created in the heart of Judas and, therefore, he turned after advancing, denied after confessing, hated after loving, until he became the cause of the crucifixion of the Glorious Lord and Manifest Light. This is the end of envy which causes people to turn from the right path. Such has taken place and will occur in this Great Cause; but there is no harm in it, as it is the cause of manifesting the firmness of the rest and the arising of the firm souls who are as solid as the lofty mountains in the love of the Manifest Light. </p>

<p id='95.5'> As to thee, convey unto the maid-servants of the Merciful that they must be firm in the love of El-Bahá at the time of the severe trials and tests; for as much as the storms and winds occur during the winter seasons; <span data-pg='89'></span> then comes the spring with the wonderful scenery and it adorns the hills and plains with flowers and beautiful birds sing the melodies of joy on the branches of the trees and warble beautiful tunes on the roofs of bowers, in wonderful melodies.

Then shalt thou see the waverers frightened and at loss. This is a complete matter on the part of the Lord of Signs. </p>

<p id='95.6'> Blessed art thou for keeping firm in the Cause of God. I pray God to give thee a divine spirit, spiritual blood and to make thee a growing and thriving leaf on the Tree of Life, so that thou mayest serve the maid-servants of God in fragrance and spirituality. </p>

<p id='95.7'> Thy generous Lord will confirm thee in serving in His great vineyard and will make thee an instrument for spreading the spirit of concord and union among the maid-servants of the Merciful, will open thine insight by the light of knowledge and forgive thee thy sins and change them to good deeds.

<p id='96.3'> Commit thyself to God; give up thy will and choose <span data-pg='90'></span> that of God; abandon thy desire and lay hold on that of God; that thou mayest be a holy, spiritual and heavenly example among the maid-servants of God. </p>

<p id='96.4'> O maid-servant of God! Know thou that in the sight of God, the conduct of women is the same as that of men. All are the creatures of God and He has created them after His form and likeness; that is to say, after the form and likeness of the Manifestations of His names and His attributes. >From the spiritual point of view, therefore, there is no difference between women and men. “The nearer we draw to God, the nearer He comes to us” without regard to whether the person be a man or a woman. How many women, thus drawn to God, have surpassed men in the shadow of Bahá in bringing men under it — women famous throughout the world! </p>

<p id='96.5'> The House of Justice, however, according to the positive commandments of the Doctrine of God, has been specialized to the men, for a (specific) reason or exercise of wisdom on the part of God, and this reason will presently appear, even as the sun at midday. </p>

<p id='96.6'> And as to you — you other maid-servants attracted by the perfume of God — establish spiritual gatherings (assemblies) and heavenly meetings. This work is the beginning of the diffusing of the perfume of God and the foundation of the elevating of the Word of God and the making known of the commandments of God. Is there a blessing greater than this? These spiritual gatherings (assemblies) are sustained (reinforced) by the Spirit of God, and their protector is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who spreads his wings (over) above them. Is there a blessing greater than this? These <span data-pg='91'></span> spiritual gatherings (assemblies) are glowing lamps and heavenly gardens which cast the light of knowledge upon the contingent world and cause the spirit of life to penetrate to every quarter.

 <p id='98' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who dear maid-servant of God! </p>

<p id='98.2' class='dropcap'> Thank God that thou hast come near unto the Holy Threshold and art dear in the Kingdom of His Glory. Thou art president of an assembly which is a type of the assemblages of the Supreme Concourse and a reflection of the semblances of the Kingdom of God. With heart and soul, with entire devotion, supplication, humbleness and submissiveness, endeavor to promulgate the law of God and strive to diffuse the fragrances <span data-pg='92'></span> of God. Exert yourself to become the real president of assemblies of spiritual ones and a companion of the Kingdom of the Merciful. </p>

<p id='98.3'> Thou hast asked in regard to the 10th verse of the 21st chapter of Revelation and to the 17th verse: </p>

<p id='98.4'> Know that the firmament of the bright sun of the world of possibilities is divided into twelve sections, according to mathematical principles, which are called the twelve constellations; likewise, the Sun of Truth manifests and pours forth His bounty in twelve constellations of holiness. By these constellations are meant holy souls who are the manifestations of purity and the dawning-points of the lights of Unity. Observe that in the day of His Holiness the Speaker of God (Moses), there were twelve holy souls who were the leaders of the Truth. In like manner, in the cycle of His Holiness the Spirit (Jesus Christ), note that there were twelve apostles under the shadow of the light of the Most High, and the Sun of Truth was manifested through those bright dawning-places like unto the phenomenal sun. Likewise, in the time of His Holiness Muḥammad, consider that there were twelve dawning points of holiness who were the manifestations of confirmation. Such is the case. </p>

<p id='98.5'> Accordingly, St. John, the divine, declared in his vision regarding the twelve doors and the twelve foundations. By the great and holy city of Jerusalem, which is descended from heaven, is meant the sacred law of God. This subject has been repeatedly explained in many Tablets and in the Scriptures of the ancient prophets. For example, it is said in one place: “I beheld Jerusalem marching on to the wilderness.” The purport <span data-pg='93'></span> is that this Heavenly Jerusalem has twelve doors through which the advancing souls enter into the City of God. These doors are the souls who are the stars of guidance and doors unto bounty and knowledge. “At the gates twelve angels stood.” By “angel” is meant the power of the confirmation of God; that the candle of the power of the divine confirmation shines forth and is illumined in those souls. That is to say, that each one of those souls will be confirmed by the mightiest power. Those twelve gates surround the whole universe. This signifies that all existence is under the shadow of those souls; also, that these doors are the foundation of the city of God, the divine Jerusalem; that upon each of the foundations the name of one of the Apostles of His Holiness the Spirit <a data-fnid='56'></a> is written. That is to say, the manifestation of the perfections, glad-tidings, virtues and high attributes of that holy soul. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn56'> Christ. </aside>



 <p id='98.6'> In brief, it is said that: “And he that talked with me had a golden rod to measure the city and the gates thereof and the walls thereof.” The purport is this, that certain souls guided (people) with a rod of the plant, that is, a reed wherewith he shepherded the sheep, like unto the rod of Moses; others trained (the people) with a rod of iron and drove them, as in the time of Muḥammad (The scepter of Muḥammad was the sword). In this Greatest Day the rod of the plant and the rod of iron are changed into a rod which is of pure gold and is from the end <span data-pg='94'></span> trained. Observe the difference: In a certain time the teachings of God were like unto the twigs of a tree and by them the signs of God were spread, the law of God promulgated and the religion of God founded. Later a time came when the rod of the divine Shepherd was like iron, and now in this blessed and glorious cycle that rod is become like unto pure gold. What a great difference exists between them! Therefore know that the law of God and the divine teachings prove a great advance in this day. They have reached a degree of supremacy, compared with former ages. Nay, rather, this is pure gold, while that was iron and wood. </p>

<p id='98.7'> This answer was written briefly because there was no more time. You will certainly excuse. The maid-servants of God must reach a station wherein they themselves shall comprehend the realities and meanings, to give clear explanations for each word and the fountains of wisdom gush forth from the reality of their hearts like a full flowing stream. </p>

Therefore, turn unto thy Supreme Lord and say: </p>

<p id='99.4'> O my God! O my God! This Thy maid-servant supplicates to Thee, trusts in Thee and directs herself unto Thee, asking Thee to shed Thy divine mercies upon her, to manifest Thy spiritual mysteries and to show forth Thy majesty unto her. O Lord! O Lord! Illumine the sight of my husband, cheer his breast by the light of knowing Thee, attract his heart unto Thy manifest Beauty and gladden his spirit by the manifestation of Thy radiant light. O Lord! Withdraw the veil from his sight, grant him Thy compassion, exhilarate him with the wine of Thy love among the people, make him an angel of Thine walking upon the earth, let his spirit soar unto heaven and make him a lamp glistening with the light of Thy knowledge in the community. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Precious, the Bestower! </p>

 <p id='108' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art advancing to the Kingdom of God! </p>

<p id='108.2' class='dropcap'> I have considered thy writing, which indicates brightness of heart and the love of God. Blessed art thou for having been thus favored and for having attained to guidance. </p>

<p id='108.3'> You have asked me two questions: “That if the same spirit is manifest in all the Manifestations and Prophets, then what is the distinction or difference between Christ (or rather Jesus) and the other Prophets; also [what is the difference] between Father and Son?” </p>

<p id='108.4'> Know that the human spirit is one, but it manifests <span data-pg='103'></span> itself in various members of the body in a certain (measure or) form. The human spirit is existent in the sight (eyes); it is also existent in the brain, which is the location of great functions and powers; it is also existent in the heart, which organ is largely connected with the brain or the center of the mind, and the heart, or that the center which is connected with the brain, has a distinct and separate function, effect and appearance. In this connection, the hair and the nails have no command (or direct feeling). </p>

<p id='108.5'> Figuratively speaking, the Father is the center of the brain and the Son is the center of the heart; the rest of the Prophets are members and parts. Fatherhood and Prophethood, in this case, are two expressions of the same thing, as man and creature are two names of the same reality. The word “man,” however, is greater than the word “creature” because it bears a weightier meaning than the name “creature”; both are the same. </p>

<p id='108.6'> O maid-servant of God! I pray God to confirm thee forever anew. Give greeting to thy dear mother. Superstition hath somewhat overcome her. When the imagined Satan overpowers, let her say: “Yá-Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” She should then turn to the highest Kingdom. Thus will the imagined Satan leave her. [She] has a form of obsession; therefore, you may not heed her sayings. </p>

<p id='108.7'> Cultivate the land and thus, through its fruits, you will obtain benefits. God will relieve you from care (on account) of your mother. </p>

<p id='108.8'> Give your good husband my spiritual greeting. I pray that he may be made a recipient of the divine bounties and attain to the grace <span data-pg='104'></span> of God. </p>

<p id='113.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, I read thy letter and I besought God to cause thee to promulgate His divine Manifestation, to be rejoiced at the bounty of His Kingdom, to adhere to His Testament, to hold fast to the hem of the robe of His grandeur, to exert thyself in His Cause, to desire the unity of His dearly beloved ones, and the harmony amongst His chosen ones and to endeavor to remove the doubts which are being emanated from deceitful souls. </p>

<p id='113.3'> By the might of my Lord, verily, the Lord will assist only those who will remain firm in His Cause, and desire union, love, humility and submissiveness, and to become separated from aught else save God.

<p id='113.4'> Exert thyself with all thy heart and soul and with all strength, so that thou mayest become a sign of firmness and as a banner of the Word of God which may wave on every lofty edifice through the favor of thy Glorious Lord. </p>

<p id='113.5'> As to thy question concerning the 12th chapter of Ecclesiastes: This is prophecy regarding the coming of Jesus in that book, the signs and marks of which were fulfilled with the appearance of the Promised One of the Bible <a data-fnid='61'></a>; but since the Jews did not understand the meaning thereof, so they denied Jesus and — <span data-pg='107'></span> God forbid! — said that He was the deformed (Antichrist). Then it is said by Jesus in the Gospel, that similar signs would appear in the “last day” — or in other words — in the day when Christ will come the second time in this world. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn61'> “Bible” signifies the Old Testament; “Gospel” signifies the New Testament. </aside>



 <p id='113.6'> The interpretation of these statements is mentioned in the clearest manner and with the most wonderful proofs in the Book of Íqán.<a data-fnid='62'></a> His honor, ‘Ali Kuli Khan, has already translated this Book which will soon be published in America.<a data-fnid='63'></a> Then you will be informed of the explanation and interpretation of these verses and statements as elucidated by the Blessed Perfection. Therefore my interpretation is not necessary. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn62'> During the time of Bahá’u’lláh’s residence in Baghdád (the Dwelling of Peace), men of learning, including Jews, Christians and Muḥammadans, visited Him seeking answer to religious and scriptural questions. Such answer He gave in the Book of Íqán, otherwise known as the Book of Explanations and Assurance. It concerns the Reality and Authority of the human Divine “Manifestations.” </aside>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn63'> The book was published in 1904. </aside>



 <p id='113.7'> As to thy question concerning the 54th chapter of Isaiah: This chapter refers to the Exalted Leaf, the mother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. As a proof to this it is said: “For more are the children of the desolate, than the children of the married wife.” Reflect upon this statement and then upon the following: ‘And thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.” And truly the humiliation and reproach which she suffered in the path of God is a fact which no one can refute. For the calamities and afflictions mentioned in the whole chapter are such afflictions which she suffered in the path of God, all of which she endured with patience and thanked God therefor and praised Him, because He had enabled her to endure afflictions for the sake of Bahá. During <span data-pg='108'></span> all this time, the men and women (nakazeen) persecuted her in an incomparable manner, while she was patient, God-fearing, calm, humble and contented through the favor of her Lord and by the bounty of her Creator. </p>

<p id='113.8'> As to thee — O thou who art confessing the Oneness of God! — rise with all thy power to keep firm in the Testament of God, and firmly believe that, verily, all troops are defeated save those of the Testament and all banners are reversed, save that of the Covenant of God, which will wave over all horizons and will overshadow the hosts of spirit, love and peace, while agitated by the breeze of the favor of God. Be thou of the number of this great host and among the vanguard of this great and powerful army. </p>

<p id='116.3'> Consider how there are thousands of heedless souls who are asleep, while there is one who is conscious and awake! Even a His Holiness Christ has said, the friends of God are the salt of the earth, and the salt is but a little part of the whole. Undoubtedly the friends of God have been endowed with ability and capacity, on which account they became of the “chosen” and not of the “called.” </p>

A prisoner who is awake and conscious will certainly seek for freedom, and mindful bird will certainly wish for deliverance from the cage. When the heart becometh free from attachment unto this world, it will crave for the world of the Kingdom and seek for eternal life. </p>

 <p id='124' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O visitant to the Resort of spirits (who are) sincere in the Religion of God!  <a data-fnid='65'></a></p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn65'> ‘Akká, Syria — the Holy Land. </aside>



 <p id='124.2' class='dropcap'> Blessed is the mother who bore thee and the breast whose milk suckled thee and the bosom wherein thou <span data-pg='115'></span> wert nurtured, because thou hast apprehended the Day of the Lord, hast prepared thyself to enter in unto His kingdom, hast set thy face singly toward His Gracious Countenance, hast believed in the Manifest Light, hast rejoiced in the Abundant Grace, hast responded to the Voice of thy Lord with a sincere and beating heart and hast presented thyself from those regions at the Glorious Threshold and hast marked thy forehead with pure, holy, fragrant Tomb,<a data-fnid='66'></a> the breaths of whose sanctity are spread abroad throughout the lands as fragrant musk is diffused unto the distant place! Then thank thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement, for this great salvation (or fruition, achievement, or attainment) and exceeding grace! </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn66'> The Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh. </aside>



 <p id='124.3'> Now as to what thou askest concerning the spirit and its “return” to this world of humanity and this elemental space: Know that spirit in general is divided into five sorts — the vegetable spirit, the animal spirit, the human spirit, the spirit of faith, and the divine spirit of sanctity. </p>

<p id='124.4'> The vegetable spirit is the virtue augmentative, or growing or vegetative faculty, which results from the admixture of the simple elements, with the co-operation of water, air and heat. </p>

<p id='124.5'> The animal spirit is the virtue perceptive resulting from the admixture and absorption of the vital elements generated in the heart, which apprehend sense-impressions. </p>

<p id='124.6'> The human spirit consists of the rational, or logical, reasoning faculty, which apprehends general ideas and things intelligible and <span data-pg='116'></span> perceptible. </p>

<p id='124.7'> Now these “spirits” are not reckoned as Spirit in the terminology of the Scriptures and the usage of the people of the Truth, inasmuch as the laws governing them are as the laws which govern all phenomenal being (i.e., all existences belonging to the phenomenal or material universe, called “the world of generation and corruption”), in respect to generation, corruption, production, change and reversion, as is clearly indicated in the Gospel where it says: “Let the dead bury their dead;” “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit”; inasmuch as he who would bury these dead was alive with the vegetative, animal and rational human soul, yet did Christ — to whom be glory! — declare such dead and devoid of life, in that this person was devoid of the Spirit of Faith, which is the Kingdom of God. </p>

<p id='124.8'> In brief, for these three spirits there is no restitution or “return,” but they are subordinate to reversions and production and corruption. </p>

<p id='124.9'> But the Spirit of Faith which is of the Kingdom (of God) consists of the all-comprehending Grace and the perfect attainment (or salvation, fruition, achievement) and the power of sanctity and the divine effulgence from the Sun of Truth on luminous light-seeking essences from the presence of the divine Unity. And by this Spirit is the life of the spirit of man, when it is fortified thereby, as Christ saith: “That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.” And this Spirit hath both restitution and return, inasmuch as it consists of the Light of God and the unconditioned Grace. So, having regard to this state and station, Christ announced that John the Baptist was Elias, who was to come before <span data-pg='117'></span> Christ (Matt. 11:14). And the likeness of this station is as that of lamps kindled (from one another): for these in respect to their glasses and oil-holders, are different, but in respect to their light, One, and in respect to their illumination, One; nay, each one is identical with the other, without imputation of plurality, or diversity or multiplicity or separateness. This is the Truth and beyond the Truth there is only error. </p>

<p id='124.10'> But as to the question of the Trinity, know, O advancer unto God, that in each one of the cycles wherein the Lights have shone forth upon the horizons (i. e., in each prophetic dispensation) and the Forgiving Lord hath revealed Himself on Mount Párán (see Habbakkuk 3:3, etc.) or Mount Sinai, or Mount Seir (see Ezekiel 35), there are necessarily three things: The Giver of Grace, and the Grace, and the Recipient of the Grace; the Source of the Effulgence, and the Effulgence, and the Recipient of the Effulgence; the Illuminator, and the Illumination, and Illuminated. Look at the Mosaic cycle: The Lord, and Moses, and the Fire (i.e., the burning bush), the Intermediary; and [at] the Messianic cycle: The Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost the Intermediary; and in the Muḥammadan cycle: The Lord, the Apostle (or Messenger, Muḥammad), and Gabriel (for, as the Muḥammadans believe, Gabriel brought the Revelation from God to Muḥammad). Look at the sun and its rays and the heat which results from its rays; the rays and the heat are but two effects of the sun, but inseparable from it; yet the sun is one in its essence, unique in its real identity, single in its attributes, neither is it possible that anything should <span data-pg='118'></span> resemble it. Such is the essence of the Truth concerning the Unity, the real doctrine of Singularity, the undiluted reality as to the (Divine) Sanctity. </p>

<p id='124.11'> But as to the question concerning the atonement on the part of the Holy Redeemer, I have explained this to thee by word of mouth in a plain and detailed manner, devoid of ambiguities, and I have made it clear to thee as the sun at noonday. </p>

<p id='124.12'> And I ask God to open unto thee the gates, that thou mayest thyself apprehend the true meanings of these mysteries. Verily, He is the Confirmer, the Beneficent, the Merciful! </p>

<p id='133.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read thy new letter and was informed of its meanings, which proved thy lowliness to thy Glorious Lord. </p>

<p id='133.3'> Verily we promised thee, by the favor of thy Lord, last year, that thy Lord would grant thee “sight of eyes” (i. e., a son), a blessed birth. Thanks and praise be unto God for that He granted thee a good descendant and dilated thy breast by this great bounty. It is incumbent on thee to offer many thanks to the Merciful Lord for this great favor in the world of humanity. Verily I implore unto God to make him a <span data-pg='123'></span> sign of His Kingdom, illuminated, spiritual and godlike among the children. </p>

  </div>

 <p id='136' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='136.2' class='dropcap'> I have seen the letter which thou hast written to Mr. ______. The opinion (expressed therein) was very agreeable. The spiritual Meeting of Consultation of New York must be in the utmost union and harmony with the Spiritual Meeting of Consultation of Chicago, and that which they deem advisable to publish, these two Meetings of Consultation must unitedly approve of it and deem its publication advisable. Then the Meeting of Consultation must send one copy thereof to ‘Akká, in order that it may be also approved of here and then returned, and that then it may be printed and published. </p>

<p id='136.3'> That the two Spiritual Meetings of Chicago and New York must be in unity and harmony is very important, and when a Spiritual Meeting may be also organized in Washington in a befitting manner, these two meetings (of Chicago and New York) must be also in unity and harmony with that meeting. </p>

<p id='136.4'> To be brief, it hath been decided by the Desire of <span data-pg='125'></span> God that union and harmony may day by day increase among the friends of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful One, in the West. Not until this is realized will the affairs advance by any means whatever! And the greatest means for the union and harmony of all is Spiritual Meetings. This matter is very important and is as a magnet (to attract or) for divine confirmation. If the beauty of this Divine Beloved One — that is, unity of believers — does appear in the ornament of the Kingdom of Abhá, it is certain that those countries will, in a short time, become the Paradise of Abhá and the light of Unity (or Oneness) and Singleness will shine upon the whole world from the West. We <a data-fnid='68'></a> are endeavoring with all heart and soul, have no rest night and day, nor a moment of tranquility, so that we may make the world of humanity the mirror of the divine unity; how much more the beloved of God! And this wish and hope shall appear and shine forth at that time when the true friends of God may arise and act in accord with the teachings of the Beauty of Abhá — may my life be a sacrifice to His beloved ones! One of the teachings is that love and faithfulness must prevail in the hearts that men may see the stranger as a friend, the sinner as an intimate fellow, may count enemies as allies, regard foes as loving comrades, call their executioner the giver of life, consider the denier as a believer and the unbeliever as a faithful one — that is, men must behave in such a manner as may befit the believers, the faithful, the friend and the confidant. If this lamp may shine in a befitting manner in the assemblage of the world you <span data-pg='126'></span> will find that the regions will become fragrant and the world become a delectable paradise, the surface of the earth will become an excellent garden, the world will become as one home, the different nations will become as one kind, and the peoples and nationalities of the East and West will become as one household. I hope such a day may come and such lights may dawn and such a Countenance may appear in the utmost beauty. </p>

 <p id='154' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O maid-servant of God! </p>

<p id='154.2' class='dropcap'> Thy letter was understood. Thou hast asked, very humbly, for certain things and all were worthy to be coveted. Thou desirest forgiveness of sins; didst ask for great unity and peace; sought nearness to the Threshold of God; hoped to be detached from thine own will, seeking the will of God; prayed for rescue from self-love (or selfishness); hoped for progress in <span data-pg='136'></span> the station of knowledge; desired to serve God; and prayed that thy honorable husband and thy children may be set aglow with the fire of the love of God and may manifest light on their brows through the radiance of the knowledge of God. All these wishes are well worthy of asking. <i>Especially the rescue from self-love</i>. This is a strange trait and the means of the destruction of many important souls in the world. If man be imbued with all good qualities but be selfish, all the other virtues will fade or pass away and eventually he will grow worse. </p>

<p id='154.3'> I hope the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful will be entirely freed from selfishness. Should this become their nature, they will indeed become manifestations of great bounties, and the doors of the divine grace will open. </p>

<p id='154.4'> Be thou grateful to Mrs. ______ for having led thee to the Straight Path and guiding thee to the Kingdom of God. If thou shouldst thank her a thousand times an hour, thou wilt fail to thank her sufficiently for the attainment. </p>

<p id='169.12'> Thou hast asked regarding the naming of children: When thou wishest to name a babe, prepare a meeting <span data-pg='150'></span> therefor; chant the verses and communes, and supplicate and implore the Threshold of Oneness and beg the attainment of guidance for the babe and wish confirmated firmness and constancy; then give the name and enjoy beverage and sweetmeat. This is spiritual baptism. </p>

<p id='169.13'> His honor, Mr. ______, Mrs. ______ and ______ arrived. They were attracted by the fragrances of God and ignited by the fire of the love of God. With a new spirit and fresh life they returned. </p>

<p id='169.15'> Strive so that the odor of violation cease and all come under the protection of the Covenant. </p>

<p id='169.16'> Remain in and about that town and know that trial is the cause of promotion. But thou must deal with all in the utmost love and do kindness. Although they lift up the head of pride, show thou greater humility and meekness and treat them with the utmost submission and lowliness. </p>

<p id='169.17'> Show the utmost kindness in my behalf to the near maid-servant of God (thy wife).... </p>

But every worldly transaction,<span data-pg='155'></span> although it be a gift through which the far and the near be profited, still it is transient and temporary and will not last for ages and its blessings will not extend successively to the righteous people in the ages to come. And as the heavenly abundance and the divine gifts and the omnipotent grace come in these days successively and uninterruptedly, therefore, thou shouldst establish a heavenly edifice to facilitate and level the way before the divine transaction, to carry out the divine order, to gladden the pure hearts of every one, to sanctify thyself from everything but God and to keep aloof from all the worldly things for the Cause of God; to be kindled with the fire of the love of God, to spread the fragrance of God and to expose thyself to the gentle breeze of God. </p>

<p id='180.2' class='dropcap'> I received thy letter and its contents caused the utmost joy and fragrance within me, because it showed thy firmness in the Cause of God and prove thy steadfastness in the love of the Word of God. Its meanings were the mystery of unity and its expression showed thy firm intention in serving the glorious Lord. </p>

<p id='180.3'> I beseech the Threshold of Unity with all humility and supplication to make thee confirmed in His service and to enable thee to be serviceable in the Holy Threshold; that thou mayest not be a moment at rest nor take a breath of composure; nay, rather to pass all thy life in this greatest gift and this supreme favor employed in diffusing the breath of God; that thy sincerity of heart, thy sanctity and purity may increase and that thou mayest become entirely separated from aught else save God.

The more the mirror is clear and pure the greater will the <span data-pg='158'></span> rays and the bounties of the Sun of Truth show forth from it. </p>

<p id='180.4'> As to those things published in journals against thee: Thou shouldst not be grieved nor sorry therefor, because thousands of journals have written traducing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, have given false and base accusations and awful calumnies. Notwithstanding these he was neither troubled nor grieved thereby; nay, rather these caused me to exert myself more than usual in the path of God and to drink the cup of sacrifice and to boil in the fire of His love. Man must seek to gain the acceptance of God and not that of the different classes of men. If one is praised and chosen by God, the accusation of all the creatures will cause no loss to him; and if the man is not accepted in the threshold of God, the praise and admiration of all men will be of no use to him. </p>

<p id='180.5'> By all these it is meant that thou must not be sorry and grieved because of these things the papers have written against thee; nay, rather trust in God and be unmoved by either the praise or the false accusations declared by people towards thee, depend entirely on God and exert thyself to serve His holy vineyard. All else save this is but imagination, though it be the praises of all people in thy behalf; because all else is of no result and bears no fruit. </p>

<p id='180.6'> As to thine action against the journal which hath libeled thee: It is not at all best to bring action against them, because there is no profit in doing that; nay, it will lead to more sayings of a similar nature. Under these circumstances silence is best. Thou must not be disappointed, sorry or grieved thereat; God will remove all these difficulties. If thou wilt employ thyself <span data-pg='159'></span> in the service (of the Cause of God) the past losses will be recovered and all the troubles will be settled. </p>

<p id='180.7'> This is the manifest truth. </p>

 <p id='187' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who hast arisen to render service to the Cause of God in His Great Vineyard! </p>

<p id='187.2' class='dropcap'> Verily, I have already written thee several letters, and sent them to thee at different times. Now, I address thee with such words whereby the souls of the proximate ones are rejoiced, and the faces of the sincere ones are cheered. </p>

<p id='187.3'> O my friend, verily the Cause is great and great, and the penetration of the Word of God in the temple (body) of all the regions is similar to the pervasion of the soul in a sound body. </p>

<p id='187.4'> By the life of Bahá, verily, the power of the Kingdom of God hath taken hold of the pillars of the world, and hath possessed all the nations. Thou wilt surely find the standards of the Testament waving in all regions, the chanting of the verses of unity raised in exalted assemblies, and the lights of the Sun of Truth and its heat dispersing the thick clouds massed on the horizon. Be rejoiced at this glad-tidings, whereby the hearts of the sincere among the beloved are cheered. </p>

<p id='187.5'> O my friend, isolate all thy faculties and senses from every other mention and thought, and follow the example of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in servitude to the Holy and Exalted Threshold. Hasten to the field of sacrifice, craving for the most great martyrdom; expend thy life and all of thy grades of love for God and in attraction to the Beauty of <span data-pg='165'></span> Abhá. </p>

<p id='187.6'> By God, the True One, man should seek only this bounty, inasmuch as it is everlasting, eternal, divine, spiritual, luminous and merciful. Be sanctified from all the universe, and send my greeting and praise to the spiritual leaf, the being who relies upon the grace of her Lord — the maid-servant of God, thy revered wife, and say unto her that she may address the veiled ones (those blind to the Truth), saying: “Verily, eyes are dazzled by gazing at the sun, and it is impossible to consider it because of the intensity of its rays; and verily the sea cannot be contained in a cup. The weakness of eyes does no harm to the sun, nor the smallness of the cup to the sea.” </p>

<p id='187.7'> Then let her explain to the people, and make known to every questioner, by saying: “Verily, minds are limited, and the splendor of lights is so great as not to be comprehended by (man’s) reflective faculties. Ye ought to have the sight of the heart so that ye may apprehend the reality of the mysteries of God which are deposited behind coverings.” </p>

 <p id='188' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who hast sought illumination from the Light of the Guidance of God! </p>

<p id='188.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read thy words of thanksgiving to God for that He hath directed thee to His Kingdom, illuminated thine insight with the light of guidance, and baptized thee with the water which hath descended from heaven, with the fire which was ignited in the Sinaitic Tree, and with the Holy Spirit which quickeneth hearts and souls. Then, thank thou God for this gift whereby thy face is shining amid the concourse of Chosen <span data-pg='166'></span> Ones. </p>

<p id='188.3'> Know thou, verily, man before reaching (spiritual) maturity passes his days and only apprehends trivial things which are clear on account of their exoteric indications, but when he attains full development, then he grasps the reality of things and their esoteric facts. Every day after maturity is equivalent to one year before it, on account of man’s perception, understanding, apprehension and discoveries. </p>

<p id='188.4'> Now, thou hast reached development and apprehended the degree of maturity: Gaze at the grades of the existence, the realities of beings, the allegories in the epistles of God, and the mysteries in the Old and New Testament. By the life of Bahá, the covering will be removed from off thee (i. e., facts will be unfolded to thee), and thou wilt be informed of that which all the philosophers and wise men are unable to apprehend. Verily, this is a gift which God assigns only to such of His chosen servants as He willeth. Verily, thy Lord will inspire thee with the mysteries of God, the Protector, the Self-subsistent. </p>

<p id='188.5'> Verily, I beseech the Lord of Hosts to increase thy faith each day over that of the previous day, to confirm thee through His Holy Spirit, to give thee capacity to partake of the lights of knowledge and wisdom, to make thee a herald of the Covenant in those regions, and to instruct thee in that which thou knowest not; so that thou mayest become a physician for bodies as well as souls, to heal bodies with the medicines which are useful and beneficial for physical (sickness), and to cure hearts and souls with that antidote which quickeneth hearts and souls. </p>

<p id='188.6'> O my friend, it is incumbent upon thee to be severed <span data-pg='167'></span> (from all else save God), to be attracted, to be sincere, and to spend thy life in the path of God. Be thou holy, spiritual, divine, lively, brilliant, godlike, sanctified, pure, with merciful character, firm in the Covenant, fluent and knowing; and gaze toward the Kingdom of Abhá with heart brimming over with the love of God, with tears flowing in the commemoration of God, with a face scintillating through the light of God, with a heart sincere to the beloved of God, and with a sword which divides truth from falsehood. By God, the True One, the Spirit of Bahá will assist thee with such strength that all the concourse of the earth will fail (to withstand). </p>

And when the heart is turned unto the Sun, then the eye will be opened and will recognize the Sun through the Sun itself. Then (man) will be in no need of arguments (or proofs), for the Sun is altogether independent, and absolute independence is in need of nothing, and proofs are one of the things (of which absolute independence has no need).

<p id='202' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art confident in the appearance of the Kingdom of God! </p>

<p id='202.2' class='dropcap'> Verily I read thy letter, which was beautifully composed and which proved thy great love, the extent of thy knowledge and the illumination of thy sight, by witnessing the signs whereunto the heads bow in reverence and faces show respect. </p>

<p id='202.3'> O beloved! Thank God that He chose thee for His love and elected thy wife for the calling of the appearance of the Kingdom of God. Verily, this is a great favor, and wert thou aware of the results which will follow it in the Kingdom of God, thou wouldst, verily, rejoice exceedingly and wouldst call with loud voice: “Blessed are we for this great favor, and glad-tidings be unto us for this glorious attainment.” </p>

<p id='202.4'> Consider the past, so that thou mayest become informed of the mysteries which shall be disclosed in the future. When the disciples were calling in the name of Christ, the Jews scoffed, scorned and laughed at them. They were saying, “They (i. e., the disciples) are taken with madness, and madness is made an art.” They even beat them with whips, threw stones at them, prevented the people from approaching them, and were saying, “This man (Christ) is naught but a sorcerer, blasphemeth God and is possessed of a devil.” </p>

<p id='202.5'> Then observe how that persecution and scorn were changed to glory, honor and reverence. Ultimately, they (the Jews) honored their sublime stations and acknowledged their loftiness, which was exalted, promoted and glorified in the center of the horizons until it reached the degree of exaggeration in deeds. They <span data-pg='176'></span> made for them likenesses and pictures, decorated with jewels shining in the eyes; thy placed these likenesses or pictures in the temples, churches and monasteries built on the tops of the mountains, and worshipped them with respect, glory, majesty and reverence. This is the condition of the neglectful ones who are deprived of the Truth (the Manifestations of God) at the day of their existence among them. After the ascension of their (the prophets’) spirits unto the Center of Purity and Piety, then the negligent ones repent and return, making likenesses and pictures according to their own ideas, which do not bear resemblance, and worship the same. This is the station of the ignorant ones who are as animals, following every croaker and shaken by every wind. “Forsake them to play in their shallow waters.” </p>

<p id='202.6'> As to thee: Be happy because of what thy Lord, the Clement, the Merciful, hath given thee; choosing thee and thy esteemed wife for entrance into His Kingdom, for calling in His name, praising Him in assemblies, gatherings and meetings. </p>

<p id='202.7'> The truth I verily say unto thee, this divine grace cannot be exchanged for the sovereignty of the earth, the east or the west. For that (the worldly kingdom) is naught but dreams, torture to the spirit, trouble for the hearts; its mortality is certain and its destruction a well known fact — while this spiritual kingdom and divine grace will shine, and it is an Abhá (Glorious) jewel which will glisten on the diadems of great glory in the course of centuries and <span data-pg='177'></span> cycles. </p>

    <h3 class='sectionnum'> — 226 — </h3>
  </div>

 <p id='226' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art advancing toward the Divine Kingdom! </p>

<p id='226.2' class='dropcap'> What thou hast written was understood and noted. Thou hast asked concerning the station of this servant. The station of this servant is servitude to the Holy Threshold (Bahá’u’lláh) and I glory and honor in this. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the standard of the divine love, the sign of the gift of God, the servant of the assemblage of the merciful ones, the light of the meeting of the spiritual ones. He is the orb of peace and reconciliation and the light of love in the world of humanity. He is the herald of the Kingdom of the Merciful One and the promulgator of the religion of rectitude and security. <i>This is the station of this servant! This is the Truth</i>! </p>

<p id='226.3'> I hope through the divine grace that the brilliancy of the love of God will pervade all regions, and that he will remove warfare and strife from the world of existence. Then the human world will become expressive of the unity of the merciful world, the inferior world will become a clear and purified mirror reflecting the Supreme Concourse, the East and West will embrace each other like unto two longing ones and the North and South will shake hands and clasp each other <span data-pg='192'></span> in the arms like unto two beloved ones. <i>This is the station of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá</i>. </p>

<p id='226.4'> As to the light thou dost witness: It is not an earthly light (phenomenal); nay, rather, it is a heavenly light. It cannot be seen by the sight; nay, rather, it is perceived by the insight. </p>

<p id='226.5'> As to the resurrection of the body of Christ three days subsequent to His departure: This signifies the divine teachings and spiritual religion of His Holiness Christ, which constitute His spiritual body, which is living and perpetual forevermore. </p>

<p id='226.6'> By the “three days” of His death is meant that after the great martyrdom, the penetration of the divine teachings and the spread of the spiritual law became relaxed on account of the crucifixion of Christ. For the disciples were somewhat troubled by the violence of divine tests. But when they became firm, that divine spirit resurrected and that body — which signifies the divine word — arose. </p>

<p id='226.7'> Likewise the address of the angels to the people of Galilee, “That this Christ will return in the same way and that He will descend from heaven,” is a spiritual address. For when Christ appeared, He came from heaven, although He was outwardly born from the womb of Mary. For He said: “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven.” </p>

<p id='226.8'> He said: “I came down from heaven and likewise will go to heaven.” By “heaven” is not meant this infinite phenomenal space, but “heaven” signifies the word of the divine kingdom which is the supreme station and seat of the Sun of Truth. </p>

<p id='226.9'> To be brief: The mysteries of the Holy Books are <span data-pg='193'></span> many and require explanation and elucidation. I hope thine insight will be so opened that the divine mysteries may become manifest and clear. </p>

<p id='228.3'> Know thou that the Messianic Spirit and the out-pouring of the Holy Spirit is always manifest, but capacity and ability (to receive it) is more in some and less in others. After the crucifixion the apostles had not in the beginning the capacity and ability of witnessing the Messianic reality. For they were agitated. But when they found firmness and steadfastness, their inner sight became opened, and thy saw the reality of the Messiah as manifest. For the body of Christ was crucified and vanished, but the Spirit of Christ is always pouring upon the contingent world, <span data-pg='194'></span> and is manifest before the insight of the people of assurance. </p>

<p id='228.4'> O thou seeker of the kingdom of God! If thou wishest thy speech and utterance to take effect in the hardened hearts, be thou severed from all attachment to this world and turn unto the Kingdom of God. Enkindle the fire of the love of God in the heart with such intensity that thou mayest become a flame of fire and a luminous lamp of guidance.

<p id='231.2' class='dropcap'> The letter which thou hast written was perused and its contents were noted. Thou hast written concerning spiritual hearing and insight. The insight (or inner perception) is a correct sight, for it never blundereth. But the outward sight doth err (or misjudgeth); it seeth the mirage as water, considereth the revolving flame as a circle, imagineth the images reflected in a mirror as a reality and judgeth huge bodies as small ones, from a remote distance. There are many evidences as to the blundering of the sight; but the insight apprehendeth the reality and discovereth the mysteries. </p>

<p id='231.3'> As to the difference between inspiration and imagination: inspiration is in conformity with the Divine Texts, but imaginations do not conform therewith. A real, spiritual connection between the True One and the servant is a luminous bounty which causeth an ecstatic (or divine) flame, passion and attraction. When this connection is secured (or realized) such an ecstasy and happiness become manifest in the heart that man doth fly away (with joy) and uttereth melody and song. Just as the soul bringeth the body in motion, so that spiritual bounty and real connection likewise moveth (or cheereth) the human <span data-pg='196'></span> soul. </p>

<p id='231.4'> As to truthful dreams: I beg of God that thy inner eye (insight) may be so opened that thou mayest thyself differentiate between truthful and untruthful dreams. </p>

I am weak: favor me with power and strength, so that I may be a maid-servant in Thy Threshold, with perfect purity and sanctity; sacrifice myself unto Thee, be quit of myself and seek Thee, walk in the path of Thy good pleasure, speak Thy secret and witness the signs of Thy Oneness wherever I look.

 <p id='241' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who art esteemed in the Threshold of the Almighty! </p>

<p id='241.2' class='dropcap'> Praise thou God, for that thou hast found the Light of Guidance, recognized the Lord of the Kingdom, art engaged in the service of the Divine Garden and hast guided a number of souls and led them to the Kingdom of Existence. When thou occupiest thyself with all thy strength in service, thou wilt become a magnet of attraction and cause every seeker to reach the presence of the Desired One; thou wilt raise a great clamor in the world and evince such an ecstasy and rapture that will astonish the minds. </p>

<p id='241.3'> Send my loving greeting to those souls whom thou hast guided unto the divine kingdom and say unto them: “Ye must appreciate Miss. ______. Move your tongues in thanksgiving and be obliged for her great effort; for she gave you to drink the wine of guidance from the cup of the love of God and led you to the kingdom of lights. Were you to thank her for many years as a reward for this guidance, ye will not be able to repay your obligation for this <span data-pg='204'></span> gift.” </p>

<p id='241.4'> Thou hast written concerning the Impersonality of the Divinity. Personality is in the Manifestation of the Divinity, not in the Essence of the Divinity. The reality of the divine world is purified and sanctified from limits and restriction. But the pure Mirror, which is the Manifestor of the Sun of Truth and in which the Sun of Truth is manifest in full appearance — that mirror is restricted, not the lights. The soul pervadeth throughout the whole body, and its commands are effective in all the parts and limbs of man. Notwithstanding its utmost sanctification (or abstraction) this soul is manifest and evident in all its grades, in this material form. By seeing God is meant beholding the Manifestation of Himself; for witnessing the sun in its entire splendor, in a clear glassy surface, is identical with witnessing the essence of the sun itself. </p>

<p id='241.5'> When the souls of the sincere depart (from this body), then their unreal vision (i. e., seeing) is changed into a vision of reality. Even as man, when in the age of babyhood and imperfection, though he seeth things, yet that vision is superficial and external. But when he reacheth the world (or age) of perfection and becometh endowed with reasoning faculty and (the power of) discrimination and comprehension, then that vision of his is a vision (i. e., seeing) of reality <a data-fnid='93'></a> and not the unreality. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn93'> Insight. </aside>



 <p id='241.6'> It is evident that the divine nearness is an unlimited nearness, be it in this world or the next one. This is a nearness which is sanctified from the comprehension of the minds. The more a man seeketh light from the Sun of Truth, the nearer he will draw. For <span data-pg='205'></span> instance, a clear body is near unto the sun, and a black stone is far from the sun. This nearness dependeth upon clearness, purity and perfection and that remoteness is due to density, dullness (or obscurity) and imperfection. </p>

<p id='241.7'> As to the question whether the souls will recognize each other in the spiritual world: This (fact) is certain; for the Kingdom is the world of vision (i. e., things are visible in it), where all concealed realities will become disclosed. How much more the well-known souls will become manifest. The mysteries of which man is heedless in this earthly world, those will he discover in the heavenly world, and there will he be informed of the secret of truth; how much more will he recognize or discover persons with whom he hath been associated. Undoubtedly, the holy souls who find a pure eye and are favored with insight will, in the kingdom of lights, be acquainted with all mysteries, and will seek the bounty of witnessing the reality of every great soul. Even they will manifestly behold the Beauty of God in that world. Likewise will they find all the friends of God, both those of the former and recent times, present in the heavenly assemblage. </p>

<p id='241.8'> As to the difference and distinction between Lazarus and that “rich man”: The first was spiritual, while the second was material. One was in the highest degree of knowledge and the other in the lowest depths of ignorance. The difference and distinction will naturally become realized between all men after their departure from this mortal world. But this (distinction) is not in respect to place, but it is in respect to the soul and conscience. For the Kingdom of God is sanctified <span data-pg='206'></span> (or free) from time and place; it is another world and another universe. But the holy souls are promised the gift of intercession. And know thou for a certainty, that in the divine worlds, the spiritual beloved ones (believers) will recognize each other, and will seek union (with each other), but a spiritual union. Likewise, a love that one may have entertained for any one will not be forgotten in the world of the Kingdom. Likewise, thou wilt not forget (there) the life that thou hast had in the material world. </p>

<p id='241.9'> O thou maid-servant of God! Hold fast to the Most Strong Handle <a data-fnid='94'></a> and be thoroughly attracted to the Kingdom of Abhá, until thou mayest at every instant find a new confirmation and attain to a wonderful gift and become a cause for the guidance of souls. </p>

  </div>

 <p id='242' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou who hast attained to Truth! </p>

<p id='242.2' class='dropcap'> I beg of God that the divine light which is spoken of in the Twelfth Chapter of John may shed its rays upon thee forever, so that thou mayest always be in light. The life of man in this world is short and will soon draw to an end. Consequently one must appreciate (or count as gain) every breath (or moment) of his life and endeavor in that which is conducive to eternal glory. </p>

<p id='242.3'> Thou hast written concerning the shining assembly of Washington (D. C.): This caused me great joy, for that assemblage is a rose-garden of mysteries and very sweet fragrances are being inhaled from it. I hope that through the sincerity of heart of the friends and maid-servants of God, that assembly will continue and <span data-pg='207'></span> be extended (or grow) day by day, will increase in luminosity every moment and that the members of that assembly will make extraordinary progress in the Divine Threshold. </p>

<p id='242.4'> If the health and well-being of the body be expended in the path of the Kingdom, this is very acceptable and praiseworthy; and if it is expended to the benefit of the human world in general — even though it be to their material (or bodily) benefit and be a means of doing good — that is also acceptable. But if the health and welfare of man be spent in sensual desires, in a life on the animal plane, and in devilish pursuits — then disease is better than such heath; nay, death itself is preferable to such a life. If thou art desirous of health, wish thou health for serving the Kingdom. I hope thou mayest attain a perfect insight, an inflexible resolution, a complete health and spiritual and physical strength in order that thou mayest drink from the fountain of eternal life and be assisted by the spirit of divine confirmation. </p>

<p id='242.5'> Say unto ______: “Thou art sowing pure seeds, but that soil (wherein the seeds fall) is full of useless plants, weeds and rubbish. Therefore the seeds are wasted. Consequently, come and sow those seeds in a pure, sweet and fertile soil, in order that they may vegetate, become fresh and verdant and form into heaps on heaps of harvest.” </p>

<p id='242.6'> Send my greeting to ______ and say unto her: “The sun is in the utmost effulgence but the surface turned toward it must be a mirror; the clearer and purer it is, the more lights shall be reflected therein.” </p>

<p id='242.7'> Send my loving greeting to his honor ______ and <span data-pg='208'></span> say unto him: “Do not miss the opportunity. Now is the springtime and the bounty of heaven is pouring on earth and the fields and rose-gardens are in growth and development. Exert thyself as much as thou canst, in order that through this everlasting bounty and the sprinklings of the clouds of the divine gift, thou mayest grow and thrive like unto a fruitful tree, with the utmost freshness and purity.” </p>

<p id='242.8'> That matter (or substance) which is the cause of the moderation and perfection of the body is that perfect moderate temperament which is produced by the organization and admixture of constituent elements; that matter (or substance) is material (or physical) not spiritual. But reason, which comprehends (or detects) the realities of things, is a spiritual reality, not physical (or material). Therefore the animal is deprived of reason, and it (reason) is specialized to mankind. The animal feeleth realities which are perceptible to the senses, but man perceiveth intellectual realities (or things perceptible to reason). Consequently, it hath become evident that reason is a spiritual faculty, not physical (or material). </p>

<p id='242.9'> The Holy Land is not tranquil in these days.<a data-fnid='95'></a> Consequently, let thy presence (or coming) in the Holy Land depend on some other time. Endeavor night and day in serving the Cause of God; this service is real visit, and this is meeting, itself. </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn95'> Revealed in 1903. </aside>



 <p id='242.10'> Deliver my greeting to each one of the friends of God and maid-servants of the Merciful with the utmost love. </p>

<p id='242.11'> That blessed name which thou hast asked to remain <span data-pg='209'></span> with thee forever and become the cause of spiritual progress — that name is “Aseyeh,” which is the name of the mother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. I give the blessed name to thee. Be therefore in the utmost joy and happiness, and be engaged in all gladness and attraction (or ecstasy) for thou hast become the object of such a favor. </p>

I beg of God that thou mayest always enjoy spiritual nearness and ever be rejoiced. Reveal thou (or teach thou) the Word of God; be not grieved at the people’s lack of hearing.

 <p id='252' class='nodropcap italic larger'> O thou who art firm in the Covenant! </p>

<p id='252.2' class='dropcap'> Thy letter was received. Thou hast written regarding thy trip to the Holy Land. God willing, this desire of thine will be realized. </p>

<p id='252.3'> The name Aseyeh is acceptable in the Threshold of Oneness, for the daughter of Pharaoh had this name, who, when (Moses) the Light of Guidance dawned, became confirmed by the Merciful One, left the court of Pharaoh with its grandeur and sovereignty and became perfumed with the fragrances of holiness. Then she assisted in the service of His Holiness (Moses) — upon him be peace! Also, Aseyeh was the name of my mother. </p>

<p id='252.4'> Thou hast written that thou lovest the Bible. Undoubtedly, the friends, and the maid-servants of the Merciful should know the value of the Bible, for they are the ones who have discovered its real significances and have become cognizant of the hidden mystery of the Holy Book. <span data-pg='219'></span> ... </p>

<p id='252.5'> Deliver my greeting to ______ and say: “I supplicate God that thou mayest gladden and rejoice the heart of ______ with the melody of the Kingdom, rend asunder the veil of her concealment, enlighten her face with the light of the Most Great Guidance and make her eyes see and her ears hear.” </p>

<p id='252.6'> Say on my behalf to the maid-servant of God, ______, “The end of every (material) work is without result, because it is perishable and inconstant, but the first (real) work is attraction to the fragrance of God, enkindlement with the fire of the love of God, reading the verse of Unity and beholding the lights from the Dawning-place of Mystery.<a data-fnid='101'></a> After that cometh the training of the soul, purification of character and service to humanity. If thou art able to accomplish any one of these, the result is eternal and the fruit everlasting.” </p>
 <aside class='fn' id='fn101'> i. e., as the sun rises out of the darkness. </aside>



 <p id='252.7'> Thou hast written regarding thy coming to the Holy Land; do not hasten, for then thou mayest travel with comfort. It would be better not to resign from the school, nay rather, avail thyself of the opportunity during vacation time which is in the season of summer, and present thyself in this land; because thy presence in that school is fruitful. Thou shalt finally study the Persian language.... </p>

 <p id='255' class='nodropcap italic larger'> 	O thou herald of the Kingdom! </p>

<p id='255.2' class='dropcap'> Thou wast not alone in the trip thou didst undertake in various places. The spirit and soul of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was with thee. Although thou hast been afflicted with many and severe persecutions, hast heard derision, scorn and contempt and observed the opposition of the heedless ones, yet this is conducive to thy glory, that thou hast been made a target for the arrow <span data-pg='221'></span> of opposition in the Path of God and hast drunk the cup of affliction. Consider this, how many a calamity was submitted to by those sanctified souls in bygone ages and to how many sufferings they were resigned! Thou also must endure dire oppression and ordeals in the Path of Abhá and maintain the feet of steadfastness and firmness. Then thou shalt behold the confirmation of God surrounding thee. Rejoice thou and be happy that thou hast attained to this station and walked in the footsteps of the holy souls. </p>

<p id='255.3'> Announce on my behalf longing greeting to Mr. ______ and say, “The melody of the Kingdom is that which hath caused the motion of the universe; the musk-diffusing fragrance of the rose-garden of God is that which hath perfumed the nostrils; and the reflection of the Sun of Truth is that which hath illumined the whole earth. Now is the beginning of illumination! Therefore, the people of darkness imagine that they can oppose (this Revelation); yet, ere long they shall find themselves in loss and consternation! They shall observe that the power of the Word of God hath subdued East and West. Be thou not sad and dispirited on account of the opposition of the heedless ones. Soon they shall regret sorely. Reflect thou how the Pharisees persecuted and looked down in contempt upon His Holiness the Christ. The result was that His lamp became ignited, His light began to shine and His followers sparkled like unto the stars from the horizon of existence; and the consequence to the Pharisees was the pangs of remorse and regrets.” </p>

<p id='255.4'> Convey, also, greeting to the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ______ and say, “Thy house is the nest and <span data-pg='222'></span> the shelter of this heavenly bird. Undoubtedly, thou must enkindle the lights of the Kingdom therein.” </p>

<p id='255.5'> Likewise convey respectful greeting on my behalf to Mrs. ______ and say, “I ask of God that thy house may become the gathering-place of the spiritual ones and the assembly of the godly ones; that the light of Truth may shine therein and make it brilliant and resplendent.” </p>

<p id='255.6'> Also convey longing greeting to Mr. ______ and say, “Those souls who, in the time of His Highness Christ, turned their faces toward the Kingdom and quaffed the wine of guidance from the cup of the Word of God, had their troubles changed into everlasting bliss. No matter how much they heard the rebuke of the heedless ones, observed the censure of the relatives, were afflicted with the injury of the oppressors and thrown into abjection, yet that ignominy finally became eternal glory. Thou must show the utmost love and kindness towards the heedless ones and the oppressors and ask from God forgiveness and pardon for them, for they are ignorant. if they understood, they would not oppress; nay, rather would they arise (to serve the Cause) with faithfulness.” </p>

<p id='255.7'> Announce, also, respectful greeting from me to Mrs. ______ and Mr. ______ and say. “The sons of the Kingdom are scattered throughout the whole world, but the ignorant Pharisees have arisen with the utmost hatred instigating persecutions. They imagine that persecution and suffering will hinder the promulgation of the Cause; whereas no rampart is able to obstruct the descent of the waves of the Most Great Sea; no veil can conceal the rays of the Sun of Truth; no wall can stay <span data-pg='223'></span> the wafting of the Divine Breeze; and no power is able to resist the Spirit of God. Be ye not sad nor dejected on account of the disturbance and uproar of the people of desire and passion. Ere long the symphony of the Kingdom shall silence all the other noises. Rest ye assured and illumine your house with the lights of divine commemoration.” </p>

<p id='255.8'> Give my greeting to Mr. ______ and announce to him, “Caiaphas and Annas were the colossal pillars of the Mosaic Dispensation in the day of His Highness the Spirit; but as they did not acknowledge the Word of God, they fell from the apex of glory to the bottom of the pit of the greatest abasement. But Peter was a catcher of fish; as he turned his face toward the Word of God, the fame of his imperishable, deathless and immortal glory encircled East and West; and he found in the sovereignty of the Kingdom, eternal and everlasting majesty. It is the same in these days.” </p>

God willing, thou wilt bring them out of the nether world, with the net of the love of God, into the immensity of the Kingdom. Those brilliant stars which thou hast beheld are the children of the Kingdom. That brilliant crescent is the Cause of God. The appearance of His Highness <span data-pg='226'></span> Christ and His white robe and resplendent light in His blessed face is the proof of the power and the promulgation of the Word of God in America. </p>

Where is the throne of David, the Glorious? Where is his iron rod? Where are his innumerable hosts? Where are his attacking armies? Where are the angels of heaven? Where do we see justice of government existing among people and even among beasts and insects? Where is his great majesty? Where is his power, which shaketh heaven and earth? Is not this a claim of one who is bewildered and wandering amidst valleys and hills? Doth he not ride upon an ass, while on his head there is a crown of thorns and he is despised?” </p>

<p id='267.5'> I supplicate and implore the Kingdom of Abhá in <span data-pg='233'></span> behalf of thine honored husband and all the family and the friends in Cincinnati. I pray that the heavenly blessings may descend, the divine bounties become possible and that thou mayest become a true caller of the Word of God. </p>

That hath no conscious knowledge of its own voice; while this is exhilarated and rejoiced by its own melody. </p>
