THE PILING OF THE FIRE ALTAR
PRAPATHAKA I
The Placing of the Fire in the Fire-pan

iv. 1. 1.
a Yoking mind first,
Extending his thoughts, Savitr
Discerning the light,
Hath brought Agni from the earth.
b Yoking with mind the gods,
Going to the heaven, the sky, with thought,
Those that are to make great light,
Savitr instigates.
c With mind well yoked are we
In the instigation of god Savitr,
For strength to go to the heaven.
d They yoke their minds, they yoke their thoughts,
The priests of the mighty wise priest,
He alone, who knoweth the way, appointeth their functions [1]
Great is the praise of the god Savitr.
e I yoke with honour your ancient prayer;
The praises go like Suras on their way;
All the sons of immortality hear (it),
Who have achieved dwellings divine.
f He whose advance others followed,
Gods, of the god praising might,
He who meted out the regions of earth,
He is the brilliant god Savitr in greatness.
g O god Savitr, instigate the sacrifice, instigate the lord of the sacrifice [2] to good luck; may the divine Gandharva, who purifieth thoughts purify our thought; may the lord of speech to-day make sweet our utterance.
h This sacrifice for us, O god Savitr
Do thou instigate, serving the gods,
Finding comrades, ever victorious,
Winning booty, winning heaven.
i By the Rc make the Stoma to prosper,
By the Gayatra the Rathantara,
The Brhat with the Gayatri for its metre.
k On the impulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the Açvins, with the hands of Pusan, with the Gayatri metre, I take thee, in the manner of Angiras.
l Thou art the spade, thou art the woman [3], from the abode of the earth I bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras; with the Tristubh metre I grasp thee in the manner of Angiras.
m Thou art the bearer, thou art the woman; through thee may we be strong to dig Agni of the dust in his place; with the Jagati metre I grasp thee in the manner of Angiras.
n Grasping in thy hand, Savitr,
Bearing the spade of gold,
Therewith digging Agni
Do thou bring for us light unperishing.
With the Anustubh metre I grasp thee in the manner of Angiras.

iv. i. 2.
a This bond of order they grasped
At their assemblies in ages gone by, the sages;
Therewith the gods mastered the pressed (juice)--
In the Saman of order proclaiming the stream.
b Swiftly run hither, O steed,
Along the most extended space;
In the sky is thy highest birth,
In the atmosphere thy navel, on the earth thy birthplace.
c Yoke ye two the ass,
In this course, O ye of mighty wealth,
Which beareth Agni, serving us.
d In each need more strong,
In each contest, we invoke,
As friends, Indra to aid us.
e Hastening [1] come hither, trampling the enemy,
Come with wondrous skill from the leadership of Rudra;
Fare along the broad atmosphere,
With happy pastures, bestowing security.
f With Pusan as fellow, from the abode of the earth do thou approach
Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
g We approach Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
h We will bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
i We bear Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
k Agni gazed along the forefront of the dawns,
Along the days first, the all-knower,
And in many ways along the rays of the sun [2],
He hath extended along sky and earth.
I The steed coming from the way
Driveth every foe;
He is fain to gaze with his eye
On Agni in his great abode.
m Coming to earth, O steed,
Do thou seek Agni with thy radiance;
Turning from earth I tell us
Whence we shall dig him up.
n Thy back is the sky, thy abode earth,
Thy breath the atmosphere, thy birthplace the ocean;
Discerning with thine eye,
Do thou overcome [3] the enemy.
o Arise for great prosperity
From this abode, giving wealth, O steed;
May we enjoy the loving favour of earth,
That are about to dig fire in her lap.
p The strong steed hath stepped forward, giving wealth;
He hath made the place of earth well wrought;
Thence let us dig Agni of fair aspect,
Mounting the heaven on the top of the vault.
q The water divine do thou pour, full of sweetness
To avert diseases for men,
From their place let arise
Plants with fair leaves.
r I touch [4] Agni with mind, with ghee,
Who lordeth it over all the worlds,
Broad, vast, with pervading vital power,
Most extensive, impetuous, winning, food.
s I touch thee with speech, with ghee,
With friendly mind accept it;
With mortal glory, with engaging colour,
Agni, with body full of life may not be touched.
t Round the offerings hath Agni gone,
The sage, the lord of strength,
Bestowing jewels on the donor.
u May we set thee around us, O Agni,
The sage, O strong one, as a fort,
Of daring due, day by day,
Destroyer of that which may be broken.
v Thou, O Agni, with days, fain to shine towards us,
Thou from the waters, thou from the rock,
Thou from the woods, thou from the plants,
Thou, O lord of men, art born pure.

iv. 1. 3.
a On the impulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the Açvins, with the hands of Pusan, in the abode of earth, I dig Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
b Full of light, thou, O Agni; of fair aspect,
Shining with unaging radiance,
Auspicious and harmless to offspring,
In the abode of earth, I dig Agni of the dust in the manner of Angiras.
c Thou art the back of the waters, expansive, wide,
About to bear Agni, least to be laid aside;
Growing to might as the lotus-flower,
Do thou extend in width with the measure of heaven.
d Ye two are protectors [1] and a help,
Unbroken, both expansive;
Do ye expanding be united;
Bear Agni of the dust.
e Be ye united, that win the heaven,
In union of heart and self;
Who shall bear within Agni
Full of light and unaging.
f Thou art of the dust, all-supporting; Atharvan first pressed out thee, O Agni.
g Thee, O Agni, from the lotus
Atharvan pressed out,
From the head of every priest.
h Thee the sage, Dadhyañc,
Son [2] of Atharvan, doth kindle,
Slayer of Vrtra, destroyer of foes.
i Thee Pathya Vrsan doth kindle,
Best slayer of foes,
Winner of booty in every conflict.
k Sit thou, O Hotr, in thine own world, wise,
Place thou the sacrifice in the birthplace of good deeds,
Eager for the gods, do thou sacrifice to them with oblation;
O Agni, bestow great strength on the sacrificer.
l The Hotr hath sat him down in the place of the Hoty, wise,
Glittering, shining, skilful,
With vows and foresight undeceived, most wealthy,
Bearing a thousand, pure-tongued Agni.
m Sit thou down, thou art great,
Burn [3] best servant of the gods;
O Agni, pure one, send forth the ruddy smoke,
O famous one, that can be seen afar.
n Be born noble in the forefront of the days,
Kind to the kindly, red in the woods;
Bestowing seven jewels in every home
Hath Agni sat him down as Hotr.

iv. 1. 4.
a May I Vayu, Matariçvan, unite
The broken heart of thee that art outstretched
To him who moveth with the expiration of the gods,
With thee, O goddess, be Vasat.
b Wellborn, with light,
Guard and protector, thou hast sat on the heaven;
O Agni, thy garment of many hues,
Put on, O thou that dost abound in light.
c Arise, thou of fair sacrifice,
Aid us with thy divine radiance;
Brilliant to behold, with mighty blaze,
Do thou come hither, O Agni, in response to our prayers [1].
d Arise erect to aid us,
Like Savitr, the god;
Erect to win the booty,
When in contest we call on thee with the shining praisers.
e Born, thou art the child of the two worlds,
O Agni; a brilliant child distributed among the plants;
A beauteous babe beyond the darkness outspread,
Thou didst come thundering from thy mothers.
f Be firm, of strong limbs,
Swift, a mighty steed;
Be broad, of kindly seat,
Thou art the carrier of dust for Agni.
g Be auspicious [2], for offspring
Of men, O Angiras;
Scorch not sky and earth,
Nor the atmosphere, nor the trees.
h Let the steed advance, thundering
And resounding, the ass, the flier;
Bearing Agni of the dust
May he fall not before his day.
i The ass, well yoked to your chariot,
O ye strong ones, that thundereth,
May he as swift envoy
Bear hence Agni of the dust.
k The strong, bearing the strong Agni,
Germ of the waters, him of the ocean,
O Agni, come hither, for enjoyment [3],
As holy order and truth.
l O plants, do ye accept Agni here
Who cometh auspicious towards you;
Casting aside all hostilities, all evil imaginings,
Sitting down, may he smite away from us misfortune.
m O plants, do ye rejoice in him,
O ye that are rich in flowers, and have fair berries;
This germ of yours, of due season,
Hath sat him in his ancient seat.

iv. 1. 5.
a Radiant with extending blaze,
Do thou repel the enemy, the Raksas's hostility;
May I enjoy the protection of the great protector,
May I enjoy the leadership of Agni, easy to invoke.
b Ye, waters, are healing;
Further us to strength,
To see great joy.
c The most auspicious flavour that is yours,
Accord to us here,
Like eager mothers.
d To him may we come with satisfaction,
To whose dwelling ye quicken us,
O waters, and propagate us.
e Mitra [1], having united the earth
And the ground with light,
Agni well-born, all-knower,
Common to all men, the wide extending.
f For health I unite thee, for offspring; may the All-gods, common to all men, unite thee with the Anustubh metre, in the manner of Angiras.
g The Rudras, having gathered together the earth,
Kindled a great light;
Their ray undying
Shineth clear among the gods.
h United by the Vasus, the cunning Rudras,
The mud fit for the rite,
Making it smooth with her hands,
May Sinivali fashion [2] this (pan).
i Sinivali, of fair braids,
Of fair head-dress, with fair locks,
May she, O Aditi, O great one,
Place within thy hands the pan.
k Let Aditi fashion the pan with might,
With her arms , with wisdom,
Let her bear Agni in her womb
As a mother a child in her lap.
I Thou art the head of Makha.
m Ye are the two feet of the sacrifice.
n May the Vasus fashion thee with the Gayatri metre, in the manner of Angiras. Thou art the earth; may the Rudras fashion thee with the Tristubh metre, in the manner of Angiras. Thou art the atmosphere [3]; may the Adityas fashion thee with the Jagati metre in the manner of Angiras. Thou art the sky; may the All-gods, common to all men, fashion thee with the Anustubh metre, in the manner of Angiras. Thou art the quarters; thou art the fixed (quarter); fix in me offspring, increase of wealth, richness in cattle, richness in heroes, (subject) his fellows to the sacrificer.
o Thou art the girdle of Aditi.
p Let Aditi seize thy hole with the Pankti metre, in the manner of Angiras.
q Having made the great pan,
Wrought of clay, as a birthplace for Agni,
Aditi gave it to her sons,
(Saying), 'Let them cook it.'

e O Mitra, cook this pan; may it not break.
f This I place around thee, to prevent breaking.
g Mitra, extending, compasseth
This sky in greatness [2],
And the earth with his fame.
h The fame of Mitra, supporter of the people,
Of the god is eternal,
True, and most varied in fame.
i May the god Savitr dig thee out,
With fair hands, fair fingers,
Fair arms, with his might.
k Breaking not, O earth,
Do thou fill the regions, the quarters;

Stand upright, be thou firm.

iv. 1. 7.
a Let the half-years, the seasons, increase thee, O Agni,
The years, the Rsis, and what truths there are;
Shine with thy heavenly lustre,
Illuminate all the quarters of the earth.
b Be kindled, O Agni, and awake him;
Arise for great good fortune;
May he that waiteth on thee, O Agni, be not harmed;
May thy priests be famous, not the others.
c These Brahmans, O Agni, choose thee;
Be thou propitious, O Agni [1], to us in the sanctuary;
Slaying our rivals, conquering the foes,
Do thou watch unfailing in thine own home.
d Here, O Agni, do thou grant wealth;
May not the overcomers, anticipating (us); overcome thee;
May the lordly power be easily wielded by thee, O Agni
Let him who waiteth on thee prosper, unassailed.
e With good life, O Agni, unite thee with the lordly power;
O Agni, vie with Mitra in friendlihood;
Be thou the midmost of thine equals;
O Agni, shine forth here to be invoked by kings.
f (Be thou) over the [2] enemy, the obstructor,
Unwisdom, niggardliness, O Agni,
All obstacles do thou overcome,
And bestow upon us wealth with heroes.
g Unassailable, all-knower, unoverpowered,
Ruling, O Agni, supporting the lordly power, do thou shine here;
Through all the regions, freeing men from fear,
Do thou this day guard us for increase with kindliness.
h O Brhaspati, instigator, awake him;
The sharp do thou more thoroughly sharpen;
Increase him to great prosperity [3]
Let the All-gods rejoice in him.
i What time, O Brhaspati, thou didst free
From life yonder, from Yama's enmity,
The Açvins removed death from him,
O Agni, the physicians of the gods with their powers.
k We from the darkness,
Gazing on the higher light,
Surya a god among the gods,
Have come to the highest light.

iv. 1. 8.
a Uplifted are his kindling-sticks,
Uplifted and pure are the rays of Agni,
Most brilliant (are they) of the son of fair countenance.
b The son of self, the Asura, all-knower,
God, god among gods,
Anointeth the ways with mead and ghee.
c With mead thou attainest the sacrifice,
Delighting, as Naraçansa, O Agni,
The kindly god Savitr, with every boon.
d Hither he cometh, with might, with ghee,
The priest implored with adoration;
To Agni the ladles (move) when the rites proceed.
e Worship let him pay to the greatness of him, of Agni;
He [1] indeed is pre-eminent among the delightful,
The wealthy, the wisest, best bestower of wealth.
f The divine doors--all--preserve
The rules of him, of Agni,
Of wide expanse, lording it with dominion.
g May day and night
Like heavenly maidens in his birthplace
Protect this our sacrifice and offering.
h O ye divine Hotrs, sing ye
To our uplifted sacrifice, to Agni's tongue,
Make for us good offering.
i May the three goddesses sit on this strew,
Ida, Sarasvati [2], Bharati, the great, being sung.
k That seminal fluid of ours, wondrous,
Abundant, may Tvastr release
As increase of wealth with good heroes, as offspring to us.
l O tree, let free,
Bestowing with thyself among the gods;
Let Agni as queller make ready the oblation.
m O Agni, utter 'Hail!' O all-knower, over the oblation for Indra;
May all the gods rejoice in this offering.
n The golden germ first arose;
Born he was the only lord of creation;
He supporteth the earth and the sky [3]
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
o He that alone by his might is king
Of the breathing, the winking world,
Who is lord of these bipeds and quadrupeds;
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
p He who is giver of breath, giver of strength,
Upon whose bidding all, even the gods, wait,
Whose shadow is immortality and death;
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
He whose are these snowy mountains through his might,
Whose they call the ocean with the Rasa [4],
Whose two arms are these quarters;
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
r To whom the armies stablished
Through his aid gazed with minds disturbed,
Over whom on the rising of the sun it goeth;
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
s He by whom the dread earth and the sky were made firm,
By whom the heaven was established, by whom the vault,
Who is the measure of the region in the atmosphere;
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
t When the waters, the great ones, went
Bearing all [5] strength, begetting Agni,
Then one breath of the gods arose;
To what god shall we offer with oblation?
u He who in his might beheld the waters
Bearing strength, begetting Agni,
Who was the god alone over the gods;
To what god shall we offer with oblation?

iv. 1. 9.
a Purpose, Agni, impulse, hail! Mind, intellect, Agni, impulse, hail! Thought, knowledge, Agni, impulse, hail! Discrimination of speech, Agni, impulse, hail! To Manu, lord of creatures, hail! To Agni Vaiçvanara hail!
b Let every man choose the companionship
Of the god who leadeth;
Every man prayeth for wealth;
Let him choose glory that he may prosper; hail!
e Be not broken, nor come to harm;
Be firm and enduring;
O mother, daringly show thy heroism [1];
With Agni wilt thou do this deed.
d Be firm, O goddess earth, for prosperity;
Thou art the wile of the Asura, made with power;
Let this oblation be pleasing to the gods;
Do thou emerge uninjured at this our sacrifice.
e O Mitra, heat this pan; may it not break.
f This I place around thee, to prevent breaking.
g Feeding on wood, sipping clarified butter,
The ancient desirable Hotr,
Son of strength, the wondrous.
h From a far region
Come hither to these lower ones [2]
Favour those in the region where I am.
i From a far distance
Do thou of ruddy steeds come hither;
Of the dust, dear to many,
O Agni, do thou overcome obstructions.
k Do thou sit down in the lap of this mother,
O Agni, knowing all the ways;
Consume her not with light nor with heat,
Within her shine with pure radiance.
l O Agni, with glow
Within thine own seat of the pan,
Heating with her blaze,
Be thou, O all-knower, auspicious.
m Becoming auspicious to me, O Agni,
Do thou sit down auspicious;
Having made all the quarters auspicious
Sit here on thine own birthplace.

iv. 1. 10.
a Whatever logs we place
In thee, O Agni,
Be that ghee for thee;
Accept it, O youngest one.
b What the insect eateth,
What the ant climbeth over,
All that be ghee for thee;
Accept it, O youngest one.
c Mighty by night, unfailingly bearing (food)
For him as fodder to a stalled horse,
May we, O Agni, thy neighbours, be not harmed,
Rejoicing in increase of wealth, in food.
d Kindled on earth's navel [1], Agni
We invoke for great increase of wealth,
Delighting in drink, recipient of great praise, worthy of offering,
The victor, Agni, sustainer in battles.
e The hosts that attack,
That pierce, the trooping,
The thieves and the robbers,
Them, O Agni, do I place in thy mouth.
f With thy tusks the burglars,
With thy teeth the robbers,
With thy jaws the thieves, O blessed one,
Do thou chew, well chewed.
g The burglars among men,
The thieves and robbers in the forest,
The [2] mischief-workers in the thickets,
Them I place within thy jaws.
h The man who is hostile to us,
And him who hateth us,
Him who revileth us, and him who seeketh to hurt,
Every one of them do thou crush to atoms.
i Sharpened is my holy power,
Sharpened the strength and might,
Sharpened the conquering lordly power of him
Whose domestic priest I am.
k Their arms have I uplifted,
Their radiance, their might;
With holy power I waste the foes,
I support [3] my own.
I Shining like gold, he hath become widely resplendent,
For glory shining with immortal life;
Agni became immortal in his strength
What time prolific Dyaus begat him.
m The sage showeth all forms;
He hath produced bliss for biped and quadruped;
Savitr, the desirable, hath discerned the vault;
After the moving forward of the dawn he shineth.
n Night and the dawn, one-minded but of various form,
United suckle one child;
The radiant one shineth between sky and earth [4]
The gods, granters of wealth, support Agni.
o Thou art the bird of fair feathers; thy head the Trivrt (Stoma), thy eye the Gayatra, thy breath the Stoma, thy body the Vamadevya Saman, thy wings the Brhat and the Rathantara, thy tail the Yajñayajñiya, thy limbs the metres, thy hoofs the altars, thy name the Yajus formulae.
p Thou art the bird of fair feathers; go to the sky, fly to the heaven.

iv. 1. 11.
a O Agni, that sacrifice, that offering,
Which on all sides thou dost encircle,
It of a truth goeth to the gods.
b O Soma, the wondrous aids
That there are of thine for the generous man,
With these be thou our helper.
c Agni the, head.
d Be.
e Thou, O Soma.
f These abodes of thine.
g That excellent glory of Savitr,
The god, we meditate,
That he may stimulate our prayers.
h What we have done in thoughtlessness against the host divine,
With feeble insight, with violence as is man's way [1],
Among gods and men, do thou, O Savitr,
There instigate us to sinlessness.
i Impeller of righteousness,
Instigator of devotions,
Sarasvati hath established the sacrifice.
k May the maiden of the lightning, the one of varied life,
Sarasvati, wife of a hero, inspire our devotion;
In accord with the ladies, may she accord to the singer
Protection uninjured, and guardianship unsurpassable.
I May Pusan follow the cows for us,
May he guard our horses;
May Pusan win booty for us.
m Bright is part of thee, worthy of offering another [2],
Like day and night of various hue, like the sky art thou;
All magic thou dost further, O powerful one;
Propitious here, O Pusan, be thy bounty.
n They grew in might with their own power;
They mounted the vault, they made a broad seat;
When Visnu helped the strong one who causeth gladness,
Like birds they sat on the dear strew.
o Bear ye variegated praise to the strong singer,
The host of the Maruts, which hath strength;
Who with might endure might [3],
For the jocund ones, O Agni, the earth shakes.
p The All-gods.
q O All-gods.
r May sky and earth this day
Place among the gods this sacrifice,
Successful, touching the sky.
s Bring forward the parents born of old with now songs,
In the seat of holy order,
Come to us, O sky and earth, with the host divine;
Great is your protection.
t Awaken Agni with the praise,
Kindling the immortal;
May he place our oblations among the gods.
u Bearing the oblation, immortal,
The eager messenger, well-inclined,
Agni uniteth with our prayer.
v Health be they.
w For each prize.

a Thou art the step of Visnu, overcoming hostility, mount the Gayatri metre, step along the earth, excluded is he whom we hate. Thou art the step of Visnu, overcoming imprecations, mount the Tristubh metre, step along the atmosphere, excluded is he whom we hate.

b Agni hath cried, like Dyaus thundering,
Licking the earth, devouring the plants
Straightway on birth he shone aflame,
He blazeth with his light within the firmaments.
c O Agni, returner, to us return
With life, with radiance, with gain, with wisdom, with offspring, with wealth.
d O Agni [2], O Angiras, a hundred be thy returns,
A thousand thy movements;
With the increase of their increase
Do thou bring back for us what is lost,
Bring back to us wealth.
e Return with strength,
Return, O Agni, with food and life;
Again guard us on all sides.
f Return with wealth,
O Agni, fatten with the stream,
All-gaining on every side.
g Unloose from us, O Varuna, the highest,
The lowest, the midmost knot [3];
Then may we, O Aditya, in thy rule,
Be guiltless before Aditi.
h I have drawn thee, thou hast become within,
Be thou firm and motionless,
Lot all the folk desire thee;
In him establish the kingship.
i In greatness hath he arisen erect in the van of the dawns;
Emerging from the darkness, he hath come with the light;
Agni, with radiant brilliance, fair limbed,
On birth hath filled every seat.
k Do thou sit down in the lap of this mother [4],
O Agni, knowing all the ways;
Consume her not with light nor with heat,
Within her shine with pure radiance.
1 O Agni, with glow
Within thine own seat of the pan,
Heating with her blaze,
Be thou, O all-knower, auspicious.
m Becoming auspicious to me, O Agni,
Do thou sit down auspicious;
Having made all the quarters auspicious,
Sit here on thine own birthplace.
n The gander seated in purity, the bright one seated in the atmosphere,
The Hotr seated at the altar, the guest seated in the house,
Seated among men, seated in the highest, seated in holy order, seated in the firmament,
Born of the waters, born of the cows, born of holy order, born of the mountain, the great holy order.

iv. 2. 2.
a From the sky was Agni first born,
From us secondly he who knoweth all,
In the waters thirdly the manly,
The pious man singeth of him, the undying, as he kindleth him.
b We know thy three places threefold, O Agni,
We know thy seat that is established in many places;
We know thy highest name in secret;
We know the spring whence thou hast come.
c The manly souled kindleth thee in the ocean, in the waters,
In the breast of the sky, O Agni, he who gazeth on men;
Thee standing in the third region [1],
In the birthplace of holy order, the steers inspirited.
d Agni hath cried, like Dyaus thundering,
Licking the earth, devouring the plants;
Straightway on birth he shone aflame,
He blazeth with his light within the firmaments.
e Eager, purifying, the envoy, the wise one,
Agni, the immortal, hath been established among men;
He beareth and darteth forward his ruddy smoke;
The sky he attaineth with his pure radiance.
f The banner of the whole world, the germ [2],
Filled on birth the firmaments;
Even the firm mountain he cleft passing over,
When the five peoples sacrificed to Agni.
g Receptacle of prosperity, supporter of riches,
Granter of thoughts, guardian of the Soma,
Son of the bright one, of strength, the king
Is resplendent within the waters, kindled before the dawns.
h He who first maketh for thee to-day, O thou of wondrous radiance,
A cake rich in ghee, O god Agni;
Do thou bear him ever on to the better,
To glory allotted by the gods, O youngest one [3].
i Give him portion, O Agni, in praises;
Give him portion in every hymn that is sung,
Dear shall he be before Surya, dear before Agni
With what is born, what is to be born shall he be victorious.
k Thee, O Agni, the sacrificers through the days
Bear as many riches desirable;
With thee desiring wealth,
Eagerly they revealed the stall rich in kine.
l Shining like gold, he hath become widely resplendent,
For glory shining with immortal life;
Agni became immortal in his strength,
What time prolific Dyaus begat him.

iv. 2. 3.

a This is she that first dawned;
Within this (earth) she hath entered and moveth;
The new-made bride as mother beareth the mothers;
Three greatnesses attend her.
b Charming, the dawns, adorned,
Moving along a common birthplace,
Wives of the sun, they move, wise ones,
Making a banner of light, unaging, rich in seed.
c Three have followed the path of holy order,
Three cauldrons have come with the light,
Offspring one guardeth, strength one [1],

With the metres in their midst, go about in brilliance.

Look around on the lap of their mother.
h The Ekastaka, undergoing penance,
Hath borne a child, the great Indra;
Therewith the gods overpowered the Asuras;
Slayer of Asuras he became in his might.
i Ye have made me, who am not younger, the younger;
Speaking the truth I desire this;
May I [3] enjoy his lovingkindness as do ye;
May not one of you supplant another.

Accomplishing thy common task,
Bringing old age, thou hast come, O unaging dawn.

Leading the days, and bearer of offspring;
Though one, O Usas, in many places dost thou shine forth
Unaging thou dost make to age all else.

Who is fain to smite us contrary to right [3],
In the noose of destruction may he be caught,
Slay him with your most burning heat.
m The Maruts, of the year, fair singers,
With wide abodes, in troops among men,
May they from us unloosen the bonds of tribulation,
Those that burn, delighting, granting delight,
n Delight the eager gods, O thou most young,
Knowing the seasons, O lord of the season, do thou sacrifice here;
With the priests divine, O Agni,
Thou art the best sacrificer of Hotrs.

Of the householder's offering.
u Him to whom, the strong, the youthful maiden,
Rich in oblation, bearing ghee, approacheth night and morning,
To him his own devotion (approacheth) seeking wealth.
v O Agni, these most acceptable oblations,
Immortal one, bear for the divine worship;
Let them accept our fragrant (offerings).
w The playful horde of the Maruts,
Sporting, resplendent on the chariot [6],
O Kanvas, do ye celebrate.
x The Maruts, speeding like steeds,
Disport themselves like youths gazing at a spectacle,
Standing in the home like beauteous younglings,
Bestowing milk, like playful calves.
y At their advance the earth moves as if trembling,
When they yoke (their teams) for their journeys, for brilliance;
Playing, resounding, with flaming weapons,
They display their own greatness, the shakers.
z What time on the steeps ye pile the moving one,
Like birds, O Maruts, on whatever path [7],
The clouds spill their water on your chariots;
Do ye sprinkle for the praiser ghee of honey hue.
aa Agni with invocations
They ever invoke, lord of the people,
Bearer of the oblation, dear to many.

The Offerings to Rudra

iv. 5. 1.
a Homage to thy wrath, O Rudra,
To thine arrow homage also;
Homage to thy bow,
And homage to thine arms.
b With thy most kindly arrow,
And kindly bow,
With thy kindly missile,
Be gentle to us, O Rudra.
c That body of thine, O Rudra, which is kindly,
Not dread, with auspicious look,
With that body, most potent to heal,
O haunter of the mountains, do thou look on us.
d The arrow which, O haunter of mountains,
In thy hand [1] thou bearest to shoot,
That make thou kindly, O guardian of mountains;
Harm not the world of men.
e With kindly utterance thee
We address, O liver on the mountains,
That all our folk
Be free from sickness and of good cheer.
f The advocate hath spoken in advocacy,
The first divine leech,
Confounding all the serpents
And all sorceries.
g The dusky, the ruddy,
The brown, the auspicious,
And the Rudras which in thousands
Lie around this (earth) in the quarters [2],
Their wrath do we deprecate.
h He who creepeth away,
Blue-necked and ruddy,
Him the cowherds have seen,
Have seen the bearers of water
And him all creatures;
May be, seen, be gentle unto us.
i Homage to the blue-necked,
Thousand-eyed one, the bountiful
And to those that are his warriors
I have paid my homage.
k Unfasten from the two notches
Of thy bow the bowstring,
And cast thou down
The arrows in thy hand [3].
1 Unstringing thy bow,
Do thou of a thousand eyes and a hundred quivers,
Destroying the points of thine arrows,
Be gentle and kindly to us.
m Unstrung is the bow of him of the braided hair
And arrowless his quiver;
His arrows have departed,
Empty is his quiver.
n O most bountiful one, the missile
That is in thy hand, thy bow,
With it on all sides do thou guard us,
Free from sickness.
o Homage to thy weapon,
Unstrung, dread;
And homage to thy two hands,
To thy bow.
p May the missile from thy bow
Avoid us on every side,
And do thou lay far from us
This quiver that is thine.

PRAPATHAKA VI
The Preparation of the Fire

iv. 6. 1.
a The strength resting on the stone, the bill,
On the wind, on Parjanya, on the breath of Varuna,
Brought together from the waters, from the plants, from the trees;
That food and strength do ye, O Maruts, bounteously bestow upon us.
b In the stone is thy hunger; let thy pain reach N. N., whom we hate.
c With the wind of the ocean
We envelop thee, O Agni;
Be thou purifying and auspicious to us.
d With the caul of winter
We envelop thee, O Agni;
Be thou purifying and auspicious to us.
e Down upon earth [1], upon the reed,
Upon the waters lower (do thou descend);
Thou, O Agni, art the bile of the waters,
f O female frog, with these come hither;
Do thou make this sacrifice of ours
Pure in hue and auspicious.
g Pure, with radiance wonderful,
On earth he hath shone as with the light of dawn.
h Who (cometh) to battle,
Moving with strength as on Etaça's course,
In the heat unathirst, immortal.
i O Agni, the purifying, with thy light,
O god, with thy pleasant tongue,
Bring hither the gods [2], and sacrifice.
k Do thou, O shining and purifying one,
O Agni, bring hither the gods
To our sacrifice and our oblation.
1 This is the meeting of the waters,
The abode of the ocean;
May thy bolts afflict another than us;
Be thou purifying and auspicious to us.
m Homage to thy heat, thy blaze
Homage be to thy light;
May thy bolts afflict another than us;
Be thou purifying and auspicious to us.
n To him that sitteth in man, hail! [3] To him that sitteth in the waters, hail! To him that sitteth in the wood, hail! To him that sitteth on the strew, hail! To him that findeth the heaven, hail!
o Those gods among gods, worshipful among the worshipful,
Who await their yearly portion,
Who eat not oblations, in this sacrifice
Do ye delight yourselves with honey and ghee.
p The gods who above the gods attained godhead,
Who lead the way to this holy power,
Without whom no place whatever is pure,
Neither on the heights of sky or earth are they.
q Giver of expiration art thou [4], of inspiration, of cross-breathing,
Giver of eyesight, giver of splendour, giver of wide room;
May thy bolts afflict another than us;
Be thou purifying and auspicious to us.
r May Agni with his piercing blaze
Cast down every foe;
May Agni win for us wealth.
s With his countenance the kindly one
Will sacrifice to the gods for us, most skilled to win prosperity by sacrifice;
Guardian undeceived and protector of us,
O Agni, shine forth with radiance and with wealth.

iv. 6. 2.
a He who sat down, offering all these beings,
As Hotr, the seer, our father,
He seeking wealth with prayer,
Hath entered into the boon of the first of coverers.
b Since Viçvakarman is mighty in mind,
Disposer, ordainer, and highest seer,
Their offerings rejoice in food,
Where say they is one beyond the seven Rsis.
c He who is our father, our begetter, the ordainer,
Who begot us from being unto being [1],
Who alone assigneth their names to the gods,
Him other beings approach for knowledge.
d Wealth they won by offering to him
The seers of old like singers in abundance,
They who fashioned these beings illumined and unillumined
In the expanse of space.
e Ye shall not find him who produced this world;
Another thing shall be betwixt you;
Enveloped in mist and with stammering
The singers of hymns move enjoying life.
f Beyond the sky, beyond this [2] earth,
Beyond the gods, what is secret from the Asuras,
What germ first did the waters bear,
When all the gods came together?
g This germ the waters first bore,
When all the gods came together;
On the navel of the unborn is set the one
On which doth rest all this world.
h Viçvakarman, the god, was born;
Then second the Gandharva;
Third the father, begetter of plants [31
In many a place did he deposit the germ of the waters.
i Father of the eye, the sage with his mind,
Produced these two worlds rich in ghee,
When the fore ends were made firm,
Then did sky and earth extend.
k With eyes on every side, with a face on every side,
With hands on every side, with feet on every side,
The one god producing sky and earth
Welds them together with arms, with wings.
l What was the basis?
Which and what his support?
When producing earth [4] Viçvakarman, all-seeing,
Disclosed the sky with his might.
m What was the wood, and what the tree,
Whence they formed sky and earth?
O ye wise ones, inquire with your minds
On what he stood as he supported the worlds.
n Thy highest, lowest,
Midmost abodes here, O Viçvakarman,
In the offering do thou teach thy comrades, O faithful one;
Do thou thyself sacrifice to thyself, rejoicing.
o The lord of speech, Viçvakarman,
Let us invoke this day to aid us [5], thought yoked for strength,
May he delight in our nearest offerings,
He with all healing, to aid (us), the doer of good deeds.
p O Viçvakarman, waxing great with the oblation,
Do thou thyself sacrifice to thyself rejoicing;
May the others around, our foes, be confused;
May our patrons here be rich.
q O Viçvakarman, with the oblation as strengthening,
Thou didst make Indra, the protector, free from scathe,
To him the clans of old bowed in homage,
That he might be dread, to be severally invoked.
r To the ocean, the moving,
The lord of streams, homage!
To the lord of all the streams
Do ye offer, to Viçvakarman,
Through all the days the immortal offering.

iv. 6. 3.
a O Agni, to whom ghee is offered,
Do thou lead him forward;
Unite him with increase of wealth,
With offspring and with wealth.
b O Indra, bring him to the fore,
That he may be lord over his fellows;
Unite him with splendour,
That he may assign their shares to the gods.
c Him, O Agni, do thou exalt
In whose house we make the offering;
To him may the gods lend aid,
And he the lord of holy power.
d May the All-gods thee [1],
O Agni, bear up with their thoughts;
Be thou to us most propitious,
With kindly face, abounding in light.
e May the five regions divine aid the sacrifice,
The goddesses driving away poverty and hostility,
And giving to the lord of the sacrifice increase of wealth.
In increase of wealth the sacrifice hath been established,
Waxing great on the kindled fire,
Grasped with hymns as wings, to be adored;
They sacrificed embracing the heated cauldron.
g When with strength the gods laboured at the sacrifice
For the divine supporter, the enjoyer,
Serving the gods, benign, with a hundred drinks (was it);
The gods kept embracing the sacrifice [2].
h With the rays of the sun, with tawny hair,
Savitr hath raised before (us) his unending light;
On his instigation fareth Pusan the god,
The guardian, gazing on all things.
i The gods stand serving as priests for the gods;
Ready (is it) for the immolator, let the immolator sacrifice;
Where the fourth offering goeth to the oblation,
Thence let our pure invocations be accepted.
k As measurer he standeth in the midst of the sky,
Filling the two worlds and the atmosphere;
The all-reaching [3], the butter-reaching, he discerneth,
Between the eastern and the western mark.
l Bull, ocean, ruddy bird,
He hath entered the birthplace of his ancient sire;
In the middle of the sky is the dappled stone set down
He hath stepped apart, he guardeth the two ends of space.
m All songs have caused Indra to wax
To encompass the ocean,
Best charioteer of charioteers,
True lord and lord of strength.
n Let the sacrifice invite favour, and bring (to us) the gods; let the god, Agni, offer and bring (to us) the gods.
o With the impulse of strength,
With elevation he hath seized me;
Then Indra hath made my enemies
Humble by depression.
p The gods have increased my prayer,
Which is elevation and depression;
Then do ye, O Indra and Agni,
Scatter my foes on every side.

iv. 6. 4.
a Swift, like a bull sharpening his horns, the warrior
Fond of slaughter, disturber of the people,
Bellowing, unwinking, sole hero,
Indra at once conquered a hundred hosts.
b With the bellowing, unwinking, conquering,
Fighter, hard to overthrow, and daring Indra,
With Indra do ye conquer, do ye withstand
The foe, O heroes, with the strong one who holdeth the arrow in his hands.
c He is mighty with those who have arrows in their hands and quivers,
Indra who joineth hosts with his band,
Conquering in combat, drinker of Soma, with many a band,
With bow uplifted, and shooter with well-drawn arrows.
d O Brhaspati, fly round with thy chariot [1],
Slaying the foe, driving away the enemy;
Defeating hosts, destroyer, victor in battle,
Be thou protector of our chariots.
e The cleaver of the cowstalls, finder of the cows, with the thunderbolt on his arm,
Victorious, crushing in might a host,
Be heroes, O my fellows, like him;
O comrades, follow in Indra's footsteps.
f Conspicuous by might, strong, heroic,
Enduring, mighty, steadfast, dread,
Surpassing heroes and warriors born of strength,
Do thou, winning kine, mount, O Indra, thy victorious car.
g In might penetrating the cowstalls,
Impetuous [2], the hero, Indra, with wrath a hundredfold,
Hard to resist, enduring in battle, unovercomable,
May he aid our armies in the battles.
h Indra (be) their leader, and let Brhaspati,
The sacrificial fee, the sacrifice and Soma go before;
Let the Maruts precede the hosts divine,
That overthrow and conquer.
i Of Indra, the strong, of Varuna, the king,
Of the Adityas, of the Maruts the mighty host--
The voice hath ascended of the gods
Great-hearted that shake the worlds as they conquer.
k Ours (be) Indra, when the standards meet;
Ours be the arrows that conquer [3];
Ours be the heroes who are victors,
And us do ye aid, O gods, at our invocations.
l Exalt our weapons, O bounteous one,
Exalt the might of my warriors;
Exalt the strength of the steed, O slayer of Vrtra,
Let the sound of the conquering chariots arise.
m Go ye forward, O heroes; conquer;
Be your arms strong;
May Indra accord you protection
That ye may be unassailable.
n Let loose, fly forward,
O arrow, expelled with holy power;
Go to our foes, and enter [4] them;
Not one of them do thou spare.
o Thy vital parts I clothe with armour;
May Soma, the king, cover thee with immortality,
Space broader than broad be thine;
May the gods take delight in thy victory.
p When the arrows fly together
Like boys unshorn,
Then may Indra, slayer of foes,
Accord us protection for ever.

iv. 6. 5.
a Along the eastern quarter do thou advance, wise one;
Be thou, O Agni, of Agni the harbinger here;
Illumine with thy radiance all the regions;
Confer strength on our bipeds and quadrupeds.
b Mount ye, with Agni, to the vault,
Bearing him of the pan in your hands;
Having gone to the ridge of the sky, to the heaven,
Do ye eat, mingled with the gods.
c From earth have I mounted to the atmosphere;
From the atmosphere have I mounted to the sky;
From the ridge of the vault of the sky
Have I attained the heaven, the light [1].
d Going to the heaven, they look not away;
They mount the sky, the two worlds,
They who extended, wisely,
The sacrifice, streaming on every side.
e O Agni, advance, first of worshippers,
Eye of gods and mortals;
Pressing on in unison with the Bhrgus,
Let the sacrificers go to heaven, to prosperity.
f Night and the dawn, one-minded, but of various form,
United suckle one child;
The radiant one shineth between sky and earth;
The gods, granters of wealth, support Agni.
g O Agni, of a thousand eyes [2], of a hundred heads,
A hundred are thy expirations, a thousand thine inspirations;
Thou art lord of wealth a thousandfold;
To thee as such let us pay homage for strength, hail!
h Thou art the winged bird, sit on the earth; sit on the ridge of earth; with thy blaze fill the atmosphere, with thy light establish the sky, with thy brilliance make firm the quarters.
i Receiving offering, fair of face, O Agni;
Sit down in front in thine own birthplace, in due order;
In this higher place,
O All-gods [3], do ye sit with the sacrificer.
k Enkindled, O Agni, shine before us,
O most youthful, with unfailing beam;
Ever upon thee strength awaiteth.
I Let us pay homage to thee in thy highest birth, O Agni;
Let us pay homage with praises in thy lower abode;
The place of birth whence thou didst come, to that I offer;
In thee when kindled they offered the oblations.
m That various lovingkindness given to all men,
Of Savitr the adorable, I choose,
That mighty fat cow of his which Kanva milked,
Streaming with a thousand (draughts) of milk [4].
n Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues,
Seven seers, seven dear abodes;
Seven Hotras sevenfold sacrifice to thee
Seven birthplaces with ghee do thou fill.
o Such like, other like, thus like, similar, measured, commensurate, harmonious;
p Of pure radiance, of varied radiance, of true radiance, the radiant, true, protector of holy order, beyond distress [5];
q Winning holy order, winning truth, host-conquering, having a good host, with foes within, with foes afar, the troop;
r Holy order, true, secure, supporting, supporter, upholder, upholding;
s Such like, thus like, do ye come to us, similar and equal.
t Measured and commensurate, to aid us, harmonious, at this sacrifice, O Maruts.
u On Indra attend the divine folk, the Maruts; even as the divine folk, the Maruts, attend on Indra, so may the folk divine and human, attend on this sacrificer.

The Horse Sacrifice

iv. 6. 6.
a As of a thunder-cloud is the face of the warrior
As he advanceth to the lap of the battles;
Be victorious with unpierced body;
Let the might of thine armour protect thee.
b By the bow cows, by the bow the contest may we win,
By the bow dread battles may we win;
The bow doth work displeasure to the foe;
By the bow let us win in all the quarters.
c As if about to speak it approacheth the ear,
Embracing its dear comrade,
Like a woman this bowstring twangeth stretched over the bow [1],
Saving in the battle.
d They coming together as a maiden to the assembly,
As a mother her child, shall bear (the arrow) in their lap;
In unison shall they pierce the foes,
These two ends springing asunder, the enemies.
e Father of many (daughters), many his sons,
He whizzeth as he goeth to battle,
The quiver, slung on the back, yielding its content,
Doth conquer every band and army.
f Standing on the chariot be guideth his steeds before him
Wheresoever he desireth, good charioteer;
The might of the reins [2] do ye admire;
The reins behind obey the mind (of the driver).
g Shrilly the strong-hooved horses neigh,
As with the cars they show their strength;
Trampling with their forefeet the enemy
They unflinchingly destroy the foe.
h The chariot-bearer is his oblation by name,
Where is deposited his armour and his weapon;
Then may we sit on the strong car,
All the days, with friendly hearts.
i The fathers with pleasant seats, granting strength,
A support in trouble mighty and profound,
With varied hosts, with arrows to strengthen them, free,
With real heroes, broad conquerors of hosts.
k The Brahmans [3], the fathers worthy of the Soma,
And sky and earth, unequalled be propitious to us;
May Pusan guard us from misfortune, us that prosper holy order
Do thou guard; may no foe overpower us.
I A feather her garment, a deer her tooth,
Tied with cowhide she flieth shot forth;
Where men run together and apart,
There may the arrows accord us protection.
m O thou of straight path, avoid us;
Be our body as of stone
May Soma favour us,
And Aditi [4] grant protection!
n Their backs it smites,
Their thighs it belabours;
O horse-whip, do ye stimulate
The skilled horses in the battles.
o Like a snake with its coils it encircleth his arm,
Fending off the friction of the bowstring,
Let the hand-guard, knowing all cunning,
Manfully guard the man on all sides.
p O lord of the forest, be strong of limb,
Our comrade, efficacious, of great strength;
Thou art tied with cowhide, be thou strong;
Let him that mounteth thee conquer what is to be conquered.
q From sky, from earth [5] is might collected,
From trees is strength gathered;
The might of the waters surrounded with the kine,
Indra's thunderbolt, the chariot, do thou adore with oblation.
r The thunderbolt of Indra, the face of the Maruts,
The embryo of Mitra, the navel of Varuna,
Do thou, accepting this our sacrifice,
O chariot divine, take to thyself the oblations.
s Roar to earth and sky;
Let the scattered world be ware of thee in many places;
Do thou, O drum, in unison with Indra and the gods [6],
Drive away the foe further than far.
t Roar thou! Grant us force and might.
Thunder, overthrowing obstacles;
Snort away, O drum, misfortune hence;
Indra's fist art thou; show thy strength.
u Drive to us those, and these make to come to us;
The drum speaketh aloud for a signal (of battle)
Our heroes winged with steeds meet together;
Be our chariotmen victorious, O Indra.

iv. 6. 7.
a When first thou didst cry on birth,
Arising from the ocean or the dust,
The wings of the eagle, the limbs of the gazelle,
That is thy famed birth, O steed.
b The steed given by Yama hath Trita yoked,
It Indra first mounted,
The bridle of it the Gandharva grasped;
O Vasus, from the sun ye fashioned the steed.
c Thou art Yama, O steed, thou art Aditya;
Thou art Trita by secret ordinance;
Thou art entirely separated from Soma [1];
Three, they say, are thy bonds in the sky.
d Three, they say, are thy bonds in the sky,
Three in the waters, three within the ocean
And like Varuna to me thou appearest, O steed,
Where, say they, is thy highest birthplace.
e These, O swift one, are thy cleansings,
These the placings down of thy hooves in victory;
Here I have seen thy fair ropes,
Which the guards of holy order guard.
f The self of thee with my mind I perceived from afar,
Flying with wings from below through the sky [2];
Thy head I saw speeding with wings
On paths fair and dustless.
g Here I saw thy highest form,
Eager to win food in the footstep of the cow;
When a mortal man pleaseth thy taste,
Then most greedily dost thou consume the plants.
h Thee follows the chariot, thee the lover, O steed,
Thee the kine, thee the portion of maidens;
Thy friendship the companies have sought;
The gods have imitated thy strength [3].
i Golden his horns, iron his feet;
Swift as thought, Indra was his inferior;
The gods came to eat his oblation
Who first did master the steed.
k Full haunched, of slender middle,
The heroic divine steeds,
Vie together like cranes in rows,
When the horses reach the divine coursing-place
1 Thy body is fain to fly, O steed;
Thy thought is like the blowing wind;
Thy horns are scattered in many places,
They wander busy in the woods.
m To [4] the slaughter the swift steed hath come,
Pondering with pious mind;
The goat, his kin, is led before,
Behind him come the sages to sing.
n To his highest abode hath the steed come,
To his father and his mother;
To-day do thou go, most welcome, to the gods;
Then boons shall he assign to the generous.

iv. 6. 8.
a Let not Mitra, Varuna, Aryaman, Ayu,
Indra, Rbhuksan, the Maruts disregard us,
When we shall proclaim before the assembly
The might of the strong god-born steed.
b When they bear before him, covered with a garment and with wealth
The gift they have seized,
The goat, all-formed, bleating,
Goeth straight to the dear stronghold of Indra and Pusan.
c This goat is led before the strong steed
As share of Pusan, connected with the All-gods,
When Tvastr impels him as an acceptable sacrifice
Together with the steed for fair renown [1].
d When men thrice lead round in due season
The steed going to the gods as an acceptable offering
Then first goeth Pusan's share,
The goat announcing the sacrifice to the gods.
e Hotr Adhvaryu, atoner, fire kindler,
Holder of the stone, and skilled reciter,
With this well-prepared sacrifice
Well offered do ye fill the channels.
f The cutters of the stake, the bearers of the stake,
And they that fashion the top piece for the stake for the horse,
And they that collect the cooking-pot for the steed [2],
May their approval quicken us.
g He hath come forth--efficacious hath been my prayer--
To the regions of the gods, straight backed;
In him the sages, the seers, rejoice,
For the prosperity of the gods a good friend have we made.
h The bond of the strong one, the tie of the steed,
The head stall, the rope of him,
And the grass placed in his mouth,
May all these of thine be with the gods.
i Whatever of the horse's raw flesh [3] the fly eateth,
Whatever on the chip or the axe hath stuck,
Whatever is on the hands, the nails of the slayer,
May all these of thine be with the gods.
k The refuse that bloweth forth from the belly,
The smell of raw flesh,
Let the slayers see that in order
Let them cook the fat to a turn.
I Whatever flieth away from thy limb
As it is cooked by the fire when thou art spitted,
Let it fall not on earth, nor on the grass;
Be that given to the eager gods.

iv. 6. 9.
a Those who watch for the cooking of the strong one,
And call out, 'It is fragrant; take it out,'
And who wait to beg for the meat of the steed,
May their approval quicken us.
b The trial spoon of the meat-cooking pot,
The vessels to hold the juice,
The coverings of the dishes for warming,
The hooks, the crates, attend the steed.
c The starting-place, the sitting down, the turning,
The hobbles of the steed,
What it hath drunk, what it hath eaten as fodder [1],
May all these of thine be with the gods.
d May Agni, smoke smelling, not make thee crackle;
May not the radiant pot be broken, smelling;
Offered, delighted in, approved, offered with the Vasat cry,
The gods accept the horse.
e The garment they spread for the horse,
The upper garment, the golden (trappings),
The bond of the steed, the hobble,
As dear to the gods they offer.
f If one hath smitten thee, riding thee driven with force,
With heel or with whip [2],
As with the ladle the parts of the oblation in the sacrifice,
So with holy power all these of thine I put in order.
g The four and thirty ribs of the strong steed,
Kin of the gods, the axe meeteth;
Skilfully do ye make the joints faultless;
Declaring each part, do ye cut it asunder.
h One carver is there of the steed of Tvastr
Two restrainers are there, so is the use;
Those parts of thy limbs that I place in order,
Those in balls I offer in the fire.
i Let not thy dear self distress thee [3] as thou comest;
Let not the axe stay in thy body;
May no greedy skilless carver,
Missing the joints, mangle thy limbs with the knife.
k Thou dost not die, indeed, thou art not injured,
On easy paths thou goest to the gods;
The bays, the dappled ones, have become thy yoke-fellows;
The steed bath stood under the yoke of the ass.
I Wealth of kine for us, may the strong one (grant), wealth in horses,
Men and sons, and every form of prosperity;
May Aditi confer on us sinlessness;
Kingship for us may the horse rich in offering gain.

Above the third firmament, in the light of the sky.

O thou of the bay steeds, be gracious unto our progeny;
Harm us not [3], abandon not us.
i May our rivals depart;
With Indra and Agni we overthrow them;
The Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas have made me
A dread corrector and overlord, sky reaching.
k Hitherward do we summon Indra from thence,
Him who is winner of cows, of booty, and winner too of horses;
Do thou accept this sacrifice at our invocation;
Ally of it we make thee, O lord of the bays.
