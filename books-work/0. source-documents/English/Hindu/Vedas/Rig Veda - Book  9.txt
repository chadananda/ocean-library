Worshipful laws and strength in kine.
15 Over the cleansing sieve have flowed the Somas, blent with curdled milk,
Effused for Indra Thunder-armed.
16 Soma, do thou most rich in sweets, a gladdening drink most dear to Gods,
Flow to the sieve to bring us wealth.
17 For Indra, living men adorn the Tawny Courser in the streams, Indu, the giver of delight.
18 Pour for us, Soma, wealth in gold, in horses and heroic sons,
Bring hither strength in herds of kine.
19 For Indra pour ye on the fleece him very sweet to taste, who longs.
For battle as it were in war.
20 The singers, seeking help, adorn the Sage who must be decked with songs:
Loud bellowing the Steer comes on,
21 The singers with their thoughts and hymns have, in the stream of sacrifice,
Caused Soma, active Steer, to roar.
22 God, working with mankind, flow on; to Indra go thy gladdening juice:
To Vayu mount as Law commands
23 O Soma, Pavamana, thou pourest out wealth that brings renown:
Enter the lake, as one we love.
24 Soma thou flowest chasing foes and bringing wisdom and delight:
Drive off the folk who love not Gods.
25 The Pavamanas have been poured, the brilliant drops of Soma juice,
For holy lore of every kind.
26 The Pavamanas have been shed, the beautiful swift Soma-drops,
Driving all enemies afar.
27 From, heaven, from out the firmament, hath Pavamana been effused
Upon the summit of the earth.
28 O Soma, Indu, very wise, drive, being purified, with thy stream
All foes, all Raksasas away.
29 Driving the Raksasas afar, O Soma, bellowing, pour for us
Most excellent and splendid strength.
30 Soma, do thou secure for us the treasures of the earih and heaven,
Indu, all boons to be desired.

HYMN LXIV. Soma Pavamana.

1. Soma, thou art a splendid Steer, a Steer, O God, with steerlike sway:
Thou as a Steer ordainest laws.
2 Steer-strong thy might is as a steer's, steerstrong thywood, steer-like thy drink
A Steer indeed, O Steer, art thou.
3 Thou, Indu, as a vigorous horse, hast neighed together steeds and kine:
Unbar for us the doors to wealth.
4 Out of desire of cows and steeds and horses. potent Soma-drops,
Brilliant and swift, have been effused.
5 They purified in both the hands, made beautiful by holy men,
Flow onward to the fleecy cloth.
6 These Soma juices shall pour forth all treasures for the worshipper
From heaven and earth and firmament.
7 The streams of Pavamana, thine, Finder of all, have been effused,
Even as Surya's rays of light.
8 Making the light that shines from heaven thou flowest on to every form
Soma, thou swellest like a sea.
9 Urged on thou sendest out thy voice, O Pavamana; thou hast moved,
Like the God Surya, to the sieve.
10 Indu, Enlightener, Friend, hath been purified by the sages' hymns:
So starts the charioteer his steed-
11 Thy God-delighting wave which hath flowed to purifying seive,
Alighting in the home of Law.
12 Flow to our sieve, a gladdening draught that hath most intercourse with Gods,
Indu, to Indra for his drink.
13 Flow onward with a stream for food, made beautiful by sapient men:
Indu with sheen approach the milk.
14 While thou art cleansed, Song-Lover, bring comfort and vigour to the folk,
Poured, Tawny One! on milk and curds.
15 Purified for the feast of Gods, go thou to Indra's special place,
Resplendent, guided by the strong.
16 Accelerated by the hymn, the rapid drops of Soma juice
Have flowed, urged onward, to the lake.
17 Easily have the living drops, made beautiful, approached the lake,
Yea, to the place of sacrifice.
18 Compass about, our faithful Friend, all our possessions with thy might:
Guard, hero like, our sheltering home.
19 Loud neighs the Courser Etasa, with singers, harnessed for the place,
Guided for travel to the lake.
20 What time the Swift One resteth in the golden place of sacrifice,
He leaves the foolish far away.
21 The friends have sung in unison, the prudent wish to sacrifice:
Down sink the unintelligent.
22 For Indra girt by Maruts, flow, thou Indu, very rich in sweets,
To sit in place of sacrifice.
23 Controlling priests and sages skilled in holy song adorn thee well:
The living make thee beautiful.
24 Aryaman, Mitra, Varuna drink Pavamana's juice, yea, thine:
O Sage, the Maruts drink thereof.
25 O Soma, Indu, thou while thou art purified urgest onward speech.
Thousandfold, with the lore of hymns.
26 Yea, Soma, Indu, while thou art purified do thou bring to us
Speech thousandfold that longs for war.
27 O Indu, Much-invoked, while thou art purifying, as the Friend.
Of these men enter thou the lake.
28 Bright are these Somas blent with milk, with light that flashes brilliantly. And form that utters loud acclaim.
29 Led by his drivers, and sent forth, the Strong Steed hath come nigh for spoil,
Like warriors when they stand arrayed.
30 Specially, Soma, coming as a Sage from heaven to prosper us,
Flow like the Sun for us to see.

HYMN LXV. Soma Pavamana.

1. THE, glittering maids send Sura forth, the glorious sisters, close-allied,
Send Indu forth, their mighty Lord.
2 Pervade, O Pavamana, all our treasures with repeated light,
God, coming hither from the Gods.
3 Pour on us, Pavamana, rain, as service and rain praise for Gods:
Pour all to be our nourishment.
4 Thou art a Steer by lustre: we, O Pavamana, faithfully
Call upon thee the Splendid One.
5 Do thou, rejoicing, nobly-armed! pour upon us heroic strength:
O Indu, come thou bitherward.
6 When thou art cleansed with both the hands and dipped in waters, with the wood.
Thou comest to the gathering-place.
7 Sing forth your songs, as Vyasva sang, to Soma Pavamana, to,
The Mighty One with thousand eyes;
8 Whose coloured sap they drive with stones, the yellow meath-distilling juice,
Indu for Indra, for his drink.
9 We seek to gain the friendly love of thee that Strong and Mighty One,
Of thee the winner of all wealth.
10 Flow onward with thy stream, a Steer, inspiriting the Maruts' Lord,
Winning all riches by thy might.
11 I send thee forth to battle from the press, O Pavamana, Strong,
Sustainer, looker on the light.
12 Acknowledged by this song of mine, flow, tawny-coloured, with thy stream
Incite to battle thine ally.
13 O Indu, visible to all pour out for us abundant food:
Soma, be thou our prosperer.
14 The pitchers, Indu, with thy streams have sung aloud in vigorous might
Enter them, and let Indra drink.
15 O thou whose potent gladdening juice they milk out with the stones, flow on,
Destroyer of our enemies.
16 King Pavamana is implored with holy songs, on man's behalf,
To travel through the firmament.
17 Bring us, O Indu, hundredfold increase of kine, and noble steeds,
The gift of fortune for our help.
18 Pressed for the banquet of the Gods, O Soma, bring us might, and speed,
Like beauty for a brilliant show.
19 Soma, flow on exceeding bright with loud roar to the wooden vats,
Falcon-like resting in thine home.
20 Soma, the Water-winner flows to Indra, Vayu, Varuna,
To Visnu and the Marut host.
21 Soma , bestowing food upon our progeny, from every sides,
Pour on us riches thousandfold
22 The Soma juices which have been expressed afar or near at hand,
Or there on Saryanavan's bank,
23 Those pressed among Arjikas, pressed among the active, in men's homes,
Or pressed among the Races Five-
24 May these celestial drops, expressed, pour forth upon us, as they flow,
Rain from the heavens apd hero strength.
25 Urged forward o'er the ox-hide flows the Lovely One of tawny hue,
Lauded by Jamadagni's song.
26 Like horses urged to speed, the drops, bright, stirring vital power, when blent
With milk, are beautified in streams.
27 So they who toil with juices send thee forward for the Gods' repast:
So with this splendour flow thou on.
28 We choose to-day that chariot-steed of thine, the Strong, that brings us bliss,
The Guardian, the desire of all,
29 The Excellent, the Gladdener, the Sage with heart that understands,
The Guardian, the desire of all;
30 Who for ourselves, O thou Most Wise, is wealth and fair intelligence,
The Guardian, the desire of all.

HYMN LXVI. Soma Pavamana.

1. FOR holy lore of every sort, flow onward thou whom all men love.
A Friend to be besought by friends.
2 O'er all thou rulest with these Two which, Soma Pavamana, stand,
Turned, as thy stations, hitherward.
3 Wise Soma Pavamana, thou encompassest on every side
Thy stations as the seasons come.
4 Flow onward, generating food, for precious boons of every kind,
A Friend for friends, to be our help.
5 Upon the lofty ridge of heaven thy bright rays with their essences,
Soma, spread purifying power.
6 O Soma, these Seven Rivers flow, as being thine, to give command:
The Streams of milk run forth to thee.
7 Flow onward, Soma in a stream, effused to gladden Indra's heart,
Bringing imperishable fame.
8 Driving thee in Vivasvan's course, the Seven Sisters with their hymns
Made melody round thee the Sage.
9 The virgins deck thee o'er fresh streams to drive thee to the sieve when thou,
A singer, bathest in the wood.
10 The streams of Pavamana, thine, Sage, Mighty One, have pouredthem forth.
Like coursers eager for renown.
11 They have been poured upon the fleece towards the meath-distilling vat:
The holy songs have sounded forth.
12 Like milch-kine coming home, the drops of Soma juice have reached the lake,
Have reached the place of sacrifice.
13 O Indu, to our great delight the running waters flow to us,
When thou wilt robe thyself in milk.
14 In this thy friendship, and with thee to help us, fain to sacrifice,
Indu, we crave thy friendly love.
15 Flow on, O Soma, for the great Viewer of men, for gain of Idne
Enter thou into Indra's throat.
16 Best art thou, Soma, of the great, Strongest of strong ones, Indu: thou
As Warrior ever hast prevailed.
17 Mightier even than the strong, more valiant even than the brave,
More libpral than the bountiful,
18 Soma, as Sura, bring us food, win offspring of our bodies: we
Elect thee for our friendship, we elect thee for companionship.
19 Agni, thou pourest life; send down upon us food and vigorous strength;
Drive thou misfortune far away,
20 Agni is Pavamana, Sage, Chief Priest of all the Races Five:
To him whose wealth is great we pray.
21 Skilled in thy task, O Agni, pour splendour with hero strength on us,
Granting me wealth that nourishes.
22 Beyond his enemies away to sweet praise Pavamana flows,
Like Surya visible to all.
23 Adorned by living men, set forth for entertainment, rich in food,
Far-sighted Indu is a Steed.
24 He, Pavamana, hath produced the lofty Law, the brilliant light,
Destroying darkness black of hue.
25 From tawny Pavamana, the Destroyer, radiant streams have sprung,
Quick streams from him whose gleams are swift.
26 Best rider of the chariot, praised with fairest praise mid beauteous ones,
Gold-gleaming with the Marut host,
27 May Pavamana, best to win the booty, penetrate with rays,
Giving the singer hero strength.
28 Over the fleecy sieve hath flowed the drop effused: to Indra comes
Indu while he is purified
29 This Soma, through the pressing-stones, is sporting on the oxhide, and
Summoning Indra to the draught.
30 O Pavamana, bless us, so that we may live, with that bright milk
Of thine which hath been brought from heaven.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HYMN LXVII. Soma and Others.

1. THOU, Soma, hast a running stream, joyous, most strong at sacrifice:
Flow bounteously bestowing wealth.
2 Effused as cheerer of the men, flowing best gladdener, thou art
A Prince to Indra with thy juice.
3 Poured forth by pressing-stones, do thou with loud roar send us in a stream
Most excellent illustrious might.
4 Indu, urged forward, floweth through the fleecy cloth: the Tawny One
With his loud roar hath brought as strength.
5 Indu, thou flowest through the fleece, bringing felicities and fame,
And, Soma, spoil and wealth in kine.
6 Hither, O Indu, bring us wealth in steeds and cattle hundredfold:
Bring wealth, O Soma, thousandfold.
7 In purifying, through the sieve the rapid drops of'Soma juice
Come nigh to Indra in their course.
8 For Indra floweth excellent Indu, the noblest Soma juice
The Living for the Living One.
9 The glittering maids send Sura forth they with their song have sung aloud
To Pavamana dropping meath.
10 May Pusan, drawn by goats, be our protector, and on all his paths
Bestow on us our share of maids.
11 This Soma flows like gladdening oil for him who wears the braided locks:
He shall give us our share of maids.
12 This Soma juice, O glowing God, flows like pure oil, effused for thee:
He shall give us our share of maids.
13 Flow onward, Soma, in thy stream, begetter of the sages' speech:
Wealth-giver among Gods art thou.
14 The Falcon dips within the jars: he wrap.him in his robe and goes
Loud roaring to the vats of wood.
15 Soma, thy juice hath been effused and poured into the pitcher: like
A rapid hawk it rushes on.
16 For Indra flow most rich in sweets, O Soma, bringing him delight.
17 They were sent forth to feast the Gods, like chariots that display their strength.
18 Brilliant, best givers of delight, these juices have sent Vayu forth.
19 Bruised by the press-stones and extolled, Soma, thou goest to the sieve,
Giving the worshipper hero strength.
20 This juice bruised by the pressing-stones and lauded passes through the sieve,
Slayer of demons, through the fleece.
21 O Pavamana, drive away the danger, whether near at hand
Or far remote, that finds me here.
22 This day may Pavamana cleanse us with his purifying power,
Most active purifying Priest.
23 O Agni, with the cleansing light diffused through all thy fiery glow,
Purify thou this prayer of ours.
24 Cleanse us with thine own cleansing power, O Agni, that is bright with flame,
And by libations poured to thee.
25 Savitar, God, by both of these, libation, purifying power,
Purify me on every side.
26 Cleanse us, God Savitar, with Three, O Soma, with sublimest forms,
Agni, with forms of power and might.
27 May the Gods' company make me clean, and Vasus make rue pure by song.
Purify me, ye General Gods; O Jatavedas, make me pure.
28 Fill thyself full of juice, flow forth, O Soma, thou with all thy stalks,
The best oblation to the Gods.
29 We with our homage have approached the Friend who seeks our wondering praise,
Young, strengthener of the solemn rite.
30 Lost is Alayya's axe. O Soma, God do thou send it back hither in thy flow
Even, Soma, God, if 'twere a mole.
31 The man who reads the essence stored by saints, the Pavamani hymns,
Tastes food completely purified, made sweet by Matarisvan's touch.
32 Whoever reads the essence stored by saints, the Pavamani hymns,
Sarasvati draws forth for him water and butter, milk and meath.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HYMN LXVIII. Soma Pavamana.

1. THE drops of Soma juice like cows who yield their milk have flowed forth, rich in meath, unto the Shining One,
And, seated on the grass, raising their voice, assumed the milk, the covering robe wherewith the udders stream.
2 He bellows with a roar arourd the highest twigs: the Tawny One is sweetened as he breaks them up.
Then passing through the sieve into the ample room, the God throws off the dregs according to his wish.
3 The gladdening drink that measured out the meeting Twins fills full with milk the Eternal Ever-waxing Pair.
Bringing to light the Two great Regions limitless, moving above them he gained sheen that never fades.
4 Wandering through, the Parents, strengthening the floods, the Sage makes his place swell with his own native might.
The stalk is mixed with grain: he comes led by the men together with the sisters, and preserves the Head.
5 With energetic intellect the Sage is born, deposited as germ of Law, far from the Twins.
They being young at first showed visibly distinct the Creature that is half-concealed and half-exposed.
6 The sages knew the form of him the Gladdener, what time the Falcon brought the plant from far away.
Him who assures success they beautified in streams, the stalk who yearned therefor, mighty and meet for praise.
7 Together with the Rsis, with their prayers and hymns ten women deck thee, Soma, friendly when effused.
Led by the men, with invocations of the Gods, through the fleece, thou hast given us strength to win the spoil.
8 Songs resonant with praise have celebrated him. Soma, Friend, springing forth with his fair company.
Even him who rich in meath, with undulating stream, Winnner of Wealth, Immortal, sends his voice from heaven,
9 He sends it into all the region forth from heaven. Soma, while he is filtcred, settles in the jars.
With milk and waters is he decked when pressed with stones: Indu, when purified, shall find sweet rest and room.
10 Even thus poured forth How on thy way, O Soma, vouchsafing us most manifold lively vigour.
We will invoke benevolent Earth and Heaven. Give us, ye Gods, riches with noble heroes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HYMN LXIX. Soma Pavamana.

1. LAID like an arrow on the bow the hymn hath been loosed like a young calf to the udder of its dam.
As one who cometh first with full stream she is milked the Soma is impelled to this man's holy rites.
2 The thought is deeply fixed; the savoury juice is shed; the tongue with joyous sound is stirring in the mouth;
And Pavamana, like the shout of combatants, the drop rising in sweet juice, is flowing through the fleece.
3 He flows about the sheep-skin, longing for a bride: he looses Aditi's Daughters for the worshipper.
The sacred drink hath come, gold-tinted, well-restrained: like a strong Bull he shines, whetting his manly might.
4 The Bull is bellowing; the Cows are coming nigh: the Goddesses approach the God's own resting-place.
Onward hath Soma passed through the sheep's fair bright fleece, and hath, as 'twere, endued a garment newly washed.
5 The golden-hued, Immortal, newly bathed, puts on a brightly shining vesture that is never harmed.
He made the ridge of heaven to be his radiant robe, by sprinkling of the bowls from moisture of the sky.
6 Even as the beams of Surya, urging men to speed, that cheer and send to sleep, together rush they forth,
These swift outpourings in long course of holy rites: no form save only Indra shows itself so pure.
7 As down the steep slope of a river to the vale, drawn from the Steer the swift strong draughts have found a way.
Well be it with the men and cattle in our home. May powers, O Soma, may the people stay with us.
8 Pour out upon us wealth in goods, in gold, in steeds, in cattle and in corn, and great heroic strength.
Ye, Soma, are my Fathers, lifted up on high as heads of heaven and makers of the strength of life.
9 These Pavamanas here, these drops of Soma, to Indra have sped forth like cars to booty.
Effused, they pass the cleansing fleece, while, gold-hued, they cast their covering off to pour the rain down.
10 O Indu, flow thou on for lofty Indra, flow blameless, very gracious, foe-destroyer.
Bring splendid treasures to the man who lauds thee. O Heaven and Earth, with all the Gods protect. us.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HYMN LXX. Soma Pavamana.

1. THE three times seven Milch-kine in the eastern heaven have for this Soma poured the genuine milky draught.
Four other beauteous Creatures hath he made for his adornment, when he waxed in strength through holy rites.
2 Longing for lovely Amrta, by his wisdom he divided, each apart from other, earth and heaven.
He gladly wrapped himself in the most lucid floods, when through their glory they found the God's resting-place.
3 May those his brilliant rays he ever free from death, inviolate, for both classes of created things,-
Rays wherewith powers of men and Gods are purified. Yea, even for this have sageswelcomed him as King.
4 He, while he is adorned by the ten skilful ones, that he too in the Midmost Mothers may create,
While he is watching o'er the lovely Amrta's ways, looks on both races as Beholder of mankind.
5 He, while he is adorned to stream forth mighty strength, rejoices in his place between the earth and heaven.
The Steer dispels the evil-hearted with his might, aiming at offerings as an archer at the game.
6 Beholding, as it were, Two Mother Cows, the Steer goes roaring on his way even as the Maruts roar.
Knowing Eternal Law, the earliest light of heaven, he, passing wise, was chosen out to tell it forth.
7 The fearful Bull is bellowing with violent might, far-sighted, sharpening his yellowcoloured horns.
Soma assumes his seat in the well-fashioned place: the cowhide and the sheepskin are his ornament.
8 Bright, making pure his body free from spot and stain, on the sheep's back the Golden-coloured hath flowed down.
Acceptable to Mitra, Vayu, Varuna, he is prepared as threefold meal by skilful men.
9 Flow on for the God's banquet, Soma, as a Steer, and enter Indra's heart, the Soma's reservoir.
Bear us beyond misfortune ere we be oppres. sed. the man who knows the land directs the man who asks.
10 Urged like a car-steed flow to strength, O Soma: Indu, flow onward to the throat of Indra.
Skilled, bear us past, as in a boat o'er water: as battling Hero save us from the foeman.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HYMN LXXI. Soma Pavamana,

1. THE guerdon is bestowed: the Mighty takes his Seat, and, ever-Watchful, guards from fiend and evil sprite.
Gold-hued, he makes the cloud his diadem, the milk his carpet in both worlds, and prayer his robe of state.
2 Strong, bellowing, he goes, like one who slays the folk; he lets this hue of Asuras flow off from him,
Throws off his covering, seeks his father's meeting-place, and thus makes for himself the bright robe he assumes.
3 Onward he flows, from both the hands, pressed out with stones: excited by the prayer, the water makes him wild.
He frolics and draws near, completes his work with song, and bathes in streams to satisfy the worshipper.
4 They pour out meath around the Master of the house, Celestial Strengthener of the mountain that gives might;
In whom, through his great powers, oblation-eating cows in their uplifted udder mix their choicest milk.
5 They, the ten sisters, on the lap of Aditi, have sent him forward like a car from both the arms.
He wanders and comes near the Cow's mysterious place, even the place which his inventions have produced.
6 Like as a falcon to his home, so speeds the God to his own golden wisely-tashioned place to rest.
With song they urge the darling to the sacred grass: the Holy One goes like a courser to the Gods.
7 From far away, from heaven, the redhued noted Sage, Steer of the triple height, hath sung unto the kine.
With thousand guidings he, leading this way and that, shines, as a singer, splendidly through many a morn.
8 His covering assumes a radiant hue; where'er he comes into the fight he drives the foe afar.
The Winner of the Floods, with food he seeks the host of heaven, he comes to praises glorified with milk.
9 Like a bull roaming round the herds he bellows: he hath assumed the brilliancy of Surya.
Down to the earth hath looked the heavenly Falcon: Soma with wisdom views all living creatures.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HYMN LXXII. Soma Pavamana.

1. THEY cleanse the Gold-hued: like a red Steed is he yoked, and Soma in the jar is mingled with the milk.
He sendeth out his voice, and many loving friends of him the highly lauded hasten with their songs.
2 The many sages utter words in unison, while into Indra's throat they pour the Soma juice,
When, with the ten that dwell together closely joined, the men whose hands are skilful cleanse the lovely meath.
3 He goes upon his way, unresting, to the cows, over the roaring sound which Sarya's Daughter loves.
The Falcon brought it to him for his own delight: now with the twofold kindred sisters is his home.
4 Washed by the men, stone-pressed, dear on the holy grass, faithful to seasons, Lord of cattle from of old,
Most liberal, completing sacrifice for men, O Indra, pure bright Soma, Indu, flows for thee.
5 O Indra, urged by arms of men and poured in streams, Soma flows on for thee after.his Godlike kind.
Plans thou fulfillest, gatherest thoughts for sacrifice: in the bowls sits the Gold-hued like a roosting bird.
6 Sages well-skilled in work, intelligent, drain out the stalk that roars, the Sage, the Everlasting One.
The milk, the hymns unite them with him in the place of sacrifice, his seat who is produced anew.
7 Earth's central point, sustainer of the mighty heavens, distilled into the streams, into the waters' wave,
As Indra's thunderbolt, Steer with farspreading wealth, Soma is flowing on to make the heart rejoice.
8 Over the earthly region flow thou on thy way, helping the praiser and the pourer, thou Most Wise.
Let us not lack rich treasure reaching to our home, and may we clothe ourselves in manifold bright wealth.
9 Hither, O Indu, unto us a hundred gifts of steeds, a thousand gifts of cattle and of gold,
Measure thou forth, yea, splendid ample strengthening food do thou, O Pavamana, heed this laud of ours.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HYMN LXXIII. Soma Pavamana.

1. THEY from the spouting drop have sounded at the rim: naves speed together to the place of sacrifice.
That Asura hath formed, to seize, three lofty heights. The ships of truth have borne the pious man across.
2 The strong Steers, gathering, have duly stirred themselves,and over the stream's wave the friends sent forth the song.
Engendering the hymn, with flowing streams of meath, Indra's dear body have they caused to wax in strength.
3 With sanctifying gear they sit around the song: their ancient Father guards their holy work from harm.
Varuna hath o'erspread the mighty sea of air. Sages had power to hold him in sustaining floods.
4 Sweet-tongued, exhaustless, they have sent their voices down togetlier, in heaven's vault that pours a thousand streams.
His wildly-restless warders never close an eye: in every place are found the bonds that bind man last.
5 O'er Sire and Mother they have roared in unison bright with the verse of praise, burning up riteless men,
Blowing away with supernatural might from earth and from the heavens the swarthy skin which Indra hates.
6 Those which, as guides of song and counsellors of speed, were manifested from their ancient dwelling place,-
From these the eyeless and the deaf have turned aside: the wicked travel not the pathway of the Law.
7 What time the filter with a thousand streams is stretched, the thoughtful sages purify their song therein.
Bright-coloured are their spies, vigorous, void of guile, excellent, fair to see, beholders of mankind.
8 Guardian of Law, most wise, he may not be deceived: three Purifiers hath he set within his heart.
With wisdom he beholds all creatures that exist: he drives into the pit the hated riteliess ones.
9 The thread of sacrifice spun in the cleansing sieve, on Varuna's tongue-tip, by supernatural might,-
This, by their striving, have the prudent ones attained: he who hath not this power shall sink into the pit.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HYMN LXXIV. Soma Pavamana

1. BORN like a youngling he hath clamoured in the wood, when he, the Red, the Strong, would win the light of heaven.
He comes with heavenly seed that makes the water swell: him for wide-spreading shelter we implore with prayer.
2 A far-extended pillar that supports the sky the Soma-stalk, filled full, moves itself every way.
He shall bring both these great worlds while the rite proceeds: the Sage holds these who move! together and all food.
3 Wide space hath he who follows Aditi's right path, and mighty, well-made food, meath blent with Soma juice;
He who from hence commands the rain, Steer of the kine, Leader of floods, who helps us hence, who claims our laud.
4 Butter and milk are drawn from animated cloud; thence Amrta is produced, centre of sacrifice.
Hini the Most Bounteous Ones, ever united, love; him as ouir Friend the Men who make all swell rain down.
5 The Soma-stalk hath roared, following with the wave: he swells with sap for man the skin which Gods enjoy.
Upon the lap of Aditi he lays the germ, by means whereof we gain children and progeny.
6 In the third region which distils a thousand streams, may the Exhaustless Ones descend with procreant power.
The kindred Four have been sent downward from the heavens: dropping with oil they bring Amrta and sacred gifts.
7 Soma assumes white colour when he strives to gain: the bounteous Asura knows full many a precious boon.
Down the steep slope, through song, he comes to sacrifice, and he will burst the water-holding cask of heaven,
8 Yea, to the shining milk-anointed beaker, as to his goal, hath stepped the conquering Courser.
Pious-souled men have sent their giffi of cattle unto Kaksivan of the hundred winters.
9 Soma, thy juice when thou art blended with the streams, flows, Pavamana, through the long wool of the sheep.
So, cleansed by sages. O best giver of delight, grow sweet for Indra, Pavamana! for his drink.

1. GRACIOUSLY-MINDED he is flowing on his way to win dear names o'er which the Youthful One grows great.
The Mighty and Far-seeing One hath mounted now the mighty Surya's car which moves to every side.
2 The Speaker, unassailable Master of this hymn, the Tongue of sacrifice pours forth the pleasant meath.
Within the lustrous region of the heavens the Son makes the third secret name of Mother and of Sire.
3 Sending forth flashes he hath bellowed to the jars, led by the men into the golden reservoir.
The milky streams of sacrifice have sung to him: he of the triple height shines brightly through the morns.
4 Pressed by the stones, with hymns, and graciously inclined, illuminating both the Parents, Heaven and Earth,
He flows in ordered season onward through the flee, a current of sweet juice still swelling day by day.
5 Flow onward, Soma, flow to bring prosperity: cleansed by the men, invest thee with the milky draught.
What gladdening drinks thou hast, foaming, exceeding strong, even with these incite Indra to give us wealth.

The Gold-hued, started like a courser by brave men, impetuously winneth splendour in the streams.
2 He takes his weapons, like a hero, in his hands, fain to win light, car-borne, in forays for the kine.
Indu, while stimulating India's might, is urged forward and balmed by sages skilful in their task.
3 Soma, as thou art purified with flowing wave, exhibiting thy strength enter thou Indra's throat.
Make both worlds stream for us, as lightning doth the clouds: mete out exhaustless powers for us, as 'twere through song.
4 Onward he flows, the King of all that sees the light: the Rsis' Lord hath raised the song of sacrifice;
Even he who is adorned with Surya's arrowy beam, Father of hymns, whose wisdom is beyond our reach.
5 Like as a bull to herds, thou flowest to the pail, bellowing as a steer upon the water's lap.
So, best of Cheerers, thou for Indra flowest on that we, with thy protection, may o'ercome in fight.

Dropping with oil, abundant, streams of sacrifice flow unto him like milch-kine, lowing, with their milk.
2 On flows that Ancient One whom, hitherward, from heaven, sped through the region of the air, the Falcon snatched.
He, quivering with alarm and terrified in heart before bow-armed Krsanu, holdeth fast the sweet.
3 May those first freshest drops of Soma juice effused flow on, their way to bring us mighty strength in kine.
Beauteous as serpents, worthy to be looked upon, they whom each sacred gift and all our prayers have pleased.
4 May that much-lauded Indu, with a heart inclined to us, well-knowing, fight against our enemies.
He who hath brought the germ beside the Strong One's seat moves onward to the widely-opcned stall of kine.
5 The active potent juice of heaven is flowing on, great Varuna whom the forward man can ne'er deceive.
Mitra, the Holy, hath been pressed for troubled times, neighing like an impatient horse amid the herd,

Full many are the paths whereon thou mayest go: a thousand bay steeds hast thou resting in the bowls.
3 Apsarases who dwell in waters of the sea, sitting within, have flowed to Soma wise of heart.
They urge the Master of the house upon his way, and to the Eternal Pavamana pray for bliss.

He whom the Gods have made a gladdening draught to drink, the drop most sweet to taste, weal-bringing, red of hue.

Perish among us they who give no gifts of food! perish the godless! May our prayers obtain success.
2 Forward to us the drops, distilling meath, shall flow, like riches for whose sake we urge the horses on.
Beyond the crafty hindering of all mortal men may we continually bear precious wealth away.
3 Yea, yerily, foe of hate shown to himself is he, yea, verity, destroyer too of other hate.
As thirst subdueth in the desert, conquer thou, O Soma Pavarnana, men of evil thoughts.
4 Near kin to thee is he, raised loftiest in the heavens: upon the earth's high ridge thy scions have grown forth.
The press-stones chew and crunch thee on the ox's hide: sages have milked thee with their hands into the streams.
5 So do they hurry on thy strong and beauteous juice, O Indu, as the first ingredient of the draught.
Bring low, thou Pavamana, every single foe, and be thy might shown forth as sweet and gladdening drink.

Thou, lengthening our princes' life and high renown, flowest for Indra as his might to gladdening drink.

He spreads himself abroad to meet all things that be: the vigorous Tawny Steed flows sporting on his way.

Soma who winnest thousands, driven by the men, expressed with stones, bring, as thou flowest, all the Gods.
5 Deft-handed men with stones, the ten swift fingers, drain thee into waters, thee, the Steer enriched with sweets.
Thou, Soma, gladdening Indra, and the Heavenly Host, flowest as Pavamana like a river's wave.

When they, brought forward with the lovely curd of kine, effused, have cheered the Hero to bestow his gifts.

Thus, knowing both the generations, he obtains the rights and dues of Gods from yonder and from hence.
3 While thou art cleansed, O Soma, scatter wealth on us; Indu, bestow great bounty as a liberal Prince.
Giver of life, with wisdom help to opulence; strew not our home possessions far away from us.

The Maruts, Asvins, Vayu, and Brhaspati, Savitar, Tvastar, tractable Sarasvati.

O Soma, be thou gracious, driving off distress: thou goest, clothed in butter, to a robe of state.
3 Parjanya is the Father of the Mighty Bird: on mountains, in earth's centre hath he made his home.
The waters too have flowed, the Sisters, to the kine: he meets the pressing-stones at the beloved rite.
4 Thou givest pleasure as a wife delights her lord. Listen, O Child of Pajri, for to thee I speak.
Amid the holy songs go on that we may live: in time of trouble, Soma, watch thou free from blame.

The Swift Ones favour him who purifieth this: with consciousness they stand upon the height of heaven.

By his high wisdom have the mighty Sages wrought: the Fathers who behold mankind laid down the germ,

Smite thou our enemies who raise the shout of joy: Indra, drink Soma juice, and drive away our foes.
3 Unharmed, best Cheerer, thou, O Indu, flowest on: thou, even thou thyself, art Indra's noblest food.
Full many a wise man lifts to thee the song of praise, and hails thee with a kiss as Sovran of this world.
4 Wondrous, with hundred streams, hymned in a thousand songs, Indu pours out for Indra his delightrul meath.
Winning us land and waters, flow thou hitherward: Rainer of bounties, Soma, make broad way for us.
5 Roaring within the beaker thou art balmed with milk: thou passest through the fleecy filter all at once.

6 Flow onward sweet of flavour for the Heavenly Race, for Indra sweet, whose name is easily invoked:
Flow sweet for Mitra, Varuna, and Vayu, rich in meath, inviolable for Brhaspati.
7 Ten rapid fingers deck the Courser in the jar: with hymns the holy singers send their voices forth.
The filtering juices hasten to their eulogy, the drops that gladden find their way to Indra's heart.
8 While thou art purified pour on us hero strength, great, far-extended shelter, spacious pasturage.
Let no oppression master this our holy work: may we, O Indu, gain all opulence through thee.
9 The Steer who sees afar hath risen above the sky: the Sage hath caused the lights of heaven to give their shine.
The. King is passing through the filter with a roar: they drain the milk of heaven from him who looks on men.
10 High in the vault of heaven, unceasing, honey-tongued, the Loving Ones drain out the mountain-haunting Steer,-
The drop that hath grown great in waters, in the lake meath-rich, in the stream's wave and in the cleansing sieve.
11 The Loving Ones besought with many voices the Eagle who had flown away to heaven.
Hymns kiss the Youngling worthy of laudation, resting on earth, the Bird of golden colour.
12 High to heaven's vault hath the Gandharva risen, beholding all his varied forms and figures.
His ray hath shone abroad with gleaming splendour: pure, he hath lighted both the worlds, the Parents.

HYMN LXXXVI. Soma Pavamana.

1. THY gladdening draughts, O Pavamana, urged by song flow swiftly of themselves like sons of fleet-foot mares.
The drops of Soma juice, those eagles of the heavens, most cheering, rich in meath, rest in the reservoir.
2 As rapid chariot-steeds, so turned in several ways have thine exhilarating juices darted forth,
Soma-drops rich in meath, waves, to the Thunder-armed, to Indra, like milch-kine who seek their calf with milk.
3 Like a steed urged to battle, finder of the light; speed onward to the cloud-born reservoir of heaven,
A Steer that o'er the woolly surface seeks the sieve, Soma while purified for Indra's nourishment.
4 Fleet as swift steeds, thy drops, divine, thought-swift, have been, O Pavamana, poured with milk into the vat.
The Rsis have poured in continuous Soma drops, ordainers who adorn thee, Friend whom Rsis love.
5 O thou who seest all things, Sovran as thou art and passing strong, thy rays encompass all abodes.
Pervading with thy natural powers thou flowest on, and as the whole world's Lord, O Soma, thou art King.
6 The beams of Pavamana, sent from earth and heaven, his ensigns who is ever steadfast, travel round.
When on the sieve the Golden-hued is cleansed, he rests within the vats as one who seats him in his place.
7 Served with fair rites he flows, ensign of sacrifice: Soma advances to the special place of Gods.
He speeds with thousand currents to the reservoir, and passes through the filter bellowing as a bull.
8 The Sovran dips him in the seain and the streams, and set in rivers with the waters' wave moves on.
High heaven's Sustainer at the central point of earth, raised on the fleecy surface Pavamana stands.
9 He on whose high decree the heavens and earth depend nath roared and thundered like the summit of the sky.
Soma flows on obtaining Indra's friendly love, and, as they purify him, settles in the jars.
10 He, light of sacrifice distils delicious meath, most wealthy, Father and begetter of the Gods.
He, gladdening, best of Cheerers, juice!hat Indra loves, enriches with mysterious treasure earth and heaven.
11 The vigorous and far-seeing one, the Lord of heaven, flows, shouting to the beaker, with his thousand streams.
Coloured like gold he rests in seats where Mitra dwells, the Steer made beautiful by rivers and by sheep.
12 In forefront of the rivers Pavamana speeds, in forefront of the hymn, foremost among the kine.
He shares the mighty booty in the van of war: the well-armed Steer is purified by worshippers.
13 This heedful Pavamana, like a bird sent forth, hath with his wave flowed onward to the fleecy sieve.
O Indra, through thy wisdom, b thy thought, O Sage, Soma flows bright and pure between the earth and heaven.
14 He, clad in mail that reaches heaven, the Holy One, filling the firmament stationed amid the worlds,
Knowing. the realm of light, hath come to us in rain: he summons to himself his own primeval Sire.
15 He who was first of all to penetrate his form bestowed upon his race wide shelter and defence.
From that high station which he hath in loftiest heaven he comes victorious to all encounters here.
16 Indu hath started for Indra's special place and slights not as a Friend the promise of his Friend.
Soma speeds onward like a youth to youtlitial maids, and gains the beaker by a course of bundred paths.
17 Your songs, exhilarating, tuneful, uttering praise, are come into the placns where the people meet.
Worshippers have exalted Soma with their hymns, and milch kine have come near to meet him with their milk.
18 O Soma, Indu, while they cleanse thee, pour on us accumulateds Plentiful, nutritious food,
Which, ceaseless, thrice a day shall yield us hero power enriched with store of nourishment, and strength, and Meath.
19 Far-seeing Soma flows, the Steer, the Lord of hymns, the Furtherer of day, of morning, and of heaven.
Mixt with the streams he caused the beakers to resound, and with the singers' aid they entered Indra's heart.
20 On, with the prudent singers, flows the ancient Sage and guided by the men hath roared about the vats.
Producing Trita's name, may he pour forth the meath, that Vayu and that Indra may become his Friends.
21 He, being purified, hath made the Mornings shine: this, even this is he who gave the rivers room.
He made the Three Times Seven pour out the milky flow: Soma, the Cheerer, yields whate'er the heart finds sweet.
22 Flow, onward, Soma, in thine own celestial forms, flow, Indu, poured within the beaker and the sieve.
Sinking into the throat of Indra with a roar, led by the men thou madest Surya mount to heaven.
23 Pressed out with stones thou flowest onward to the sieve, O Indu, entering the depths of Indra's throat.
Far-sighted Soma, now thou lookest on mankind: thou didst unbar the cowstall for the Angirases.
24 In thee, O Soma, while thou purifitedst thee, high-thoughted sages, seeking favour, have rejoiced.
Down from the heavens the Falcon brought thee hitherward, even thee, O Indu, thee whom all our hymns adorn.
25 Seven Milch-kine glorify the Tawny-coloured One while with his wave in wool he purifies himself.
The living men, the mighty, have impelled the Sage into the waters' lap, the place of sacrifice.
26 Indu, attaining purity, plunges through the foe, making Ilis ways all easy for the pious man.
Making the kine his mantle, he, the lovely Sage, runs like a sporting courser onward through the fleece.
27 The ceaseless watery fountains with their hundred streams sing, as they hasten near, to him the Golden-hued
Him, clad in robes of milk, swift fingers beautify on the third height and in the luminous realm of heaven.
28 These are thy generations of celestial seed thou art the Sovran Lord of all the world of life.
This universe, O Pavamana, owns thy sway; thou, Indu, art the first establisher of Law.
29 Thou art the sea, O Sage who bringest alf to light: under thy Law are these five regions of the world.
Tlou reachest out beyond the earth, beyond the heavens: thine are the lights, O Pavamana, thine the Sun.
30 Thou in the filter, Soma Pavamana, art purified to support the region for the Gods.
The chief, the longing ones have sought to hold thee fast, and all these living creatures have been turned to thee.
31 Onward the Singer travels o'er the fleecy sieve. the Tawny Steer hath bellowed in the wooden vats.
Hymns have been sung aloud in resonant harmony, and holy songs kiss him, the Child who claims our praise.
32 He hath assumed the rays of Surya for his robe, spinning, as he knows bow, the triply-twisted thread.
He, guiding to the newest rules of Holy Law, comes as the Women's Consort to the special place.
33 On flows the King of rivers and the Lord of heaven: he follows with a shout the paths of Holy Law.
The Golden-hued is poured forth, with his hundred streams, Wealth-bringer, lifting up his voice while purified.
34 Fain to be cleansed, thou, Pavamana, pourest out, like wondrous Surya, through the fleece, an ample sea.
Purified with the hands, pressed by the men with stones, thou speedest on to mighty booty-bringing war.
35 Thou, Pavamana, sendest food and power in streams. thou sittest in the beakers as a hawk on trees,
For Indra poured as cheering juice to make him glad, as nearest and farseeing bearer-up of heaven.
36 The Sisters Seven, the Mothers, stand around the Babe, the noble, new-born Infant, skilled in holy song,
Gandharva of the floods, divine, beholding men, Soma, that he may reign as King of all the world.
37 As Sovran Lord thereof thou Passest through these worlds, O Indu, harnessing thy tawny well-winged Mares.
May they pour forth for thee milk and oil rich in sweets: O Soma, let the folk abide in thy decree.
38 O Soma, thou beholdest men from every side: O Pavamana, Steer, thou wanderest through these.
Pour out upon us wealth in treasure and in gold: may we have strength to live among the things that be.
39 Winner of gold and goods and cattle flow thou on, set as impregner, Indu, mid the worlds of life.
Rich in brave men art thou, Soma, who winnest all: these holy singers wait upon thee with the song.
40 The wave of flowing meath hath wakened up desires: the Steer enrobed in milk plunges into the streams.
Borne on his chariot-sieve the King hath risen to war, and with a thousand rays hath won him high renown.
41 Dear to all life, he sends triumphant praises forth, abundant, bringing offspring, each succeeding day.
From Indra crave for us, Indu, when thou art quaffed, the blessing that gives children, wealth that harbours steeds.
42 When days begin, the strong juice, lovely, golden-hued, is recognized by wisdom more and more each day,
He, stirring both the Races, goes between the two, the bearer of the word of men and word of Gods.
43 They balm him, balm him over balm him thoroughly, caress the mighty strength and balm it with the meath.
They seize the flying Steer at the stream's breathing-place: cleansing with gold they grasp the Animal herein.
44 Sing forth to Pavamana skilled in holy song: the juice is flowing onward like a mighty stream.
He.glideth like a serpent from his ancient skin, and like a playful horse the Tawny Steer hath run.
45 Dweller in floods, King, foremost, he displays his might, set among living things as measurer of days.
Distilling oil he flows, fair, billowy, golden-hued, borne on a car of light, sharing one hom-e with wealth.
46 Loosed is the heavens! support, the uplifted cheering juice: the triply-mingled draught flows round into the worlds.
The holy hymns caress the stalk that claims our praise, when singers have approached his beauteous robe with song.
47 Thy strearns that flow forth rapidly collected run over the fine fleece of the sheep as thou art cleansed.
When, Indu, thou art. balmed with milk within the bowl, thou sinkest in the jars, O Soma, when expressed.
48 Winner of' power, flow, Soma, worthy of our laud: run onward to the fleece as well-beloved meath.
Destroy, O Indu, all voracious Raksasas. With brave sons in the assembly let our speech be bold.

HYMN XCII. Soma Pavamana.

1. THE gold-hued juice, poured out upon the filter, is started like a car sent forth to conquer.
He hath gained song and vigour while they cleansed him, and hath rejoiced the Gods with entertainments.
2 He who beholdeth man hath reached the filter: bearing his name, the Sage hath sought his dwelling.
The Rsis came to him, seven holy singers, when in the bowls he settled as Invoker.
3 Shared by all Gods, mobt wise, propitious, Soma goes, while they cleanse him, to his constant station.
Let him rejoice in all his lofty wisdom to the Five Tribes the Sage attains with labour.
4 In thy mysterious place, O Pavamana Soma, are all the Gods, the Thrice-Eleven.
Ten on the fleecy height, themselves, self-prompted, and seven fresh rivers, brighten and adorn thee.
5 Now let this be the truth of Pavamana, there where all singers gather them together,
That he hath given us room and made the daylight, hath holpen Manu and repelled the Dasyu.
6 As the priest seeks the station rich in cattle, like a true King who goes to great assemblies,
Soma hath sought the beakers while they cleansed him, and like a wild bull, in the wood hath settled.

HYMN XCIII. Soma Pavamana.

1. TEN sisters, pouring out the rain together, swift-moving thinkers of the sage, adorn him.
Hither hath run the gold-hued Child of Surya and reached the vat like a fleet vigorous courser.

As youth to damsel, so with milk he hastens on to the. chose meeting-place, the beaker.
3 Yea, swollen is the udder of the milch-cow: thither in streams goes very sapient Indu.
The kine make ready, as with new-washed treasures, the Head and Chief with milk within the vessels.
4 With all the Gods, O Indu Pavamana, while thou art roaring send us wealth in horses.
Hither upon her car come willing Plenty, inclined to us, to give us of her treasures.

HYMN XCIV. Soma Pavamana.

1. WHEN beauties strive for him as for a charger, then strive the songs like soldiers for the sunlight.
Acting the Sage, he flows enrobed in waters and song as 'twere a stall that kine may prosper.
2 The worlds expand to hirn who from aforetime found light to spread the law of life eternal.
The swelling songs, like kine within the stable, in deep devotion call aloud on Indu.
3 When the sage bears his holy wisdom round him, like a car visiting all worlds, the Hero,
Becoming fame, mid Gods, unto the mortal, wealth to the skilled, worth praise mid the Ever-present,

They, clothed in glory, have become immortal. He, measured in his course, makes frays successful.

HYMN XCV Soma Pavamana.

1. Loud neighs the Tawny Steed when started, settling deep in the wooden vessel while they cleanse him.
Led by the men he takes the milk for raiment: then shall he, through his powers, engender praise-songs.
2 As one who rows drives on his boat, he, Gold-hued, sends forth his voice, loosed on the path of Order.
As God, the secret names of Gods he utters, to be declared on sacred grass more widely.
3 Hastening onward like the waves of waters, our holy hymns are pressing nigh to Soma.
To him they come with lowly adoration, and, longing, enter him who longs to meet them.
4 They drain the stalk, the Steer who dwells on mountains, even as a Bull who decks him on the upland.
Hymns follow and attend him as he bellows: Trita bears Varuna aloft in ocean.
5 Sending thy voice out as Director, loosen the Invoker's thought, O Indu, as they cleanse thee.
While thou and Indra rule for our advantage, may we be masters of heroic vigour.

HYMN XCVI. Soma Pavamana

1. IN forefront of the cars forth goes the Hero, the Leader, winning spoil: his host rejoices.
Soma endues his robes of lasting colours, and blesses, for his friends, their calls on Indra.
2 Men decked with gold adorn his golden tendril, incessantly with steed-impelling homage.
The Friend of Indra mounts his car well-knowing, he comes thereon to meet the prayer we offer.
3 O God, for service of the Gods flow onward, for food sublime, as Indra's drink, O Soma.
Making the floods, bedewing earth and heaven, come from the vast, comfort us while we cleanse thee
4 Flow for prosperity and constant Vigour, flow on for happiness and high perfection.
This is the wish of these friends assembled: this is my wish, O Soma Pavamana.
5 Father of holy hymns, Soma flows onward the Father of the earth, Father of heaven:
Father of Agni, Surya's generator, the Father who begat Indra and Visnu.
6 Brahman of Gods, the Leader of the poets, Rsi of sages, Bull of savage creatures,
Falcon amid the vultures, Axe of forests, over the cleansing sieve goes Soma singing.
7 He, Soma Pavamana, like a river, hath stirred the wave of voice, our songs and praises.
Beholding these inferior powers in cattle, he rests among them as a Steer well-knowing.
8 As Gladdener, Warrior never harmed in battle, with thousand genial streams, pour strength and vigour.
As thoughtful Pavamana, urge O Indu, speeding the kine, the plant's wave on to Indra.
9 Dear, grateful to the Gods, on to the beaker moves Soma, sweet to Indra, to delight him.
With hundred powers, with thousand currents, Indu, like a strong car-horse, goes to the assembly.
10 Born in old time as finder-out of treasures, drained with the stone, decking himself in waters,
Warding off curses, King of all existence, he shall find way for prayer the while they cleanse him.
11 For our sage fathers, Soma Pavamana, of old performed, by thee, their sacred duties.
Fighting unvanquished, open the enclosures: enrich us with large gifts of steeds and heroes.
12 As thou didst flow for Manu Life-bestowing, Foe-queller, Comforter, rich in oblations,
Even thus flow onward now conferring riches: combine with Indra, and bring forth thy weapons.
13 Flow onward, Soma, rich in sweets and holy,. enrobed in waters on the fleecy summit.
Settle in vessels that are full of fatness, as cheering and most gladdening drink for Indra.
14 Pour, hundred-streamed, winner of thousands, mighty at the Gods' banquet, Pour the rain of heaven,
While thou with rivers roarest in the beaker, and blent with milk prolongest our existence.
15 Purified with our holy hymns, this Soma o'ertakes malignities like some strong charger,
Like fresh milk poured by Aditi, like passage in ample room, or like a docile car-horse.
16 Cleansed by the pressers, armed with noble weapons, stream to us the fair secret name thou bearest.
Pour booty, like a horse, for love of glory God, Soma, send us kine, and send us Vayu.
17 They deck him at his birth, the lovely Infant, the Maruts with their troop adorn the Car-horse.
By songs a Poet and a Sage by wisdom, Soma joes singing through the cleansing filter.
18 Light-winner, Rsi-mindcd, Rsi-maker, hymned in a thousand hymns, Leader of sages,
A Steer who strives to gain his third form, Soma is, like Viraj, resplendent as a Singer.
19 Hawk seated in the bowls, Bird wide-extended, the Banner seeking kine and wielding weapons,
Following close the sea, the wave of waters, the great Bull tells his fourth form and declares it.
20 Like a fair youth who decorates his body, a courser rushing to the gain of riches,
A steer to herds, so, flowing to the pitcher, he with a roar hath passed into the beakers.
21 Flow on with might as Pavamana, Indu flow loudly roaring through the fleecy filter.
Enter the beakers sporting, as they cleanse thee, and let thy gladdening juice make Indra joyful.
22 His streams have been effused in all their fulness, and he hath entered, balmed with milk, the goblets.
Singing his psalm, well-skilled in song, a Chanter, be comes as 'twere to his friend's sister roaring.
23 Chasing our foes thou comest, Pavamana Indu, besting, as lover to his darling.
As a bird flies and settles in the forest, thus Soma settles, purified, in goblets.
24 With full stream and abundant milk, O Soma, thy beams come, like a woman, as they cleanse thee.
He, gold-hued, rich in boons, brought to the waters, hath roared within the goblet of the pious.

HYMN XCVII. Soma Pavamana

1. MADE pure by this man's urgent zeal and impulse the God hath to the Gods his juice imparted.
He goes, effused and singing, to the filter, like priest to measured seats supplied with cattle.
2 Robed in fair raiment meet to wear in battle, a mighty Sage pronouncing invocations.
Roll onward to the beakers as they cleanse thee, far-seeing at the feast of Gods, and watchful.
3 Dear, he is brightened on the fleecy summit, a Prince among us, nobler than the noble.
Roar out as thou art purified, run forward. Do ye preserve us evermore with blessings.
4 Let us sing praises to the Gods: sing loudly, send ye the Soma forth for mighty riches.
Let him flow, sweetly-flavoured, through the filter, and let our pious one rest in the pitcher.
5 Winning the friendship of the Deities, Indu flows in a thousand streams to make them joyful.
Praised by the men after the ancient statute, he hath come nigh, for our great bliss, to Indra.
6 Flow, Gold-hued, cleansing thee, to enrich the singer: let thy juice go to Indra to support him.
Come nigh, together with the Gods, for bounty. Do ye preserve us evermore with blessings.
7 The God declares the Deities' generations, like Usana, proclaiming lofty wisdom.
With brilliant kin, far-ruling, sanctifying, the Boar advances, singing, to the places.
8 The Swans, the Vrsaganas from anear us have brought their restless spirit to our dwelling.
Friends come to Pavamana meet for praises, and sound in concert their resistless music.
9 He follows the Wide-strider's rapid movement: cows low, as 'twere, to him who sports at pleasure.
He with the sharpened horns brings forth abundance: the Silvery shines by night, by day the Golden.
10 Strong Indu, bathed in milk, flows on for Indra, Soma exciting strength, to make him joyful.
He quells malignities and slays the demons, the King of mighty power who brings us comfort.
11 Then in a stream he flows, milked out with press-stones, mingled with sweetness, through the fleecy filter-
Indu rejoicing in the love of Indra, the God who gladdens, for the God's enjoyment.
12 As he is purified he pours out treasures, a God bedewing Gods with his own juices.
Indu hath, wearing qualities by seasons, on the raised fleece engaged, the ten swift fingers.
13 The Red Bull bellowing to the kine advances, causing the heavens and earth to roar and tbunder.
Well is he beard like Indra's shout in battle: letting this voice be known he hastens hither.
14 Swelling with milk, abounding in sweet flavours, urging the meath-rich plant thou goest onward.
Raising a shout thou flowest as they cleanse thee, when thou, O Soma, art effused for Indra.
15 So flow thou on inspiriting, for rapture, aiming deatb-shafts at him who stays the waters,
Flow to us wearing thy resplendent colour, effused and eager for the kine, O Soma.
16 Pleased with us, Indu, send us as thou flowest good easy paths in ample space and comforts.
Dispelling, as 'twere with a club, misfortunes, run o'er the height, run o'er the fleecy summit.
17 Pour on us rain celestial, quickly streaming, refreshing, fraught with health and ready bounty.
Flow, Indu, send these Winds thy lower kinsmen, setting them free like locks of hair unbraided.
18 Part, like a knotted tangle, while they cleanse thee, O Soma, righteous and unrighteous conduct.
Neigh like a tawny courser who is loosened, come like a youth, O God, a house-possessor.
19 For the God's service, for delight, O Indu, run o'er the height, run o'ver the fleecy summit.
With thousand streams, inviolate, sweet-scented, flow on for gain of strength that conquers heroes.
20 Without a car, without a rein to guide them, unyoked, like coursers started in the contest,
These brilliant drops of Soma juice run forward. Do ye, O Deities, come nigh to drink them.
21 So for our banquet of the Gods, O Indu, pour down the rain of heaven into the vessels.
May Soma grant us riches sought with longing, mighty, exceeding strong, with store of heroes.
22 What time the loving spirit's word had formed him Chief of all food, by statute of the Highest,
Then loudly lowing came the cows to Indu, the chosen, well-loved Master in the beaker.
23 The Sage, Celestial, liberal, raining bounties, pours as he flows the Genuine for the Truthful.
The King shall be effectual strength's upholder: he by the ten bright reins is mostly guided.
24 He who beholds mankind, made pure with filters, the King supreme of Deities and mortals,
From days of old is Treasure-Lord of riches: he, Indu, cherishes fair well-kept Order.
25 Haste, like a steed, to vittory for glory, to Indra's and to Vayu's entertainment.
Give us food ample, thousandfold: be, Soma, the finder-out of riches when they cleanse thee.
26 Effused by us let God-delighting Somas bring as they flow a home with noble heroes.
Rich in all boons like priests acquiring favour, the worshippers of heaven, the best of Cheerers.
27 So, God, for service of the Gods flow onward, flow, drink of Gods, for ample food, O Soma.
For we go forth to war against the mighty make heaven and earth well stablished by thy cleansing.
28 Thou, yoked by strong men, neighest like a courser, swifter than thought is, like an awful lion.
By paths directed hitherward, the straightest, send thou us happiness, Indu, while they cleanse thee.
29 Sprung from the Gods, a hundred streams, a thousand, have been effused: sages prepare and purge them.
Bring us from heaven the means of winnning, Indu; thou art-forerunnner of abundant riches.
30 The streams of days, were poured as 'twere from heaven: the wise King doth not treat his friend unkindly.
Like a son following his father's wishes, grant to this family success and safety.
31 Now are thy streams poured forth with all their sweetness, when, purified. thou goest through the filter.
The race of kine is thy gift, Pavarridna: when born thou madest Surya rich with brightness.
32 Bright, bellowing aiong the path of Order, thou shinest as the form of life eternal.
Thou flowest on as gladdening drink for Indra, sending thy voice out with the hymns of sages.
33 Pouring out streams at the Gods' feast with service, thou, Soma, lookest down, a heavenly Eagle.
Enter the Soma-holding beaker, Indu, and with a roar approach the ray of Sarya.
34 Three are the voices that the Courser utters: he speaks the thought of prayer, the law of Order.
To the Cow's Master come the Cows inquiring: the hymns with eager longing come to Soma.
35 To Soma come the Cows, the Milch-kine longing, to Soma sages with their hvmns inquiring.
Soma, effused, is purified and blended our hymns and Trstup songs unite in Soma.
36 Thus, Soma, as we pour thee into vessels, while thou art purified flow for our welfare.
Pass into Indra with a mighty roaring make the voice swell, and generate abundance.
37 Singer of true songs, ever-watchful, Soma hath settled in the ladles when they cleanse him.
Him the Adhvaryus, paired and eager, follow, leaders of sacrifice and skilful-handed.
38 Cleansed near the Sun as 'twere he as Creator hath filled full heaven and earth, and hath disclosed them.
He by whose dear help men gain all their wishes shall yield the precious meed as to a victor.
39 He, being cleansed, the Strengthener and Increaser, Soma the Bounteous, helped us with his lustre,
Wherewith our sires of old who knew the footsteps found light and stole the cattle from the mountain.
40 In the first vault of heaven loud roared the Ocean, King of all being, generating creatures.
Steer, in the filter, on the fleecy summit, Soma, the Drop effused, hath waxen mighty.
41 Soma the Steer, in that as Child of Waters he chose the Gods, performed that great achievement.
He, Pavamana, granted strength to Indra; he, Indu, generated light in Surya.
42 Make Vayu glad,, for furtherance and bounty: cheer Varuna and Mitra, as they cleanse thee.
Gladden the Gods, gladden the host of Maruts: make Heaven and Earth rejoice, O God, O Soma.
43 Flow onward righteous slayer of the wicked, driving away our enemies and sickness,
Blending thy milk with milk which cows afford us. We are thy friends, thou art the Friend of Indra.
44 Pour us a fount of meath, a spring of treasure; send us a hero son and happy fortune.
Be sweet to India when they cleanse thee, Indu, and pour down riches on us from the ocean.
45 Strong Soma, pressed, like an impetuous courser, hath flowed in stream as a flood speeding downward.
Cleansed, he hath settled in his wooden dwelling: Indu hath flowed with milk and with the waters.
46 Strong, wise, for thee who longest for his coming this Soma here flows to the bowls, O Indra.
He, chariot-borne, sun-bright, and truly potent, was poured forth like the longing of the pious.
47 He, purified with ancient vital vigour, pervading all his Daughter's forms and figures,
Finding his threefold refuge in the waters, goes singing, as a priest, to the assemblies.
48 Now, chariot-borne, flow unto us, God Soma, as thou art purified flow to the saucers,
Sweetest in waters, rich in meath, and holy, as Savitar the God is, truthfulminded.
49 To feast him, flow mid song and hymn, to Vayu, flow purified to Varuna and Mitra.
Flow to the song-inspiring car-borne Hero, to mighty Indra, him who wields the thunder.
50 Pour on us garments that shall clothe us meetly, send, purified, miIch-kine, abundant yielders.
God Soma, send us chariot-drawing horses that they may bring us treasures bright and golden.
51 Send to us in a stream celestial riches, send us, when thou art cleansed, what earth containeth,
So that thereby we may acquire possessions and Rsihood in Jamadagni's manner.
52 Pour forth this wealth with this purification: flow onward to the yellow lake, O Indu.
Here, too, the Ruddy, wind-swift, full of wisdom, Shall give a son to him who cometh quickly.
53 Flow on for us with this purification to the famed ford of thee whose due is glory.
May the Foe-queller shake us down, for triumph, like a tree's ripe fruit, sixty thousand treasures.
54 Eagerly do we pray for those two exploits, at the blue lake and Prsana, wrought in battle.
He sent our enemies to sleep and slew thern, and turned away the foolish and unfriendly.
55 Thou comest unto three extended filters, and hasteriest through each one as they cleanse thee.
Thou art the giver of the gift, a Bhaga, a Maghavan for liberal lords, O Indu.
56 This Soma here, the Wise, the All-obtainer, flows on his way as King of all existence.
Driving the drops at our assemblies, Indu completely traverses the fleecy filter.
57 The Great Inviolate are kissing Indu, and singing in his place like eager sages.
The wise men send him forth with ten swift fingers, and balm his form with essence of the waters.
58 Soma, may we, with thee as Pavamana, pile up together all our spoil in battle.
This boon vouchsafe us Varuna and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.

Who with exhilarating juice goes forth to all the Deities.
8 Through longing for this sap of yours ye drink what brings ability,
Even him who, dear as heaven's own light, gives to our princes high renown.
9 Indu at holy rites produced you, Heaven and Earth, the Friends of men,
Hill-haunting God the Goddesses. They bruised him where the roar was loud.
10 For Vrtra-slaying Indra, thou, Soma, art poured that he may drink,
Poured for the guerdon-giving man, poured for the God who sitteth there.
11 These ancient Somas, at the break of day, have flowed into the sieve,
Snorting away at early morn these foolish evil-hearted ones.
12 Friends, may the princes, ye and we, obtain this Most Resplendent One.
Gain him who hath the smell of strength, win him whose home is very strength.

What time the sacrificer's thoughts speed on his way the Golden-hued.

That which kine took into their mouths, of old, and princes take it now.
4 To him, while purifying, they have raised the ancient psalm of praise:
And sacred songs which bear the names of Gods have supplicated him.

Him they instruct as messenger to bear the sage's morning prayer.
6 Soma, best Cheerer, takes his seat, the while they cleanse him in the bowls.
He as it were impregns the cow, and babbles on, the Lord of Song.
7 He is effused and beautified, a God for Gods, by skilful men.

Hastening onward through the fleece like a fierce horse who wins the prize.

Effused for Indra, for his drink, for Mitra and for Varuna.
6 Flow to the filter with thy stream, effused, best winner, thou, of spoil,
O Soma, as most rich in sweets for Indra, Visnu, and the Gods.
7 The mothers, void of guiles, caress thee Golden-coloured, in the sieve,
As cows, O Pavamana, lick the new-born calf, as Law commands.
8 Thou, Pavamana, movest on with wondrous rays to great renown.
Striving within the votary's house thou drivest all the glooms away.

Drive ye away the dog, my friends, drive ye the long-tongued dog away.

By pressing-stones, to sacrifice.
4 The Somas, very rich in sweets, for which the sieve is destined, flow,
Effused, the source of Indra's joy: may your strong juices reach the Gods.
5 Indu flows on for Indra's sake: thus have the Deities declared.
The Lord of Speech exerts himself, Ruler of all, because of might.
6 Inciter of the voice of song, with thousand streams the ocean flows,
Even Soma, Lord of opulence, the Friend of Indra, day by day.
7 As Pusan, Fortune, Bhaga, comes this Soma while they make him pure.
He, Lord of the multitude, hath looked upon the earth and heaven.
8 The dear cows lowed in joyful mood together to the gladdening drink.
The drops as they were purified, the Soma juices, made then paths.
9 O Pavamana, bring the juice, the mightiest, worthy to be famed,
Which the Five Tribes have over them, whereby we may win opulence.
10 For us the Soma juices flow, the drops best furtherers of our weal,
Effused as friends without a spot, benevolent, finders of the light.
11 Effused by means of pressing-stones, upon the ox-hide visible,
They, treasure-finders, have announced food unto us from every side.
12 Tlese Soma juices, skilled in song, purified, blent with milk and curd,
When moving and when firmly laid in oil, resemble lovely Suns.
13 Let not the power of men restrain the voice of the outpouring juice:
As Bhrgu's sons chased Makha, so drive ye the greedy hound away.
14 The Friend hath wrapped him in his robe, as in his parents arms, a son.
He went, as lover to a dame, to take his station suitor-like.
15 That Hero who produces strength, he who hath propped both worlds apart,
Gold-hued, hath wrapped him in the sieve, to settle, priest-like, in his place.
16 Soma upon the ox's skin through the sheep's wool flows purified.
Bellowing out, the Tawny Steer goes on to Indra's special place.

Secret and dear through seven lights of sacrifice.
3 Urge to three courses, on the heights of Trita, riches in a stream.
He who is passing wise measures his courses out.
4 Even at his birth the Mothers Seven taught him, for glory, like a sage,
So that he, firm and sure, hath set his mind on wealth.
5 Under his sway, of one accord, are all the guileless Deities:
Warriors to be envied, they, when they are pleased.
6 The Babe whom they who strengthen Law have generated fair to see,
Much longed for at the sacrifice, most liberal Sage,-
7 To him, united, of themselves, come the young Parents of the rite,
When they adorn him, duly weaving sacrifice.

Speeding at solemn rite the plan of Holy Law.

HYMN CVI. Soma Pavamana.

1. To Indra, to the Mighty Steer, may these gold-coloured juices go,
Drops rapidly produced, that find the light of heaven.
2 Effused, this juice victorious flows for Indra, for his maintenance.
Soma bethinks him of the Conqueror, as he knows.
3 May Indra in his raptures gain from him the grasp that gathers spoil,
And, winning waters, wield the steerstrong thunderbolt.
4 Flow vigilant for Indra, thou Soma, yea, Indu, run thou on:
Bring hither splendid strength that finds the light of heaven.
5 Do thou, all-beautiful, purify for Indra's sake the mighty juice,
Path-maker thou, far seeing, with a thousand ways.
6 Best finder of prosperity for us, most rich in sweets for Gods,
Proceed thou loudly roaring on a thousand paths.
7 O Indu, with thy streams, in might, flow for the banquet of the Gods:
Rich in meath, Soma, in our beaker take thy place.
8 Thy drops that swim in water have exalted Indra to delight:
The Gods have drunk thee up for immortality.
9 Stream opulence to us, ye drops of Soma, pressed and purified,
Pouring down rain from heaven in hoods, and finding light.
10 Soma, while filtered, with his wave flows through the long wool of the sheep,
Shouting while purified before the voice of song.
11 With songs they send the Mighty forth, sporting in wood, above the fleece:
Our psalms have glorified him of the triple height.
12 Into the jars hath he been loosed, like an impetuous steed for war,
And lifting up his voice, while filtered, glided on.
13 Gold-hued and lovely in his course, througb tangles of the wool he flows,
And pours heroic fame upon the worshippers.
14 Flow thus, a faithful votary: the streams of meath have been effused.
Thou comest to the filter, singing, from each side.

Men skilful at their work drive him forth, like a car, into the rivers from their bands.

Intelligent drops above the basin of the sea, exhilarating, finding light.

Many fiends follow me; help me, thou Tawny-hued; pass on beyond these barriers.

Thou flowest, Soma Pavamana, balmed with milk unto the special place of Gods.
23 Flow on to win us strength, flow on to lofty lore of every kind.
Thou, Soma, as Exhilarator wast the first to spread the sea abroad for Gods.
24 Flow to the realm of earth, flow to the realm of heaven, O Soma, in thy righteous ways.
Fair art thou whom the sages, O Far-seeing One, urge onward with their songs and hymns.
25 Over the cleansing sieve have flowed the Pavamanas in a stream,
Girt by the Maruts, gladdening, Steeds with Indra's stiength, for wisdom and for dainty food.
