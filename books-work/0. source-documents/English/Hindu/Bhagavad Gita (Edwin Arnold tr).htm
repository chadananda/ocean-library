<p>  <p class=left> CHAPTER I<br>
<p class=left> Of the Distress of Arjuna

<p>  Dhritirashtra. Ranged thus for battle on the sacred plain- <br>
On Kurukshetra- say, Sanjaya! say <br>
What wrought my people, and the Pandavas? <br>
Sanjaya. When he beheld the host of Pandavas, <br>
Raja Duryodhana to Drona drew, <br>
And spake these words: "Ah, Guru! see this line, <br>
How vast it is of Pandu fighting-men, <br>
Embattled by the son of Drupada, <br>
Thy scholar in the war! Therein stand ranked <br>
Chiefs like Arjuna, like to Bhima chiefs, <br>
Benders of bows; Virata, Yuyudhan, <br>
Drupada, eminent upon his car, <br>
Dhrishtaket, Chekitan, Kasi's stout lord, <br>
Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and Saivya, <br>
With Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauj <br>
Subhadra's child; and Drupadi's;- all famed! <br>
All mounted on their shining chariots! <br>
On our side, too,- thou best of Brahmans! see <br>
Excellent chiefs, commanders of my line, <br>
Whose names I joy to count: thyself the first, <br>
Then Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight, <br>
Vikarna, Aswatthaman; next to these <br>
Strong Saumadatti, with full many more <br>
Valiant and tried, ready this day to die <br>
For me their king, each with his weapon grasped, <br>
Each skilful in the field. Weakest- meseems- <br>
Our battle shows where Bhishma holds command, <br>
And Bhima, fronting him, something too strong! <br>
Have care our captains nigh to Bhishma's ranks <br>
Prepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!" 

<p>  Then, at the signal of the aged king, <br>
With blare to wake the blood, rolling around <br>
Like to a lion's roar, the trumpeter <br>
Blew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it, <br>
Trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns <br>
Burst into sudden clamour; as the blasts <br>
Of loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed! <br>
Then might be seen, upon their car of gold <br>
Yoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells, <br>
Krishna the God, Arjuna at his side: <br>
Krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch <br>
Carved of the "Giant's bone;" Arjuna blew <br>
Indra's loud gift; Bhima the terrible- <br>
Wolf-bellied Bhima- blew a long reed-conch; <br>
And Yudhisthira, Kunti's blameless son, <br>
Winded a mighty shell, "Victory's Voice;" <br>
And Nakula blew shrill upon his conch <br>
Named the "Sweet-sounding," Sahadev on his <br>
Called "Gem-bedecked," and Kasi's Prince on his. <br>
Sikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn, <br>
Virata, Satyaki the Unsubdued, <br>
Drupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!) <br>
Long-armed Subhadra's children, all blew loud, <br>
So that the clangour shook their foemen's hearts, <br>
With quaking earth and thundering heav'n. <br>
Then 'twas- <br>
Beholding Dhritirashtra's battle set, <br>
Weapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war <br>
Instant to break- Arjun, whose ensign-badge <br>
Was Hanuman the monkey, spake this thing <br>
To Krishna the Divine, his charioteer: <br>
"Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground <br>
Betwixt the armies; I would see more nigh <br>
These who will fight with us, those we must slay <br>
To-day, in war's arbitrament; for, sure, <br>
On bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain, <br>
Obeying Dhritirashtra's sinful son." 

<p>  Thus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!) <br>
Between the hosts that heavenly Charioteer <br>
Drove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds <br>
Where Bhishma led, and Drona, and their Lords. <br>
"See!" spake he to Arjuna, "where they stand, <br>
Thy kindred of the Kurus:" and the Prince <br>
Marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house, <br>
Grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons, <br>
Cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed <br>
With friends and honoured elders; some this side, <br>
Some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed, <br>
Such kith grown enemies- Arjuna's heart <br>
Melted with pity, while he uttered this: <br>
Arjuna. Krishna! as I behold, come here to shed <br>
Their common blood, yon concourse of our kin, <br>
My members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth, <br>
A shudder thrills my body, and my hair <br>
Bristles with horror; from my weak hand slips <br>
Gandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns <br>
My skin to parching; hardly may I stand; <br>
The life within me seems to swim and faint; <br>
Nothing do I foresee save woe and wail! <br>
It is not good, O Keshav! nought of good <br>
Can spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate <br>
Triumph and domination, wealth and ease, <br>
Thus sadly won! Aho! what victory <br>
Can bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils <br>
Could profit; what rule recompense; what span <br>
Of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood? <br>
Seeing that these stand here, ready to die, <br>
For whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased, <br>
And power grew precious:- grandsires, sires, and sons, <br>
Brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law, <br>
Elders and friends! Shall I deal death on these <br>
Even though they seek to slay us? Not one blow, <br>
O Madhusudan! will I strike to gain <br>
The rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less <br>
To seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these <br>
Must breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be <br>
Guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths; <br>
Their sins will light on us, if we shall slay <br>
Those sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin; <br>
What peace could come of that, O Madhava? <br>
For if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath, <br>
These cannot see, or will not see, the sin <br>
Of kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain, <br>
How should not we, who see, shun such a crime- <br>
We who perceive the guilt and feel the shame- <br>
O thou Delight of Men, Janardana? <br>
By overthrow of houses perisheth <br>
Their sweet continuous household piety, <br>
And- rites neglected, piety extinct- <br>
Enters impiety upon that home; <br>
Its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring <br>
Mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes, <br>
Sending a Hell-ward road that family, <br>
And whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath. <br>
Nay, and the souls of honoured ancestors <br>
Fall from their place of peace, being bereft <br>
Of funeral-cakes and the wan death-water. <br>
So teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay <br>
Kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power, <br>
Ahovat! what an evil fault it were! <br>
Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike, <br>
To face them weaponless, and bare my breast <br>
To shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow. 

<p>  So speaking, in the face of those two hosts, <br>
Arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat, <br>
And let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart. 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER I OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Arjun-Vishad," <br>
Or "The Book of the Distress of Arjuna." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER II <br>
Of Doctrines

<p>  Sanjaya. Him, filled with such compassion and such grief, <br>
With eyes tear-dimmed, despondent, in stern words <br>
The Driver, Madhusudan, thus addressed: <br>
Krishna. How hath this weakness taken thee? <br>
Whence springs <br>
The inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave, <br>
Barring the path of virtue? Nay, Arjun! <br>
Forbid thyself to feebleness! it mars <br>
Thy warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit! <br>
Wake! Be thyself! Arise, Scourge of thy Foes! <br>
Arjuna. How can I, in the battle, shoot with shafts <br>
On Bhishma, or on Drona- O thou Chief!- <br>
Both worshipful, both honourable men? 

<p>  Better to live on beggar's bread <br>
With those we love alive, <br>
Than taste their blood in rich feasts spread, <br>
And guiltily survive! <br>
Ah! were it worse- who knows?- to be <br>
Victor or vanquished here, <br>
When those confront us angrily <br>
Whose death leaves living drear? <br>
In pity lost, by doubtings tossed, <br>
My thoughts- distracted- turn <br>
To Thee, the Guide I reverence most, <br>
That I may counsel learn: <br>
I know not what would heal the grief <br>
Burned into soul and sense, <br>
If I were earth's unchallenged chief- <br>
A god- and these gone thence! 

<p>  Sanjaya. So spake Arjuna to the Lord of Hearts, <br>
And sighing, "I will not fight!" held silence then. <br>
To whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata!) <br>
While the Prince wept despairing 'twixt those hosts, <br>
Krishna made answer in divinest verse: <br>
Krishna. Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak'st <br>
Words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart <br>
Mourn not for those that live, nor those that die. <br>
Nor I, nor thou, nor any one of these, <br>
Ever was not, nor ever will not be, <br>
For ever and for ever afterwards. <br>
All, that doth live, lives always! To man's frame <br>
As there come infancy and youth and age, <br>
So come there raisings-up and layings-down <br>
Of other and of other life-abodes, <br>
Which the wise know, and fear not. This that irks- <br>
Thy sense-life, thrilling to the elements- <br>
Bringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys, <br>
'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince! <br>
As the wise bear. The soul which is not moved, <br>
The soul that with a strong and constant calm <br>
Takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently, <br>
Lives in the life undying! That which is <br>
Can never cease to be; that which is not <br>
Will not exist. To see this truth of both <br>
Is theirs who part essence from accident, <br>
Substance from shadow. Indestructible, <br>
Learn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all; <br>
It cannot anywhere, by any means, <br>
Be anywise diminished, stayed, or changed. <br>
But for these fleeting frames which it informs <br>
With spirit deathless, endless, infinite, <br>
They perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight! <br>
He who shall say, "Lo! I have slain a man!" <br>
He who shall think, "Lo! I am slain!" those both <br>
Know naught! Life cannot slay. Life is not slain! <br>
Never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never; <br>
Never was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams! <br>
Birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for <br>
ever; <br>
Death hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it <br>
seems! <br>
Who knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained, <br>
Immortal, indestructible,- shall such <br>
Say, "I have killed a man, or caused to kill?" 

<p>  Nay, but as when one layeth <br>
His worn-out robes away, <br>
And, taking new ones, sayeth, <br>
"These will I wear to-day!" <br>
So putteth by the spirit <br>
Lightly its garb of flesh, <br>
And passeth to inherit <br>
A residence afresh. 

<p>  I say to thee weapons reach not the Life; <br>
Flame burns it not, waters cannot o'erwhelm, <br>
Nor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable, <br>
Unentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched, <br>
Immortal, all-arriving, stable, sure, <br>
Invisible, ineffable, by word <br>
And thought uncompassed, ever all itself, <br>
Thus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,- <br>
Knowing it so,- grieve when thou shouldst not grieve? <br>
How, if thou hearest that the man new-dead <br>
Is, like the man new-born, still living man- <br>
One same, existent Spirit- wilt thou weep? <br>
The end of birth is death; the end of death <br>
Is birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou, <br>
Chief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls <br>
Which could not otherwise befall? The birth <br>
Of living things comes unperceived; the death <br>
Comes unperceived; between them, beings perceive: <br>
What is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince? 

<p>  Wonderful, wistful, to contemplate! <br>
Difficult, doubtful, to speak upon! <br>
Strange and great for tongue to relate, <br>
Mystical hearing for every one! <br>
Nor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is, <br>
When seeing, and saying, and hearing are done! 

<p>  This Life within all living things, my Prince! <br>
Hides beyond harm; scorn thou to suffer, then, <br>
For that which cannot suffer. Do thy part! <br>
Be mindful of thy name, and tremble not! <br>
Nought better can betide a martial soul <br>
Than lawful war; happy the warrior <br>
To whom comes joy of battle- comes, as now, <br>
Glorious and fair, unsought; opening for him <br>
A gateway unto Heav'n. But, if thou shunn'st <br>
This honourable field- a Kshattriya- <br>
If, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd'st <br>
Duty and task go by- that shall be sin! <br>
And those to come shall speak thee infamy <br>
From age to age; but infamy is worse <br>
For men of noble blood to bear than death! <br>
The chiefs upon their battle-chariots <br>
Will deem 'twas fear that drove thee from the fray. <br>
Of those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn <br>
Thou must abide, while all thine enemies <br>
Will scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock <br>
The valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall <br>
More grievously than this? Either- being killed- <br>
Thou wilt win Swarga's safety, or- alive <br>
And victor- thou wilt reign an earthly king. <br>
Therefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace <br>
Thine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet- <br>
As things alike to thee- pleasure or pain, <br>
Profit or ruin, victory or defeat: <br>
So minded, gird thee to the fight, for so <br>
Thou shalt not sin! <br>
Thus far I speak to thee <br>
As from the "Sankhya"- unspiritually- <br>
Hear now the deeper teaching of the Yog, <br>
Which holding, understanding, thou shalt burst <br>
Thy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds. <br>
Here shall no end be hindered, no hope marred, <br>
No loss be feared: faith- yea, a little faith- <br>
Shall save thee from the anguish of thy dread. <br>
Here, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule- <br>
One steadfast rule- while shifting souls have laws <br>
Many and hard. Specious, but wrongful deem <br>
The speech of those ill-taught ones who extol <br>
The letter of their Vedas, saying, "This <br>
Is all we have, or need;" being weak at heart <br>
With wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes- they say- <br>
As "fruit of good deeds done;" promising men <br>
Much profit in new births for works of faith; <br>
In various rites abounding; following whereon <br>
Large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power; <br>
Albeit, who wealth and power do most desire <br>
Least fixity of soul have such, least hold <br>
On heavenly meditation. Much these teach, <br>
From Veds, concerning the "three qualities;" <br>
But thou, be free of the "three qualities," <br>
Free of the "pairs of opposites," and free <br>
From that sad righteousness which calculates; <br>
Self-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied. <br>
Look! like as when a tank pours water forth <br>
To suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw <br>
Text for all wants from tank of Holy Writ. <br>
But thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward <br>
Of doing right in right! Let right deeds be <br>
Thy motive, not the fruit which comes from them. <br>
And live in action! Labour! Make thine acts <br>
Thy piety, casting all self aside, <br>
Contemning gain and merit; equable <br>
In good or evil: equability <br>
Is Yog, is piety! <br>
Yet, the right act <br>
Is less, far less, than the right-thinking mind. <br>
Seek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven! <br>
Scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts! <br>
The mind of pure devotion- even here- <br>
Casts equally aside good deeds and bad, <br>
Passing above them. Unto pure devotion <br>
Devote thyself: with perfect meditation <br>
Comes perfect act, and the righthearted rise- <br>
More certainly because they seek no gain- <br>
Forth from the bands of body, step by step, <br>
To highest seats of bliss. When thy firm soul <br>
Hath shaken off those tangled oracles <br>
Which ignorantly guide, then shall it soar <br>
To high neglect of what's denied or said, <br>
This way or that way, in doctrinal writ. <br>
Troubled no longer by the priestly lore, <br>
Safe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent <br>
On meditation. This is Yog- and Peace! <br>
Arjuna. What is his mark who hath that steadfast heart, <br>
Confirmed in holy meditation? How <br>
Know we his speech, Kesava? Sits he, moves he <br>
Like other men? <br>
Krishna. When one, O Pritha's Son!- <br>
Abandoning desires which shake the mind- <br>
Finds in his soul full comfort for his soul, <br>
He hath attained the Yog- that man is such! <br>
In sorrows not dejected, and in joys <br>
Not overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress <br>
Of passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms <br>
Of lofty contemplation;- such an one <br>
Is Muni, is the Sage, the true Recluse! <br>
He who to none and nowhere overbound <br>
By ties of flesh, takes evil things and good <br>
Neither desponding nor exulting, such <br>
Bears wisdom's plainest mark He who shall draw <br>
As the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe <br>
Under its shield, his five frail senses back <br>
Under the spirit's buckler from the world <br>
Which else assails them, such an one, my Prince! <br>
Hath wisdom's mark! Things that solicit sense <br>
Hold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes, <br>
The appetites of him who lives beyond <br>
Depart,- aroused no more. Yet may it chance, <br>
O Son of Kunti that a governed mind <br>
Shall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest <br>
Strong self-control by the roots. Let him regain <br>
His kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit <br>
On Me intent. That man alone is wise <br>
Who keeps the mastery of himself! If one <br>
Ponders on objects of the sense, there springs <br>
Attraction; from attraction grows desire, <br>
Desire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds <br>
Recklessness; then the memory- all betrayed- <br>
Lets noble purpose go, and saps the mind, <br>
Till purpose, mind, and man are all undone. <br>
But, if one deals with objects of the sense <br>
Not loving and not hating, making them <br>
Serve his free soul, which rests serenely lord, <br>
Lo! such a man comes to tranquillity; <br>
And out of that tranquillity shall rise <br>
The end and healing of his earthly pains, <br>
Since the will governed sets the soul at peace. <br>
The soul of the ungoverned is not his, <br>
Nor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked, <br>
How grows serenity? and, wanting that, <br>
Whence shall he hope for happiness? <br>
The mind <br>
That gives itself to follow shows of sense <br>
Seeth its helm of wisdom rent away, <br>
And, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives <br>
To wreck and death. Only with him, great Prince! <br>
Whose senses are not swayed by things of sense- <br>
Only with him who holds his mastery, <br>
Shows wisdom perfect. What is midnight-gloom <br>
To unenlightened souls shines wakeful day <br>
To his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day <br>
Is known for night, thick night of ignorance, <br>
To his true-seeing eyes. Such is the Saint! <br>
And like the ocean, day by day receiving <br>
Floods from all lands, which never overflows; <br>
Its boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving, <br>
Fed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;- <br>
So is the perfect one! to his soul's ocean <br>
The world of sense pours streams of witchery, <br>
They leave him as they find, without commotion, <br>
Taking their tribute, but remaining sea. <br>
Yea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh <br>
Lives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free <br>
From pride, from passion, from the sin of "Self," <br>
Toucheth tranquillity! O Pritha's Son! <br>
That is the state of Brahm! There rests no dread <br>
When that last step is reached! Live where he will, <br>
Die when he may, such passeth from all 'plaining, <br>
To blest Nirvana, with the Gods, attaining. 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER II OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Sankhya-Yog," <br>
Or "The Book of Doctrines." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER III <br>
Of Virtue in Work

<p>  Arjuna. Thou whom all mortals praise, Janardana! <br>
If meditation be a nobler thing <br>
Than action, wherefore, then, great Kesava! <br>
Dost thou impel me to this dreadful fight? <br>
Now am I by thy doubtful speech disturbed! <br>
Tell me one thing, and tell me certainly; <br>
By what road shall I find the better end? <br>
Krishna. I told thee, blameless Lord! there be paths <br>
Shown to this world; two schools of wisdom. First <br>
The Sankhya's, which doth save in way of works <br>
Prescribed by reason; next, the Yog, which bids <br>
Attain by meditation, spiritually: <br>
Yet these are one! No man shall 'scape from act <br>
By shunning action; nay, and none shall come <br>
By mere renouncements unto perfectness. <br>
Nay, and no jot of time, at any time, <br>
Rests any actionless; his nature's law <br>
Compels him, even unwilling, into act; <br>
[For thought is act in fancy]. He who sits <br>
Suppressing all the instruments of flesh, <br>
Yet in his idle heart thinking on them, <br>
Plays the inept and guilty hypocrite: <br>
But he who, with strong body serving mind, <br>
Gives up his mortal powers to worthy work, <br>
Not seeking gain, Arjuna! such an one <br>
Is honourable. Do thine allotted task! <br>
Work is more excellent than idleness; <br>
The body's life proceeds not, lacking work. <br>
There is a task of holiness to do, <br>
Unlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not <br>
The faithful soul; such earthly duty do <br>
Free from desire, and thou shalt well perform <br>
Thy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati- <br>
In the beginning, when all men were made, <br>
And, with mankind, the sacrifice- "Do this! <br>
Work! sacrifice! Increase and multiply <br>
With sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk, <br>
Your 'Cow of Plenty,' giving back her milk <br>
Of all abundance. Worship the gods thereby; <br>
The gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye <br>
The gods will grant to Labour, when it pays <br>
Tithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats <br>
Fruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven <br>
No gift of toil, that thief steals from his world." 

<p>  Who eat of food after their sacrifice <br>
Are quit of fault, but they that spread a feast <br>
All for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin. <br>
By food the living live; food comes of rain, <br>
And rain comes by the pious sacrifice, <br>
And sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil; <br>
Thus action is of Brahma, who is One, <br>
The Only, All-pervading; at all times <br>
Present in sacrifice. He that abstains <br>
To help the rolling wheels of this great world, <br>
Glutting his idle sense, lives a lost life, <br>
Shameful and vain. Existing for himself, <br>
Self-concentrated, serving self alone, <br>
No part hath he in aught; nothing achieved, <br>
Nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope <br>
Of help for all the living things of earth <br>
Depends from him. Therefore, thy task prescribed <br>
With spirit unattached gladly perform, <br>
Since in performance of plain duty man <br>
Mounts to his highest bliss. By works alone <br>
Janak and ancient saints reached blessedness! <br>
Moreover, for the upholding of thy kind, <br>
Action thou should'st embrace. What the wise choose <br>
The unwise people take; what best men do <br>
The multitude will follow. Look on me, <br>
Thou Son of Pritha! in the three wide worlds <br>
I am not bound to any toil, no height <br>
Awaits to scale, no gift remains to gain, <br>
Yet I act here! and, if I acted not- <br>
Earnest and watchful- those that look to me <br>
For guidance, sinking back to sloth again <br>
Because I slumbered, would decline from good, <br>
And I should break earth's order and commit <br>
Her offspring unto ruin, Bharata! <br>
Even as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense, <br>
So let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set <br>
To bring the world deliverance, and its bliss; <br>
Not sowing in those simple, busy hearts <br>
Seed of despair. Yea! let each play his part <br>
In all he finds to do, with unyoked soul. <br>
All things are everywhere by Nature wrought <br>
In interaction of the quahties. <br>
The fool, cheated by self, thinks, "This I did" <br>
And "That I wrought;" but- ah, thou strong-armed Prince!- <br>
A better-lessoned mind, knowing the play <br>
Of visible things within the world of sense, <br>
And how the qualities must qualify, <br>
Standeth aloof even from his acts. Th' untaught <br>
Live mixed with them, knowing not Nature's way, <br>
Of highest aims unwitting, slow and dull. <br>
Those make thou not to stumble, having the light; <br>
But all thy dues discharging, for My sake, <br>
With meditation centred inwardly, <br>
Seeking no profit, satisfied, serene, <br>
Heedless of issue- fight! They who shall keep <br>
My ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts, <br>
Have quittance from all issue of their acts; <br>
But those who disregard My ordinance, <br>
Thinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss, <br>
Confused and foolish. 'Sooth, the instructed one <br>
Doth of his kind, following what fits him most: <br>
And lower creatures of their kind; in vain <br>
Contending 'gainst the law. Needs must it be <br>
The objects of the sense will stir the sense <br>
To like and dislike, yet th' enlightened man <br>
Yields not to these, knowing them enemies. <br>
Finally, this is better, that one do <br>
His own task as he may, even though he fail, <br>
Than take tasks not his own, though they seem good. <br>
To die performing duty is no ill; <br>
But who seeks other roads shall wander still. <br>
Arjuna. Yet tell me, Teacher! by what force doth man <br>
Go to his ill, unwilling; as if one <br>
Pushed him that evil path? <br>
Krishna. Kama it is! <br>
Passion it is! born of the Darknesses, <br>
Which pusheth him. Mighty of appetite, <br>
Sinful, and strong is this!- man's enemy! <br>
As smoke blots the white fire, as clinging rust <br>
Mars the bright mirror, as the womb surrounds <br>
The babe unborn, so is the world of things <br>
Foiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh. <br>
The wise fall, caught in it; the unresting foe <br>
It is of wisdom, wearing countless forms, <br>
Fair but deceitful, subtle as a flame. <br>
Sense, mind, and reason- these, O Kunti's Son! <br>
Are booty for it; in its play with these <br>
It maddens man, beguiling, blinding him. <br>
Therefore, thou noblest child of Bharata! <br>
Govern thy heart! Constrain th' entangled sense! <br>
Resist the false, soft sinfulness which saps <br>
Knowledge and judgment! Yea, the world is strong <br>
But what discerns it stronger, and the mind <br>
Strongest; and high o'er all the ruling Soul. <br>
Wherefore, perceiving Him who reigns supreme, <br>
Put forth full force of Soul in thy own soul! <br>
Fight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear Hero! slay <br>
What haunts thee in fond shapes, and would betray! 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER III OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Karma-Yog," <br>
Or "The Book of Virtue in Work." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER IV <br>
Of the Religion of Knowledge

<p>  Krishna. This deathless Yoga, this deep union, <br>
I taught Vivaswata, the Lord of Light; <br>
Vivaswata to Manu gave it; he <br>
To Ikshwaku; so passed it down the line <br>
Of all my royal Rishis. Then, with years, <br>
The truth grew dim and perished, noble Prince! <br>
Now once again to thee it is declared- <br>
This ancient lore, this mystery supreme- <br>
Seeing I find thee votary and friend. <br>
Arjuna. Thy birth, dear Lord, was in these later days <br>
And bright Vivaswata's preceded time! <br>
How shall I comprehend this thing thou sayest, <br>
"From the beginning it was I who taught?" <br>
Krishna. Manifold the renewals of my birth <br>
Have been, Arjuna! and of thy births, too! <br>
But mine I know, and thine thou knowest not, <br>
O Slayer of thy Foes! Albeit I be <br>
Unborn, undying, indestructible, <br>
The Lord of all things living; not the less- <br>
By Maya, by my magic which I stamp <br>
On floating Nature-forms, the primal vast- <br>
I come, and go, and come. When Righteousness <br>
Declines, O Bharata! when Wickedness <br>
Is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take <br>
Visible shape, and move a man with men, <br>
Succouring the good, thrusting the evil back, <br>
And setting Virtue on her seat again. <br>
Who knows the truth touching my births on earth <br>
And my divine work, when he quits the flesh <br>
Puts on its load no more, falls no more down <br>
To earthly birth: to Me he comes, dear Prince! 

<p>  Many there be who come! from fear set free, <br>
From anger, from desire; keeping their hearts <br>
Fixed upon me- my Faithful- purified <br>
By sacred flame of Knowledge. Such as these <br>
Mix with my being. Whoso worship me, <br>
Them I exalt; but all men everywhere <br>
Shall fall into my path; albeit, those souls <br>
Which seek reward for works, make sacrifice <br>
Now, to the lower gods. I say to thee <br>
Here have they their reward. But I am He <br>
Made the Four Castes, and portioned them a place <br>
After their qualities and gifts. Yea, I <br>
Created, the Reposeful; I that live <br>
Immortally, made all those mortal births: <br>
For works soil not my essence, being works <br>
Wrought uninvolved. Who knows me acting thus <br>
Unchained by action, action binds not him; <br>
And, so perceiving, all those saints of old <br>
Worked, seeking for deliverance. Work thou <br>
As, in the days gone by, thy fathers did. <br>
Thou sayst, perplexed, It hath been asked before <br>
By singers and by sages, "What is act, <br>
And what inaction?" I will teach thee this, <br>
And, knowing, thou shalt learn which work doth save <br>
Needs must one rightly meditate those three- <br>
Doing,- not doing,- and undoing. Here <br>
Thorny and dark the path is! He who sees <br>
How action may be rest, rest action- he <br>
Is wisest 'mid his kind; he hath the truth! <br>
He doeth well, acting or resting. Freed <br>
In all his works from prickings of desire, <br>
Burned clean in act by the white fire of truth, <br>
The wise call that man wise; and such an one, <br>
Renouncing fruit of deeds, always content. <br>
Always self-satisfying, if he works, <br>
Doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul, <br>
Which- quit of fear and hope- subduing self- <br>
Rejecting outward impulse-yielding up <br>
To body's need nothing save body, dwells <br>
Sinless amid all sin, with equal calm <br>
Taking what may befall, by grief unmoved, <br>
Unmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same <br>
In good and evil fortunes; nowise bound <br>
By bond of deeds. Nay, but of such an one, <br>
Whose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate, <br>
Whose heart is set on truth- of such an one <br>
What work he does is work of sacrifice, <br>
Which passeth purely into ash and smoke <br>
Consumed upon the altar! All's then God! <br>
The sacrifice is Brahm, the ghee and grain <br>
Are Brahm, the fire is Brahm, the flesh it eats <br>
Is Brahm, and unto Brahm attaineth he <br>
Who, in such office, meditates on Brahm. <br>
Some votaries there be who serve the gods <br>
With flesh and altar-smoke; but other some <br>
Who, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite <br>
With will of worship. Of the which be they <br>
Who, in white flame of continence, consume <br>
Joys of the sense, delights of eye and ear, <br>
Foregoing tender speech and sound of song: <br>
And they who, kindling fires with torch of Truth, <br>
Burn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss <br>
Of youth and love, renouncing happiness: <br>
And they who lay for offering there their wealth, <br>
Their penance, meditation, piety, <br>
Their steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore <br>
Painfully gained with long austerities: <br>
And they who, making silent sacrifice, <br>
Draw in their breath to feed the flame of thought, <br>
And breathe it forth to waft the heart on high, <br>
Governing the ventage of each entering air <br>
Lest one sigh pass which helpeth not the soul: <br>
And they who, day by day denying needs, <br>
Lay life itself upon the altar-flame, <br>
Burning the body wan. Lo! all these keep <br>
The rite of offering, as if they slew <br>
Victims; and all thereby efface much sin. <br>
Yea! and who feed on the immortal food <br>
Left of such sacrifice, to Brahma pass, <br>
To The Unending. But for him that makes <br>
No sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot <br>
Even in the present world. How should he share <br>
Another, O thou Glory of thy Line? 

<p>  In sight of Brahma all these offerings <br>
Are spread and are accepted! Comprehend <br>
That all proceed by act; for knowing this, <br>
Thou shalt be quit of doubt. The sacrifice <br>
Which Knowledge pays is better than great gifts <br>
Offered by wealth, since gifts' worth- O my Prince! <br>
Lies in the mind which gives, the will that serves: <br>
And these are gained by reverence, by strong search, <br>
By humble heed of those who see the Truth <br>
And teach it. Knowing Truth, thy heart no more <br>
Will ache with error, for the Truth shall show <br>
All things subdued to thee, as thou to Me. <br>
Moreover, Son of Pandu! wert thou worst <br>
Of all wrong-doers, this fair ship of Truth <br>
Should bear thee safe and dry across the sea <br>
Of thy transgressions. As the kindled flame <br>
Feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash, <br>
So unto ash, Arjuna! unto nought <br>
The flame of Knowledge wastes works' dross away! <br>
There is no purifier like thereto <br>
In all this world, and he who seeketh it <br>
Shall find it- being grown perfect- in himself. <br>
Believing, he receives it when the soul <br>
Masters itself, and cleaves to Truth, and comes- <br>
Possessing knowledge- to the higher peace, <br>
The uttermost repose. But those untaught, <br>
And those without full faith, and those who fear <br>
Are shent; no peace is here or other where, <br>
No hope, nor happiness for whoso doubts. <br>
He that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt, <br>
Disparting self from service, soul from works, <br>
Enlightened and emancipate, my Prince! <br>
Works fetter him no more! Cut then atwain <br>
With sword of wisdom, Son of Bharata! <br>
This doubt that binds thy heart-beats! cleave the bond <br>
Born of thy ignorance! Be bold and wise! <br>
Give thyself to the field with me! Arise! 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER IV OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Jnana Yog," <br>
Or "The Book of the Religion of Knowledge." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER V <br>
Of Religion by Renouncing Fruit of Works

<p>  Arjuna. Yet, Krishna at the one time thou dost laud <br>
Surcease of works, and, at another time, <br>
Service through work. Of these twain plainly tell <br>
Which is the better way? <br>
Krishna. To cease from works <br>
Is well, and to do works in holiness <br>
Is well; and both conduct to bliss supreme; <br>
But of these twain the better way is his <br>
Who working piously refraineth not. 

<p>  That is the true Renouncer, firm and fixed, <br>
Who- seeking nought, rejecting nought- dwells proof <br>
Against the "opposites." O valiant Prince! <br>
In doing, such breaks lightly from all deed: <br>
'Tis the new scholar talks as they were two, <br>
This Sankhya and this Yoga: wise men know <br>
Who husbands one plucks golden fruit of both! <br>
The region of high rest which Sankhyans reach <br>
Yogins attain. Who sees these twain as one <br>
Sees with clear eyes! Yet such abstraction, Chief! <br>
Is hard to win without much holiness. <br>
Whoso is fixed in holiness, self-ruled, <br>
Pure-hearted, lord of senses and of self, <br>
Lost in the common life of all which lives- <br>
A "Yogayukt"- he is a Saint who wends <br>
Straightway to Brahm. Such an one is not touched <br>
By taint of deeds. "Nought of myself I do!" <br>
Thus will he think- who holds the truth of truths- <br>
In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling; when <br>
He eats, or goes, or breathes; slumbers or talks, <br>
Holds fast or loosens, opes his eyes or shuts; <br>
Always assured "This is the sense-world plays <br>
With senses." He that acts in thought of Brahm, <br>
Detaching end from act, with act content, <br>
The world of sense can no more stain his soul <br>
Than waters mar th' enamelled lotus-leaf. <br>
With life, with heart, with mind,- nay, with the help <br>
Of all five senses- letting selfhood go- <br>
Yogins toil ever towards their souls' release. <br>
Such votaries, renouncing fruit of deeds, <br>
Gain endless peace: the unvowed, the passion-bound, <br>
Seeking a fruit from works, are fastened down. <br>
The embodied sage, withdrawn within his soul, <br>
At every act sits godlike in "the town <br>
Which hath nine gateways," neither doing aught <br>
Nor causing any deed. This world's Lord makes <br>
Neither the work, nor passion for the work, <br>
Nor lust for fruit of work; the man's own self <br>
Pushes to these! The Master of this World <br>
Takes on himself the good or evil deeds <br>
Of no man- dwelling beyond! Mankind errs here <br>
By folly, darkening knowledge. But, for whom <br>
That darkness of the soul is chased by light, <br>
Splendid and clear shines manifest the Truth <br>
As if a Sun of Wisdom sprang to shed <br>
Its beams of dawn. Him meditating still, <br>
Him seeking, with Him blended, stayed on Him, <br>
The souls illuminated take that road <br>
Which hath no turning back- their sins flung off, <br>
By strength of faith. [Who will may have this Light; <br>
Who hath it sees.] To him who wisely sees, <br>
The Brahman with his scrolls and sanctities, <br>
The cow, the elephant, the unclean dog, <br>
The Outcast gorging dog's meat, are all one. 

<p>  The world is overcome- aye! even here! <br>
By such as fix their faith on Unity. <br>
The sinless Brahma dwells in Unity, <br>
And they in Brahma. Be not over-glad <br>
Attaining joy, and be not over-sad <br>
Encountering grief, but, stayed on Brahma, still <br>
Constant let each abide! The sage whose soul <br>
Holds off from outer contacts, in himself <br>
Finds bliss; to Brahma joined by piety, <br>
His spirit tastes eternal peace. The joys <br>
Springing from sense-life are but quickening wombs <br>
Which breed sure griefs: those joys begin and end! <br>
The wise mind takes no pleasure, Kunti's Son! <br>
In such as those! But if a man shall learn, <br>
Even while he lives and bears his body's chain, <br>
To master lust and anger, he is blest! <br>
He is the Yukta; he hath happiness, <br>
Contentment, light, within: his life is merged <br>
In Brahma's life; he doth Nirvana touch! <br>
Thus go the Rishis unto rest, who dwell <br>
With sins effaced, with doubts at end, with hearts <br>
Governed and calm. Glad in all good they live, <br>
Nigh to the peace of God; and all those live <br>
Who pass their days exempt from greed and wrath, <br>
Subduing self and senses, knowing the Soul! 

<p>  The Saint who shuts outside his placid soul <br>
All touch of sense, letting no contact through; <br>
Whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows, <br>
Whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn <br>
Equal and slow through nostrils still and close; <br>
That one- with organs, heart, and mind constrained, <br>
Bent on deliverance, having put away <br>
Passion, and fear, and rage;- hath even now, <br>
Obtained deliverance, ever and ever freed. <br>
Yea! for he knows Me Who am He that heeds <br>
The sacrifice and worship, God revealed; <br>
And He who heeds not, being Lord of Worlds, <br>
Lover of all that lives, God unrevealed, <br>
Wherein who will shall find surety and shield! 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER V OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Karmasanyasayog," <br>
Or "The Book of Religion by Renouncing <br>
Fruit of Works." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER VI <br>
Of Religion of Self-Restraint

<p>  Krishna. Therefore, who doeth work rightful to do, <br>
Not seeking gain from work, that man, O Prince! <br>
Is Sanyasi and Yogi- both in one <br>
And he is neither who lights not the flame <br>
Of sacrifice, nor setteth hand to task. 

<p>  Regard as true Renouncer him that makes <br>
Worship by work, for who renounceth not <br>
Works not as Yogin. So is that well said: <br>
"By works the votary doth rise to faith, <br>
And saintship is the ceasing from all works; <br>
Because the perfect Yogin acts- but acts <br>
Unmoved by passions and unbound by deeds, <br>
Setting result aside. <br>
Let each man raise <br>
The Self by Soul, not trample down his Self, <br>
Since Soul that is Self's friend may grow Self's foe. <br>
Soul is Self's friend when Self doth rule o'er Self, <br>
But Self turns enemy if Soul's own self <br>
Hates Self as not itself. <br>
The sovereign soul <br>
Of him who lives self-governed and at peace <br>
Is centred in itself, taking alike <br>
Pleasure and pain; heat, cold; glory and shame. <br>
He is the Yogi, he is Yukta, glad <br>
With joy of light and truth; dwelling apart <br>
Upon a peak, with senses subjugate <br>
Whereto the clod, the rock, the glistering gold <br>
Show all as one. By this sign is he known <br>
Being of equal grace to comrades, friends, <br>
Chance-comers, strangers, lovers, enemies, <br>
Aliens and kinsmen; loving all alike, <br>
Evil or good. 

<p>  Sequestered should he sit, <br>
Steadfastly meditating, solitary, <br>
His thoughts controlled, his passions laid away, <br>
Quit of belongings. In a fair, still spot <br>
Having his fixed abode,- not too much raised, <br>
Nor yet too low,- let him abide, his goods <br>
A cloth, a deerskin, and the Kusa-grass. <br>
There, setting hard his mind upon The One, <br>
Restraining heart and senses, silent, calm, <br>
Let him accomplish Yoga, and achieve <br>
Pureness of soul, holding immovable <br>
Body and neck and head, his gaze absorbed <br>
Upon his nose-end, rapt from all around, <br>
Tranquil in spirit, free of fear, intent <br>
Upon his Brahmacharya vow, devout, <br>
Musing on Me, lost in the thought of Me. <br>
That Yogin, so devoted, so controlled, <br>
Comes to the peace beyond,- My peace, the peace <br>
Of high Nirvana! 

<p>  But for earthly needs <br>
Religion is not his who too much fasts <br>
Or too much feasts, nor his who sleeps away <br>
An idle mind; nor his who wears to waste <br>
His strength in vigils. Nay, Arjuna! I call <br>
That the true piety which most removes <br>
Earth-aches and ills, where one is moderate <br>
In eating and in resting, and in sport; <br>
Measured in wish and act; sleeping betimes, <br>
Waking betimes for duty. 

<p>  When the man, <br>
So living, centres on his soul the thought <br>
Straitly restrained- untouched internally <br>
By stress of sense- then is he Yukta. See! <br>
Steadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind; <br>
Such is the likeness of the Yogi's mind <br>
Shut from sense-storms and burning bright to Heaven. <br>
When mind broods placid, soothed with holy wont; <br>
When Self contemplates self, and in itself <br>
Hath comfort; when it knows the nameless joy <br>
Beyond all scope of sense, revealed to soul- <br>
Only to soul! and, knowing, wavers not, <br>
True to the farther Truth; when, holding this, <br>
It deems no other treasure comparable, <br>
But, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook <br>
By any gravest grief, call that state "peace," <br>
That happy severance Yoga; call that man <br>
The perfect Yogin! 

<p>  Steadfastly the will <br>
Must toil thereto, till efforts end in ease, <br>
And thought has passed from thinking. Shaking off <br>
All longings bred by dreams of fame and gain, <br>
Shutting the doorways of the senses close <br>
With watchful ward; so, step by step, it comes <br>
To gift of peace assured and heart assuaged, <br>
When the mind dwells self-wrapped, and the soul broods <br>
Cumberless. But, as often as the heart <br>
Breaks- wild and wavering- from control, so oft <br>
Let him re-curb it, let him rein it back <br>
To the soul's governance; for perfect bliss <br>
Grows only in the bosom tranquillised, <br>
The spirit passionless, purged from offence, <br>
Vowed to the Infinite. He who thus vows <br>
His soul to the Supreme Soul, quitting sin, <br>
Passes unhindered to the endless bliss <br>
Of unity with Brahma. He so vowed, <br>
So blended, sees the Life-Soul resident <br>
In all things living, and all living things <br>
In that Life-Soul contained. And whoso thus <br>
Discerneth Me in all, and all in Me, <br>
I never let him go; nor looseneth he <br>
Hold upon Me; but, dwell he where he may, <br>
Whate'er his life, in Me he dwells and lives, <br>
Because he knows and worships Me, Who dwell <br>
In all which lives, and cleaves to Me in all. <br>
Arjuna! if a man sees everywhere- <br>
Taught by his own similitude- one Life, <br>
One Essence in the Evil and the Good, <br>
Hold him a Yogi, yea! well perfected! <br>
Arjuna. Slayer of Madhu! yet again, this Yog, <br>
This Peace, derived from equanimity, <br>
Made known by thee- I see no fixity <br>
Therein, no rest, because the heart of men <br>
Is unfixed, Krishna! rash, tumultuous, <br>
Wilful and strong. It were all one, I think, <br>
To hold the wayward wind, as tame man's heart. <br>
Krishna. Hero long-armed! beyond denial, hard <br>
Man's heart is to restrain, and wavering; <br>
Yet may it grow restrained by habit, Prince! <br>
By wont of self-command. This Yog, I say, <br>
Cometh not lightly to th' ungoverned ones; <br>
But he who will be master of himself <br>
Shall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto. <br>
Arjuna. And what road goeth he who, having faith, <br>
Fails, Krishna! in the striving; falling back <br>
From holiness, missing the perfect rule? <br>
Is he not lost, straying from Brahma's light, <br>
Like the vain cloud, which floats 'twixt earth and heaven <br>
When lightning splits it, and it vanisheth? <br>
Fain would I hear thee answer me herein, <br>
Since, Krishna! none save thou can clear the doubt. <br>
Krishna. He is not lost, thou Son of Pritha! No! <br>
Nor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him, <br>
Because no heart that holds one right desire <br>
Treadeth the road of loss! He who should fail, <br>
Desiring righteousness, cometh at death <br>
Unto the Region of the Just; dwells there <br>
Measureless years, and being born anew, <br>
Beginneth life again in some fair home <br>
Amid the mild and happy. It may chance <br>
He doth descend into a Yogin house <br>
On Virtue's breast; but that is rare! Such birth <br>
Is hard to be obtained on this earth, Chief! <br>
So hath he back again what heights of heart <br>
He did achieve, and so he strives anew <br>
To perfectness, with better hope, dear Prince! <br>
For by the old desire he is drawn on <br>
Unwittingly; and only to desire <br>
The purity of Yog is to pass <br>
Beyond the Sabdabrahm, the spoken Ved. <br>
But, being Yogi, striving strong and long, <br>
Purged from transgressions, perfected by births <br>
Following on births, he plants his feet at last <br>
Upon the farther path. Such as one ranks <br>
Above ascetics, higher than the wise, <br>
Beyond achievers of vast deeds! Be thou <br>
Yogi Arjuna! And of such believe, <br>
Truest and best is he who worships Me <br>
With inmost soul, stayed on My Mystery! 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER VI OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Atmasanyamayog," <br>
Or "The Book of Religion of Self-Restraint." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER VII <br>
Of Religion by Discernment

<p>  Krishna. Learn now, dear Prince! how, if thy soul be set <br>
Ever on Me- still exercising Yog, <br>
Still making Me thy Refuge- thou shalt come <br>
Most surely unto perfect hold of Me. <br>
I will declare to thee that utmost lore, <br>
Whole and particular, which, when thou knowest, <br>
Leaveth no more to know here in this world. 

<p>  Of many thousand mortals, one, perchance, <br>
Striveth for Truth; and of those few that strive- <br>
Nay, and rise high- one only- here and there- <br>
Knoweth Me, as I am, the very Truth. 

<p>  Earth, water, flame, air, ether, life, and mind, <br>
And individuality- those eight <br>
Make up the showing of Me, Manifest. 

<p>  These be my lower Nature; learn the higher, <br>
Whereby, thou Valiant One! this Universe <br>
Is, by its principle of life, produced; <br>
Whereby the worlds of visible things are born <br>
As from a Yoni. Know! I am that womb: <br>
I make and I unmake this Universe: <br>
Than me there is no other Master, Prince! <br>
No other Maker! All these hang on me <br>
As hangs a row of pearls upon its string. <br>
I am the fresh taste of the water; I <br>
The silver of the moon, the gold o' the sun, <br>
The word of worship in the Veds, the thrill <br>
That passeth in the ether, and the strength <br>
Of man's shed seed. I am the good sweet smell <br>
Of the moistened earth, I am the fire's red light, <br>
The vital air moving in all which moves, <br>
The holiness of hallowed souls, the root <br>
Undying, whence hath sprung whatever is; <br>
The wisdom of the wise, the intellect <br>
Of the informed, the greatness of the great. <br>
The splendour of the splendid. Kunti's Son! <br>
These am I, free from passion and desire; <br>
Yet am I right desire in all who yearn, <br>
Chief of the Bharatas! for all those moods, <br>
Soothfast, or passionate, or ignorant, <br>
Which Nature frames, deduce from me; but all <br>
Are merged in me- not I in them! The world- <br>
Deceived by those three qualities of being- <br>
Wotteth not Me Who am outside them all, <br>
Above them all, Eternal! Hard it is <br>
To pierce that veil divine of various shows <br>
Which hideth Me; yet they who worship Me <br>
Pierce it and pass beyond. 

<p>  I am not known <br>
To evil-doers, nor to foolish ones, <br>
Nor to the base and churlish; nor to those <br>
Whose mind is cheated by the show of things, <br>
Nor those that take the way of Asuras. 

<p>  Four sorts of mortals know me: he who weeps, <br>
Arjuna! and the man who yearns to know; <br>
And he who toils to help; and he who sits <br>
Certain of me, enlightened. 

<p>  Of these four, <br>
O Prince of India! highest, nearest, best <br>
That last is, the devout soul, wise, intent <br>
Upon "The One." Dear, above all, am I <br>
To him; and he is dearest unto me! <br>
All four are good, and seek me; but mine own, <br>
The true of heart, the faithful- stayed on me, <br>
Taking me as their utmost, blessedness, <br>
They are not "mine," but I- even I myself! <br>
At end of many births to Me they come! <br>
Yet hard the wise Mahatma is to find, <br>
That man who sayeth, "All is Vasudev!" 

<p>  There be those, too, whose knowledge, turned aside <br>
By this desire or that, gives them to serve <br>
Some lower gods, with various rites, constrained <br>
By that which mouldeth them. Unto all such- <br>
Worship what shrine they will, what shapes, in faith- <br>
'Tis I who give them faith! I am content! <br>
The heart thus asking favour from its God, <br>
Darkened but ardent, hath the end it craves, <br>
The lesser blessing- but 'tis I who give! <br>
Yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap: <br>
Those men of little minds, who worship so, <br>
Go where they worship, passing with their gods. <br>
But Mine come unto me! Blind are the eyes <br>
Which deem th' Unmanifested manifest, <br>
Not comprehending Me in my true Self! <br>
Imperishable, viewless, undeclared, <br>
Hidden behind my magic veil of shows, <br>
I am not seen by all; I am not known- <br>
Unborn and changeless- to the idle world. <br>
But I, Arjuna! know all things which were, <br>
And all which are, and all which are to be, <br>
Albeit not one among them knoweth Me! 

<p>  By passion for the "pairs of opposites," <br>
By those twain snares of Like and Dislike, Prince! <br>
All creatures live bewildered, save some few <br>
Who, quit of sins, holy in act, informed, <br>
Freed from the "opposites," and fixed in faith, <br>
Cleave unto Me. 

<p>  Who cleave, who seek in Me <br>
Refuge from birth and death, those have the Truth! <br>
Those know Me BRAHMA: know Me Soul of Souls, <br>
The ADHYATMAN: know KARMA, my work; <br>
Know I am ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Life, <br>
And ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods, <br>
And ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice; <br>
Worship Me well, with hearts of love and faith, <br>
And find and hold me in the hour of death.

BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Vijnanayog," <br>
Or "The Book of Religion by Discernment." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  <br>
CHAPTER VIII <br>
Of Religion by Devotion to the One Supreme God

<p>  Arjuna. Who is that BRAHMA? What that Soul of Souls, <br>
The ADHYATMAN? What, Thou Best of All! <br>
Thy work, the KARMA? Tell me what it is <br>
Thou namest ADHIBHUTA? What again <br>
Means ADHIDAIVA? Yea, and how it comes <br>
Thou canst be ADHIYAJNA in thy flesh? <br>
Slayer of Madhu! Further, make me know <br>
How good men find thee in the hour of death? <br>
Krishna. I BRAHMA am! the One Eternal GOD, <br>
And ADHYATMAN is My Being's name, <br>
The Soul of Souls! What goeth forth from Me, <br>
Causing all life to live, is KARMA called: <br>
And, Manifested in divided forms, <br>
I am the ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Lives; <br>
And ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods, <br>
Because I am PURUSHA, who who begets. <br>
And ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice, <br>
I- speaking with thee in this body here- <br>
Am, thou embodied one! (for all the shrines <br>
Flame unto Me!) And, at the hour of death, <br>
He that hath meditated Me alone, <br>
In putting off his flesh, comes forth to Me, <br>
Enters into My Being- doubt thou not! <br>
But, if he meditated otherwise <br>
At hour of death, in putting off the flesh, <br>
He goes to what he looked for, Kunti's Son! <br>
Because the Soul is fashioned to its like. 

<p>  Have Me, then, in thy heart always! and fight! <br>
Thou too, when heart and mind are fixed on Me, <br>
Shalt surely come to Me! All come who cleave <br>
With never-wavering will of firmest faith, <br>
Owning none other Gods: all come to Me, <br>
The Uttermost, Purusha, Holiest! 

<p>  Whoso hath known Me, Lord of sage and singer, <br>
Ancient of days; of all the Three Worlds Stay, <br>
Boundless,- but unto every atom Bringer <br>
Of that which quickens it: whoso, I say, 

<p>  Hath known My form, which passeth mortal knowing; <br>
Seen my effulgence- which no eye hath seen- <br>
Than the sun's burning gold more brightly glowing, <br>
Dispersing darkness,- unto him hath been 

<p>  Right life! And, in the hour when life is ending, <br>
With mind set fast and trustful piety, <br>
Drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending, <br>
In happy peace that faithful one doth die,- 

<p>  In glad peace passeth to Purusha's heaven. <br>
The place which they who read the Vedas name <br>
AKSHARAM, "Ultimate;" whereto have striven <br>
Saints and ascetics- their road is the same. 

<p>  That way- the highest way- goes he who shuts <br>
The gates of all his senses, locks desire <br>
Safe in his heart, centres the vital airs <br>
Upon his parting thought, steadfastly set; <br>
And, murmuring OM, the sacred syllable- <br>
Emblem of BRAHM- dies, meditating Me. 

<p>  For who, none other Gods regarding, looks <br>
Ever to Me, easily am I gained <br>
By such a Yogi; and, attaining Me, <br>
They fall not- those Mahatmas- back to birth, <br>
To life, which is the place of pain, which ends, <br>
But take the way of utmost blessedness. 

<p>  The worlds, Arjuna!- even Brahma's world- <br>
Roll back again from Death to Life's unrest; <br>
But they, O Kunti's Son! that reach to Me, <br>
Taste birth no more. If ye know Brahma's Day <br>
Which is a thousand Yugas; if ye know <br>
The thousand Yugas making Brahma's Night, <br>
Then know ye Day and Night as He doth know! <br>
When that vast Dawn doth break, th' Invisible <br>
Is brought anew into the Visible; <br>
When that deep Night doth darken, all which is <br>
Fades back again to Him Who sent it forth; <br>
Yea! this vast company of living things- <br>
Again and yet again produced- expires <br>
At Brahma's Nightfall; and, at Brahma's Dawn, <br>
Riseth, without its will, to life new-born. <br>
But- higher, deeper, innermost- abides <br>
Another Life, not like the life of sense, <br>
Escaping sight, unchanging. This endures <br>
When all created things have passed away; <br>
This is that Life named the Unmanifest, <br>
The Infinite! the All! the Uttermost. <br>
Thither arriving none return. That Life <br>
Is Mine, and I am there! And, Prince! by faith <br>
Which wanders not, there is a way to come <br>
Thither. I, the PURUSHA, I Who spread <br>
The Universe around me- in Whom dwell <br>
All living Things- may so be reached and seen! 

<p>  Richer than holy fruit on Vedas growing, <br>
Greater than gifts, better than prayer or fast, <br>
Such wisdom is! The Yogi, this way knowing, <br>
Comes to the Utmost Perfect Peace at last. 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER VIII OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA; <br>
Entitled "Aksharaparabrahmayog," <br>
Or "The Book of Religion by Devotion <br>
to the One Supreme God." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER IX <br>
Of Religion by the Kingly Knowledge and the Kingly Mystery

<p>  Krishna. Now will I open unto thee- whose heart <br>
Rejects not- that last lore, deepest-concealed, <br>
That farthest secret of My Heavens and Earths, <br>
Which but to know shall set thee free from ills,- <br>
A royal lore! a Kingly mystery! <br>
Yea! for the soul such light as purgeth it <br>
From every sin; a light of holiness <br>
With inmost splendour shining; plain to see; <br>
Easy to walk by, inexhaustible! 

<p>  They that receive not this, failing in faith <br>
To grasp the greater wisdom, reach not Me, <br>
Destroyer of thy foes! They sink anew <br>
Into the realm of Flesh, where all things change! 

<p>  By Me the whole vast Universe of things <br>
Is spread abroad;- by Me, the Unmanifest! <br>
In Me are all existences contained; <br>
Not I in them! <br>
Yet they are not contained, <br>
Those visible things! Receive and strive to embrace <br>
The mystery majestical! My Being- <br>
Creating all, sustaining all- still dwells <br>
Outside of all! 

<p>  See! as the shoreless airs <br>
Move in the measureless space, but are not space, <br>
[And space were space without the moving airs]; <br>
So all things are in Me, but are not I. 

<p>  At closing of each Kalpa, Indian Prince! <br>
All things which be back to My Being come: <br>
At the beginning of each Kalpa, all <br>
Issue new-born from Me. 

<p>  By Energy <br>
And help of Prakriti, my outer Self, <br>
Again, and yet again, I make go forth <br>
The realms of visible things- without their will- <br>
All of them- by the power of Prakriti. 

<p>  Yet these great makings, Prince! involve Me not <br>
Enchain Me not ! I sit apart from them, <br>
Other, and Higher, and Free; nowise attached! 

<p>  Thus doth the stuff of worlds, moulded by Me, <br>
Bring forth all that which is, moving or still, <br>
Living or lifeless! Thus the worlds go on! 

<p>  The minds untaught mistake Me, veiled in form;- <br>
Naught see they of My secret Presence, nought <br>
Of My hid Nature, ruling all which lives. <br>
Vain hopes pursuing, vain deeds doing; fed <br>
On vainest knowledge, senselessly they seek <br>
An evil way, the way of brutes and fiends. <br>
But My Mahatmas, those of noble soul <br>
Who tread the path celestial, worship Me <br>
With hearts unwandering,- knowing Me the Source, <br>
Th' Eternal Source, of Life. Unendingly <br>
They glorify Me; seek Me; keep their vows <br>
Of reverence and love, with changeless faith <br>
Adoring Me. Yea, and those too adore, <br>
Who, offering sacrifice of wakened hearts, <br>
Have sense of one pervading Spirit's stress, <br>
One Force in every place, though manifold! <br>
I am the Sacrifice! I am the Prayer! <br>
I am the Funeral-Cake set for the dead! <br>
I am the healing herb! I am the ghee, <br>
The Mantra, and the flame, and that which burns! <br>
I am- of all this boundless Universe- <br>
The Father, Mother, Ancestor, and Guard! <br>
The end of Learning! That which purifies <br>
In lustral water! I am OM! I am <br>
Rig-Veda, Sama-Veda, Yajur-Ved; <br>
The Way, the Fosterer, the Lord, the Judge, <br>
The Witness; the Abode, the Refuge-House, <br>
The Friend, the Fountain and the Sea of Life <br>
Which sends, and swallows up; Treasure of Worlds <br>
And Treasure-Chamber! Seed and Seed-Sower, <br>
Whence endless harvests spring! Sun's heat is mine; <br>
Heaven's rain is mine to grant or to withhold; <br>
Death am I, and Immortal Life I am, <br>
Arjuna! SAT and ASAT, Visible Life, <br>
And Life Invisible! <br>
Yea! those who learn <br>
The threefold Veds, who drink the Soma-wine, <br>
Purge sins, pay sacrifice- from Me they earn <br>
Passage to Swarga; where the meats divine 

<p>  Of great gods feed them in high Indra's heaven. <br>
Yet they, when that prodigious joy is o'er, <br>
Paradise spent, and wage for merits given, <br>
Come to the world of death and change once more. 

<p>  They had their recompense! they stored their treasure, <br>
Following the threefold Scripture and its writ; <br>
Who seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure <br>
Of joy which comes and goes! I grant them it! 

<p>  But to those blessed ones who worship Me, <br>
Turning not otherwhere, with minds set fast, <br>
I bring assurance of full bliss beyond. 

<p>  Nay, and of hearts which follow other gods <br>
In simple faith, their prayers arise to me, <br>
O Kunti's Son! though they pray wrongfully; <br>
For I am the Receiver and the Lord <br>
Of every sacrifice, which these know not <br>
Rightfully; so they fall to earth again! <br>
Who follow gods go to their gods; who vow <br>
Their souls to Pitris go to Pitris; minds <br>
To evil Bhuts given o'er sink to the Bhuts; <br>
And whoso loveth Me cometh to Me. <br>
Whoso shall offer Me in faith and love <br>
A leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth, <br>
That offering I accept, lovingly made <br>
With pious will. Whate'er thou doest, Prince! <br>
Eating or sacrificing, giving gifts, <br>
Praying or fasting, let it all be done <br>
For Me, as Mine. So shalt thou free thyself <br>
From Karmabandh, the chain which holdeth men <br>
To good and evil issue, so shalt come <br>
Safe unto Me- when thou art quit of flesh- <br>
By faith and abdication joined to Me! 

<p>  I am alike for all! I know not hate, <br>
I know not favour! What is made is Mine! <br>
But them that worship Me with love, I love; <br>
They are in Me, and I in them! 

<p>  Nay, Prince! <br>
If one of evil life turn in his thought <br>
Straightly to Me, count him amidst the good; <br>
He hath the high way chosen; he shall grow <br>
Righteous ere long; he shall attain that peace <br>
Which changes not. Thou Prince of India! <br>
Be certain none can perish, trusting Me! <br>
O Pritha's Son! whoso will turn to Me, <br>
Though they be born from the very womb of Sin, <br>
Woman or man; sprung of the Vaisya caste <br>
Or lowly disregarded Sudra,- all <br>
Plant foot upon the highest path; how then <br>
The holy Brahmans and My Royal Saints? <br>
Ah! ye who into this ill world are come- <br>
Fleeting and false- set your faith fast on Me! <br>
Fix heart and thought on Me! Adore Me! Bring <br>
Offerings to Me! Make Me prostrations! Make <br>
Me your supremest joy! and, undivided, <br>
Unto My rest your spirits shall be guided. 

<p>  <br>
HERE ENDETH CHAPTER IX OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Rajavidyarajaguhyayog," <br>
Or "The Book of Religion by the Kingly Knowledge <br>
and the Kingly Mystery." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER X <br>
Of Religion by the Heavenly Perfections

<p>  <br>
Krishna. Hear farther yet, thou Long-Armed Lord! these latest <br>
words I say- <br>
Uttered to bring thee bliss and peace, who lovest Me alway- <br>
Not the great company of gods nor kingly Rishis know <br>
My Nature, Who have made the gods and Rishis long ago; <br>
He only knoweth- only he is free of sin, and wise, <br>
Who seeth Me, Lord of the Worlds, with faith-enlightened eyes, <br>
Unborn, undying, unbegun. Whatever Natures be <br>
To mortal men distributed, those natures spring from Me! <br>
Intellect, skill, enlightenment, endurance, self-control, <br>
Truthfulness, equability, and grief or joy of soul, <br>
And birth and death, and fearfulness, and fearlessness, and shame, <br>
And honour, and sweet harmlessness, and peace which is the same <br>
Whate'er befalls, and mirth, and tears, and piety and thrift, <br>
And wish to give, and will to help,- all cometh of My gift! <br>
The Seven Chief Saints, the Elders Four, the Lordly Manus set- <br>
Sharing My work- to rule the worlds, these too did I beget; <br>
And Rishis, Pitris, Manus, all, by one thought of My mind; <br>
Thence did arise, to fill this world, the races of mankind; <br>
Wherefrom who comprehends My Reign of mystic Majesty- <br>
That truth of truths- is thenceforth linked in faultless faith to <br>
Me: <br>
Yea! knowing Me the source of all, by Me all creatures wrought, <br>
The wise in spirit cleave to Me, into My Being brought; <br>
Hearts fixed on Me; breaths breathed to Me; praising Me, each to <br>
each, <br>
So have they happiness and peace, with pious thought and speech; <br>
And unto these- thus serving well, thus loving ceaselessly- <br>
I give a mind of perfect mood, whereby they draw to Me; <br>
And, all for love of them, within their darkened souls I dwell, <br>
And, with bright rays of wisdom's lamp, their ignorance dispel. <br>
Arjuna. Yes! Thou art Parabrahm! The High Abode! <br>
The Great Purification! Thou art God <br>
Eternal, All-creating, Holy, First, <br>
Without beginning! Lord of Lords and Gods! <br>
Declared by all the Saints- by Narada, <br>
Vyasa Asita, and Devalas; <br>
And here Thyself declaring unto me! <br>
What Thou hast said now know I to be truth, <br>
O Kesava! that neither gods nor men <br>
Nor demons comprehend Thy mystery <br>
Made manifest, Divinest! Thou Thyself <br>
Thyself alone dost know, Maker Supreme! <br>
Master of all the living! Lord of Gods! <br>
King of the Universe! To Thee alone <br>
Belongs to tell the heavenly excellence <br>
Of those perfections wherewith Thou dost fill <br>
These worlds of Thine; Pervading, Immanent! <br>
How shall I learn, Supremest Mystery! <br>
To know Thee, though I muse continually? <br>
Under what form of Thine unnumbered forms <br>
Mayst Thou be grasped? Ah! yet again recount, <br>
Clear and complete, Thy great appearances, <br>
The secrets of Thy Majesty and Might, <br>
Thou High Delight of Men! Never enough <br>
Can mine ears drink the Amrit of such words! <br>
Krishna. Hanta! So be it! Kuru Prince! I will to thee unfold <br>
Some portions of My Majesty, whose powers are manifold! <br>
I am the Spirit seated deep in every creature's heart; <br>
From Me they come; by Me they live; at My word they depart! <br>
Vishnu of the Adityas I am, those Lords of Light; <br>
Maritchi of the Maruts, the Kings of Storm and Blight; <br>
By day I gleam, the golden Sun of burning cloudless Noon; <br>
By Night, amid the asterisms I glide, the dappled Moon! <br>
Of Vedas I am Sama-Ved, of gods in Indra's Heaven <br>
Vasava; of the faculties to living beings given <br>
The mind which apprehends and thinks; of Rudras Sankara; <br>
Of Yakshas and of Rakshasas, Vittesh; and Pavaka <br>
Of Vasus, and of mountain-peaks Meru; Vrihaspati <br>
Know Me 'mid planetary Powers; 'mid Warriors heavenly <br>
Skanda; of all the water-floods the Sea which drinketh each, <br>
And Bhrigu of the holy Saints, and OM of sacred speech; <br>
Of prayers the prayer ye whisper; of hills Himila's snow, <br>
And Aswattha, the fig-tree, of all the trees that grow; <br>
Of the Devarshis, Narada; and Chitrarath of them <br>
That sing in Heaven, and Kapila of Munis, and the gem <br>
Of flying steeds, Uchchaisravas, from Amritwave which burst; <br>
Of elephants Airavata; of males the Best and First; <br>
Of weapons Heav'n's hot thunderbolt; of cows white Kamadhuk, <br>
From whose great milky udder-teats all hearts' desires are strook; <br>
Vasuki of the serpent-tribes, round Mandara entwined; <br>
And thousand-fanged Ananta, on whose broad coils reclined <br>
Leans Vishnu; and of water-things Varuna; Aryam <br>
Of Pitris, and, of those that judge, Yama the Judge I am; <br>
Of Daityas dread Prahlada; of what metes days and years, <br>
Time's self I am; of woodland-beasts- buffaloes, deers, and bears- <br>
The lordly-painted tiger; of birds the vast Garud, <br>
The whirlwind 'mid the winds; 'mid chiefs Rama with blood imbrued, <br>
Makar 'mid fishes of the sea, and Ganges 'mid the streams; <br>
Yea! First, and Last, and Centre of all which is or seems <br>
I am, Arjuna! Wisdom Supreme of what is wise, <br>
Words on the uttering lips I am, and eyesight of the eyes. <br>
And "A" of written characters, Dwandwa of knitted speech, <br>
And Endless Life, and boundless Love, whose power <br>
sustaineth each; <br>
And bitter Death which seizes all, and joyous sudden Birth, <br>
Which brings to light all beings that are to be on earth; <br>
And of the viewless virtues, Fame, Fortune, Song am I, <br>
And Memory, and Patience; and Craft, and Constancy: <br>
Of Vedic hymns the Vrihatsam, of metres Gayatri, <br>
Of months the Margasirsha, of all the seasons three <br>
The flower-wreathed Spring; in dicer's-play the conquering <br>
Double-Eight; <br>
The splendour of the splendid, and the greatness of the great, <br>
Victory I am, and Action! and the goodness of the good, <br>
And Vasudev of Vrishni's race, and of this Pandu brood <br>
Thyself!- Yea, my Arjuna! thyself; for thou art Mine! <br>
Of poets Usana, of saints Vyasa, sage divine; <br>
The policy of conquerors, the potency of kings, <br>
The great unbroken silence in learning's secret things; <br>
The lore of all the learned, the seed of all which springs. <br>
Living or lifeless, still or stirred, whatever beings be, <br>
None of them is in all the worlds, but it exists by Me! <br>
Nor tongue can tell, Arjuna! nor end of telling come <br>
Of these My boundless glories, whereof I teach thee some; <br>
For wheresoe'er is wondrous work, and majesty, and might, <br>
From Me hath all proceeded. Receive thou this aright! <br>
Yet how shouldst thou receive, O Prince! the vastness of this word? <br>
I, who am all, and made it all, abide its separate Lord! 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER X OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Vibhuti Yog," <br>
Or "The Book of Religion by the Heavenly Perfections." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER XI <br>
Of the Manifesting of the One and Manifold

<p>  Arjuna. This, for my soul's peace, have I heard from Thee, <br>
The unfolding of the Mystery Supreme <br>
Named Adhyatman; comprehending which, <br>
My darkness is dispelled; for now I know- <br>
O Lotus-eyed!- whence is the birth of men, <br>
And whence their death, and what the majesties <br>
Of Thine immortal rule. Fain would I see, <br>
As thou Thyself declar'st it, Sovereign Lord! <br>
The likeness of that glory of Thy Form <br>
Wholly revealed. O Thou Divinest One! <br>
If this can be, if I may bear the sight, <br>
Make Thyself visible, Lord of all prayers! <br>
Show me Thy very self, the Eternal God! <br>
Krishna. Gaze, then, thou Son of Pritha! I manifest for thee <br>
Those hundred thousand thousand shapes that clothe my Mystery: <br>
I show thee all my semblances, infinite, rich, divine, <br>
My changeful hues, my countless forms. See! in this face of mine, <br>
Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Aswins, and Maruts; see <br>
Wonders unnumbered, Indian Prince! revealed to none save thee. <br>
Behold! this is the Universe!- Look! what is live and dead <br>
I gather all in one- in Me! Gaze, as thy lips have said <br>
On GOD, ETERNAL, VERY GOD! See ME! what thou prayest! 

<p>  Thou canst not!- nor, with human eyes, Arjuna! ever mayest! <br>
Therefore I give thee sense divine. Have other eyes, new light! <br>
And, look! This is My glory, unveiled to mortal sight! <br>
Sanjaya. Then, O King! to God, so saying, <br>
Stood, to Pritha's Son displaying <br>
All the splendour, wonder, dread <br>
Of His vast Almighty-head. <br>
Out of countless eyes beholding, <br>
Out of countless mouths commanding, <br>
Countless mystic forms enfolding <br>
In one Form: supremely standing <br>
Countless radiant glories wearing, <br>
Countless heavenly weapons bearing, <br>
Crowned with garlands of star-clusters, <br>
Robed in garb of woven lustres, <br>
Breathing from His perfect Presence <br>
Breaths of every subtle essence <br>
Of all heavenly odours; shedding <br>
Blinding brilliance; overspreading- <br>
Boundless, beautiful- all spaces <br>
With His all-regarding faces; <br>
So He showed! If there should rise <br>
Suddenly within the skies <br>
Sunburst of a thousand suns <br>
Flooding earth with beams undeemed-of, <br>
Then might be that Holy One's <br>
Majesty and radiance dreamed of! 

<p>  So did Pandu's Son behold <br>
All this universe enfold <br>
All its huge diversity <br>
Into one vast shape, and be <br>
Visible, and viewed, and blended <br>
In one Body- subtle, splendid, <br>
Nameless- th' All-comprehending <br>
God of Gods, the Never-Ending <br>
Deity! 

<p>  But, sore amazed, <br>
Thrilled, o'erfilled, dazzled, and dazed, <br>
Arjuna knelt; and bowed his head, <br>
And clasped his palms; and cried, and said: <br>
Arjuna. Yea! I have seen! I see! <br>
Lord! all is wrapped in Thee! <br>
The gods are in Thy glorious frame! the creatures <br>
Of earth, and heaven, and hell <br>
In Thy Divine form dwell, <br>
And in Thy countenance shine all the features 

<p>  Of Brahma, sitting lone <br>
Upon His lotus-throne; <br>
Of saints and sages, and the serpent races <br>
Ananta, Vasuki; <br>
Yea! mightiest Lord! I see <br>
Thy thousand thousand arms and breasts, and faces, 

<p>  And eyes,- on every side <br>
Perfect, diversified; <br>
And nowhere end of Thee, nowhere beginning, <br>
Nowhere a centre! Shifts- <br>
Wherever soul's gaze lifts- <br>
Thy central Self, all-wielding, and all-winning! 

<p>  Infinite King! I see <br>
The anadem on Thee, <br>
The club, the shell, the discus; see Thee burning <br>
In beams insufferable, <br>
Lighting earth, heaven, and hell <br>
With brilliance blazing, glowing, flashing; turning 

<p>  Darkness to dazzling day, <br>
Look I whichever way; <br>
Ah, Lord! I worship Thee, the Undivided, <br>
The Uttermost of thought, <br>
The Treasure-Palace wrought <br>
To hold the wealth of the worlds; the Shield provided 

<p>  To shelter Virtue's laws; <br>
The Fount whence Life's stream draws <br>
All waters of all rivers of all being: <br>
The One Unborn, Unending: <br>
Unchanging and Unblending! <br>
With might and majesty, past thought, past seeing! 

<p>  Silver of moon and gold <br>
Of sun are glories rolled <br>
From Thy great eyes; Thy visage, beaming tender <br>
Throughout the stars and skies, <br>
Doth to warm life surprise <br>
Thy Universe. The worlds are filled with wonder 

<p>  Of Thy perfections! Space <br>
Star-sprinkled, and void place <br>
From pole to pole of the Blue, from bound to bound, <br>
Hath Thee in every spot, <br>
Thee, Thee!- Where Thou art not, <br>
O Holy, Marvellous Form! is nowhere found! 

<p>  O Mystic, Awful One! <br>
At sight of Thee, made known, <br>
The Three Worlds quake; the lower gods draw nigh Thee; <br>
They fold their palms, and bow <br>
Body, and breast, and brow, <br>
And, whispering worship, laud and magnify Thee! 

<p>  Rishis and Siddhas cry <br>
"Hail! Highest Majesty! <br>
From sage and singer breaks the hymn of glory <br>
In dulcet harmony, <br>
Sounding the praise of Thee; <br>
While countless companies take up the story, 

<p>  Rudras, who ride the storms, <br>
Th' Adityas' shining forms, <br>
Vasus and Sadhyas, Viswas, Ushmapas; <br>
Maruts, and those great Twins <br>
The heavenly, fair, Aswins, <br>
Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Siddhas, and Asuras,- 

<p>  These see Thee, and revere <br>
In sudden-stricken fear; <br>
Yea! the Worlds,- seeing Thee with form stupendous, <br>
With faces manifold, <br>
With eyes which all behold, <br>
Unnumbered eyes, vast arms, members tremendous, 

<p>  Flanks, lit with sun and star, <br>
Feet planted near and far, <br>
Tushes of terror, mouths wrathful and tender;- <br>
The Three wide Worlds before Thee <br>
Adore, as I adore Thee, <br>
Quake, as I quake, to witness so much splendour! 

<p>  I mark Thee strike the skies <br>
With front, in wondrous wise <br>
Huge, rainbow-painted, glittering; and thy mouth <br>
Opened, and orbs which see <br>
All things, whatever be <br>
In all Thy worlds, east, west, and north and south. 

<p>  O Eyes of God! O Head! <br>
My strength of soul is fled, <br>
Gone is heart's force, rebuked is mind's desire! <br>
When I behold Thee so, <br>
With awful brows a-glow, <br>
With burning glance, and lips lighted by fire 

<p>  Fierce as those flames which shall <br>
Consume, at close of all, <br>
Earth, Heaven! Ah me! I see no Earth and Heaven! <br>
Thee, Lord of Lords! I see, <br>
Thee only- only Thee! <br>
Now let Thy mercy unto me be given, 

<p>  Thou Refuge of the World! <br>
Lo! to the cavern hurled <br>
Of Thy wide-opened throat, and lips white-tushed, <br>
I see our noblest ones, <br>
Great Dhritarashtra's sons, <br>
Bhishma, Drona, and Karna, caught and crushed! 

<p>  The Kings and Chiefs drawn in, <br>
That gaping gorge within; <br>
The best of both these armies torn and riven! <br>
Between Thy jaws they lie <br>
Mangled full bloodily, <br>
Ground into dust and death! Like streams down-driven 

<p>  With helpless haste, which go <br>
In headlong furious flow <br>
Straight to the gulfing deeps of th' unfilled ocean, <br>
So to that flaming cave <br>
Those heroes great and brave <br>
Pour, in unending streams, with helpless motion! 

<p>  Like moths which in the night <br>
Flutter towards a light, <br>
Drawn to their fiery doom, flying and dying, <br>
So to their death still throng, <br>
Blind, dazzled, borne along <br>
Ceaselessly, all those multitudes, wild flying! 

<p>  Thou, that hast fashioned men, <br>
Devourest them again, <br>
One with another, great and small, alike! <br>
The creatures whom Thou mak'st, <br>
With flaming jaws Thou tak'st, <br>
Lapping them up! Lord God! Thy terrors strike 

<p>  From end to end of earth, <br>
Filling life full, from birth <br>
To death, with deadly, burning, lurid dread! <br>
Ah, Vishnu! make me know <br>
Why is Thy visage so? <br>
Who art Thou, feasting thus upon Thy dead? 

<p>  Who? awful Deity! <br>
I bow myself to Thee, <br>
Namostu Te, Devavara! Prasid! <br>
O Mightiest Lord! rehearse <br>
Why hast Thou face so fierce? <br>
Whence doth this aspect horrible proceed? <br>
Krishna. Thou seest Me as Time who kills, <br>
Time who brings all to doom, <br>
The Slayer Time, Ancient of Days, come hither to consume; <br>
Excepting thee, of all these hosts of hostile chiefs arrayed, <br>
There stands not one shall leave alive the battlefield! Dismayed <br>
No longer be! Arise! obtain renown! destroy thy foes! <br>
Fight for the kingdom waiting thee when thou hast vanquished those. <br>
By Me they fall- not thee! the stroke of death is dealt them now, <br>
Even as they show thus gallantly; My instrument art thou! <br>
Strike, strong-armed Prince, at Drona! at Bhishma strike! deal <br>
death <br>
On Karna, Jyadratha; stay all their warlike breath! <br>
'Tis I who bid them perish! Thou wilt but slay the slain; <br>
Fight! they must fall, and thou must live, victor upon this plain! <br>
Sanjaya. Hearing mighty Keshav's word, <br>
Trembling that helmed Lord <br>
Clasped his lifted palms, and- praying <br>
Grace of Krishna- stood there, saying, <br>
With bowed brow and accents broken, <br>
These words, timorously spoken: <br>
Arjuna. Worthily, Lord of Might! <br>
The whole world hath delight <br>
In Thy surpassing power, obeying Thee; <br>
The Rakshasas, in dread <br>
At sight of Thee, are sped <br>
To all four quarters; and the company 

<p>  Of Siddhas sound Thy name. <br>
How should they not proclaim <br>
Thy Majesties, Divinest, Mightiest? <br>
Thou Brahm, than Brahma greater! <br>
Thou Infinite Creator! <br>
Thou God of gods, Life's Dwelling-place and Rest. 

<p>  Thou, of all souls the Soul! <br>
The Comprehending Whole! <br>
Of being formed, and formless being the Framer; <br>
O Utmost One! O Lord! <br>
Older than eld, Who stored <br>
The worlds with wealth of life! O Treasure-Claimer, 

<p>  Who wottest all, and art <br>
Wisdom Thyself! O Part <br>
In all, and All; for all from Thee have risen <br>
Numberless now I see <br>
The aspects are of Thee! <br>
Vayu Thou art, and He who keeps the prison 

<p>  Of Narak, Yama dark; <br>
And Agni's shining spark; <br>
Varuna's waves are Thy waves. Moon and starlight <br>
Are Thine! Prajapati <br>
Art Thou, and 'tis to Thee <br>
They knelt in worshipping the old world's far light, 

<p>  The first of mortal men. <br>
Again, Thou God! again <br>
A thousand thousand times be magnified! <br>
Honour and worship be- <br>
Glory and praise,- to Thee <br>
Namo, Namaste, cried on every side; <br>
Cried here, above, below, <br>
Uttered when Thou dost go, <br>
Uttered where Thou dost come! Namo! we call; <br>
Namostu! God adored! <br>
Namostu! Nameless Lord <br>
Hail to Thee! Praise to Thee Thou One in all; 

<p>  For Thou art All! Yea, Thou! <br>
Ah! if in anger now <br>
Thou shouldst remember I did think Thee Friend, <br>
Speaking with easy speech, <br>
As men use each to each; <br>
Did call Thee "Krishna," "Prince," nor comprehend 

<p>  Thy hidden majesty, <br>
The might, the awe of Thee; <br>
Did, in my heedlessness, or in my love, <br>
On journey, or in jest, <br>
Or when we lay at rest, <br>
Sitting at council, straying in the grove, 

<p>  Alone, or in the throng, <br>
Do Thee, most Holy! wrong, <br>
Be Thy grace granted for that witless sin <br>
For Thou art, now I know, <br>
Father of all below, <br>
Of all above, of all the worlds within 

<p>  Guru of Gurus; more <br>
To reverence and adore <br>
Than all which is adorable and high! <br>
How, in the wide worlds three <br>
Should any equal be? <br>
Should any other share Thy Majesty? 

<p>  Therefore, with body bent <br>
And reverent intent, <br>
I praise, and serve, and seek Thee, asking grace. <br>
As father to a son, <br>
As friend to friend, as one <br>
Who loveth to his lover, turn Thy face 

<p>  In gentleness on me! <br>
Good is it I did see <br>
This unknown marvel of Thy Form! But fear <br>
Mingles with joy! Retake, <br>
Dear Lord! for pity's sake <br>
Thine earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear! 

<p>  Be merciful, and show <br>
The visage that I know; <br>
Let me regard Thee, as of yore, arrayed <br>
With disc and forehead-gem, <br>
With mace and anadem, <br>
Thou that sustainest all things! Undismayed 

<p>  Let me once more behold <br>
The form I loved of old, <br>
Thou of the thousand arms and countless eyes! <br>
This frightened heart is fain <br>
To see restored again <br>
My Charioteer, in Krishna's kind disguise. 

<p>  Krishna. Yea! thou hast seen, Arjuna! because I loved thee well, <br>
The secret countenance of Me, revealed by mystic spell, <br>
Shining, and wonderful, and majestic, manifold, <br>
Which none save thou in all the years had favour to behold; <br>
For not by Vedas cometh this, nor sacrifice, nor alms, <br>
Nor works well-done, nor penance long, nor prayers, nor chanted <br>
psalms, <br>
That mortal eyes should bear to view the Immortal Soul unclad, <br>
Prince of the Kurus! This was kept for thee alone! Be glad! <br>
Let no more trouble shake thy heart, because thine eyes have seen <br>
My terror with My glory. As I before have been <br>
So will I be again for thee; with lightened heart behold! <br>
Once more I am thy Krishna, the form thou knew'st of old! <br>
Sanjaya. These words to Arjuna spake <br>
Vasudev, and straight did take <br>
Back again the semblance dear <br>
Of the well-loved charioteer; <br>
Peace and joy it did restore <br>
When the Prince beheld once more <br>
Mighty BRAHMA'S form and face <br>
Clothed in Krishna's gentle grace. <br>
Arjuna. Now that I see come back, Janardana! <br>
This friendly human frame, my mind can think <br>
Calm thoughts once more; my heart beats still again! <br>
Krishna. Yea! it was wonderful and terrible <br>
To view me as thou didst, dear Prince! The gods <br>
Dread and desire continually to view! <br>
Yet not by Vedas, nor from sacrifice, <br>
Nor penance, nor gift-giving, nor with prayer <br>
Shall any so behold, as thou hast seen! <br>
Only by fullest service, perfect faith, <br>
And uttermost surrender am I known <br>
And seen, and entered into, Indian Prince! <br>
Who doeth all for Me; who findeth Me <br>
In all; adoreth always; loveth all <br>
Which I have made, and Me, for Love's sole end, <br>
That man, Arjuna! unto Me doth wend. 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XI OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Viswarupadarsanam," <br>
Or "The Book of the Manifesting of the <br>
One and Manifold." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER XII <br>
Of the Religion of Faith

<p>  Arjuna. Lord! of the men who serve Thee- true in heart- <br>
As God revealed; and of the men who serve, <br>
Worshipping Thee Unrevealed, Unbodied, Far, <br>
Which take the better way of faith and life? <br>
Krishna. Whoever serve Me- as I show Myself- <br>
Constantly true, in full devotion fixed, <br>
Those hold I very holy. But who serve- <br>
Worshipping Me The One, The Invisible, <br>
The Unrevealed, Unnamed, Unthinkable, <br>
Uttermost, All-pervading, Highest, Sure- <br>
Who thus adore Me, mastering their sense, <br>
Of one set mind to all, glad in all good, <br>
These blessed souls come unto Me. <br>
Yet, hard <br>
The travail is for such as bend their minds <br>
To reach th' Unmanifest. That viewless path <br>
Shall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh! <br>
But whereso any doeth all his deeds <br>
Renouncing self for Me, full of Me, fixed <br>
To serve only the Highest, night and day <br>
Musing on Me- him will I swiftly lift <br>
Forth from life's ocean of distress and death, <br>
Whose soul clings fast to Me. Cling thou to Me! <br>
Clasp Me with heart and mind! so shalt thou dwell <br>
Surely with Me on high. But if thy thought <br>
Droops from such height; if thou be'st weak to set <br>
Body and soul upon Me constantly, <br>
Despair not! give Me lower service! I seek <br>
To reach Me, worshipping with steadfast will; <br>
And, if thou canst not worship steadfastly, <br>
Work for Me, toil in works pleasing to Me! <br>
For he that laboureth right for love of Me <br>
Shall finally attain! But, if in this <br>
Thy faint heart fails, bring Me thy failure! find <br>
Refuge in Me! let fruits of labour go, <br>
Renouncing hope for Me, with lowliest heart, <br>
So shalt thou come; for, though to know is more <br>
Than diligence, yet worship better is <br>
Than knowing, and renouncing better still. <br>
Near to renunciation- very near- <br>
Dwelleth Eternal Peace! 

<p>  Who hateth nought <br>
Of all which lives, living himself benign, <br>
Compassionate, from arrogance exempt, <br>
Exempt from love of self, unchangeable <br>
By good or ill; patient, contented, firm <br>
In faith, mastering himself, true to his word, <br>
Seeking Me, heart and soul; vowed unto Me,- <br>
That man I love! Who troubleth not his kind, <br>
And is not troubled by them; clear of wrath, <br>
Living too high for gladness, grief, or fear, <br>
That man I love! Who, dwelling quiet-eyed, <br>
Stainless, serene, well-balanced, unperplexed, <br>
Working with Me, yet from all works detached, <br>
That man I love! Who, fixed in faith on Me, <br>
Dotes upon none, scorns none; rejoices not, <br>
And grieves not, letting good or evil hap <br>
Light when it will, and when it will depart, <br>
That man I love! Who, unto friend and foe <br>
Keeping an equal heart, with equal mind <br>
Bears shame and glory; with an equal peace <br>
Takes heat and cold, pleasure and pain; abides <br>
Quit of desires, hears praise or calumny <br>
In passionless restraint, unmoved by each; <br>
Linked by no ties to earth, steadfast in Me, <br>
That man I love! But most of all I love <br>
Those happy ones to whom 'tis life to live <br>
In single fervid faith and love unseeing, <br>
Drinking the blessed Amrit of my Being! 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XII OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Bhaktiyog," <br>
Or "The Book of the Religion of Faith." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER XIII <br>
Of Religion by Separation of Matter and Spirit

<p>  Arjuna. Now would I hear, O gracious Kesava! <br>
Of Life which seems, and Soul beyond, which sees, <br>
And what it is we know- or think to know. <br>
Krishna. Yea! Son of Kunti! for this flesh ye see <br>
Is Kshetra, is the field where Life disports; <br>
And that which views and knows it is the Soul, <br>
Kshetrajna. In all "fields," thou Indian prince! <br>
I am Kshetrajna. I am what surveys! <br>
Only that knowledge knows which knows the known <br>
By the knower! What it is, that "field" of life, <br>
What qualities it hath, and whence it is, <br>
And why it changeth, and the faculty <br>
That wotteth it, the mightiness of this, <br>
And how it wotteth- hear these things from Me! 

<p>  The elements, the conscious life, the mind, <br>
The unseen vital force, the nine strange gates <br>
Of the body, and the five domains of sense; <br>
Desire, dislike, pleasure and pain, and thought <br>
Deep-woven, and persistency of being; <br>
These all are wrought on Matter by the Soul! 

<p>  Humbleness, truthfulness, and harmlessness, <br>
Patience and honour, reverence for the wise. <br>
Purity, constancy, control of self, <br>
Contempt of sense-delights, self-sacrifice, <br>
Perception of the certitude of ill <br>
In birth, death, age, disease, suffering, and sin; <br>
Detachment, lightly holding unto home, <br>
Children, and wife, and all that bindeth men; <br>
An ever-tranquil heart in fortunes good <br>
And fortunes evil, with a will set firm <br>
To worship Me- Me only! ceasing not; <br>
Loving all solitudes, and shunning noise <br>
Of foolish crowds; endeavours resolute <br>
To reach perception of the Utmost Soul, <br>
And grace to understand what gain it were <br>
So to attain,- this is true Wisdom, Prince! <br>
And what is otherwise is ignorance! 

<p>  Now will I speak of knowledge best to know- <br>
That Truth which giveth man Amrit to drink, <br>
The Truth of HIM, the Para-Brahm, the All, <br>
The Uncreated; not Asat, nor Sat, <br>
Not Form, nor the Unformed; yet both, and more;- <br>
Whose hands are everywhere, and everywhere <br>
Planted His feet, and everywhere His eyes <br>
Beholding, and His ears in every place <br>
Hearing, and all His faces everywhere <br>
Enlightening and encompassing His worlds. <br>
Glorified in the senses He hath given, <br>
Yet beyond sense He is; sustaining all, <br>
Yet dwells He unattached: of forms and modes <br>
Master, yet neither form nor mode hath He; <br>
He is within all beings- and without- <br>
Motionless, yet still moving; not discerned <br>
For subtlety of instant presence; close <br>
To all, to each; yet measurelessly far! <br>
Not manifold, and yet subsisting still <br>
In all which lives; for ever to be known <br>
As the Sustainer, yet, at the End of Times, <br>
He maketh all to end- and re-creates. <br>
The Light of Lights He is, in the heart of the Dark <br>
Shining eternally. Wisdom He is <br>
And Wisdom's way, and Guide of all the wise, <br>
Planted in every heart. 

<p>  So have I told <br>
Of Life's stuff, and the moulding, and the lore <br>
To comprehend. Whoso, adoring Me, <br>
Perceiveth this, shall surely come to Me! 

<p>  Know thou that Nature and the Spirit both <br>
Have no beginning! Know that qualities <br>
And changes of them are by Nature wrought; <br>
That Nature puts to work the acting frame, <br>
But Spirit doth inform it, and so cause <br>
Feeling of pain and pleasure. Spirit, linked <br>
To moulded matter, entereth into bond <br>
With qualities by Nature framed, and, thus <br>
Married to matter, breeds the birth again <br>
In good or evil yonis. <br>
Yet is this- <br>
Yea! in its bodily prison!- Spirit pure, <br>
Spirit supreme; surveying, governing, <br>
Guarding, possessing; Lord and Master still <br>
PURUSHA, Ultimate, One Soul with Me. 

<p>  Whoso thus knows himself, and knows his soul <br>
PURUSHA, working through the qualities <br>
With Nature's modes, the light hath come for him! <br>
Whatever flesh he bears, never again <br>
Shall he take on its load. Some few there be <br>
By meditation find the Soul in Self <br>
Self-schooled; and some by long philosophy <br>
And holy life reach thither; some by works: <br>
Some, never so attaining, hear of light <br>
From other lips, and seize, and cleave to it <br>
Worshipping; yea! and those- to teaching true- <br>
Overpass Death! <br>
Wherever, Indian Prince! <br>
Life is- of moving things, or things unmoved, <br>
Plant or still seed- know, what is there hath grown <br>
By bond of Matter and of Spirit: Know <br>
He sees indeed who sees in all alike <br>
The living, lordly Soul; the Soul Supreme, <br>
Imperishable amid the Perishing: <br>
For, whoso thus beholds, in every place, <br>
In every form, the same, one, Living Life, <br>
Doth no more wrongfulness unto himself, <br>
But goes the highest road which brings to bliss. <br>
Seeing, he sees, indeed, who sees that works <br>
Are Nature's wont, for Soul to practise by <br>
Acting, yet not the agent; sees the mass <br>
Of separate living things- each of its kind- <br>
Issue from One, and blend again to One: <br>
Then hath he BRAHMA, he attains! <br>
O Prince! <br>
That Ultimate, High Spirit, Uncreate, <br>
Unqualified, even when it entereth flesh <br>
Taketh no stain of acts, worketh in nought! <br>
Like to th' ethereal air, pervading all, <br>
Which, for sheer subtlety, avoideth taint, <br>
The subtle Soul sits everywhere, unstained: <br>
Like to the light of the all-piercing sun <br>
[Which is not changed by aught it shines upon,] <br>
The Soul's light shineth pure in every place; <br>
And they who, by such eye of wisdom, see <br>
How Matter, and what deals with it, divide; <br>
And how the Spirit and the flesh have strife, <br>
Those wise ones go the way which leads to Life! 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XIII OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Kshetrakshetrajnavibhagayog," <br>
Or "The Book of Religion by Separation of Matter and Spirit." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER XIV <br>
Of Religion by Separation from the Qualities

<p>  Krishna. Yet farther will I open unto thee <br>
This wisdom of all wisdoms, uttermost, <br>
The which possessing, all My saints have passed <br>
To perfectness. On such high verities <br>
Reliant, rising into fellowship <br>
With Me, they are not born again at birth <br>
Of Kalpas, nor at Pralyas suffer change! 

<p>  This Universe the womb is where I plant <br>
Seed of all lives! Thence, Prince of India, comes <br>
Birth to all beings! Whoso, Kunti's Son! <br>
Mothers each mortal form, Brahma conceives, <br>
And I am He that fathers, sending seed! 

<p>  Sattwan, Raias, and Tamas, so are named <br>
The qualities of Nature, "Soothfastness," <br>
"Passion," and "Ignorance." These three bind down <br>
The changeless Spirit in the changeful flesh. <br>
Whereof sweet "Soothfastness," by purity <br>
Living unsullied and enlightened, binds <br>
The sinless Soul to happiness and truth; <br>
And Passion, being kin to appetite, <br>
And breeding impulse and propensity, <br>
Binds the embodied Soul, O Kunti's Son! <br>
By tie of works. But Ignorance, begot <br>
Of Darkness, blinding mortal men, binds down <br>
Their souls to stupor, sloth, and drowsiness. <br>
Yea, Prince of India! Soothfastness binds souls <br>
In pleasant wise to flesh; and Passion binds <br>
By toilsome strain; but Ignorance, which blots <br>
The beams of wisdom, binds the soul to sloth. <br>
Passion and Ignorance, once overcome, <br>
Leave Soothfastness, O Bharata! Where this <br>
With Ignorance are absent, Passion rules; <br>
And Ignorance in hearts not good nor quick. <br>
When at all gateways of the Body shines <br>
The Lamp of Knowledge, then may one see well <br>
Soothfastness settled in that city reigns; <br>
Where longing is, and ardour, and unrest, <br>
Impulse to strive and gain, and avarice, <br>
Those spring from Passion- Prince!- engrained; and where <br>
Darkness and dulness, sloth and stupor are, <br>
'Tis Ignorance hath caused them, Kuru Chief! 

<p>  Moreover, when a soul departeth, fixed <br>
In Soothfastness, it goeth to the place- <br>
Perfect and pure- of those that know all Truth. <br>
If it departeth in set habitude <br>
Of Impulse, it shall pass into the world <br>
Of spirits tied to works; and, if it dies <br>
In hardened Ignorance, that blinded soul <br>
Is born anew in some unlighted womb. 

<p>  The fruit of Soothfastness is true and sweet; <br>
The fruit of lusts is pain and toil; the fruit <br>
Of Ignorance is deeper darkness. Yea! <br>
For Light brings light, and Passion ache to have; <br>
And gloom, bewilderments, and ignorance <br>
Grow forth from Ignorance. Those of the first <br>
Rise ever higher; those of the second mode <br>
Take a mid place; the darkened souls sink back <br>
To lower deeps, loaded with witlessness! 

<p>  When, watching life, the living man perceives <br>
The only actors are the Qualities, <br>
And knows what rules beyond the Qualities, <br>
Then is he come nigh unto Me! <br>
The Soul, <br>
Thus passing forth from the Three Qualities- <br>
Whereby arise all bodies- overcomes <br>
Birth, Death, Sorrow, and Age; and drinketh deep <br>
The undying wine of Amrit. <br>
Arjuna. Oh, my Lord! <br>
Which be the signs to know him that hath gone <br>
Past the Three Modes? How liveth he? What way <br>
Leadeth him safe beyond the threefold Modes? <br>
Krishna. He who with equanimity surveys <br>
Lustre of goodness, strife of passion, sloth <br>
Of ignorance, not angry if they are, <br>
Not wishful when they are not: he who sits <br>
A sojourner and stranger in their midst <br>
Unruffled, standing off, saying- serene- <br>
When troubles break, "These be the Qualities! <br>
He unto whom- self-centred- grief and joy <br>
Sound as one word; to whose deep-seeing eyes <br>
The clod, the marble, and the gold are one; <br>
Whose equal heart holds the same gentleness <br>
For lovely and unlovely things, firm-set, <br>
Well-pleased in praise and dispraise; satisfied <br>
With honour or dishonour; unto friends <br>
And unto foes alike in tolerance; <br>
Detached from undertakings,- he is named <br>
Surmounter of the Qualities! 

<p>  And such- <br>
With single, fervent faith adoring Me, <br>
Passing beyond the Qualities, conforms <br>
To Brahma, and attains Me! 

<p>  For I am <br>
That whereof Brahma is the likeness! Mine <br>
The Amrit is; and Immortality <br>
Is mine; and mine perfect Felicity!

BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Gunatrayavibhagayog," <br>
Or "The Book of Religion by Separation from <br>
the Qualities." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER XV <br>
Of Religion by Attaining the Supreme

<p>  Krishna. Men call the Aswattha,- the Banyan-tree,- <br>
Which hath its boughs beneath, its roots above,- <br>
The ever-holy tree. Yea! for its leaves <br>
Are green and waving hymns which whisper Truth! <br>
Who knows the Aswattha, knows Veds, and all. 

<p>  Its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth, <br>
Even as the deeds of men, which take their birth <br>
From qualities: its silver sprays and blooms, <br>
And all the eager verdure of its girth, <br>
Leap to quick life at kiss of sun and air, <br>
As men's lives quicken to the temptings fair <br>
Of wooing sense: its hanging rootlets seek <br>
The soil beneath, helping to hold it there, 

<p>  As actions wrought amid this world of men <br>
Bind them by ever-tightening bonds again. <br>
If ye knew well the teaching of the Tree, <br>
What its shape saith; and whence it springs; and, then 

<p>  How it must end, and all the ills of it, <br>
The axe of sharp Detachment ye would whet, <br>
And cleave the clinging snaky roots, and lay <br>
This Aswattha of sense-life low,- to set 

<p>  New growths upspringing to that happier sky,- <br>
Which they who reach shall have no day to die, <br>
Nor fade away, nor fall- to Him, I mean, <br>
FATHER and FIRST, Who made the mystery 

<p>  Of old Creation; for to Him come they <br>
From passion and from dreams who break away; <br>
Who part the bonds constraining them to flesh, <br>
And,- Him, the Highest, worshipping alway- 

<p>  No longer grow at mercy of what breeze <br>
Of summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees, <br>
What blast of tempest tears them, bough and stem: <br>
To the eternal world pass such as these! 

<p>  Another Sun gleams there! another Moon! <br>
Another Light,- not Dusk, nor Dawn, nor Noon- <br>
Which they who once behold return no more; <br>
They have attained My rest, life's Utmost boon! 

<p>  When, in this world of manifested life, <br>
The undying Spirit, setting forth from Me, <br>
Taketh on form, it draweth to itself <br>
From Being's storehouse,- which containeth all,- <br>
Senses and intellect. The Sovereign Soul <br>
Thus entering the flesh, or quitting it, <br>
Gathers these up, as the wind gathers scents, <br>
Blowing above the flower.-beds. Ear and Eye, <br>
And Touch and Taste, and Smelling, these it takes,- <br>
Yea, and a sentient mind;- linking itself <br>
To sense-things so. <br>
The unenlightened ones <br>
Mark not that Spirit when he goes or comes, <br>
Nor when he takes his pleasure in the form, <br>
Conjoined with qualities; but those see plain <br>
Who have the eyes to see. Holy souls see <br>
Which strive thereto. Enlightened, they perceive <br>
That Spirit in themselves; but foolish ones, <br>
Even though they strive, discern not, having hearts <br>
Unkindled, ill-informed! <br>
Know, too, from Me <br>
Shineth the gathered glory of the suns <br>
Which lighten all the world: from Me the moons <br>
Draw silvery beams, and fire fierce loveliness. <br>
I penetrate the clay, and lend all shapes <br>
Their living force; I glide into the plant- <br>
Root, leaf, and bloom- to make the woodlands green <br>
With springing sap. Becoming vital warmth, <br>
I glow in glad, respiring frames, and pass, <br>
With outward and with inward breath, to feed <br>
The body by all meats. <br>
For in this world <br>
Being is twofold: the Divided, one; <br>
The Undivided, one. All things that live <br>
Are "the Divided." That which sits apart, <br>
"The Undivided." <br>
Higher still is He, <br>
The Highest, holding all, whose Name is LORD, <br>
The Eternal, Sovereign, First! Who fills all worlds, <br>
Sustaining them. And- dwelling thus beyond <br>
Divided Being and Undivided- I <br>
Am called of men and Vedas, Life Supreme, <br>
The PURUSHOTTAMA. <br>
Who knows Me thus, <br>
With mind unclouded, knoweth all, dear Prince! <br>
And with his whole soul ever worshippeth Me. 

<p>  Now is the sacred, secret Mystery <br>
Declared to thee! Who comprehendeth this <br>
Hath wisdom! He is quit of works in bliss! 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XV OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>
Entitled "Purushottamapraptiyog," <br>
Or "The Book of Religion by Attaining the Supreme." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER XVI <br>
Of the Separateness of the Divine and the Undivine

<p>  Krishna. Fearlessness, singleness of soul, the will <br>
Always to strive for wisdom; opened hand <br>
And governed appetites; and piety, <br>
And love of lonely study; humbleness, <br>
Uprightness, heed to injure nought which lives, <br>
Truthfulness, slowness unto wrath, a mind <br>
That lightly letteth go what others prize; <br>
And equanimity, and charity <br>
Which spieth no man's faults; and tenderness <br>
Towards all that suffer; a contented heart, <br>
Fluttered by no desires; a bearing mild, <br>
Modest, and grave, with manhood nobly mixed, <br>
With patience, fortitude, and purity; <br>
An unrevengeful spirit, never given <br>
To rate itself too high;- such be the signs, <br>
O Indian Prince! of him whose feet are set <br>
On that fair path which leads to heavenly birth! 

<p>  Deceitfulness, and arrogance, and pride, <br>
Quickness to anger, harsh and evil speech, <br>
And ignorance, to its own darkness blind,- <br>
These be the signs, My Prince! of him whose birth <br>
Is fated for the regions of the vile. 

<p>  The Heavenly Birth brings to deliverance, <br>
So should'st thou know! The birth with Asuras <br>
Brings into bondage. Be thou joyous, Prince! <br>
Whose lot is set apart for heavenly Birth. 

<p>  Two stamps there are marked on all living men, <br>
Divine and Undivine; I spake to thee <br>
By what marks thou shouldst know the Heavenly Man, <br>
Hear from me now of the Unheavenly! 

<p>  They comprehend not, the Unheavenly, <br>
How Souls go forth from Me; nor how they come <br>
Back unto Me: nor is there Truth in these, <br>
Nor purity, nor rule of Life. "This world <br>
Hath not a Law, nor Order, nor a Lord," <br>
So say they: "nor hath risen up by Cause <br>
Following on Cause, in perfect purposing, <br>
But is none other than a House of Lust." <br>
And, this thing thinking, all those ruined ones- <br>
Of little wit, dark-minded- give themselves <br>
To evil deeds, the curses of their kind. <br>
Surrendered to desires insatiable, <br>
Full of deceitfulness, folly, and pride, <br>
In blindness cleaving to their errors, caught <br>
Into the sinful course, they trust this lie <br>
As it were true- this lie which leads to death- <br>
Finding in Pleasure all the good which is, <br>
And crying "Here it finisheth!" 

<p>  Ensnared <br>
In nooses of a hundred idle hopes, <br>
Slaves to their passion and their wrath, they buy <br>
Wealth with base deeds, to glut hot appetites; <br>
"Thus much, to-day," they say, "we gained! thereby <br>
Such and such wish of heart shall have its fill; <br>
And this is ours! and th' other shall be ours! <br>
To-day we slew a foe, and we will slay <br>
Our other enemy to-morrow! Look! <br>
Are we not lords? Make we not goodly cheer? <br>
Is not our fortune famous, brave, and great? <br>
Rich are we, proudly born! What other men <br>
Live like to us? Kill, then, for sacrifice! <br>
Cast largesse, and be merry!" So they speak <br>
Darkened by ignorance; and so they fall- <br>
Tossed to and fro with projects, tricked, and bound <br>
In net of black delusion, lost in lusts- <br>
Down to foul Naraka. Conceited, fond, <br>
Stubborn and proud, dead-drunken with the wine <br>
Of wealth, and reckless, all their offerings <br>
Have but a show of reverence, being not made <br>
In piety of ancient faith. Thus vowed <br>
To self-hood, force, insolence, feasting, wrath, <br>
These My blasphemers, in the forms they wear <br>
And in the forms they breed, my foemen are, <br>
Hateful and hating; cruel, evil, vile, <br>
Lowest and least of men, whom I cast down <br>
Again, and yet again, at end of lives, <br>
Into some devilish womb, whence- birth by birth- <br>
The devilish wombs re-spawn them, all beguiled; <br>
And, till they find and worship Me, sweet Prince! <br>
Tread they that Nether Road. 

<p>  The Doors of Hell <br>
Are threefold, whereby men to ruin pass,- <br>
The door of Lust, the door of Wrath, the door <br>
Of Avarice. Let a man shun those three! <br>
He who shall turn aside from entering <br>
All those three gates of Narak, wendeth straight <br>
To find his peace, and comes to Swarga's gate. 

<p>  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XVI OF THE <br>
BHAGAVAD-GITA, <br>

Or "The Book of the Separateness of the <br>
Divine and Undivine." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER XVII <br>
Of Religion by the Threefold Kinds of Faith

<p>  Arjuna. If men forsake the holy ordinance, <br>
Heedless of Shastras, yet keep faith at heart <br>
And worship, what shall be the state of those, <br>
Great Krishna! Sattwan, Rajas, Tamas? Say! <br>
Krishna. Threefold the faith is of mankind, and springs <br>
From those three qualities,- becoming "true," <br>
Or "passion-stained," or "dark," as thou shalt hear! 

<p>  The faith of each believer, Indian Prince! <br>
Conforms itself to what he truly is. <br>
Where thou shalt see a worshipper, that one <br>
To what he worships lives assimilate, <br>
[Such as the shrine, so is the votary,] <br>
The "soothfast" souls adore true gods; the souls <br>
Obeying Rajas worship Rakshasas <br>
Or Yakshas; and the men of Darkness pray <br>
To Pretas and to Bhutas. Yea, and those <br>
Who practise bitter penance, not enjoined <br>
By rightful rule- penance which hath its root <br>
In self-sufficient, proud hypocrisies- <br>
Those men, passion-beset, violent, wild, <br>
Torturing- the witless ones- My elements <br>
Shut in fair company within their flesh, <br>
(Nay, Me myself, present within the flesh!) <br>
Know them to devils devoted, not to Heaven! <br>
For like as foods are threefold for mankind <br>
In nourishing, so is there threefold way <br>
Of worship, abstinence, and almsgiving! <br>
Hear this of Me! there is a food which brings <br>
Force, substance, strength, and health, and joy to live, <br>
Being well-seasoned, cordial, comforting, <br>
The "Soothfast" meat. And there be foods which bring <br>
Aches and unrests, and burning blood, and grief <br>
Being too biting, heating, salt, and sharp, <br>
And therefore craved by too strong appetite. <br>
And there is foul food- kept from over-night, <br>
Savourless, filthy, which the foul will eat, <br>
A feast of rottenness, meet for the lips <br>
Of such as love the "Darkness." 

<p>  Thus with rites;- <br>
A sacrifice not for rewardment made, <br>
Offered in rightful wise, when he who vows <br>
Sayeth, with heart devout, "This I should do! <br>
Is "Soothfast" rite. But sacrifice for gain, <br>
Offered for good repute, be sure that this, <br>
O Best of Bharatas! is Rajas-rite, <br>
With stamp of "passion." And a sacrifice <br>
Offered against the laws, with no due dole <br>
Of food-giving, with no accompaniment <br>
Of hallowed hymn, nor largesse to the priests, <br>
In faithless celebration, call it vile, <br>
The deed of "Darkness!"- lost! <br>
Worship of gods <br>
Meriting worship; lowly reverence <br>
Of Twice-borns, Teachers, Elders; Purity, <br>
Rectitude, and the Brahmacharya's vow, <br>
And not to injure any helpless thing,- <br>
These make a true religiousness of Act. 

<p>  Words causing no man woe, words ever true, <br>
Gentle and pleasing words, and those ye say <br>
In murmured reading of a Sacred Writ,- <br>
These make the true religiousness of Speech. 

<p>  Serenity of soul, benignity, <br>
Sway of the silent Spirit, constant stress <br>
To sanctify the Nature,- these things make <br>
Good rite, and true religiousness of Mind. 

<p>  Such threefold faith, in highest piety <br>
Kept, with no hope of gain, by hearts devote <br>
Is perfect work of Sattwan, true belief. 

<p>  Religion shown in act of proud display <br>
To win good entertainment, worship, fame, <br>
Such- say I- is of Rajas, rash and vain. 

<p>  Religion followed by a witless will <br>
To torture self, or come at power to hurt <br>
Another,- 'tis of Tamas, dark and ill. 

<p>  The gift lovingly given, when one shall say <br>
"Now must I gladly give!" when he who takes <br>
Can render nothing back; made in due place, <br>
Due time, and to a meet recipient, <br>
Is gift of Sattwan, fair and profitable. 

<p>  The gift selfishly given, where to receive <br>
Is hoped again, or when some end is sought, <br>
Or where the gift is proffered with a grudge, <br>
This is of Rajas, stained with impulse, ill. 

<p>  The gift churlishly flung, at evil time, <br>
In wrongful place, to base recipient, <br>
Made in disdain or harsh unkindliness, <br>
Is gift of Tamas, dark; it doth not bless!

Kinds of Faith." 

<p>  ==============================================

<p>  CHAPTER XVIII <br>
Of Religion by Deliverance and Renunciation

<p>  Arjuna. Fain would I better know, Thou Glorious One! <br>
The very truth- Heart's Lord!- of Sannyas, <br>
Abstention; and Renunciation, Lord! <br>
Tyaga; and what separates these twain! <br>
Krishna. The poets rightly teach that Sannyas <br>
Is the foregoing of all acts which spring <br>
Out of desire; and their wisest say <br>
Tyaga is renouncing fruit of acts. 

<p>  There be among the saints some who have held <br>
All action sinful, and to be renounced; <br>
And some who answer, "Nay! the goodly acts- <br>
As worship, penance, alms- must be performed!" <br>
Hear now My sentence, Best of Bharatas! 

<p>  'Tis well set forth, O Chaser of thy Foes! <br>
Renunciation is of threefold form, <br>
And Worship, Penance, Alms, not to be stayed; <br>
Nay, to be gladly done; for all those three <br>
Are purifying waters for true souls! 

<p>  Yet must be practised even those high works <br>
In yielding up attachment, and all fruit <br>
Produced by works. This is My judgment, Prince! <br>
This My insuperable and fixed decree! 

<p>  Abstaining from a work by right prescribed <br>
Never is meet! So to abstain doth spring <br>
From "Darkness," and Delusion teacheth it. <br>
Abstaining from a work grievous to flesh, <br>
When one saith "'Tis unpleasing!" this is null! <br>
Such an one acts from "passion;" nought of gain <br>
Wins his Renunciation! But, Arjun! <br>
Abstaining from attachment to the work, <br>
Abstaining from rewardment in the work, <br>
While yet one doeth it full faithfully, <br>
Saying, "'Tis right to do!" that is "true" act <br>
And abstinence! Who doeth duties so, <br>
Unvexed if his work fail, if it succeed <br>
Unflattered, in his own heart justified, <br>
Quit of debates and doubts, his is "true" act: <br>
For, being in the body, none may stand <br>
Wholly aloof from act; yet, who abstains <br>
From profit of his acts is abstinent. 

<p>  The fruit of labours, in the fives to come, <br>
Is threefold for all men,- Desirable, <br>
And Undesirable, and mixed of both; <br>
But no fruit is at all where no work was. 

<p>  Hear from me, Long-armed Lord! the makings five <br>
Which go to every act, in Sankhya taught <br>
As necessary. First the force; and then <br>
The agent; next, the various instruments; <br>
Fourth, the especial effort; fifth, the God. <br>
What work soever any mortal doth <br>
Of body, mind, or speech, evil or good, <br>
By these five doth he that. Which being thus, <br>
Whoso, for lack of knowledge, seeth himself <br>
As the sole actor, knoweth nought at all <br>
And seeth nought. Therefore, I say, if one- <br>
Holding aloof from self- with unstained mind <br>
Should slay all yonder host, being bid to slay, <br>
He doth not slay; he is not bound thereby! 

<p>  Knowledge, the thing known, and the mind which knows, <br>
These make the threefold starting-ground of act. <br>
The act, the actor, and the instrument, <br>
These make the threefold total of the deed. <br>
But knowledge, agent, act, are differenced <br>
By three dividing qualities. Hear now <br>
Which be the qualities dividing them. 

<p>  There is "true" Knowledge. Learn thou it is this: <br>
To see one changeless Life in all the Lives, <br>
And in the Separate, One Inseparable. <br>
There is imperfect Knowledge: that which sees <br>
The separate existences apart, <br>
And, being separated, holds them real. <br>
There is false Knowledge: that which blindly clings <br>
To one as if 'twere all, seeking no Cause, <br>
Deprived of light, narrow, and dull, and "dark." 

<p>  There is "right" Action: that which- being enjoined- <br>
Is wrought without attachment, passionlessly, <br>
For duty, not for love, nor hate, nor gain. <br>
There is "vain" Action: that which men pursue <br>
Aching to satisfy desires, impelled <br>
By sense of self, with all-absorbing stress: <br>
This is of Rajas- passionate and vain. <br>
There is "dark" Action: when one doth a thing <br>
Heedless of issues, heedless of the hurt <br>
Or wrong for others, heedless if he harm <br>
His own soul- 'tis of Tamas, black and bad! 

<p>  There is the "rightful" doer. He who acts <br>
Free from self-seeking, humble, resolute, <br>
Steadfast, in good or evil hap the same, <br>
Content to do aright- he "truly" acts. <br>
There is th' "impassioned" doer. He that works <br>
From impulse, seeking profit, rude and bold <br>
To overcome, unchastened; slave by turns <br>
Of sorrow and of joy: of Rajas he! <br>
And there be evil doers; loose of heart, <br>
Low-minded, stubborn, fraudulent, remiss, <br>
Dull, slow, despondent- children of the "dark." 

<p>  Hear, too, of Intellect and Steadfastness <br>
The threefold separation, Conqueror-Prince! <br>
How these are set apart by Qualities. 

<p>  Good is the Intellect which comprehends <br>
The coming forth and going back of life, <br>
What must be done, and what must not be done, <br>
What should be feared, and what should not be feared, <br>
What binds and what emancipates the soul: <br>
That is of Sattwan, Prince! of "soothfastness." <br>
Marred is the Intellect which, knowing right <br>
And knowing wrong, and what is well to do <br>
And what must not be done, yet understands <br>
Nought with firm mind, nor as the calm truth is: <br>
This is of Rajas, Prince! and "passionate!" <br>
Evil is Intellect which, wrapped in gloom, <br>
Looks upon wrong as right, and sees all things <br>
Contrariwise of Truth. O Pritha's Son! <br>
That is of Tamas, "dark" and desperate! 

<p>  Good is the steadfastness whereby a man <br>
Masters his beats of heart, his very breath <br>
Of life, the action of his senses; fixed <br>
In never-shaken faith and piety: <br>
That is of Sattwan, Prince! "soothfast" and fair! <br>
Stained is the steadfastness whereby a man <br>
Holds to his duty, purpose, effort, end, <br>
For life's sake, and the love of goods to gain, <br>
Arjuna! 'tis of Raias, passion-stamped! <br>
Sad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool <br>
Cleaves to his sloth, his sorrow, and his fears, <br>
His folly and despair. This- Pritha's Son!- <br>
Is born of Tamas, "dark" and miserable! 

<p>  Hear further, Chief of Bharatas! from Me <br>
The threefold kinds of Pleasure which there be. 

<p>  Good Pleasure is the pleasure that endures, <br>
Banishing pain for aye; bitter at first <br>
As poison to the soul, but afterward <br>
Sweet as the taste of Amrit. Drink of that! <br>
It springeth in the Spirit's deep content. <br>
And painful Pleasure springeth from the bond <br>
Between the senses and the sense-world. Sweet <br>
As Amrit is its first taste, but its last <br>
Bitter as poison. 'Tis of Rajas, Prince! <br>
And foul and "dark" the Pleasure is which springs <br>
From sloth and sin and foolishness; at first <br>
And at the last, and all the way of life <br>
The soul bewildering. 'Tis of Tamas, Prince! 

<p>  For nothing lives on earth, nor 'midst the gods <br>
In utmost heaven, but hath its being bound <br>
With these three Qualities, by Nature framed. 

<p>  The work of Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, <br>
And Sudras, O thou Slayer of thy Foes! <br>
Is fixed by reason of the Qualities <br>
Planted in each: <br>
A Brahman's virtues, Prince <br>
Born of his nature, are serenity, <br>
Self-mastery, religion, purity, <br>
Patience, uprightness, learning, and to know <br>
The truth of things which be. A Kshatriya's pride, <br>
Born of his nature, lives in valour, fire, <br>
Constancy, skilfulness, spirit in fight, <br>
And open-handedness and noble mien, <br>
As of a lord of men. A Vaisya's task, <br>
Born with his nature, is to till the ground, <br>
Tend cattle, venture trade. A Sudra's state, <br>
Suiting his nature, is to minister. 

<p>  Whoso performeth- diligent, content- <br>
The work allotted him, whate'er it be, <br>
Lays hold of perfectness! Hear how a man <br>
Findeth perfection, being so content: <br>
He findeth it through worship- wrought by work- <br>
Of HIM that is the Source of all which lives, <br>
Of HIM by Whom the universe was stretched. 

<p>  Better thine own work is, though done with fault, <br>
Than doing others' work, ev'n excellently. <br>
He shall not fall in sin who fronts the task <br>
Set him by Nature's hand! Let no man leave <br>
His natural duty, Prince! though it bear blame! <br>
For every work hath blame, as every flame <br>
Is wrapped in smoke! Only that man attains <br>
Perfect surcease of work whose work was wrought <br>
With mind unfettered, soul wholly subdued, <br>
Desires for ever dead, results renounced. 

<p>  Learn from me, Son of Kunti! also this, <br>
How one, attaining perfect peace, attains <br>
BRAHM, the supreme, the highest height of all! 

<p>  Devoted- with a heart grown pure, restrained <br>
In lordly self-control, forgoing wiles <br>
Of song and senses, freed from love and hate, <br>
Dwelling 'mid solitudes, in diet spare, <br>
With body, speech, and will tamed to obey, <br>
Ever to holy meditation vowed, <br>
From passions liberate, quit of the Self, <br>
Of arrogance, impatience, anger, pride; <br>
Freed from surroundings, quiet, lacking nought- <br>
Such an one grows to oneness with the BRAHM; <br>
Such an one, growing one with BRAHM, serene, <br>
Sorrows no more, desires no more; his soul, <br>
Equally loving all that lives, loves well <br>
Me, Who have made them, and attains to Me. <br>
By this same love and worship doth he know <br>
Me as I am, how high and wonderful, <br>
And knowing, straightway enters into Me. <br>
And whatsoever deeds he doeth- fixed <br>
In Me, as in his refuge- he hath won <br>
For ever and for ever by My grace <br>
Th' Eternal Rest! So win thou! In thy thoughts <br>
Do all thou dost for Me! Renounce for Me! <br>
Sacrifice heart and mind and will to Me! <br>
Live in the faith of Me! In faith of Me <br>
All dangers thou shalt vanquish, by My grace; <br>
But, trusting to thyself and heeding not, <br>
Thou can'st but perish! If this day thou say'st, <br>
Relying on thyself, "I will not fight!" <br>
Vain will the purpose prove! thy qualities <br>
Would spur thee to the war. What thou dost shun, <br>
Misled by fair illusions, thou wouldst seek <br>
Against thy will, when the task comes to thee <br>
Waking the promptings in thy nature set. <br>
There lives a Master in the hearts of men <br>
Maketh their deeds, by subtle pulling-strings, <br>
Dance to what tune HE will. With all thy soul <br>
Trust Him, and take Him for thy succour, Prince! <br>
So- only so, Arjuna!- shalt thou gain- <br>
By grace of Him- the uttermost repose, <br>
The Eternal Place! <br>
Thus hath been opened thee <br>
This Truth of Truths, the Mystery more hid <br>
Than any secret mystery. Meditate! <br>
And- as thou wilt- then act! 

<p>  Nay! but once more <br>
Take My last word, My utmost meaning have! <br>
Precious thou art to Me; right well-beloved! <br>
Listen! tell thee for thy comfort this. <br>
Give Me thy heart! adore Me! serve Me! cling <br>
In faith and love and reverence to Me! <br>
So shalt thou come to Me! I promise true, <br>
For thou art sweet to Me! <br>
And let go those- <br>
Rites and writ duties! Fly to Me alone! <br>
Make Me thy single refuge! will free <br>
Thy soul from all its sins! Be of good cheer! 

<p>  [Hide, the holy Krishna saith, <br>
This from him that hath no faith, <br>
Him that worships not, nor seeks <br>
Wisdom's teaching when she speaks: <br>
Hide it from all men who mock; <br>
But, wherever, 'mid the flock <br>
Of My lovers, one shall teach <br>
This divinest, wisest, speech- <br>
Teaching in the faith to bring <br>
Truth to them, and offering <br>
Of all honour unto Me- <br>
Unto Brahma cometh he! <br>
Nay, and nowhere shall ye find <br>
Any man of all mankind <br>
Doing dearer deed for Me; <br>
Nor shall any dearer be <br>
In My earth. Yea, furthermore, <br>
Whoso reads this converse o'er, <br>
Held by Us upon the plain, <br>
Pondering piously and fain, <br>
He hath paid Me sacrifice! <br>
(Krishna speaketh in this wise!) <br>
Yea, and whoso, full of faith, <br>
Heareth wisely what it saith, <br>
Heareth meekly,- when he dies, <br>
Surely shall his spirit rise <br>
To those regions where the Blest, <br>
Free of flesh, in joyance rest.] 

<p>  Hath this been heard by thee, O Indian Prince! <br>
With mind intent? hath all the ignorance- <br>
Which bred thy trouble- vanished, My Arjun? <br>
Arjuna. Trouble and ignorance are gone! the Light <br>
Hath come unto me, by Thy favour, Lord! <br>
Now am I fixed! my doubt is fled away! <br>
According to Thy word, so will I do! 

<p>  Sanjaya. Thus gathered I the gracious speech of Krishna, O my King! <br>
Thus have I told, with heart a-thrill, this wise and wondrous thing <br>
By great Vyasa's learning writ, how Krishna's self made known <br>
The Yoga, being Yoga's Lord. So is the high truth shown! <br>
And aye, when I remember, O Lord my King, again <br>
Arjuna and the God in talk, and all this holy strain, <br>
Great is my gladness: when I muse that splendour, passing speech, <br>
Of Hari, visible and plain, there is no tongue to reach <br>
My marvel and my love and bliss. O Archer-Prince! all hail! <br>
O Krishna, Lord of Yoga! surely there shall not fail <br>
Blessing, and victory, and power, for Thy most mighty sake, <br>
Where this song comes of Arjun, and how with God he spake. 

<p>  HERE ENDS, WITH CHAPTER XVIII, <br>
Entitled "Mokshasanyasayog," <br>
Or "The Book of Religion by Deliverance and Renunciation," <br>
THE BHAGAVAD-GITA. <br>
THE END
