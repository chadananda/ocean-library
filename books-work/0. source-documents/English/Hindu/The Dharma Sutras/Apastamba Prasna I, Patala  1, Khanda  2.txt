5. But those whose great-grandfather's (grandfather's and father's) initiation is not remembered, are called 'burial-grounds.'
6. Intercourse, dining, and intermarriage with them should be avoided. For them, if they like, the (following) penance (is prescribed). (Such a man) shall keep for twelve years the rules prescribed for a student who is studying the three Vedas. Afterwards he may be initiated. Then he shall bathe, reciting the Pavamanis and the other (texts mentioned above, I, 1, 2, 2).

[10. The commentatcr observes that for those whose great-great-grandfather or remoter ancestors were not initiated, no penance is prescribed, and that it must be fixed by those who know the law.]

[11. Manu II, 164.
12. Manu III, 1, and Yagn. I, 36; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 125.
16. The commentator declares that in Manu III, 1, the expression until he has learnt it,' must be understood in this sense, that the pupil may leave his teacher, if he has learnt the Veda, after twelve years' study, never before. But compare also Asv. Gri. Su. I, 22, 3.
17. The commentator states that this rule refers only to a temporary, not to a professed student (Daishihika). He also gives an entirely different explanation to the Sutra, which, according to some, means, 'A student who learns the sacred science shall not fast in order to obtain heaven.' This Tendering also is admissible, as the word para may mean either a 'stranger' or 'heaven' and upavasa, 'dwelling' or 'fasting.'
19. Regarding the crimes which cause loss of caste (pataniya), see below, I, 7, 21, 7.
20. Manu II, 108, and Yagn. I, 27.
21. Manu II, 108, 198; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 123 and 124.]

26. He shall preserve chastity.
27. He shall not embellish himself (by using ointments and the like).
28. He shall not wash his body (with hot water for pleasure).
29. But, if it is soiled by unclean things, he shall clean it (with earth or water), in a place where he is not seen by a Guru.
30. Let him not sport in the water whilst bathing; let him swim (motionless) like a stick.
31. He shall wear all his hair tied in one braid.
32. Or let him make a braid of the lock on the crown of the head, and shave the rest of the hair.
[23. Regarding the meaning of kshara, 'pungent condiments,' see Haradatta on II, 6, 15, 15. Other commentators explain the term differently.--Manu II, 177; Yagn. I, 33; and Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 123. Asv. Gri. Su. I, 22, 2.
25. Manu II, 177; Yagn. I, 33.
26. Manu II, 180.
27. Manu II, 178; Yagn. I, 33.
29. 'Here, in the section on the teacher, the word guru designates the father and the rest also.'--Haradatta.
30. Another version of the first portion of this Sutra, proposed by Haradatta, is, 'Let him not, whilst bathing, clean himself (with bathing powder or the like).' Another commentator takes Sutra 28 as a prohibition of the daily bath or washing generally ordained for Brahmanas, and refers Sutra 29. to the naimittika snana or 'bathing on certain occasions,' and takes Sutra 30 as a restriction of the latter.
31. Manu II, 2 19.]

38. The staff worn by a Brahmana should be made of Palasa wood, that of a Kshatriya of a branch of the Banian tree, which grows downwards, that of a Vaisya of Badara or Udumbara wood. Some declare, without any reference to caste, that the staff of a student should be made of the wood of a tree (that is fit to be used at the sacrifice).
39. (He shall wear) a cloth (to cover his nakedness).
40. (It shall be made) of hemp for a Brahmana, of flax (for a Kshatriya), of the skin of a (clean) animal (for a Vaisya).

[33. Manu II, 42-44; Yagn. I, 29; Asv. Gri. Su. I, 19, 12; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 23.
38. Manu II, 45; Yagn. I, 29; Asv. Gri. Su. I, 19, 13; 20, 1; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 23.
Haradatta gives no commentary on this Sutra, but refers back to the Grihya-sutra, II, 16-17, where the same words occur.
39. The word forms a Sutra by itself, in order to show that every one must wear this cloth.
40. Manu II, 41. 'Clean' means here and everywhere else, if applied to animals or things,' fit to be used at the sacrifice.'
