1. Honey, uncooked (grain), venison, land, roots, fruits, (a promse of) safety, a pasture for cattle, a house, and fodder for a draught-ox may be accepted (even) from an Ugra.
2. Harita declares, that even these (presents) are to be accepted only if they have been obtained by a pupil.
[18. 1. Manu IV, 247. 'Ugra denotes either a bad twice-born man. or the offspring of a Vaisya and of a Sudra-woman. Other persons of a similar character must be understood to be included by the term.'--Haradatta.]
3. Or they (Brahmana householders) may accept (from an Ugra) uncooked or (a little) unflavoured boiled food.
4. (Of such food) they shall not take a great quantity (but only so much as suffices to support life).
5. If (in times of distress) he is unable to keep himself, he may eat (food obtained from anybody),
6. After having touched it (once) with gold,
7. Or (having touched it with) fire.
8. He shall not be too eager after (such a way of living). He shall leave it when he has obtained a (lawful) livelihood.
9. (A student of the Brahmanic caste) who has returned home shall not eat (in the house) of people belonging to the three tribes, beginning with ihe Kshatriya (i. e. of Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras).
10. He may (usually) eat (the food) of a Brahmana on account of (the giver's) character (as a Brahmana). It must be avoided for particular reasons only.
[4. Also this rule seems to belong to Harita, on account of its close connection with the preceding two.
8. Haradatta quotes, in support of the last Satras, a passage of the Khandogya Upanishad, I, 10, 1, and one from the Rig-veda, IV, 18, 13, according to which it would be lawful to eat even impure food, as a dog's entrails, under such circumstances. Other commentators explain this and the preceding thrce Sutras differentiv. According to them the translaticn would run thus: 'If he himself does not find any livelihood (in times of distress, he may dwell even with low-caste people who give him something to eat, and) he may eat (food given by them) paying for it with (some small gift in) gold or with animals.' This second explanation is perhaps preferable.
9. Manu IV, 219, and 223.]

15. He may eat it, after having touched it (once) with gold or with fire. He shall not be too eager after (such a way of living). He shall leave it when he obtains a (lawful) livelihood.

17. Nor food offered by a general invitation (to all comers).
18. Food offered by an artisan must not be eaten,
19. Nor (that of men) who live by the use of arms (with the exception of Kshatriyas),
[11. If a Brahmana who has been ordered to perform a penance, performs a Vaisvadeva or other rite without heeding the order of his spiritual teacher, then a student who has returned home ought not to eat in his house, until the enjoined penance has been performed.'--Haradatta.
12. 'The use of the part. perf. pass. "performed" indicates that he must not eat there, whilst the penance is being performed.'--Haradatta.
