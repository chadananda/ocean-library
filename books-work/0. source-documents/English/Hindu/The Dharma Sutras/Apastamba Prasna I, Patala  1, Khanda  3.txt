19.The explanations of the last two terms, santa (Sutra 18) and danta (Sutra 19), are different from those given usually. Sama is usually explained as 'the exclusive direction of the mind towards God,' and dama as 'the restraining of the senses..'
23, Manu II, 178.
25. Regarding the explanation of the term Abhisasta, see below, I, 7, 21, 17. Haradatta: 'Apapatras are called those born from a high-caste mother and a low-caste father, such as washermen. For their cooking vessels &c. are unfit for the use of the four castes.
Since Apastamba says, In the evening and in the morning, food obtained in the evening must not be used for the morning meal, nor food obtained in the morning for the eveni ng meal."' Manu II, 182, 183, 185; Asv. Gri. Su. I, 22, 4. See also Gopatha-brahmana I, 2, 6.]
26. A Brahmana declares: Since a devout student takes away from women, who refuse (to give him alms, the merit gained) by (Srauta)-sacrifices, by gifts, (and) by burnt-offerings (offered in the domestic fire), as well as their offspring, their cattle, the sacred learning (of their families), therefore, indeed, (a woman) should not refuse (alms) to the crowd of students; for amonst those (who come to beg), there might be one of that (devout) kind, one who thus (conscientiously) keeps his vow.
2 7 . Alms (shall) not (be considered) leavings (and be rejected) by inference from their appearance), but on the strength of ocular or oral testimony (only).
28. A Brahmana shall beg, prefacing (his request) by the word 'Lady';
29. A Kshatriya (inserting the word) 'Lady' in the middle (between the words 'give alms');
30. A Vaisya, adding the word 'Lady' (at the end of the formula).
31. (The pupil) having taken those (alms) shall place them before his teacher and offer them to him.
32. He may eat (the food) after having been ordered to do so by his teacher.
[27. To eat the residue of the meal of any person except that left by the teacher and other Gurus, is not permitted to a student; see also below, I, 1, 4, 1 seq.; Manu II, 56; Yagn. I, 33.
28. The formula to be used by a Brahmana is, 'Lady, give alms;' that to be used by a Kshatriya, 'Give, lady, alms;' and that used by a Vaisya, 'Give alms, lady.' Manu II, 49; Yagn. I, 30; Asv. Gri. Su. I, 22, 8.
31. The words with which be announces the alms are, Idam ittham ahritam, 'this much have I received.' Manu II, 51; Yagn. I, 2, 7; Asv. Gri. Su. I, 2 2, 10.

34. If the (family of the teacher) is (also) absent, the pupil (may offer the food) to other learned Brahmanas (Srotriyas) also (and receive from them the permission to eat).
5. He shall not beg for his own sake (alone).
36. After he has eaten, he himself shall clean his dish.
37. And he shall leave no residue (in his dish).
38. If he cannot (eat all that he has taken in his dish), he shall bury (the remainder) in the grou nd;
39. Or he may throw it into the water;
40. Or he may place (all that remains in a pot), and put it down near an (uninitiated) Arya;
41. Or (he may put it down) near a Sudra slave (belonging to his teacher).
42. If (the pupil) is on a journey, he shall throw
[34. Regarding the term Srotriya, see below, II, 3, 6. 4.
35. 'The meaning of this Sutra is, that the rule given, Sutra 42 (below), for a pupil who is on a journey, shall hold food also for a pupil who is at home, if (in the absence of his teacher) no Srotriyas are to be found (from whom he can receive the permission to eat).'--Haradatta.
36. 'He commits no sin, if he has the alms-pot cleaned by somebody else. Some say that the Sutra refers to both vessels (the alms-pot and his own dish).'
40. An Arya is a person belonging to one of the first three castes (see below). The Arya must be a boy who is not initiated, because children are karnabhakshah, i.e. allowed to eat what they like, even leavings.
42. This rule holds good if no Srotriyas are near. If Srotriyas are to be found, Sutra 34 applies. Agni, the god of fire, is considered to be of the Brahminical caste, and hence he takes the place of the teacher or of the Srotriyas. See also Manu II, 247, 248, and the passages collected from the Brahmanas, by Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 39.]
a part of the alms into the fire and eat (the remainder).
43. Alms are declared to be sacrificial food. In regard to them the teacher (holds the position which) a deity (holds in regard to food offered at a sacrifice).
44. And (the teacher holds also the place which) the Ahavaniya fire occupies (at a sacrifice, because a portion of the alms is offered in the fire of his stomach).
45. To him (the teacher) the (student) shall offer (a portion of the alms),
