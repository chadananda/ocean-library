Khandamsi, 'the Vedic texts,' i.e. the Mantras and Brahmanas. The Angas may be studied out of term; see Apastamba I, 3, 9, 3 note.]
(the full moon of) Bhadrapada (August-September) and study the Vedic texts,

15. (Nor shall he study) when the teachers (of the gods and Asuras, i.e. the planets Jupiter and Venus) are surrounded by a halo,

when lightning (flashes out of season) after the fires have become visible (in the twilight).
24. (If these phenomena appear) during the (rainy) season, (the reading must be interrupted) for a day (or a night),
25. And if lightning (is observed) during the night, (the recitation of the Veda shall be interrupted) until the third watch.
26. If (lightning) flashes during the third part of the day or later, (the Veda must not be read) during the entire (following night).
27. (According to the opinion) of some, a fiery meteor (has the same effect) as lightning,
28. Likewise thunder (which is heard) during the last part of the day,
29. (Or) also in the twilight.
[24. Apastamba I, 3, 9, 22. The above translation follows the reading of my MSS., which differ very much from Professor Stenzier's edition. According to them the commentary on the latter part of Sutra 23 and on Sutra 24 runs as follows: . . . pratyekam alalika anadhyayahetavah | apartav idam | ritav aha ||
AHA RITAU || 24 ||
Varshartav ete yadi bhaveyuh sandhyayam tadaharmatram anadhyayah | pratasket | sayam tu ratrav anadhyaya ityarthasiddhatvad anuktam || . . . 'are each reasons for discontinuing the recitation until the same time next day. This (rule) refers to other times than the rainy season. He now declares (the rule) for the rainy season:
24. "During the (rainy) season for a day."
'If these (phenomena) happen in the twilight during the rainy season, the interruption of the study lasts for that day only, provided (they happen) in the morning. But if they happen in the evening, study is forbidden during the night. As this is clear from the context, it has not been declared specially.'--Haradatta. I suspect that Professor Stenzler's reading apartau is a correction, made by an ingenious Pandit, of an old varia lectio 'ahartau' for aha ritau, which is found in one of my MSS. (C) also.
25. Apastamba I, 3, 9, 21.]
30. (If thunder is heard) before midnight, (the study of the Veda must be interrupred) during the whole night.
31. (If it is heard) during the (early part of the) day, (the interruption must continue) as long as the sun shines,
32. Likewise if the king of the country has died.
33. If one (pupil) has gone on a journey (and) another (stays) with (the teacher, the study of the Veda shall be interrupted until the absentee returns).
34. When an attack (is made on the village), or a fire (breaks out), when one Veda has been completed, after (an attack of) vomiting, when he has partaken of a funeral repast or of a dinner on the occasion of a sacrifice offered to men, (the study of the Veda shall be- interrupted) for a day and a night,
35. Likewise on the day of the new moon.
36. (On the latter occasion it may also be interrupted) for two days.
37. (The Veda shall not be studied for a day and a night) bn the full moon days of the months Karttika, Phalguna, and Ashadha.
[30. Apastamba I, 3, 9, 23.
33. Apastamba I, 3, 11, 11. Haradatta adds that others enjoin a stoppage of the Veda-study from the hour of the departure until the same hour on the following day, while another commentator gives the following explanation: 'All, indeed, the teacher and the rest, shall, on that day, not even recite the Veda in order to remember it.'
34. Apastamba I, 3, 9, 25; I, 3, 10, 22, 28-30; I, 3, 11, 6, 30; Manu IV, 118. Haradatta is in doubt whether 'a sacrifice offered in honour of men' means a Samskara, or a sacrifice to gods, like Kumara, who formerly were men; see Apastamba I, 3, 11, 3.

38. On the three Ashtakas (the Veda shall not be studied) for three (days and) nights.
39. Some (declare, that the rule applies) to the last Ashtaka (only).
40. (On the occasion of) the annual (Upakarman and Utsarga the reading shall be interrupted) on the day (of the ceremony) and those preceding and following it.
41. All (teachers declare, that the reading shall be interrupted for three days) when rain, thunder, and lightning (are observed) simultaneously,
42. When the rain is very heavy, (the reading shall be interrupted as long as it lasts).
43. On a festive day (the reading shall be stopped) after the (morning) meal,
44. And he who has begun to study (after the Upakarman shall not read) at night for four Muhurtas.
45. Some (declare, that the recitation of the Veda is) always (forbidden) in a town.
46. While he is impure (he shall) not even (recite the Veda) mentally.

43. Haradatta explains 'a festive day' to mean the day of the initiation ancl the like, but see Apastamba I, 3, 11, 20.
44. Haradatta explains this Sutra as equivalent to Apastamba I, 3, 9, 1. He adds that another commentator reads pradhitasya ka as a separate Sutra, interpreting it to mean, 'And a person who has performed the Upakarman (shall not study after dinner),' and refers the words 'at night for four Muhurtas' to the prohibition to read on the evening of the thirteenth day of the dark half of the month.

47. (The study) of those who offer a funeral sacrifice (must be interrupted) until the same time next day,
48. Even if uncooked grain is offered at the funeral sacrifice.
49. And (those rules regarding the stoppage of the reading must be observed), which they teach in the several schools.
