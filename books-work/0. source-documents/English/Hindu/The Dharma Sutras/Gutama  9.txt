1. Such (a man) shall bathe, after (having fulfilled) the, law (regarding studentship), take unto him a wife, and, fulfilling the duties of a householder which have been del-lared above, in addition obey the following ordinances
[IX 1. Apastamba I, 11, 30. 1-4. Haradatta says that the expression sa, 'such (a man),' refers to the king, and to the Brahmana deeply versed in the Vedas, who have been described in the preceding chapter. My MSS. insert between this and the following one another Sutra, which has been left out in Professor Stenzler's edition. It seems to me that it is absolutely required, and I therefore insert it here, together with Haradatta's comment, according to my best copy, P.
Gautama: '(And) a Snataka (i.e. a person who has completed his studentship, but has not yet taken a wife, shall act thus).' Haradalta: 'It must be understood that the word "and" has been left out. (The meaning is): "And a Snataka shall obey the following ordinances." If this Sutra were not given, those ordinances would have to be obeyed after marriage only; and if the preceding Sutra (1) had not been given, before marriage only, because the term Snataka is usually employed in that (sense) only. For this reason both (Sutras) have been given. Hence, though a man may not enter another order, he shall, after taking the bath (on completion of his studentship), obey these ordinances during his whole life. As here (Sutra 1) the word sa, "such a man," is used, a Kshatriya and a Brahmana only must necessarily obey the rules prescribed for a Snataka and perform a penance for breaking them; and the penance for breaking the rules prescribed for a Snataka is fasting. This is (the object of the insertion of the word sa, "such (a man)." But, if a Vaisya follows them, (his reward will be) prosperity; if he breaks them, he need not perform a penance. With respect to this matter another Smriti says: "The penance which is prescribed for a breach of the Snataka laws, must be performed by a Kshatriya and a Brahmana alone, never by (men of) the other (caste)."]
2. (He shall be) always pure (and) sweet-smelling (and) bathe frequently.
3. If he possesses wealth, he shall not be dressed in old or dirty clothes;
4. Nor shall he wear dyed or sumptuous garments, nor such as have been worn (before) by others,
5. Nor a garland and shoes (that have been worn by others).
6. (He may wear a cast-off garment) which has been washed, if he is unable (to afford a new one).
7. He shall not allow his beard to grow without a (sufficient) reason.
[2. Manu IV, 35.
3-4. Apastamba I, 11, 30, 10-13.
5. Manu IV, 66.
6. According to Haradatta the same rule applies to garlands and shoes.
7. Manu IV, 35. 'The expression "his beard" includes by implication the nails and the rest. . . . . As he says "without a sufficient reason," he shall allow his beard to grow during the pregnancy of his wife and on other occasions. With respect to this matter they quote the following verse: "In the sixth year and in the sixteenth vear, likewise in the year of his marriage and during the pregnancy of his wife, he shall avoid the use of a razor."--Haradatta.]
8. He shall not carry water and fire at the same time.
9. He shall not drink out of his joined hands.
10. He shall not sip water standing, nor (shall he sip) water drawn up (from a well),

12. Facing or within sight of wind, fire, Brahmanas, the sun, water, (images of the) gods, and cows he shall not eject urine or faces or other impurities.
13. He shall not stretch out his feet towards those divine beings.
14. He shall not remove urine or faces with leaves, clods of earth, or stones.

14. Apastamba I, 11, 30, 21. Haradatta remarks that some explain loshtha, 'a clod of earth,' by kapala, 'a pot-sherd.'
15. Apastamba II, 8, 20, 11-12. Kapila, 'pot-sherds,' may also mean 'skull-bones.'
6. Manu IV, 57. Haradatta says that only a conversation, properly so called, is forbidden, not to ask barbarians &c. about the road and similar matters.]
17. If he has conversed (with such persons), he shall meditate on virtuous (men),
18. Or he may speak with a Brahmana.

23, Apastamba I, 11, 31, 10. Haradatta remarks that the prohibition does not extend to those cases where the Vedic ritual requires the fact to be pointed out. 'He is, of course, right in making this statement, as an express injunction of the Sruti always overrides the rules of the Smriti.
24. Haradatta adds that this and the preceding Sutras include by implication the cases where a cow does damage in a field; see Apastamba I, 11, 31, 9.

61. Manu IV, 61.
62. Apastamba I, 11, 32, 29; I, 7, 20, 8. Haradatta adds that the plural is used in the above Sutra in order to indicate that many Brahmanas must be unaninious regarding the practices to be followed.
63. Manu IV, 33; X, 113. 'For the sake of these objects he may go to a ruler, i.e. a king without cringing, because the preposition adhi is used (in the text, and) adhi denotes mastership' (Panini I, 4, 97). The meaning that he shall go (as becomes) an independent man.'--Haradatta.
65. Apastamba I, 5, 15, 22; I, 11, 32, 18. Aryans i.e. Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas:
66. Manu IV, 39. 'A cow, a Brahmana, a well-known tree, and the like are called excellent (beings or things). An auspicious (object), i.e. a filled jar and the like.'--Haradatta.]

[67. Haradatta observes that this rule refers to cases where, being in a hurry, one cannot show one's reverence in the manner described in the preceding Sutra.
