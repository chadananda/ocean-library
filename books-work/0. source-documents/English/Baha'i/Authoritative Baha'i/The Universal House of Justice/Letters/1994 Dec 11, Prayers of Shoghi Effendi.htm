<p class=Left>Dear Baha'i Friend,</p>
 
	<p>At the request of the Universal House of Justice, the Research Department has provided the enclosed response to your email message of 12 November 1994, in which you inquire about the reason that the prayers of the Guardian are not translated into English.

	<p>In her email letter of 12 November 1994 to the Universal House of Justice, Shohreh Mansouri enquires about the prayers written in Persian and Arabic by Shoghi Effendi. She wishes to know why these prayers have not been translated into the English language.
 
	<p>The following two extracts from letters written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice provide information which pertains to Miss Mansouri's query:

<blockquote> 
     Even though the beloved Guardian wrote some prayers in his 
     letters to the eastern friends, he did not encourage their translation 
     into the western languages. In a letter written on his behalf to the 
     National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States on 23 
     February 1957, his secretary stated:
   <blockquote>
          He sees no necessity for translating prayers that he has written 
          in Persian into English. The Baha'is have a great many wonderful 
          prayers already translated, and he feels that now is not the time to 
          spend money on these things.

   </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
     In response to your Email message of 6 November 1986 regarding 
     the possibility of publishing a selection of the prayers of Shoghi 
     Effendi translated into English, the Universal House of Justice 
     instructs us to advise that it does not feel that the time has come for 
     this to be done. We are to convey its further comments.
</blockquote> 

<blockquote>
     There is no doubt that one day the general messages of the 
     beloved Guardian addressed to the friends in the East, particularly to 
     the friends in Iran and written in Arabic and Persian, will be 
     translated for the benefit of the English-speaking world. In the context of 
     such a project, the prayers of Shoghi Effendi, which usually form 
     part of these communications, will of course be translated and made 
     available to the friends.
