<p class=left>Dear Baha'i Friend,

	<p>Your email letter of 8 November 2002 has been received at the Baha'i World Centre and passed to our Department for response.

	<p>As you are aware, it is not the practice of Baha'i institutions or individuals to take positions on the political decisions of governments. One of the greatest obstacles to progress is the tendency of Baha'is to be drawn into the general attitudes and disputes that surround them. The central importance of the principle of avoidance of politics and controversial matters is that Baha'is should not allow themselves to be involved in the disputes of the many conflicting elements of the society around them. The aim of the Baha'is is to reconcile viewpoints, to heal divisions, and to bring about tolerance and mutual respect among men, and this aim is undermined if we allow ourselves to be swept along by the ephemeral passions of others. This does not mean that Baha'is cannot collaborate with any non-Baha'i movement; it does mean that good judgment is required to distinguish those activities and associations which are beneficial and constructive from those which are divisive.

<p class=signed>With loving Baha'i greetings,<br>
