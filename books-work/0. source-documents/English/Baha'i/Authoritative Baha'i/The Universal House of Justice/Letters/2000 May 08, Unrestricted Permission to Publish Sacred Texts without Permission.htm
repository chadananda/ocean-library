<p class=Left>Mr. ....

<p class=Left>Dear Baha'i Friend,</p>

	<p>Your email message of 15 April 2000 requesting permission to include electronic versions of The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah and Bahiyyih Khanum in ..., a searchable electronic textbase of the Baha'i Writings on CD-ROM for Macintosh computer users, has been received at the Baha'i World Centre.

	<p>There is no objection to your using electronic versions of these texts as you have indicated. For your information, there are no copyright restrictions on publishing the Sacred Text, the works of the Guardian, books produced by World Centre Publications or the Baha'i International Community. Permission from independent Baha'i publishers is required before publishing books produced by them. It is also common practice to include an acknowledgement of copyright and to indicate the original source for electronic text.


<p class=Signed>With loving Baha'i greetings,<br>
Department of the Secretariat <br>
