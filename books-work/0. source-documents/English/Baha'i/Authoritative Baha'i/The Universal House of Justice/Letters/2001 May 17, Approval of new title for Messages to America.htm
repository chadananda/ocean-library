<p class=Left>Dear Baha'i Friends</p>

	<p> The Universal House of Justice received your message dated 9 May 2001 proposing a change in the title of the new edition of "Messages to America". We have been asked to respond that it considers "This Decisive Hour: Messages from Shoghi Effendi to the North American Baha'is, 1932-1946" both felicitous and descriptive and is happy to endorse it.

<p class=Signed>With loving Baha'i greetings,<br>
