<p class=Left>From: Mr Sizwe Cawe
<p class=Left>Subject: Ruhi Institute 
 

	<p class=blockquote>"... The approval of institute or other educational programs is not a task that the Universal House of Justice generally undertakes. Nevertheless, it is well aware that the materials of the Ruhi Institute have played a significant role in the development of most institutes around the world. The International Teaching Centre recently prepared a document entitled "Training Institutes and Systematic Growth", which was sent to all National Spiritual Assemblies under a cover letter dated 23 march 2000 written on behalf of the House of Justice. That document contains a section which describes the value of the Ruhi Institute program, and you are encouraged to obtain a copy from your National Assembly."<br>
