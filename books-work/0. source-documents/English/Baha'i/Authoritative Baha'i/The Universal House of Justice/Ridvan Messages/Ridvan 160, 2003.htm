<p class=Left> To the Baha'is of the World 
<p class=Left> Dearly loved Friends, </p>

	<p id=1>      As the Five Year Plan enters upon its third year, momentum is building:  
the record of achievement during the year just ended far outdistanced that of 
the previous twelve months.  The thrust of this momentum owes as much to the 
increased coherence achieved in the Plan's constituent elements as to the 
animating effect of the spirit of unrest pervading the planet. 

	<p id=2>     The circumstances attending the opening of this new administrative year 
are at once critical, challenging and extraordinary in their significance.  The 
entire course of the previous year was agitated by a succession of crises that 
culminated in the outbreak of war in the Middle East.  The implications are no 
less significant for the progress of the community of the Most Great Name than 
for the evolution of an increasingly global society in the throes of a 
turbulent transition.  Of necessity, the timing, scale and tendencies of this 
transition have not been predictable.  How swift indeed has been the current 
change in the tide of world conditions! In the resultant conflict, involving so 
conspicuously the countries in which the earliest history of the Cause took 
shape, we see a fresh reminder of Baha'u'llah's warning that the "world's 
equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great, 
this new World Order".  That the events of this crisis directly affect a 
territory with as rich a Baha'i legacy as Iraq is particularly noteworthy. 

	<p id=3>The disruptions caused by this and other situations in the world have, in 
one instance, suggested the opening of a new chapter in the history of the 
highly prized but woefully oppressed Baha'i community of a land in which the 
Manifestation of God for this Day resided for a whole decade.  In another, they 
have dashed the preparations for the Ninth International Convention at the 
World Centre of our Faith.  But, however disappointing, this calls for no 
dismay.  When the Major Plan of God interferes with His Minor Plan, there 
should be no doubt that in due course a way will providentially be opened to an 
opportunity of stellar possibilities for advancing the interests of His 
glorious Cause. 

	<p id=4>The sorrows, fears and perplexities evoked by this latest conflict in the 
unfoldment of the Lesser Peace have intensified the feelings of grievance and 
outrage at the recurrent crises agitating the planet.  The anxieties of people 
across the globe are even now being played out publicly in angry demonstrations 
too overwhelming to be ignored.  The issues they protest and the emotions they 
arouse often add to the chaos and confusion they hope by such public displays 
to resolve.  For the friends of God, there is an unambiguous explanation for 
what is occurring; they have only to recall the vision and principles offered 
by the Faith if they are to respond effectively to the challenges posed by the 
spread of distress and dismay.  Let them strive  
to understand more deeply the Teachings that are relevant by reviewing letters 
of Shoghi Effendi which have been published in The World Order of Baha'u'llah, 
particularly those entitled "The Goal of a New World Order", "America and the 
Most Great Peace", and "The Unfoldment of World Civilization". 

	<p id=5>While the world continues on its tumultuous course, the Five Year Plan 
has reached the operational capacity to enable our community to make giant 
strides towards its major aim of advancing the process of entry by troops.  The 
details of so encouraging a state of affairs for the Faith on all five 
continents have already been given in our 17 January letter; to it we invite 
your further study.  Only a few key details need now be underscored:  The 
division of countries into clusters has been completed in 179 of them; there 
exist some 17,000 of these seedbeds of expansion.  Reflection meetings at the 
level of clusters have become a powerful means of unifying thought and action 
across institutions and localities; they have lent a potent stimulus to 
institutional and individual initiatives in a mutually supportive spirit.  The 
institute process has demonstrated even more prominently than before its 
influence as a generating force for expansion and consolidation.  The core 
activities of the Plan have attained a scale far outstripping that of the past 
year.  As a result, a growing number of friends are now active in the teaching 
and administrative work throughout the world, demonstrating the infectious 
spirit of confidence inspiring the enthusiasm of their efforts.  Youth and 
children have been more systematically involved in the programmes of the 
community, and non-Baha'is have been participating more numerously in study 
circles, devotional meetings and children's classes.  It is indeed heartening 
to note that, in the brief period since the beginning of the Plan, where in 
many communities these three core activities had been sporadic they have become 
regular features and have multiplied.  Here, then, is a snapshot of a world 
community focused and on the move as never before. 

	<p id=6>During the past year, as this pattern of growth became more firmly rooted 
in the operation of the Plan, other important developments were taking place.  
In the arena of external affairs, agencies of the Baha'i International 
Community engaged in activities too numerous and varied to describe here, but 
of a collective effect too impressive to let pass without some mention.  The 
highlight of such activities was the message we addressed last April to the 
world's religious leaders.  This has given a fresh impulse to the approach 
being taken by the Baha'i community to call the attention of the most 
influential elements of society to issues of critical importance to ensuring 
the peace of the world.  Through the coordinating efforts of the Baha'i 
International Community's Office of Public Information and the prompt 
efficiency of National Spiritual Assemblies, the message was distributed in a 
short time to the topmost ranks and other echelons of religious communities 
across the globe.  The purpose of the initiative is to bring to the attention 
of all concerned the urgent need for religious leadership to address the 
problem of religious prejudice, which is becoming a steadily more serious 
danger to human well-being.  The immediate reactions from many recipients 
indicate that the message is being seriously regarded and is even in some 
places lending new perspective to interfaith activities. 

	<p id=7>In the field of social and economic development a tempo has been attained 
that impresses ever more deeply the effects of institutional and individual 
effort on both the internal development of the community and the community's 
collaboration with others.  The Office of Social and Economic Development 
reports that during the second year of the Plan eight new Baha'i-inspired 
development agencies were established, operating in such diverse fields as the 
advancement of women, health, agriculture, child education and youth 
empowerment. 

	<p id=8>In the Holy Land, the English translation of Baha'u'llah's Arabic epistle 
known as Javahiru'l-Asrar was released under the title "Gems of Divine 
Mysteries".  The restoration of the Cell of Baha'u'llah in the prison at 'Akka 
was completed, and work began on the remainder of the upper floor of the prison 
cell area.  As of the next pilgrimage season, beginning in October 2003, the 
number of pilgrims in each group will be raised from 150 to 200. 

	<p id=9>Furthermore, efforts at fostering the development of institutions 
operating at the World Centre were especially evident in the continuing 
evolution of the institution of Huququ'llah under the distinguished leadership 
of the Trustee, the Hand of the Cause of God 'Ali-Muhammad Varqa.  Through his 
wise initiative and constant endeavour, Dr. Varqa has inspired the education of 
the friends everywhere concerning the law of Huququ'llah.  In the decade since 
the law was universally applied, a network of national and regional boards of 
trustees has been brought into existence, which provides coordination and 
direction to the service of an increasing number of deputies and 
representatives.  Knowledge of this great law has spread widely, and friends 
from all continents are responding to it with a spirit of devotion, which the 
Trustee hopes will touch those who have not yet availed themselves of the 
promised blessings flowing from adherence to this law. 

	<p id=10>In the nearly two years since we announced the special necessity for 
financial support to maintain, at a befitting standard, the buildings and 
gardens at the World Centre, the World Centre Endowment Fund has been 
established.  The contributions have not yet reached a level equal to the 
annual need.  However, we have felt obliged to set aside five million dollars 
of the contributions received as an earmarked fund towards building a corpus to 
provide a source of investment income dedicated to the original purpose.  We 
have done so by drawing upon the Baha'i International Fund to assist in 
covering the necessary expenditures, suspending activities in other fields that 
it would have been normal to pursue. 

	<p id=11>We are delighted to advise that, in response to the call issued by the 
National Spiritual Assembly of Chile, 185 design concepts have been received 
from architects and designers around the world for the Mother Temple of South 
America to be constructed in Santiago.  A final choice will be announced in due 
course. 

	<p id=12>Dear Friends:  Gratified by solid evidence of the progress being made far 
and wide, we trust in the continuing confirmations of our Supreme Lord upon the 
dedicated efforts you exert within the framework of the Five Year Plan--a Plan 
designed to fit the requirements of these times.  May your persistence in its 
pursuit release those pent-up forces that, through the grace and favour of the 
Abha Beauty, can advance by mighty thrusts the process of entry by troops in 
every land.
