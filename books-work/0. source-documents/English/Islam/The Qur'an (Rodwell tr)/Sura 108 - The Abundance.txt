SURA CVIII (108) - The Abundance   (Mecca - 3 Verses)            (XII - 30)   
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       Truly we have given thee an Abundance;
 
       Pray therefore to the Lord, and slay the victims.
 
       Verily whoso hateth thee shall be childless.
