SURA LXXXI (81) - The Folded Up  (Mecca - 29 Verses        (XXXII - 45)       
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       When the sun shall be Folded Up,
 
       And when the stars shall fall,
 
       And when the mountains shall be set in motion,
 
       And when the she-camels shall be abandoned,
 
       And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together,
 
       And when the seas shall boil,
 
       And when the souls shall be paired with their bodies,
 
       And when the female child that had been buried alive shall be asked
 
       For what crime she was put to death,
 
81:10  And when the leaves of the Book shall be unrolled,
 
       And when the Heavens shall be stripped away,
 
       And when Hell shall be made to blaze,
 
       And when Paradise shall be brought near,
 
       Every soul shall know what it hath produced.
 
       It needs not that I swear by the stars of retrograde motions
 
       Which move swiftly and hide themselves away,
 
       And by the night when it cometh darkening on,
 
       And by the dawn when it brighteneth,
 
       That this is the word of an illustrious Messenger,
 
81:20  Endued with power, having influence with the Lord of the Throne,
 
       Obeyed there by Angels, faithful to his trust,
 
       And your compatriot is not one possessed by djinn;
 
       For he saw him in the clear horizon:
 
       Nor doth he teach the doctrine of a cursed Satan.
 
       Whither then are ye going?
 
       Verily, this is no other than a warning to all creatures;
 
       To him among you who willeth to walk in a straight path:
 
       But will it ye shall not, unless as God willeth it, the Lord of the
worlds.
