SURA CIX (109) - Unbelievers      (Mecca - 6 Verses)             (IX - 29)   
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       Say:  O ye Unbelievers!
 
       I worship not that which ye worship,
 
       And ye do not worship that which I worship;
 
       I shall never worship that which ye worship,
 
       Neither will ye worship that which I worship.
 
       To you be your religion; to me my religion.
