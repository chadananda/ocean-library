SURA XCVII (97) - Power    (Mecca - 5 Verses)            (XXI - 37)         
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       Verily, we have caused It to descend on the night of Power.
 
       And who shall teach thee what the night of power is?
 
       The night of power excelleth a thousand months:
 
       Therein descend the angels and the spirit by permission of their Lord
for every matter;
 
       And all is peace till the breaking of the morn.
