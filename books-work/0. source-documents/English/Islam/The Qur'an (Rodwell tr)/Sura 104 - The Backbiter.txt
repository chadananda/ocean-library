SURA CIV (104) The Backbiter      (Mecca - 9 Verses)          (XIII - 30)   
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       Woe to every Backbiter, Defamer!
 
       Who amasseth wealth and storeth it against the future!
 
       He thinketh surely that his wealth shall be with him for ever.
 
       Nay! for verily he shall be flung into the Crushing Fire;
 
       And who shall teach thee what the Crushing Fire is?
 
       It is God's kindled fire,
 
       Which shall mount above the hearts of the damned;
 
       It shall verily rise over them like a vault,
 
       On outstretched columns.
