SURA CVII (107)  Religion      (Mecca - 7 Verses)               (XIV - 31)    
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       What thinkest thou of him who treateth our Religion as a lie?
 
       He it is who thrusteth away the orphan,
 
       And stirreth not others up to the feed the poor.
 
       Woe to those who pray,
 
       But in their prayer are careless;
 
       Who make a shew of devotion,
 
       But refuse help to the needy.
