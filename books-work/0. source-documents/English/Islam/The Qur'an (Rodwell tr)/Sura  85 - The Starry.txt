SURA LXXXV (85) - The Starry  (Mecca - 22 Verses        (XXVIII - 42)           
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       By the star-bespangled Heaven!
 
       By the promised Day!
 
       By the witness and the witnessed!
 
       Cursed the masters of the trench
 
       Of the fuel-fed fire,
 
       When they sat around it
 
       Witnesses of what they inflicted on the believers!
 
       Nor did they torment them but for their faith in God, the Mighty, the
Praiseworthy:
 
       His the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth; and God is the witness
of everything.
 
85:10  Verily, those who vexed the believers, men and women, and repented not,
doth the torment of Hell, and the torment of the burning, await.
 
       But for those who shall have believed and done the things that be right,
are the Gardens beneath whose shades the rivers flow.  This is the immense
bliss!
 
       Verily, right terrible will by thy Lord's vengeance!
 
       He it is who produceth all things, and causeth them to return;
 
       And is He the Indulgent, the Loving;
 
       Possessor of the Glorious throne;
 
       Worker of that he willeth.
 
       Hath not the story reached thee of the hosts
 
       Of Pharaoh and Themoud?
 
       Nay! the infidels are all for denial:
 
85:20  But God surroundeth them from behind.
 
       Yet it is a glorious Koran,
 
       Written on the preserved Table.
