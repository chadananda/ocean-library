SURA XCIX (99) The Earthquake    (Mecca - 8 Verses)           (XXX - 44)     
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       When the Earth with her quaking shall quake
 
       And the Earth shall cast forth her burdens,
 
       And man shall say, What aileth her?
 
       On that day shall she tell out her tidings,
 
       Because thy Lord shall have inspired her.
 
       On that day shall men come forward in throngs to behold their works,
 
       And whosoever shall have wrought an atom's weight of good shall behold
it.
 
       And whosoever shall have wrought an atom's weight of evil shall behold
it.
