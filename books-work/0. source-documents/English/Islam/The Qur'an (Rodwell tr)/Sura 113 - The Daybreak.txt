SURA CXIII (113) - The Daybreak   (Mecca or Medina - 5 Verses)     (VI - 27)   
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       Say:  I betake me for refuge to the Lord of the Day Break
 
       Against the mischiefs of his creation;
 
       And against the mischief of the night when it overtaketh me;
 
       And against the mischief of weird women;
 
       And against the mischief of the envier when he envieth.
