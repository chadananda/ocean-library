SURA LXXXVI (86) - The Night-Comer (Mecca - 17 Verses)         (XXII - 37)      
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       By the heaven, and by the Night-Comer!
 
       But who shall teach thee what the night-comer is?
 
       'Tis the star of piercing radiance.
 
       Over every soul is set a guardian.
 
       Let man then reflect out of what he was created.
 
       He was created of the poured-forth germs,
 
       Which issue from the loins and breastbones:
 
       Well able then is God to restore him to life, -
 
       On the day when all secrets shall be searched out,
 
86:10  And he shall have no other might or helper.
 
       I swear by the heaven which accomplisheth its cycle,
 
       And by the earth which openeth her bosom,
 
       That his Koran is a discriminating discourse,
 
       And that it is not frivolous.
 
       They plot a plot against thee,
 
       And I will plot a plot against them.
 
       Deal calmly therefore with the infidels; leave them awhile alone.
