SURA LXXXVIII (88) - The Overshadowing  (Mecca - 26 Verses)  (XXXVIII - 53)  
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       Hath the tidings of the day that shall Overshadow, reached thee?
 
       Downcast on that day shall be the countenances of some,
 
       Travailing and worn,
 
       Burnt at the scorching fire,
 
       Made to drink from a fountain fiercely boiling.
 
       No food shall they have but the fruit of Darih,
 
       Which shall not fatten, nor appease their hunger.
 
       Joyous too, on that day, the countenances of others,
 
       Well pleased with their labours past,
 
88:10  In a lofty garden:
 
       No vain discourse shalt thou hear therein:
 
       Therein shall be a gushing fountain,
 
       Therein shall be raised couches,
 
       And goblets ready placed,
 
       And cushions laid in order,
 
       And carpets spread forth.
 
       Can they not look up to the clouds, how they are created;
 
       And to the heaven how it is upraised;
 
       And to the mountains how they are rooted;
 
88:20  And to the earth how it is outspread?
 
       Warn thou then; for thou art a warner only:
 
       Thou hast no authority over them:
 
       But whoever shall turn back and disbelieve,
 
       God shall punish him with the greater punishment.
 
       Verily to Us shall they return;
 
       Then shall it be Our's to reckon with them.
