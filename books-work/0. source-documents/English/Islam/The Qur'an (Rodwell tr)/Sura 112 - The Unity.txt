SURA CXII (112) - The Unity      (Mecca - 4 Verses)              (X - 29)     
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       Say:  He is God alone:
 
       God the eternal!
 
       He begetteth not, and He is not begotten;
 
       And there is none like unto Him.
