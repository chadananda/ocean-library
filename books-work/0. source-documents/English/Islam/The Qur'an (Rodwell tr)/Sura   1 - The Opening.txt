       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!
 
       King on the day of reckoning!
 
       Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.
 
       Guide Thou us on the straight path,
 
       The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; - with whom thou art
not angry, and who go not astray.
