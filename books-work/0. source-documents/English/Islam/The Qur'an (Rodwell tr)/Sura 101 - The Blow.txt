SURA CI (101) - The Blow    (Mecca - 8 Verses          (XXIX - 43)           
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       The Blow! what is the Blow?
 
       Who shall teach thee what the Blow is?
 
       The Day when men shall be like scattered moths,
 
       And the mountains shall be like flocks of carded wool,
 
       Then as to him whose balances are heavy - his shall be a life that shall
please him well:
 
       And as to him whose balances are light - his dwelling-place shall be the
pit.
 
       And who shall teach thee what the pit (El-Hawiya) is?
 
       A raging fire!
