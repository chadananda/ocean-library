SURA XCII (92) - The Night   (Mecca - 21)                      (XVI - 31)       
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       By the Night when she spreads her veil;
 
       By the Day when it brightly shineth;
 
       By Him who made male and female;
 
       At different ends truly do ye aim!
 
       But as to him who giveth alms and feareth God,
 
       And yieldeth assent to the Good;
 
       To him will we make easy the path to happiness.
 
       But as to him who is covetous and bent on riches,
 
       And calleth the Good a lie,
 
92:10  To him will we make easy the path to misery:
 
       And what shall his wealth avail him when he goeth down?
 
       Truly man's guidance is with Us
 
       And Our's, the Future and the Past.
 
       I warn you therefore of the flaming fire;
 
       None shall be cast to it but the most wretched, -
 
       Who hath called the truth a lie and turned his back.
 
       But the God-fearing shall escape it, -
 
       Who giveth away his substance that he may become pure;
 
       And who offereth not favours to any one for the sake of recompense,
 
92:20  But only as seeking the face of his Lord the Most High.
 
       And surely in the end he shall be well content.
