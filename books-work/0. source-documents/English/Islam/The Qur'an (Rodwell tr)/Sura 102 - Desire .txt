SURA CII (102) - Desire     (Mecca - 8 Verses)                (XV - 31)      
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       The Desire of increasing riches occupieth you,
 
       Till ye come to the grave.
 
       Nay! but in the end ye shall know -
 
       Nay! once more, in the end ye shall know your folly.
 
       Nay! would that ye knew it with knowledge of certainty!
 
       Surely ye shall see hell-fire.
 
       Then shall ye surely see it with the eye of certainty;
 
       Then shall ye on that day be taken to task concerning pleasures.
