SURA XCV (95) The Fig       (Mecca - 8 Verses)               (XXVI - 41)     
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       I swear by the Fig and by the olive,
 
       By Mount Sinai,
 
       And by this inviolate soil!
 
       That of goodliest fabric we created man,
 
       Then brought him down to be the lowest of the low; -
 
       Save who believe and do the things that are right, for theirs shall be a
reward that faileth not.
 
       Then, who after this shall make thee treat the Judgment as a lie?
 
       What! is not God the most just of judges?
