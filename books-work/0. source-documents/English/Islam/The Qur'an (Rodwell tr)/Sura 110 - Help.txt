SURA CX (110) - Help       (Medina - 3 Verses)              (CXI - 468)     
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       When the Help of God and the victory arrive,
 
       And thou seest men entering the religion of God by troops;
 
       Then utter the praise of thy Lord, implore His pardon; for He loveth to
turn in mercy.
