SURA XCI (91) - The Sun  (Mecca - 15 Verses)             (XXIII - 38)           
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       By the Sun and his noonday brightness!
 
       By the Moon when she followeth him!
 
       By the Day when it revealeth his glory!
 
       By the Night when it enshroudeth him!
 
       By the Heaven and Him who built it!
 
       By the Earth and Him who spread it forth!
 
       And breathed into it its wickedness and its piety,
 
       Blessed now is he who hath kept it pure,
 
91:10  And undone is he who hath corrupted it!
 
       Themoud in his impiety rejected the message of the Lord,
 
       When the greatest wretch among them rushed up: -
 
       Said the Apostle of God to them - "The Camel of God! let her drink."
 
       But they treated him as an impostor and hamstrung her.
 
       So their Lord destroyed them for their crime, and visited all alike:
 
       Nor feared he the issue.
