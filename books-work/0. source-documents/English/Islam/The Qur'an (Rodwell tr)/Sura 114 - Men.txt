SURA CXIV (114) - Men        (Mecca or Medina - 6 Verses)        (VII - 27)    
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       Say:  I betake me for refuge to the Lord of Men,
 
       The King of men,
 
       The God of men,
 
       Against the mischief of the stealthily withdrawing whisperer,
 
       Who whispereth in man's breast -
 
       Against djinn and men.
