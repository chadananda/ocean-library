SURA CIII (103) The Afternoon       (Mecca - 3 Verses)         (XXVII - 42)    
 
       In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
 
       I swear by the declining day!
 
       Verily, man's lot is cast amid destruction,
 
       Save those who believe and do the things which be right, and enjoin
truth and enjoin stedfastness on each other.
