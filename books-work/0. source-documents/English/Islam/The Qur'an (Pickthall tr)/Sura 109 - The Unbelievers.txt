109. al-Kafirun: The Unbelievers

1 Say: O disbelievers! 

2 I worship not that which ye worship; 

3 Nor worship ye that which I worship. 

4 And I shall not worship that which ye worship. 

5 Nor will ye worship that which I worship. 

6 Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion.
