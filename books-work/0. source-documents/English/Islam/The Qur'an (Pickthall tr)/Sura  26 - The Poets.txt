26. ash-Shu`ara': The Poets

1 Ta. Sin. Mim. 

2 These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain. 

3 It may be that thou tormentest thyself (O Muhammad) because they believe not. 

4 If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their necks would remain bowed before it. 

5 Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but they turn away from it. 

6 Now they have denied (the Truth); but there will come unto them tidings of that whereat they used to scoff. 

7 Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to grow therein ? 

8 Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. 

9 And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 

10 And when thy Lord called Moses, saying: Go unto the wrongdoing folk, 

11 The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off (evil) ? 

12 He said: My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me, 

13 And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor send for Aaron (to help me). 

14 And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me. 

15 He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with you, Hearing. 

16 And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord of the Worlds, 

17 (Saying): Let the Children of Israel go with us. 

18 (Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not rear thee among us as a child ? And thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us, 

19 And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the ingrates. 

20 He said: I did it then, when I was of those who are astray. 

21 Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him). 

22 And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel. 

23 Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds ? 

24 (Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye had but sure belief. 

25 (Pharaoh) said unto those around him: Hear ye not ? 

26 He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers. 

27 (Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a madman! 

28 He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did but understand. 

29 (Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners. 

30 He said: Even though I show thee something plain ? 

31 (Pharaoh) said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful! 

32 Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest, 

33 And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders. 

34 (Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about him: Lo! this is verily a knowing wizard, 

35 Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye ? 

36 They said: Put him off, (him) and his brother, and send into the cities summoners 

37 Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard. 

38 So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed. 

39 And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering ? 

40 (They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners. 

41 And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners ? 

42 He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near (to me). 

43 Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are going to throw! 

44 Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaoh's might, lo! we verily are the winners. 

45 Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely show. 

46 And the wizards were flung prostrate, 

47 Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, 

48 The Lord of Moses and Aaron. 

49 (Pharaoh) said: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know. Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you every one. 

50 They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return. 

51 Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers. 

52 And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night, for ye will be pursued. 

53 Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners, 

54 (Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a little troop, 

55 And lo! they are offenders against us. 

56 And lo! we are a ready host. 

57 Thus did We take them away from gardens and watersprings, 

58 And treasures and a fair estate. 

59 Thus (were those things taken from them) and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them. 

60 And they overtook them at sunrise. 

61 And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are indeed caught. 

62 He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me. 

63 Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted, and each part was as a mountain vast. 

64 Then brought We near the others to that place. 

65 And We saved Moses and those with him, every one; 

66 And We drowned the others. 

67 Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 

68 And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 

69 Recite unto them the story of Abraham: 

70 When he said unto his father and his folk: What worship ye ? 

71 They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them. 

72 He said: Do they hear you when ye cry ? 

73 Or do they benefit or harm you ? 

74 They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this wise. 

75 He said: See now that which ye worship, 

76 Ye and your forefathers! 

77 Lo! they are (all) an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds, 

78 Who created me, and He doth guide me, 

79 And Who feedeth me and watereth me. 

80 And when I sicken, then He healeth me, 

81 And Who causeth me to die, then giveth me life (again), 

82 And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment. 

83 My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous. 

84 And give unto me a good report in later generations. 

85 And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight, 

86 And forgive my father. Lo! he is of those who err. 

87 And abase me not on the day when they are raised, 

88 The day when wealth and sons avail not (any man) 

89 Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole heart. 

90 And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off (evil). 

91 And hell will appear plainly to the erring. 

92 And it will be said unto them: Where is (all) that ye used to worship 

93 Instead of Allah ? Can they help you or help themselves ? 

94 Then will they be hurled therein, they and the seducers 

95 And the hosts of Iblis, together. 

96 And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein: 

97 By Allah, of a truth we were in error manifest 

98 When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds. 

99 It was but the guilty who misled us. 

100 Now we have no intercessors 

101 Nor any loving friend. 

102 Oh, that we had another turn (on earth), that we might be of the believers! 

103 Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers! 

104 And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 

105 Noah's folk denied the messengers (of Allah), 

106 When their brother Noah said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 

107 Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 

108 So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. 

109 And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. 

110 So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. 

111 They said: Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest (of the people) follow thee ? 

112 He said: And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing (in the past) ? 

113 Lo! their reckoning is my Lord's concern, if ye but knew; 

114 And I am not (here) to repulse believers. 

115 I am only a plain warner. 

116 They said: If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those stoned (to death). 

117 He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me. 

118 Therefor judge Thou between us, a (conclusive) judgment, and save me and those believers who are with me. 

119 And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship. 

120 Then afterward We drowned the others. 

121 Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 

122 And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 

123 (The tribe of) A'ad denied the messengers (of Allah). 

124 When their brother Hud said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 

125 Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 

126 So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 

127 And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. 

128 Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight ? 

129 And seek ye out strongholds, that haply ye may last for ever ? 

130 And if ye seize by force, seize ye as tyrants ? 

131 Rather keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. 

132 Keep your duty toward Him Who hath aided you with (the good things) that ye know, 

133 Hath aided you with cattle and sons. 

134 And gardens and watersprings. 

135 Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an awful day. 

136 They said: It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who preach; 

137 This is but a fable of the men of old, 

138 And we shall not be doomed. 

139 And they denied him; therefor We destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 

140 And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 

141 (The tribe of) Thamud denied the messengers (of Allah) 

142 When their brother Salih said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 

143 Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 

144 So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 

145 And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. 

146 Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us, 

147 In gardens and watersprings. 

148 And tilled fields and heavy-sheathed palm-trees, 

149 Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful ? 

150 Therefor keep your duty to Allah and obey me, 

151 And obey not the command of the prodigal, 

152 Who spread corruption in the earth, and reform not. 

153 They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; 

154 Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring some token if thou art of the truthful. 

155 He said: (Behold) this she-camel. She hath the right to drink (at the well), and ye have the right to drink, (each) on an appointed day. 

156 And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful day. 

157 But they hamstrung her, and then were penitent. 

158 So the retribution came on them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 

159 And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 

160 The folk of Lot denied the messengers (of Allah), 

161 When their brother Lot said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 

162 Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 

163 So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 

164 And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. 

165 What! Of all creatures do ye come unto the males, 

166 And leave the wives your Lord created for you ? Nay, but ye are froward folk. 

167 They said: If thou cease not, O Lot, thou wilt soon be of the outcast. 

168 He said: I am in truth of those who hate your conduct. 

169 My Lord! Save me and my household from what they do. 

170 So We saved him and his household, every one, 

171 Save an old woman among those who stayed behind. 

172 Then afterward We destroyed the others. 

173 And We rained on them a rain. And dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned. 

174 Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. 

175 And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 

176 The dwellers in the wood (of Midian) denied the messengers (of Allah), 

177 When Shu'eyb said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? 

178 Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, 

179 So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 

180 And I ask of you no wage for it; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds. 

181 Give full measure, and be not of those who give less (than the due). 

182 And weigh with the true balance. 

183 Wrong not mankind in their goods, and do not evil, making mischief, in the earth. 

184 And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the men of old. 

185 They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; 

186 Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars. 

187 Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us, if thou art of the truthful. 

188 He said: My Lord is Best Aware of what ye do. 

189 But they denied him, so there came on them the retribution of the day of gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day. 

190 Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. 

191 And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. 

192 And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds, 

193 Which the True Spirit hath brought down 

194 Upon thy heart, that thou mayst be (one) of the warners, 

195 In plain Arabic speech. 

196 And lo! it is in the Scriptures of the men of old. 

197 Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know it ? 

198 And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs, 

199 And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it. 

200 Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty. 

201 They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom, 

202 So that it will come upon them suddenly, when they perceive not. 

203 Then they will say: Are we to be reprieved ? 

204 Would they (now) hasten on Our doom ? 

205 Hast thou then seen, if We content them for (long) years, 

206 And then cometh that which they were promised, 

207 (How) that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them ? 

208 And We destroyed no township but it had its warners 

209 For reminder, for We never were oppressors. 

210 The devils did not bring it down. 

211 It is not meet for them, nor is it in their power, 

212 Lo! verily they are banished from the hearing. 

213 Therefor invoke not with Allah another god, lest thou be one of the doomed. 

214 And warn thy tribe of near kindred, 

215 And lower thy wing (in kindness) unto those believers who follow thee. 

216 And if they (thy kinsfolk) disobey thee, say: Lo! I am innocent of what they do. 

217 And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful. 

218 Who seeth thee when thou standest up (to pray) 

219 And (seeth) thine abasement among those who fall prostrate (in worship). 

220 Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower. 

221 Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend ? 

222 They descend on every sinful, false one. 

223 They listen eagerly, but most of them are liars. 

224 As for poets, the erring follow them. 

225 Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley, 

226 And how they say that which they do not ? 

227 Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned!
