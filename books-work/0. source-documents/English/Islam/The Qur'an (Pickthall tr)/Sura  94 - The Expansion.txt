94. al-Inshirah: The Expansion

1 Have We not caused thy bosom to dilate, 

2 And eased thee of the burden 

3 Which weighed down thy back; 

4 And exalted thy fame ? 

5 But lo! with hardship goeth ease, 

6 Lo! with hardship goeth ease; 

7 So when thou art relieved, still toil 

8 And strive to please thy Lord.
