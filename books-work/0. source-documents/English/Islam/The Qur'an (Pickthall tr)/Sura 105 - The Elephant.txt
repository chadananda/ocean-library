105. al-Fil: The Elephant

1 Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant ? 

2 Did He not bring their stratagem to naught, 

3 And send against them swarms of flying creatures, 

4 Which pelted them with stones of baked clay, 

5 And made them like green crops devoured (by cattle) ?
