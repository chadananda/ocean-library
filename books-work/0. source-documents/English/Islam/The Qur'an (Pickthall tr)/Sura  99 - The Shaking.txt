99. al-Zilzal: The Shaking

1 When Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake 

2 And Earth yieldeth up her burdens, 

3 And man saith: What aileth her ? 

4 That day she will relate her chronicles, 

5 Because thy Lord inspireth her. 

6 That day mankind will issue forth in scattered groups to be shown their deeds. 

7 And whoso doeth good an atom's weight will see it then, 

8 And whoso doeth ill an atom's weight will see it then.
