95. at-Tin: The Fig

1 By the fig and the olive, 

2 By Mount Sinai, 

3 And by this land made safe; 

4 Surely We created man of the best stature 

5 Then we reduced him to the lowest of the low, 

6 Save those who believe and do good works, and theirs is a reward unfailing. 

7 So who henceforth will give the lie to thee about the judgment ? 

8 Is not Allah the most conclusive of all judges ?
