104. al-Humazah: The Slanderer

1 Woe unto every slandering traducer, 

2 Who hath gathered wealth (of this world) and arranged it. 

3 He thinketh that his wealth will render him immortal. 

4 Nay, but verily he will be flung to the Consuming One. 

5 Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Consuming One is! 

6 (It is) the fire of Allah, kindled, 

7 Which leapeth up over the hearts (of men). 

8 Lo! it is closed in on them 

9 In outstretched columns.
