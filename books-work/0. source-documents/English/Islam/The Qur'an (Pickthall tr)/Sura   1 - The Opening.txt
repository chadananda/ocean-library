THE MEANING OF THE GLORIOUS QURAN
by Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall

1. al-Fatihah: The Opening

1 In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

2 Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, 

3 The Beneficent, the Merciful. 

4 Master of the Day of Judgment, 

5 Thee (alone) we worship; Thee (alone) we ask for help. 

6 Show us the straight path, 

7 The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not the (path) of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray.
