97. al-qadr: The Majesty

1 Lo! We revealed it on the Night of Predestination. 

2 Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Night of Power is! 

3 The Night of Power is better than a thousand months. 

4 The angels and the Spirit descend therein, by the permission of their Lord, with all decrees. 

5 (The night is) Peace until the rising of the dawn.
