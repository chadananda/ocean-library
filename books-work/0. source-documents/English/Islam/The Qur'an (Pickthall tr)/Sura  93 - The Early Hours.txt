93. ad-Duha: The Early Hours

1 By the morning hours 

2 And by the night when it is stillest, 

3 Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee nor doth He hate thee, 

4 And verily the latter portion will be better for thee than the former, 

5 And verily thy Lord will give unto thee so that thou wilt be content. 

6 Did He not find thee an orphan and protect (thee) ? 

7 Did He not find thee wandering and direct (thee) ? 

8 Did He not find thee destitute and enrich (thee) ? 

9 Therefor the orphan oppress not, 

10 Therefor the beggar drive not away, 

11 Therefor of the bounty of thy Lord be thy discourse.
