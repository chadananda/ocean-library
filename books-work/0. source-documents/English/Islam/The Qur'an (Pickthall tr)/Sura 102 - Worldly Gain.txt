1 Rivalry in worldly increase distracteth you 

2 Until ye come to the graves. 

3 Nay, but ye will come to know! 

4 Nay, but ye will come to know! 

5 Nay, would that ye knew (now) with a sure knowledge! 

6 For ye will behold hell-fire. 

7 Aye, ye will behold it with sure vision. 

8 Then, on that day, ye will be asked concerning pleasure.
