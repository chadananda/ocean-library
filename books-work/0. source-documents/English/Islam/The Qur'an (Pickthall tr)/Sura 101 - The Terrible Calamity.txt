101. al-Qari`ah: The Terrible Calamity

1 The Calamity! 

2 What is the Calamity ? 

3 Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Calamity is! 

4 A day wherein mankind will be as thickly-scattered moths 

5 And the mountains will become as carded wool. 

6 Then, as for him whose scales are heavy (with good works), 

7 He will live a pleasant life. 

8 But as for him whose scales are light, 

9 A bereft and Hungry One will be his mother, 

10 Ah, what will convey unto thee what she is! - 

11 Raging Fire.
