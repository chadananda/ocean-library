107. al-Ma`un: The Daily Necessaries

1 Hast thou observed him who belieth religion ? 

2 That is he who repelleth the orphan, 

3 And urgeth not the feeding of the needy. 

4 Ah, woe unto worshippers 

5 Who are heedless of their prayer; 

6 Who would be seen (at worship) 

7 Yet refuse small kindnesses!
