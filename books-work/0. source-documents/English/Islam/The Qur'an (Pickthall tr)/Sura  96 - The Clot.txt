96. al-`Alaq: The Clot

1 Read: In the name of thy Lord Who createth, 

2 Createth man from a clot. 

3 Read: And thy Lord is the Most Bounteous, 

4 Who teacheth by the pen, 

5 Teacheth man that which he knew not. 

6 Nay, but verily man is rebellious 

7 That he thinketh himself independent! 

8 Lo! unto thy Lord is the return. 

9 Hast thou seen him who dissuadeth 

10 A slave when he prayeth ? 

11 Hast thou seen if he relieth on the guidance (of Allah) 

12 Or enjoineth piety ? 

13 Hast thou seen if he denieth (Allah's guidance) and is froward ? 

14 Is he then unaware that Allah seeth ? 

15 Nay, but if he cease not We will seize him by the forelock - 

16 The lying, sinful forelock - 

17 Then let him call upon his henchmen! 

18 We will call the guards of hell. 

19 Nay, Obey not thou him. But prostrate thyself, and draw near (unto Allah).
