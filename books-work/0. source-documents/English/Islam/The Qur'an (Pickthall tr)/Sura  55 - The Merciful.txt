55. ar-Rahman: The Merciful

1 The Beneficent 

2 Hath made known the Qur'an. 

3 He hath created man. 

4 He hath taught him utterance. 

5 The sun and the moon are made punctual. 

6 The stars and the trees adore. 

7 And the sky He hath uplifted; and He hath set the measure, 

8 That ye exceed not the measure, 

9 But observe the measure strictly, nor fall short thereof. 

10 And the earth hath He appointed for (His) creatures, 

11 Wherein are fruit and sheathed palm-trees, 

12 Husked grain and scented herb. 

13 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

14 He created man of clay like the potter's, 

15 And the jinn did He create of smokeless fire. 

16 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

17 Lord of the two Easts, and Lord of the two Wests! 

18 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

19 He hath loosed the two seas. They meet. 

20 There is a barrier between them. They encroach not (one upon the other). 

21 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

22 There cometh forth from both of them the pearl and coral-stone. 

23 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

24 His are the ships displayed upon the sea, like banners. 

25 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

26 Everyone that is thereon will pass away; 

27 There remaineth but the Countenance of thy Lord of Might and Glory. 

28 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

29 All that are in the heavens and the earth entreat Him. Every day He exerciseth (universal) power. 

30 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

31 We shall dispose of you, O ye two dependents (man and jinn). 

32 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

33 O company of jinn and men, if ye have power to penetrate (all) regions of the heavens and the earth, then penetrate (them)! Ye will never penetrate them save with (Our) sanction. 

34 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

35 There will be sent, against you both, heat of fire and flash of brass, and ye will not escape. 

36 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

37 And when the heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red hide - 

38 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? - 

39 On that day neither man nor jinni will be questioned of his sin. 

40 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

41 The guilty will be known by their marks, and will be taken by the forelocks and the feet. 

42 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

43 This is hell which the guilty deny. 

44 They go circling round between it and fierce, boiling water. 

45 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

46 But for him who feareth the standing before his Lord there are two gardens. 

47 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

48 Of spreading branches. 

49 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

50 Wherein are two fountains flowing. 

51 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

52 Wherein is every kind of fruit in pairs. 

53 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

54 Reclining upon couches lined with silk brocade, the fruit of both the gardens near to hand. 

55 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

56 Therein are those of modest gaze, whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them. 

57 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

58 (In beauty) like the jacynth and the coral-stone. 

59 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

60 Is the reward of goodness aught save goodness ? 

61 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

62 And beside them are two other gardens, 

63 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

64 Dark green with foliage. 

65 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

66 Wherein are two abundant springs. 

67 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

68 Wherein is fruit, the date-palm and pomegranate. 

69 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

70 Wherein (are found) the good and beautiful - 

71 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? - 

72 Fair ones, close-guarded in pavilions - 

73 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? - 

74 Whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them - 

75 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

76 Reclining on green cushions and fair carpets. 

77 Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny ? 

78 Blessed be the name of thy Lord, Mighty and glorious!
