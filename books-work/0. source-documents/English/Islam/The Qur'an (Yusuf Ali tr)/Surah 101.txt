Surah 101

Al Qari'ah (The Great Calamity)


In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1.  The (Day) of Noise and Clamor:

2.  What is the (Day) of Noise and Clamor?

3.  And what will explain to thee what the (Day) of Noise and Clamor is?

4.  (It is) a Day whereon Men will be like moths Scattered about,

5.  And the mountains will be like carded wool.

6.  Then, he whose balance (of good deeds) will be (found) heavy,

7.  Will be in a life of good pleasure and satisfaction.

8.  But he whose balance (of good deeds) will be (found) light--

9.  Will have his home in a (bottomless) pit.

10.  And what will explain to thee what this is?

11.  (It is) a Fire Blazing fiercely!
