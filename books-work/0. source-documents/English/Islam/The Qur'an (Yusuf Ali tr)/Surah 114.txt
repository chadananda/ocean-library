Surah 114

Al Nas (Mankind)


In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1.  Say: I seek refuge with the Lord and Cherisher of Mankind,

2.  The King (or Ruler) of Mankind,

3.  The Allah (or Judge) of Mankind--

4.  From the mischief of the Whisperer (of Evil), who withdraws (after his whisper)--

5.  (The same) who whispers into the hearts of mankind--

6.  Among Jinns and among Men._
