Surah 111

Al Masad (The Plaited Rope) -or- Al Lahab (The Flame)


In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1.  Perish the hands of the Father of Flame!  Perish he!

2.  No profit to him from all his wealth, and all his gains!

3.  Burnt soon will he be in a Fire of blazing Flame!

4.  His wife shall carry the (crackling) wood--as fuel!--

5.  A twisted rope of palm-leaf fibre round her (own) neck!
