Surah 109

Al Kafirun (Those Who Reject Faith)


In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1.  Say: O ye that reject Faith!

2.  I worship not that which ye worship,

3.  Nor will ye worship that which I worship.

4.  And I will not worship that which ye have been wont to worship,

5.  Nor will ye worship that which I worship.

6.  To you be your Way, and to me mine.
