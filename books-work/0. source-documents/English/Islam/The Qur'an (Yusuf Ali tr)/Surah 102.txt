Surah 102

Al Takathur (The Piling Up)


In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1.  The mutual rivalry for piling up (the good things of this world) diverts you (from the more serious things),

2.  Until ye visit the graves.

3.  But nay, ye soon shall know (the reality).

4.  Again,, ye soon shall know!

5.  Nay, were ye to know with certainty of mind, (Ye would beware!)

6.  Ye shall certainly see Hellfire!

7.  Again, ye shall see it with certainty of sight!

8.  Then, shall ye be Questioned that Day about the joy (ye indulged in)!
