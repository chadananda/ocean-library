Surah 105

Al Fil (The Elephant)


In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1.  Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the Companions of the Elephant?

2.  Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray?

3.  And He sent against them flights of Birds,

4.  Striking them with stones of baked clay.

5.  Then did He make them like an empty field of stalks and straw, (of which the corn) has been eaten up.
