Surah 94

Al Sharh -or- Al Inshirah (The Expansion of the Breast)


In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1.  Have We not expanded thee thy breast?--

2.  And removed from thee thy burden

3.  The which did gall thy back?--

4.  And raised high the esteem (in which) thou (art held)?--

5.  So, verily, with every difficulty, there is relief:

6.  Verily, with every difficulty there is relief.

7.  Therefore, when thou art free (from thine immediate task), still labor hard,

8.  And to thy Lord turn (all) thy attention.
