Surah 97

Al Qadr (The Night of Power or Honour)


In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1.  We have indeed revealed this (Message) in the night of Power:

2.  And what will explain to thee what the Night of Power is?

3.  The Night of Power is better than a thousand Months.

4.  Therein come down the angels and the Spirit by Allah's permission, on every errand:

5.  Peace!..This until the rise of Morn!
