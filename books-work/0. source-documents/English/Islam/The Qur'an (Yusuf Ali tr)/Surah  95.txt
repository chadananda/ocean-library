Surah 95

Al Tin (The Fig)


In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1.  By the Fig and the Olive,

2.  And the Mount of Sinai,

3.  And this City of security--

4.  We have indeed created man in the best of molds,

5.  Then do We abase him (to be) the lowest of the low--

6.  Except such as believe and do righteous deeds: for they shall have a reward unfailing.

7.  Then what can, after this, contradict thee; as to the Judgment (to come)?

8.  Is not Allah the wisest of Judges?
