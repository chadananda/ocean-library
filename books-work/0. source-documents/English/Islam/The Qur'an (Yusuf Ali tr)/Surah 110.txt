Surah 110

Al Nasr (The Help)


In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1.  When comes the Help of Allah, and Victory,

2.  And thou dost see the People enter Allah's Religion in crowds,

3.  Celebrate the Praises of thy Lord, and pray for His Forgiveness: for He is Oft-Returning (in Grace and Mercy).
