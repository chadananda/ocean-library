Surah 113

Al Falaq (The Daybreak)


In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

1.  Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn,

2.  From the mischief of created things;

3.  From the mischief of Darkness as it overspreads;

4.  From the mischief of those who practice Secret Arts;

5.  And from the mischief of the envious one as he practices envy.
