THE CHAPTER OF THE CONGREGATION
(LXII. Medinah.)
IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God. What is in the heavens and what is in the earth celebrates the praises of God the King, the holy, the mighty, the wise! He it is who sent unto the Gentiles a prophet amongst themselves to recite to them His signs and to purify them, and to teach them the Book and the wisdom, although they were before in obvious error. And others of them have not yet overtaken them; but He is the mighty, the wise!
That is God's grace, He gives it to whomsoever He will; for God is Lord of mighty grace.
The likeness of those who were charged with the law and then bore it not is as the likeness of an ass bearing books: sorry is the likeness of the people who say God's signs are lies! but God guides not an unjust people.
Say, 'O ye who are Jews! if ye pretend that ye are the clients of God, beyond other people; then wish for death if ye do speak the truth!'
But they never wish for it, through what their hands have sent before! but God knows the unjust.
Say, 'Verily, the death from which ye flee will surely meet you; then shall ye be sent back to Him who knows the unseen and the visible, and He will inform you of that which ye have done!' O ye who believe! when the call to prayer is made upon the Congregation Day, then hasten to the remembrance of God, and leave off traffic; that is better for you, if ye did but know! And when prayer is performed, then disperse abroad in the land, and crave of God's grace; and remember God much; haply ye may prosper! But when they see merchandise or sport they flock to it and leave thee standing! Say, 'What is with God is better than sport and than merchandise, for God is the best of providers!'
