THE CHAPTER OF ABU LAHEB
(CXI. Mecca.)
IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.
Abu Laheb's two hands shall perish, and he shall perish!
His wealth shall not avail him, nor what he has earned! He shall broil in a fire that flames, and his wife carrying faggots!- on her neck a cord of palm fibres.
