THE CHAPTER OF THE FIG
(XCV. Place of origin doubtful.)
IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.
By the fig!
And by the olive!
And by Mount Sinai!
And by this safe land!
We have indeed created man in the best of symmetry. Then we will send him back the lowest of the low; save those who believe and act aright; for theirs is a hire that is not grudged.
But what shall make thee call the judgment after this a lie?
Is not God a most just of judges?
