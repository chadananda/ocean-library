THE CHAPTER OF THE SUN
(XCI. Mecca.)
IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.
By the sun and its noonday brightness!
And the moon when it follows him!
And the day when it displays him!
And the night when it covers him!
And the heaven and what built it!
And the earth and what spread it!
And the soul and what fashioned it, and taught it
its sin and its piety!
Prosperous is he who purifies it!
And disappointed is he who corrupts it!
Thamud called the apostle a liar in their outrage, when their wretch rose up and the apostle of God said to them, 'God's she-camel! so give her to drink.'
But they called him a liar, and they ham-strung her; but their Lord destroyed them in their sins, and served them all alike; and He fears not the result thereof!
