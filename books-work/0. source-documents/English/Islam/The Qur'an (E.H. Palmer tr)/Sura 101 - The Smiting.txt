THE CHAPTER OF THE SMITING
(CI. Mecca.)
IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.
The smiting!
What is the smiting?
And what shall make thee know what the smiting is? The day when men shall be like scattered moths; and the mountains shall be like flocks of carded wool!
And as for him whose balance is heavy, he shall be in a well-pleasing life.
But as for him whose balance is light, his dwelling shall be the pit of hell.
And who shall make thee know what it is?- a burning fire!
