THE CHAPTER OF THE BACKBITER
(CIV. Mecca.)
IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God. Woe to every slanderous backbiter, who collects wealth and counts it.
He thinks that his wealth can immortalize him.
Not so! he shall be hurled into El'Hutamah!
And what shall make thee understand what El'Hutamah is?- the fire of God kindled; which rises above the hearts. Verily, it is an archway over them on long-drawn columns.
