THE CHAPTER OF POWER
(XCVII. Place of origin doubtful.)
IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.
Verily, we sent it down on the Night of Power! And what shall make thee know what the Night of Power is?- the Night of Power is better than a thousand months!
The angels and the Spirit descend therein, by the permission of their Lord with every bidding.
Peace it is until rising of the dawn!
