THE CHAPTER OF THE EARTHQUAKE
(XCIX. Place of origin doubtful.)
IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.
When the earth shall quake with its quaking! And the earth shall bring forth her burdens, and man shall say, 'What ails her!'
On that day she shall tell her tidings, because thy Lord inspires her.
On the day when men shall come up in separate bands to show their works: and he who does the weight of an atom of good shall see it! and he who does the weight of an atom of evil shall see it!
