THE CHAPTER OF THOSE WHO GIVE SHORT WEIGHT
(LXXXIII. Mecca.)
IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God. Woe to those who give short weight! who when they measure against others take full measure; but when they measure to them or weigh to them, diminish!
Do not these think that they shall be raised again at the mighty day? the day when men shall stand before the Lord of the worlds! Nay, verily, the book of the wicked is in Siggin; and what shall make thee know what Siggin is a book inscribed! Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie! Who call the judgment day a lie! but none shall call it a lie except every sinful transgressor, who, when our signs are read to him, says, 'Old folks' tales!'
Nay, but that which they have gained has settled upon their hearts. Nay, verily, from their Lord on that day are they veiled; and then, verily, they shall broil in hell; then it shall be said, 'This is what ye once did call a lie!'
Nay, verily, the book of the righteous is in 'Illiyun; and what shall make thee know what 'Illiyun is? book inscribed! those nigh to God shall witness it.
Verily, the righteous shall be in pleasure; upon couches shall they gaze; thou mayest recognise in their faces the brightness of pleasure; they shall be given to drink wine that is sealed, whose seal is musk; for that then let the aspirants aspire!-and it shall be tempered with Tasnim,-a spring from which those nigh to God shall drink.
Verily, those who sin do laugh at those who believe; and when they pass by they wink at one another, and when they return to their family they return ridiculing them; and when they see them they say, 'Verily, these do go astray!'-but they are not sent as guardians over them! But to-day those who believe shall at the misbelievers laugh! Upon couches shall they gaze; are the misbelievers rewarded for what they have done?
