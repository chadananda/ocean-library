THE CHAPTER OF THE CHARGERS
(C. Mecca.)
IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.
By the snorting chargers!
And those who strike fire with their hoofs!
And those who make incursions in the morning, And raise up dust therein, And cleave through a host therein!
Verily, man is to his Lord ungrateful; and, verily, he is a witness of that.
Verily, he is keen in his love of good.
Does he not know when the tombs are exposed, and what is in the breasts is brought to light?
Verily, thy Lord upon that day indeed is well aware.
