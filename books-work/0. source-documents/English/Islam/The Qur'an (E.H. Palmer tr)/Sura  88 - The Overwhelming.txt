THE CHAPTER OF THE OVERWHELMING
(LXXXVIII. Mecca.)
IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.
Has there come to thee the story of the overwhelming? Faces on that day shall be humble, labouring, toiling,- shall broil upon a burning fire; shall be given to drink from a boiling spring! no food shall they have save from the foul thorn, which shall not fatten nor avail against hunger!
Faces on that day shall be comfortable, content with their past endeavours,-in a lofty garden wherein they shall hear no foolish word; wherein is a flowing fountain; wherein are couches raised on high, and goblets set down, and cushions arranged, and carpets spread! Do they not look then at the camel how she is created?
And at the heaven how it is reared?
And at the mountains how they are set up?
And at the earth how it is spread out?
But remind: thou art only one to remind; thou art not in authority over them; except such as turns his back and misbelieves, for him will God torment with the greatest torment.
Verily, unto us is their return, and, verily, for us is their account!
