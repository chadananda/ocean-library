FARGARD 1.
----------
Sixteen perfect lands created by Ahura Mazda, and as many
plagues created by Angra Mainyu. 

1.
  Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathushtra, saying: I have
made every land dear (to its people), even though it had no charms
whatever in it: had I not made every land dear (to its people),
even though it had no charms whatever in it, then the whole living
world would have invaded the Airyana Vaeja.
2.
  [Clause 2 in the Vendidad Sada is composed of Zend quotations
in the Commentary that illustrate the alternative process of creation:
'First, Ahura Mazda would create a land of such kind that its
dwellers might like it, and there could be nothing more delightful.
Then he who is all death would bring against it a counter-creation.']
  
The first of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda,
created, was the Airyana Vaeja, by the Vanguhi Daitya.
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
the serpent in the river and Winter, a work of the Daevas.
3.
  There are ten winter months there, two summer months; and
those are cold for the waters, cold for the earth, cold for the
trees. Winter falls there, the worst of all plagues.
4.
  The second of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was the plain [Doubtful] which the Sughdhas inhabit.
  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
the locust, which brings death unto cattle and plants.
5.
  The third of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda,
created, was the strong, holy Mouru.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
plunder and sin [Doubtful].
6.
  The fourth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was the beautiful Bakhdhi with high-lifted banner.
  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
the ants and the ant-hills.
7.
  The fifth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda,
created, was Nisaya, that lies between the Mouru and Bakhdhi.
  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
the sin of unbelief.
8.
  The sixth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda,
created, was the house-deserting Haroyu.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
tears and wailing.
9.
  The seventh of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was Vaekereta, of the evil shadows.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
the Pairika Knathaiti, who claves unto Keresaspa.
10.
  The eighth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was Urva of the rich pastures.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
the sin of pride.
11.
  The ninth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda,
created, was Khnenta which the Vehrkanas inhabit.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
a sin for which there is no atonement, the unnatural sin.
12.
  The tenth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda,
created, was the beautiful Harahvaiti.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
a sin for which there is no atonement, the burying of the dead.
13.
  The eleventh of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was the bright, glorious Haetumant.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
the evil work of witchcraft.
14.
  And this is the sign by which it is known, this is that by
which it is seen at once: wheresoever they may go and raise a
cry of sorcery, there the worst works of witchcraft go forth.
From there they come to kill and strike at heart, and they bring
locusts as many as they want.
15.
  The twelfth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was Ragha of the three races.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
the sin of utter unbelief.
16.
  The thirteenth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was the strong, holy Chakhra.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
a sin for which there is no atonement, the cooking of corpses.
17.
  The fourteenth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was the four-cornered Varena, for which was born
Thraetaona, who smote Azi Dahaka.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
abnormal issues in women, and barbarian oppression.
18.
  The fifteenth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was the Seven Rivers.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
abnormal issues in women, and excessive heat.
19.
  The sixteenth of the good lands and countries which I, Ahura
Mazda, created, was the land by the sources (?) of the Rangha,
where people live who have no chiefs.  
Thereupon came Angra Mainyu, who is all death, and he counter-created
Winter, a work of the Daevas.
20.
  There are still other lands and countries, beautiful and deep,
longing and asking for the good, and bright.

Myths of Yima 

1.
  Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Who was the
first mortal, before myself, Zarathushtra, with whom thou, Ahura
Mazda, didst converse, whom thou didst teach the Religion of Ahura,
the Religion of Zarathushtra? 2. Ahura Mazda answered: The fair
Yima, the good shepherd, O holy Zarathushtra! he was the first
mortal, before thee, Zarathushtra, with whom I, Ahura Mazda, did
converse, whom I taught the Religion of Ahura, the Religion of
Zarathushtra. 3. Unto him, O Zarathushtra, I, Ahura Mazda, spake,
saying: 'Well, fair Yima, son of Vivanghat, be thou the preacher
and the bearer of my Religion!' And the fair Yima, O Zarathushtra,
replied unto me, saying: 'I was not born, I was not taught to
be the preacher and the bearer of thy Religion.'
4.
  Then I, Ahura Mazda, said thus unto him, O Zarathushtra: 'Since
thou dost not consent to be the preacher and the bearer of my
Religion, then make thou my world increase, make my world grow:
consent thou to nourish, to rule, and to watch over my world.'
5.
  And the fair Yima replied unto me, O Zarathushtra, saying:
'Yes! I will make thy world increase, I will make thy world grow.
Yes! I will nourish, and rule, and watch over thy world. There
shall be, while I am king, neither cold wind not hot wind, neither
disease nor death.'
6.
  []Vd2.6 is composed of unconnected Zend quotations,
which are no part of the text and are introduced by the commentator
for the purpose of showing that 'although Yima did not teach the
law and train pupils, he was nevertheless a faithful and a holy
man, and rendered men holy too (?).' See Fragments of the Vendidad.
  
Then I, Ahura Mazda, brought two implements unto him: a golden
seal and a poniard inlaid with gold. Behold, here Yima bears the
royal sway!
7.
  [Obscure.]
8.
  Thus, under the sway of Yima, three hundred winters passed
away, and the earth was replenished with flocks and herds, with
men and dogs and birds and with red blazing fires, and there was
room no more for flocks, herds, and men.
9.
  Then I warned the fair Yima, saying: 'O fair Yima, son of
Vivanghat, the earth has become full of flocks and herds, of men
and dogs and birds and of red blazing fires, and there is room
no more for flocks, herds, and men.'
10.
  Then Yima stepped forward, in light, southwards, on the way
of the sun, and (afterwards) he pressed the earth with the golden
seal, and bored it with the poniard, speaking thus: 'O Spenta
Armaiti, kindly'Do this out of kindness to the creatures'
(Comm.) open asunder and stretch thyself afar, to
bear flocks and herds and men.'
11.
  And Yima made the earth grow larger by one-third than it was
before, and there came flocks and herds and men, at their will
and wish, as many as he wished.
12.
  Thus, under the sway of Yima, six hundred winters passed away,
and the earth was replenished with flocks and herds, with men
and dogs and birds and with red blazing fires, and there was room
no more for flocks, herds, and men.
13.
  And I warned the fair Yima, saying: 'O fair Yima, son of Vivanghat,
the earth has become full of flocks and herds, of men and dogs
and birds and of red blazing fires, and there is room no more
for flocks, herds, and men.'
14.
  Then Yima stepped forward, in light, southwards, on the way
of the sun, and (afterwards) he pressed the earth with the golden
seal, and bored it with the poniard, speaking thus: 'O Spenta
Armaiti, kindly) open asunder and stretch thyself afar, to bear
flocks and herds and men.'
15.
  And Yima made the earth grow larger by two-thirds than it
was before, and there came flocks and herds and men, at their
will and wish, as many as he wished.
16.
  Thus, under the sway of Yima, nine hundred winters passed
away, and the earth was replenished with flocks and herds, with
men and dogs and birds and with red blazing fires, and there was
room no more for flocks, herds, and men.
17.
  And I warned the fair Yima, saying: 'O fair Yima, son of Vivanghat,
the earth has become full of flocks and herds, of men and dogs
and birds and of red blazing fires, and there is room no more
for flocks, herds, and men.'
18.
  Then Yima stepped forward, in light, southwards, on the way
of the sun, and (afterwards) he pressed the earth with the golden
seal, and bored it with the poniard, speaking thus: 'O Spenta
Armaiti, kindly) open asunder and stretch thyself afar, to bear
flocks and herds and men.'
19.
  And Yima made the earth grow larger by two-thirds than it
was before, and there came flocks and herds and men, at their
will and wish, as many as he wished.
20.
  The Maker, Ahura Mazda, called together a meeting of the celestial
Yazatas in the Airyana Vaejo of high renown, by the Vanguhi Dairya.
  
The fair Yima, the good shepherd, called together a meeting of
the best of the mortals, in the Airyana Vaejo of high renown,
by the Vanguhi Daitya.
21.
  To that meeting came Ahura Mazda, in the Airyana Vaejo of
high renown, by the Vanguhi Daitya; he came together with the
celestial Yazatas.  
To that meeting came the fair Yima, the good shepherd, in the
Airyana Vaejo of high renown, by the Vanguhi Daitya; he came together
with the best of the mortals.
22.
  And Ahura Mazda spake unto Yima, saying: 'O fair Yima, son
of Vivanghat! Upon the material world the evil winters are about
to fall, that shall bring the fierce, deadly frost; upon the material
world the evil winters are about to fall, that shall make snow-flakes
fall thick, even an aredvi deep on the highest tops of mountains'Even
where it (the snow) is least, it will be one Vitasti two fingers
deep' (Comm.); that is, fourteen fingers deep.
23.
  'And the beasts that live in the wildernessThe
Comm. has, strangely enough, 'for instance, Ispahan.',
and those that live on the tops of the mountains'For
instance, Aparsen (the Upairisaena or Hindu-Kush).',
and those that live in the bosom of the dale'For
instance, Khorastan (the plain of Khorasan).' shall
take shelter in underground abodes.
24.
  'Before that winter, the country would bear plenty of grass
for cattle, before the waters had flooded it. Now after the melting
of the snow, O Yima, a place wherein the footprint of a sheep
may be seen will be a wonder in the world.
25.
  'Therefore make thee a Vara, long as a riding-ground on every
side of the square'Two hathras long on every side'
(Comm.) A hathra is about an English mile., and
thither bring the seeds of sheep and oxen, of men, of dogs, of
birds, and of red blazing fires. Therefore make thee a Vara, long
as a riding-ground on every side of the square, to be an abode
for man; a Vara, long as a riding-ground on every side of the
square, for oxen and sheep.
26.
  'There thou shalt make waters flow in a bed a hathra long;
there thou shalt settle birds, on the green that never fades,
with food that never fails. There thou shalt establish dwelling-places,
consisting of a house with a balcony, a courtyard, and as galleryThe
last three words are of doubtful meaning..
27.
  'Thither thou shalt bring the seeds of men and women, of the
greatest, best, and finest on this earth; thither thou shalt bring
the seeds of every kind of cattle, of the greatest, best, and
finest on this earth.
28.
  'Thither thou shalt bring the seeds of every kind of tree,
of the highest of size and sweetest of odor on this earth'The
highest of size, like the cypress and the plane-tree; the sweetest
of odor, like the rose and the jessamine' (Comm.);
thither thou shalt bring the seeds of every kind of fruit, the
best of savor and sweetest of odor'The best of savor,
like the date; the sweetest of odor, like the citron' (Comm.).
All those seeds shalt thou bring, two of every kind, to be kept
inexhaustible there, so long as those men shall stay in the Vara.
29. 'There shall be no humpbacked, none bulged forward there;
no impotent, no lunatic; no malicious, no liar; no one spiteful,
none jealous; no one with decayed tooth, no leprous to be pent
up, nor any of the brands wherewith Angra Mainyu stamps the bodies
of mortals.
30.
  'In the largest part of the place thou shalt make nine streets,
six in the middle part, three in the smallest. To the streets
of the largest part thou shalt bring a thousand seeds of men and
women; to the streets of the middle part, six hundred; to the
streets of the smallest part, three hundred. That Vara thou shalt
seal up with thy golden seal, and thou shalt make a door, and
a window self-shining within.'
31.
  Then Yima said within himself: 'How shall I manage to make
that Vara which Ahura Mazda has commanded me to make?' And Ahura
Mazda said unto Yima: 'O fair Yima, son of Vivanghat! Crush the
earth with a stamp of thy heel, and then knead it with thy hands,
as the potter does when kneading the potter's clay.'
32.
  [And Yima did as Ahura Mazda wished; he crushed the earth
with a stamp of his heel, he kneaded it with his hands, as the
potter does when kneading the potter's clayFrom the
Vendidad Sada..]
33.
  And Yima made a Vara, long as a riding-ground on every side
of the square. There he brought the seeds of sheep and oxen, of
men, of dogs, of birds, and of red blazing fires. He made a Vara,
long as a riding-ground on every side of the square, to be an
abode for men; a Vara, long as a riding-ground on every side of
the square, for oxen and sheep.
34.
  There he made waters flow in a bed a hathra long; there he
settled birds, on the green that never fades, with food that never
fails. There he established dwelling-places, consisting of a house
with a balcony, a courtyard, and a gallery.
35.
  There he brought the seeds of men and women, of the greatest,
best, and finest on this earth; there he brought the seeds of
every kind of cattle, of the greatest, best, and finest on this
earth.
36.
  There he brought the seeds of every kind of tree, of the highest
of size and sweetest of odor on this earth; there he brought the
seeds of every kind of fruit, the best of savor and sweetest of
odor. All those seeds he brought, two of every kind, to be kept
inexhaustible there, so long as those men shall stay in the Vara.
37.
  And there were no humpbacked, none bulged forward there; no
impotent, no lunatic; no one malicious, no liar; no one spiteful,
none jealous; no one with decayed tooth, no leprous to be pent
up, nor any of the brands wherewith Angra Mainyu stamps the bodies
of mortals.
38.
  In the largest part of the place he made nine streets, six
in the middle part, three in the smallest. To the streets of the
largest part he brought a thousand seeds of men and women; to
the streets of the middle part, six hundred; to the streets of
the smallest part, three hundred. That Vara he sealed up with
the golden ring, and he made a door, and a window self-shining
within.
39.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! What are the
lights that give light in the Vara which Yima made?
40.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'There are uncreated lights and created
lightsThe Commentary has here the following Avestan
quotation: 'The uncreated light shines from above; all the created
lights shine from below.'. The one thing missed
there is the sight of the stars, the moon, and the sun, and a
year seems only as a day.
41.
  'Every fortieth year, to every couple two are born, a male
and a female. And thus it is for every sort of cattle. And the
men in the Vara which Yima made live the happiest life'They
live there for 150 years; some say, they never die' (Comm.).'
42.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Who is he who
brought the Religion of Mazda into the Vara which Yima made? Ahura
Mazda answered: 'It was the bird Karshipta, O holy Zarathushtra!'
43.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Who are the
Lord and the Master there? Ahura Mazda answered: 'Urvatat-nara,
O Zarathushtra! and thyself, Zarathushtra.'


FARGARD 3.
----------

The Earth 

1.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Which is the
first place where the Earth feels most happy? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is the place whereon one of the faithful steps forward, O
Spitama Zarathushtra! with the log in his hand, the Baresma in
his hand, the milk in his hand, the mortar in his hand, lifting
up his voice in good accord with religion, and beseeching Mithra,
the lord of the rolling country-side, and Rama Hvastra.'
2,3.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Which is the
second place where the Earth feels most happy? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is the place whereon one of the faithful erects a house with
a priest within, with cattle, with a wife, with children, and
good herds within; and wherein afterwards the cattle continue
to thrive, virtue to thrive, fodder to thrive, the dog to thrive,
the wife to thrive, the child to thrive, the fire to thrive, and
every blessing of life to thrive.'
4.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Which is the
third place where the Earth feels most happy? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is the place where one of the faithful sows most corn, grass,
and fruit, O Spitama Zarathushtra! where he waters ground that
is dry, or drains ground that is too wet.'
5.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Which is the
fourth place where the Earth feels most happy? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is the place where there is most increase of flocks and herds.'
6.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Which is the
fifth place where the Earth feels most happy? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is the place where flocks and herds yield most dung.'
7.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Which is the
first place where the Earth feels sorest grief? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is the neck of Arezura, whereon the hosts of fiends rush forth
from the burrow of the Druj.'
8.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Which is the
second place where the Earth feels sorest grief? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is the place wherein most corpses of dogs and of men lie buried.'
9.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Which is the
third place where the Earth feels sorest grief? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is the place whereon stand most of those Dakhmas on which
the corpses of men are deposited.'
10.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Which is the
fourth place where the Earth feels sorest grief? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is the place wherein are most burrows of the creatures of
Angra Mainyu'Where there are most Khrafstras' (noxious
animals)..
11.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Which is the
fifth place where the Earth feels sorest grief? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is the place whereon the wife and children of one of the faithful,
O Spitama Zarathushtra! are driven along the way of captivity,
the dry, the dusty way, and lift up a voice of wailing.'
12.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Who is the first
that rejoices the Earth with greatest joy? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is he who digs out of it most corpses of dogs and men.' 
13.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Who is the second
that rejoices the Earth with greatest joy? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is he who pulls down most of those Dakhmas on which the corpses
of men are deposited.'  
-----------------------------------------------------
14.
  Let no man alone by himself carry a corpse. If a man alone
by himself carry a corpse, the Nasu rushes upon him, to defile
him, from the nose of the dead, from the eye, from the tongue,
from the jaws, from the sexual organs, from the hinder parts.
This Druj Nasu falls upon him, [stains him] even to the end of
the nails, and he is unclean, thenceforth, for ever and ever.
15.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! What shall be
the place of that man who has carried a corpse [alone]? Ahura
Mazda answered: 'It shall be the place on this earth wherein is
least water and fewest plants, whereof the ground is the cleanest
and the dryest and the least passed through by flocks and herds,
by the fire of Ahura Mazda, by the consecrated bundles of Baresma,
and by the faithful.'
16.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! How far from
the fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated
bundles of Baresma? How far from the faithful?
17.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Thirty paces from the fire, thirty
paces from the water, thirty paces from the consecrated bundles
of Baresma, three paces from the faithful.
18,19.
  'There, on that place, shall the worshippers of Mazda erect
an enclosure, and therein shall they establish him with food,
therein shall they establish him with clothes, with the coarsest
food and with the most worn-out clothes. That food he shall live
on, those clothes he shall wear, and thus shall they let him live,
until he has grown to the age of a Hana, or of a Zaurura, or of
a Pairishta-khshudra.
20,21.
  'And when he has grown to the age of a Hana, or of a Zaurura,
or of a Pairishta-khshudra, then the worshippers of Mazda shall
order a man strong, vigorous, and skillful'Trained
to operations of that sort' (Comm.), to cut the
head off his neck, in his enclosure on the top of the mountain:
and they shall deliver his corpse unto the greediest of the corpse-eating
creatures made by the beneficent Spirit, unto the vultures, with
these words: "The man here has repented of all his evil thoughts,
words, and deeds. If he has committed any other evil deed, it
is remitted by his repentance: if he has committed no other evil
deed, he is absolved by his repentance, for ever and ever."'
22.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Who is the third
that rejoices the Earth with greatest joy? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is he who fills up most burrows of the creatures of Angra
Mainyu.'
23.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! Who is the fourth
that rejoices the Earth with greatest joy? Ahura Mazda answered:
'It is he who sows most corn, grass, and fruit, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
who waters ground that is dry, or drains ground that is too wet.
24.
  'Unhappy is the land that has long lain unsown with the seed
of the sower and wants a good husbandman, like a well-shapen maiden
who has long gone childless and wants a good husband.
25.
  'He who would till the earth, O Spitama Zarathushtra! with
the left arm and the right, with the right arm and the left, unto
him will she bring forth plenty of fruit: even as it were a lover
sleeping with his bride on her bed; the bride will bring forth
children, (the earth will bring forth) plenty of fruit.
26,27.
  'He who would till the earth, O Spitama Zarathushtra! with
the left arm and the right, with the right arm and the left, unto
him thus says the Earth: "O thou man! who dost till me with
the left arm and the right, with the right arm and the left, here
shall I ever go on bearing, bringing forth all manner of food,
bringing corn first to thee'When something good grows
up, it will grow up for thee first' (Comm.) Perhaps: 'bringing
to thee profusion of corn' ('some say, she will bring to thee
15 for 10;' Comm.)."
28,29.
  'He who does not till the earth, O Spitama Zarathushtra! with
the left arm and the right, with the right arm and the left, unto
him thus says the Earth: "O thou man! who dost not till me
with the left arm and the right, with the right arm and the left,
ever shalt thou stand at the door of the stranger, among those
who beg for bread; the refuse and the crumbs of the bread are
brought unto thee'They take for themselves what is
good and send to thee what is bad' (Comm.), brought
by those who have profusion of wealth."'
30.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! What is the
food that fills the Religion of Mazda [lit: what is the stomach
of the law?]? Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is sowing corn again and
again, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
31.
  'He who sows corn, sows righteousness: he makes the Religion
of Mazda walk, he suckles the Religion of Mazda; as well as he
could do with a hundred man's feet, with a thousand woman's breasts'He
makes the Religion of Mazda as fat as a child could be made by
means of a hundred feet, that is to say, of fifty servants walking
to rock him; of a thousand breasts, that is, of five hundred nurses'

  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! If a man shall
bury in the earth either the corpse of a dog or the corpse of
a man, and if he shall not disinter it within half a year, what

  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy one! If a man shall
bury in the earth either the corpse of a dog or the corpse of
a man, and if he shall not disinter it within the second year,
what is the penalty for it? What is the atonement for it? What
is the cleansing from it?

  Ahura Mazda answered: 'For that deed there is nothing that
can pay, nothing that can atone, nothing that can cleanse from
it; it is a trespass for which there is no atonement, for ever
and ever.'

  When is it so?  
'It is so, if the sinner be a professor of the Religion of Mazda,
or one who has been taught in it.  
'But if he be not a professor of the Religion of Mazda, nor one
who has been taught in it, then his sin is taken from him, if
he makes confession of the Religion of Mazda and resolves never
to commit again such forbidden deeds.
41.
  'The Religion of Mazda indeed, O Spitama Zarathushtra! takes
away from him who makes confession of it the bonds of his sin;
it takes away (the sin of) breach of trustDoubtful.
From the commentary it appears that draosha must have meant a
different sort of robbery: 'He knows that it is forbidden to steal,
but he fancies that robbing the rich to give to the poor is a
pious deed' (Comm.); it takes away (the sin of)
murdering one of the faithful; it takes away (the sin of) deeds
for which there is no atonement; it takes away the worst sin of
usury; it takes away any sin that may be sinned.
42.
  'In the same way the Religion of Mazda, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
cleanses the faithful from every evil thought, word, and deed,
as a swift-rushing mighty wind cleanses the plain'From
chaff' (Comm.).  
'So let all the deeds he doeth be henceforth good, O Zarathushtra!
a full atonement for his sin is effected by means of the Religion
of Mazda.'

  There dies a man in the depths of the vale: a bird takes flight

and it feeds on the corpse of the dead man there: then, up it

it flies to some one of the trees there, of the hard-wooded or

makest them flow back to the sea Puitika?

  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be
a number of men resting in the same place, on the same carpet,

one happens to die; how many of them does the Druj Nasu envelope
with corruption, infection, and pollution?

  Ahura Mazda answered: 'If the dead one be a priest, the Druj
Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathushtra! she goes as far as
the eleventh and defiles the ten.  
'If the dead one be a warrior, the Druj Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama

33.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If it be a weasel,
how many of the creatures of the good spirit does it directly
defile, how many does it indirectly defile?
34.
  Ahura Mazda answered : 'A weasel does neither directly nor
indirectly defile any of the creatures of the good spirit, but
him who smites and kills it; to him the uncleanness clings for
ever and ever.'
35.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If the dead
one be such a wicked, two-footed ruffian, as an ungodly Ashemaogha,
how many of the creatures of the good spirit does he directly
defile, how many does he indirectly defile?
36.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'No more than a frog does whose venom
is dried up, and that has been dead more than a year. Whilst alive,
indeed, O Spitama Zarathushtra! such a wicked, two-legged ruffian
as an ungodly Ashemaogha, directly defiles the creatures of the
good spirit, and indirectly defiles them.
37.
  'Whilst alive he smites the water; whilst alive he blows out
the fire; whilst alive he carries off the cow; whilst alive he
smites the faithful man with a deadly blow, that parts the soul
from the body; not so will he do when dead.
38.
  'Whilst alive, indeed, O Spitama Zarathushtra! such a wicked,
two-legged ruffian as an ungodly Ashemaogha robs the faithful
man of the full possession of his food, of his clothing, of his
wood, of his bed, of his vessels; not so will he do when dead.'

  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! When into our
houses here below we have brought the fire, the Baresma, the cups,
the Haoma, and the mortar, O holy Ahura Mazda! if it come to pass
that either a dog or a man dies there, what shall the worshippers
of Mazda do?
40.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Out of the house, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
shall they take the fire, the Baresma, the cups, the Haoma, and
the mortar; they shall take the dead one out to the proper place
whereto, according to the law, corpses must be brought, to be
devoured there.'
41.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! When shall they
bring back the fire into the house wherein the man has died? 42.
Ahura Mazda answered: 'They shall wait for nine nights in winter,
for a month in summer, and then they shall bring back the fire
to the house wherein the man has died.'
43.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! And if they
shall bring back the fire to the house wherein the man has died,
within the nine nights, or within the month, what penalty shall
they pay?
44.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'They shall be Peshotanus: two hundred
stripes with the Aspahe-astra, two hundred stripes with the Sraosho-karana.'

45.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If in the house
of a worshipper of Mazda there be a woman with child, and if being
a month gone, or two, or three, or four, or five, or six, or seven,
or eight, or nine, or ten months gone, she bring forth a still-born
child, what shall the worshippers of Mazda do?
46.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'The place in that Mazdean house whereof
the ground is the cleanest and the driest, and the least passed
through by flocks and herds, by the fire of Ahura Mazda, by the
consecrated bundles of Baresma, and by the faithful;'
47.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from
the fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated
bundles of Baresma? How far from the faithful?
48.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Thirty paces from the fire; thirty
paces from the water; thirty paces from the consecrated bundles
of Baresma; three paces from the faithful;-
49.
  'On that place shall the worshippers of Mazda erect an enclosure,
and therein shall they establish her with food, therein shall
they establish her with clothes.'
50.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! What is the
food that the woman shall first take?
51.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Gomez mixed with ashes, three draughts
of it, or six, or nine, to send down the Dakhma within her womb.
52.
  'Afterwards she may drink boiling milk of mares, cows, sheep,
or goats, with pap or without pap; she may take cooked milk without
water, meal without water, and wine without water.'
53.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long shall
she remain so? How long shall she live thus on milk, meal, and
wine?
54.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Three nights long shall she remain
so; three nights long shall she live thus on milk, meal, and wine.
Then, when three nights have passed, she shall wash her body,
she shall wash her clothes, with gomez and water, by the nine
holes, and thus shall she be clean.'
55.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long shall
she remain so? How long, after the three nights have gone, shall
she sit confined, and live separated from the rest of the worshippers
of Mazda, as to her seat, her food, and her clothing?
56.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Nine nights long shall she remain so:
nine nights long, after the three nights have gone, shall she
sit confined, and live separated from the rest of the worshippers
of Mazda, as to her seat, her food, and her clothing. Then, when
the nine nights have gone, she shall wash her body, and cleanse
her clothes with gomez and water.'
57.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can those clothes,
when once washed and cleansed, ever be used either by a Zaotar,
or by a Havanan, or by an Atare-vakhsha, or by a Frabaretar, or
by an Abered, or by an Asnatar, or by a Rathwishkar, or by a Sraosha-varez,
or by any priest, warrior, or husbandman?
58.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Never can those clothes, even when
washed and cleansed, be used either by a Zaotar, or by a Havanan,
or by an Atare-vakhsha, or by a Frabaretar, or by an Abered, or
by an Asnatar, or by a Rathwishkar, or by a Sraosha-varez, or
by any priest, warrior, or husbandman.
59.
  'But if there be in a Mazdean house a woman who is in her
sickness, or a man who has become unfit for work, and who must
sit in the place of infirmity, those clothes shall serve for their
coverings and for their sheets, until they can withdraw their
hands for prayer.
60.
  'Ahura Mazda, indeed, does not allow us to waste anything
of value that we may have, not even so much as an Asperena's weight
of thread, not even so much as a maid lets fall in spinning.
61.
  'Whosoever throws any clothing on a dead body, even so much
as a maid lets fall in spinning, is not a pious man whilst alive,
nor shall he, when dead, have a place in Paradise.
62.
  'He makes himself a viaticum unto the world of the wicked,
into that world, made of darkness, the offspring of darkness,
which is Darkness' self. To that world, to the world of Hell,
you are delivered by your own doings, by your own religion, O

again who has eaten of the carcass of a dog or of the corpse of
a man?
24.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'He cannot, O holy Zarathushtra! His
burrow shall be dug out, his heart shall be torn out, his bright
eyes shall be put out; the Druj Nasu falls upon him, takes hold
of him even to the end of the nails, and he is unclean thenceforth,
for ever and ever.'


			V.
25.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can he be clean
again, O holy Ahura Mazda! who has brought a corpse with filth
into the waters, or unto the fire, and made either unclean?
26.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'He cannot, O holy Zarathushtra! Those
wicked ones it is, those Nasu-cutters, that most increase spiders
and locusts; those wicked ones it is, those Nasu-cutters, that
most increase the grass-destroying drought.  
27. 'Those wicked ones it is, those Nasu-cutters, that increase
most the power of the winter, produced by the fiends, the cattle-killing,
thick- snowing, overflowing, the piercing, fierce, mischievous
winter. Upon them comes and rushes the Druj Nasu she takes hold
of them even to the end of the nails, and they are unclean, thenceforth,
for ever and ever.'


			VI.
28. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the
wood be made clean, O holy Ahura Mazda! whereunto Nasu has been
brought from a dead dog, or from a dead man?
29. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It can, O holy Zarathushtra!'
How so?
'If the Nasu has not yet been expelled by the corpse-eating
dogs, or by the corpse-eating birds, they shall lay down, apart
on the ground, all the wood on a Vitasti a all around, if the
wood be dry; on a Frarathni all around, if it be wet; then they
shall sprinkle it once over with water, and it shall be clean.
30. 'But if the Nasu has already been expelled by the corpse-eating
dogs, or by the corpse-eating birds, they shall lay down, apart
on the ground, all the wood on a Frarathni all around, if the
wood be dry; on a Frabazu all around, if it be wet; then they
shall sprinkle it once over with water, and it shall be clean.
31. 'Thus much of the wood around the dead shall they lay
down, apart on the ground, according as the wood is dry or wet;
as it is hard or soft; they shall sprinkle it once over with water,
and it shall be clean.'
32. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the
corn or the fodder be made clean O holy Ahura Mazda! whereunto
Nasu has been brought from a dead dog, or from a dead man?
33. Ahura Mazda answered: 'It can, O holy Zarathushtra!' How
so?
'If the Nasu has not yet been expelled by the corpse-eating
dogs, or by the corpse-eating birds they shall lay down, apart
on the ground, all the corn on a Frarathni all around, if the
corn be dry on a Frabazu all around, if it be wet; then they shall
sprinkle it once over with water, and it shall be clean.
34. 'But if the Nasu has already been expelled by the corpse-eating
dogs, or by the corpse-eating birds, they shall lay down, apart
on the ground, all the corn on a Frabazu all around, if the corn
be dry; on a Vibazu all around, if it be wet then they shall sprinkle
it once over with water, and it shall be clean.
35. 'Thus much of the corn around the dead shall they lay
down, apart on the ground, according as the corn is dry or wet;
as it is sown or not sown; as it is reaped or not reaped; [as
it is beaten or not beaten]1; as it is winnowed or not winnowed;
[as it is ground or not ground]2; as it is kneaded [or not kneaded]3;
they shall sprinkle it once over with water, and it shall be clean.'


			VIIa.
36. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a worshipper
of Mazda want to practice the art of healing, on whom shall he
first prove his skill? on worshippers of Mazda or on worshippers
of the Daevas?
37. Ahura Mazda answered: 'On worshippers of the Daevas shall
he first prove himself, rather than on worshippers of Mazda. If
he treat with the knife a worshipper of the Daevas and he die;
if he treat with the knife a second worshipper of the Daevas and
he die; if he treat with the knife for the third time a worshipper
of the Daevas and he die, he is unfit for ever and ever.
38. 'Let him therefore never attend any worshipper of Mazda;
let him never treat with the knife and worshipper of Mazda, nor
wound him with the knife. If he shall ever attend any worshipper
of Mazda, if he shall ever treat with the knife any worshipper
of Mazda, and wound him with the knife, he shall pay for his wound
the penalty for willful murder.
39. 'If he treat with the knife a worshipper of the Daevas
and he recover; if he treat with the knife a second worshipper
of the Daevas and he recover; if for the third time he treat with
the knife a worshipper of the Daevas and he recover; then he is
fit for ever and ever.
40. 'He may henceforth at his will attend worshippers of Mazda;
he may at his will treat with the knife worshippers of Mazda,
and heal them with the knife.

41. 'A healer shall heal a priest for a blessing of the just;
he shall heal the master of a house for the value of an ox of
low value; he shall heal the lord of a borough for the value of
an ox of average value; he shall heal the lord of a town for the
value of an ox of high value; he shall heal the lord of a province
for the value of a chariot and four.
42. 'He shall heal the wife of the master of a house for the
value of a she-ass; he shall heal the wife of the lord of a borough
for the value of a cow; he shall heal the wife of the lord of
a town for the value of a mare; he shall heal the wife of the
lord of a province for the value of a she-camel.
43. 'He shall heal the heir of a great house for the value
of an ox of high value; he shall heal an ox of high value for
the value of an ox of aver- age value; he shall heal an ox of
average value for the value of an ox of low value; he shall heal
an ox of low value for the value of a sheep; he shall heal a sheep
for the value of a piece of meat.
44. 'If several healers offer themselves together, O Spitama
Zarathushtra! namely, one who heals with the knife, one who heals
with herbs, and one who heals with the Holy Word, let one apply
to the healing by the Holy Word: for this one is the best-healing
of all healers who heals with the Holy Word; he will best drive
away sickness from the body of the faithful.'

45. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long
after the corpse of a dead man has been laid down on the ground,
clothed with the light of heaven and beholding the sun, is the
ground clean again?
46. Ahura Mazda answered: 'When the corpse of a dead man has
lain on the ground for a year, clothed with the light of heaven,
and beholding the sun, then the ground is clean again, O holy
Zarathushtra!'
47. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long
after the corpse of a dead man has been buried in the earth, is
the earth clean again?
48. Ahura Mazda answered: 'When the corpse of a dead man has
lain buried in the earth for fifty years, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
then the earth is clean again.'
49. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long
after the corpse of a dead man has been laid down on a Dakhma,
is the ground, whereon the Dakhma stands, clean again?
50. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Not until the dust of the corpse,
O Spitama Zarathushtra! has mingled with the dust of the earth.
Urge every one in the material world, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
to pull down Dakhmas.
51. 'He who should pull down Dakhmas, even so much thereof
as the size of his own body, his sins in thought, word, and deed
are remitted as they would be by a Patet; his sins in thought,
word, and deed are undone.
52. 'Not for his soul shall the two spirits wage war with
one another; and when he enters Paradise, the stars, the moon,
and the sun shall rejoice in him; and I, Ahura Mazda, shall rejoice
in him, saying: " Hail, O man! thou who hast just passed
from the decaying world into the undecaying one!"'
55. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Where are
there Daevas: Where is it they offer worship to the Daevas: What
is the place whereon troops of Daevas rush together, whereon troops
of Daevas come rushing along? What is the place whereon they rush
together to kill their fifties and their hundreds, their hundreds
and their thousands, their thousands and their tens of thousands,
their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads?
56. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Those Dakhmas that are built upon
the face of the earth, O Spitama Zarathushtra! and whereon are
laid the corpses of dead men, that is the place where there are
Daevas, that is the place whereon troops of Daevas rush together;
whereon troops of Daevas come rushing along; whereon they rush
together to kill their fifties and their hundreds, their hundreds
and their thousands, their thousands and their tens of thousands,
their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads.
57. 'On those Dakhmas, O Spitama Zarathushtra! those Daevas
take food and void filth. As you, men, in the material world,
you cook meal and eat cooked meat, so do they. It is, as it were,
the smell of their feeding that you smell there, O men!
58. 'For thus they go on reveling, until that stench is rooted
in the Dakhmas. In those Dakhmas arise the infection of diseases,
itch, hot fever, naeza, cold fever, rickets, and hair untimely
white. On those Dakhmas meet the worst murderers, from the hour
when the sun is down.
59. 'And people of small understanding who do not seek for
better understanding, the Gainis make those diseases grow stronger
by a third, on their thighs, on their hands, on their three-plaited
hair.'

60. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If in the
house of a worshipper of Mazda there be a woman with child, and
if being a month gone, or two, or three, or four, or five, or
six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or ten months gone, she bring
forth a still-born child, what shall the worshippers of Mazda
do?
61. Ahura Mazda answered: 'The place in that Mazdean house
whereof the ground is the cleanest and the driest, and the least
passed through by flocks and herds, by the fire of Ahura Mazda,
by the consecrated bundles of baresma, and by the faithful;'
62. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far
from the fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated
bundles of baresma? How far from the faithful?
63. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Thirty paces from the fire; thirty
paces from the water; thirty paces from the consecrated bundles
of Baresma; three paces from the faithful;-
64. 'On that place shall the worshippers of Mazda erect an
enclosure, and therein shall they establish her with food, therein
shall they establish her with clothes.'
65. O Maker of the material word, thou Holy One! What is the
food that the woman shall first take?
66. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Gomez mixed with ashes, three draughts
of it, or six, or nine, to send down the Dakhma within her womb.
67. 'Afterwards she may drink boiling milk of mares, cows,
sheep, or goats, with pap or without pap; she may take cooked
milk without water, meal without water, and wine without water.'
68. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long shall
she remain so? How long shall she live thus on milk, meal, and
wine?
69. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Three nights long shall she remain
so; three nights long shall she live thus on milk, meal, and wine.
Then, when three nights have passed, she shall wash her body,
she shall wash her clothes, with gomez and water, by the nine
holes, and thus shall she be clean.'
70. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! But if fever
befall her unclean body, if these two worst pains, hunger and
thirst, befall her, may she be allowed to drink water?
71. Ahura Mazda answered: 'She may; the first thing for her
is to have her life saved. From the hands of one of the holy men,
a holy faithful man, who knows the holy knowledge, she shall drink
of the strength-giving water. But you, worshippers of Mazda, fix
ye the penalty for it. The Ratu being applied to, the Sraosha-varez
being applied to, shall prescribe the penalty to be paid.'
72. What is the penalty to be paid?
Ahura Mazda answered: 'The deed is that of a Peshotanu: two
hundred stripes with the Aspahe-astra, two hundred stripes with
the Sraosho-charana.'


			X.
73. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the
eating-vessels be made clean that have been touched by Nasu from
a dog, or Nasu from a man?
74. Ahura Mazda answered: 'They can, O holy Zarathushtra!'
How so?
'If they be of gold, you shall wash them once with gomez,
you shall rub them once with earth, you shall wash them once with
water, and they shall be clean.
'If they be of silver, you shall wash them twice with gomez,
you shall rub them twice with earth, you shall wash them twice
with water, and they shall be clean.
[75. 'If they be of brass, you shall wash them thrice with
gomez, you shall rub them thrice with earth, you shall wash them
thrice with water, and they shall be clean.
'If they be of steel, you shall wash them four times with
gomez, you shall rub them four times with earth, you shall wash
them four times with water, and they shall be clean.
'If they be of stone, you shall wash them six times with gomez,
you shall rub them six times with earth, you shall wash them six
times with water, and they shall be clean.]
'If they be of earth, of wood, or of clay, they are unclean
for ever and ever.'


			XI.
76. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the
cow be made clean that has eaten of the carcass of a dog, or of
the corpse of a man?
77. Ahura Mazda answered: 'She can, O holy Zarathushtra! The
priest shall not, within a year, take from her either milk or
cheese for the libation, nor meat for the libation and the Baresma.
When a year has passed, then the faithful may eat of her as before.'


			XII.
78. Who is he, O holy Ahura Mazda! who, meaning well and desiring
righteousness, prevents righteousness? Who is he who, meaning
well, falls into the ways of the Druj?
79. Ahura Mazda answered: 'This one, meaning well and desiring
righteousness, prevents righteousness; this one, meaning well,
falls into the ways of the Druj, who offers up water defiled by
the dead and unfit for libation; or who offers up in the dead
of the night water unfit for libation.'

  If a dog or a man die under a hut of wood or a hut of felt,
what shall the worshippers of Mazda do?
2.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'They shall search for a Dakhma, they
shall look for a Dakhma all around. If they find it easier to
remove the dead, they shall take out the dead, they shall let
the house stand, and shall perfume it with Urvasna or Vohu-gaona,
or Vohu-kereti, or Hadha-naepata, or any other sweet-smelling
plant.

  'If they find it easier to remove the house, they shall take
away the house, they shall let the dead he on the spot, and shall

  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If in the house
of a worshipper of Mazda a dog or a man happens to die, and it
is raining, or snowing, or blowing, or it is dark, or the day
is at its end, when flocks and men lose their way, what shall
the worshippers of Mazda do?
5.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'The place in that house whereof the
ground is the cleanest and the driest, and the least passed through
by flocks and herds, by the fire of Ahura Mazda, by the consecrated
bundles of Baresma, and by the faithful;'-
6.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from
the fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated
bundles of Baresma? How far from the faithful?
7.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Thirty paces from the fire; thirty
paces from the water; thirty paces from the consecrated bundles
of Baresma; three paces from the faithful;-
8.
  'On that place they shall dig a grave, half a foot deep if
the earth be hard, half the height of a man if it be soft; [they
shall cover the surface of the grave with ashes or cowdung]; they
shall cover the surface of it with dust of bricks, of stones,
or of dry earth.
9.
  'And they shall let the lifeless body lie there, for two nights,
or three nights, or a month long, until the birds begin to fly,
the plants to grow, the hidden floods to flow, and the wind to
dry up the earth.
10.
  'And when the birds begin to fly, the plants to grow, the
hidden floods to flow, and the wind to dry up the earth, then
the worshippers of Mazda shall make a breach in the wall of the
house, and two men, strong and skillful, having stripped their
clothes off, shall take up the body from the clay or the stones,
or from the plastered house, and they shall lay it down on a place
where they know there are always corpse-eating dogs and corpse-eating
birds.
11.
  'Afterwards the corpse-bearers shall sit down, three paces
from the dead, and the holy Ratu shall proclaim to the worshippers
of Mazda thus: "Worshippers of Mazda, let the urine be brought
here wherewith the corpse-bearers there shall wash their hair
and their bodies!"'
12.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which is the
urine wherewith the corpse-bearers shall wash their hair and their
bodies? Is it of sheep or of oxen? Is it of man or of woman?
13.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is of sheep or of oxen; not of man
nor of woman, except a man or a woman who has married the next-of-kin:
these shall therefore procure the urine wherewith the corpse-bearers
shall wash their hair and their bodies.'

14.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the way,
whereon the carcasses of dogs or corpses of men have been carried,
be passed through again by flocks and herds, by men and women,
by the fire of Ahura Mazda, by the consecrated bundles of Baresma,
and by the faithful?
15.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'It cannot be passed through again by
flocks and herds, nor by men and women, nor by the fire of Ahura
Mazda, nor by the consecrated bundles of Baresma, nor by the faithful.
16.
  'They shall therefore cause a yellow dog with four eyes, or
a white dog with yellow ears, to go three times through that way.
When either the yellow dog with four eyes, or the white dog with
yellow ears, is brought there, then the Druj Nasu flies away to
the regions of the north, [in the shape of a raging fly, with
knees and tail sticking out, droning without end, and like unto
the foulest Khrafstras.]
17.
  'If the dog goes unwillingly, O Spitama Zarathushtra, they
shall cause the yellow dog with four eyes, or the white dog with
yellow ears, to go six times through that way. When either the
yellow dog with four eyes, or the white dog with yellow ears,
is brought there, then the Druj Nasu flies away to the regions
of the north, [in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail
sticking out, droning without end, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras.]
18.
  'If the dog goes unwillingly, they shall cause the yellow
dog with four eyes, or the white dog with yellow ears, to go nine
times through that way. When either the yellow dog with four eyes,
or the white dog with yellow ears, has been brought there, then
the Druj Nasu flies away to the regions of the north, [in the
shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, droning
without end, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras.]
19.
  'An Athravan shall first go along the way and shall say aloud
these victorious words: "Yatha aha vairyo: - The will of
the Lord is the law of righteousness.  
'"The gifts of Vohu-mano to the deeds done in this world
for Mazda.  
'"He who relieves the poor makes Ahura king.
20.
  '"Kem-na mazda: - What protector hast thou given unto
me, O Mazda! while the hate of the wicked encompasses me? Whom
but thy Atar and Vohu-mano, through whose work I keep on the world
of righteousness? Reveal therefore to me thy Religion as thy rule!
  
'"Ke verethrem-ja: - Who is the victorious who will protect
thy teaching? Make it clear that I am the guide for both worlds.
May Sraosha come with Vohu-mano and help whomsoever thou pleasest,
O Mazda!
21.
  '"Keep us from our hater, O Mazda and Armaiti Spenta!
Perish, O fiendish Druj! Perish, O brood of the fiend! Perish,
O creation of the fiend! Perish, O world of the fiend! Perish
away, O Druj! Rush away, O Druj! Perish away, O Druj! Perish away
to the regions of the north, never more to give unto death the
living world of Righteousness!"

  'Then the worshippers of Mazda may at their will bring by
those ways sheep and oxen, men and women, and Fire, the son of
Ahura Mazda, the consecrated bundles of Baresma, and the faithful.

and wine in that house; it shall be clean, and there will be no

23.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man shall
throw clothes, either of skin or woven, upon a dead body, enough
to cover the feet, what is the penalty that he shall pay? Ahura
Mazda answered: 'Four hundred stripes with the Aspahe-astra, four
hundred stripes with the Sraosho-charana.'
24.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man shall
throw clothes, either of skin or woven, upon a dead body, enough
to cover both legs, what is the penalty that he shall pay? Ahura
Mazda answered: 'Six hundred stripes with the Aspahe-astra, six
hundred stripes with the Sraosho-charana.'
25.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man shall
throw clothes, either of skin or woven, upon a dead body, enough
to cover the whole body, what is the penalty that he shall pay?
Ahura Mazda answered: 'A thousand stripes with the Aspahe-astra,
a thousand stripes with the Sraosho-charana.'


			V
26.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man, by
force, commits the unnatural sin, what is the penalty that he
shall pay?  
Ahura Mazda answered: 'Eight hundred stripes with the Aspahe-astra,
eight hundred stripes with the Sraosho-charana.'
27.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man voluntarily
commits the unnatural sin, what is the penalty for it? What is
the atonement for it? What is the cleansing from it?  
Ahura Mazda answered: 'For that deed there is nothing that can
pay, nothing that can atone, nothing that can cleanse from it;
it is a trespass for which there is no atonement, for ever and
ever.'
28.
  When is it so?  
'It is so if the sinner be a professor of the Religion of Mazda,
or one who has been taught in it.  
'But if he be not a professor of the Religion of Mazda, nor one
who has been taught in it, then his sin is taken from him, if
he makes confession of the Religion of Mazda and resolves never
to commit again such forbidden deeds.
29.
  'The Religion of Mazda indeed, O Spitama Zarathushtra! takes
away from him who makes confession of it the bonds of his sin;
it takes away (the sin of) breach of trust; it takes away (the
sin of) murdering one of the faithful; it takes away (the sin
of) burying a corpse; it takes away (the sin of) deeds for which
there is no atonement; it takes away the worst sin of usury; it
takes away any sin that may be sinned.
30.
  In the same way the Religion of Mazda, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
cleanses the faithful from every evil thought, word, and deed,
as a swift-rushing mighty wind cleanses the plain.  
'So let all the deeds he doeth be henceforth good, O Zarathushtra!
a full atonement for his sin is effected by means of the Religion
of Mazda.'
31.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Who is the man
that is a Daeva? Who is he that is a worshipper of the Daevas?
that is a male paramour of the Daevas? that is a female paramour
of the Daevas? that is a wife to the Daeva? that is as bad as
a Daeva: that is in his whole being a Daeva? Who is he that is
a Daeva before he dies, and becomes one of the unseen Daevas after
death?
32.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'The man that lies with mankind as man
lies with womankind, or as woman lies with mankind, is the man
that is a Daeva; this one is the man that is a worshipper of the
Daevas, that is a male paramour of the Daevas, that is a female
paramour of the Daevas, that is a wife to the Daeva; this is the
man that is as bad as a Daeva, that is in his whole being a Daeva;
this is the man that is a Daeva before he dies, and becomes one
of the unseen Daevas after death: so is he, whether he has lain
with mankind as mankind, or as womankind.'

33.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Shall the man
be clean who has touched a corpse that has been dried up and dead
more than a year?
34.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'He shall. The dry mingles not with
the dry. Should the dry mingle with the dry, how soon all this
material world of mine would be only one Peshotanu, bent on the
destruction of righteousness, and whose soul will cry and wail!
so numberless are the beings that die upon the face of the earth.'


			VII
35.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the man
be made clean that has touched the corpse of a dog or the corpse
of a man?
36.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'He can, O holy Zarathushtra!'  
How so?  
'If the Nasu has already been expelled by the corpse-eating dogs,
or by the corpse-eating birds, he shall cleanse his body with
gomez and water, and he shall be clean.
37.
  'If the Nasu has not yet been expelled by the corpse-eating
dogs, or by the corpse-eating birds, then the worshippers of Mazda
shall dig three holes in the ground, and he shall thereupon wash
his body with gomez, not with water. They shall then lift and
bring my dog, they shall bring him (thus shall it be done and
not otherwise) in front [of the man].
38.
  'The worshippers of Mazda shall dig three other holes in the
ground, and he shall thereupon wash his body with gomez, not with
water. They shall then lift and bring my dog, they shall bring
him (thus shall it be done and not otherwise) in front [of the
man]. Then shall they wait until he is dried even to the last
hair on the top of his head.
39.
  'They shall dig three more holes in the ground, three paces
away from the preceding, and he shall thereupon wash his body
with water, not with gomez.
40.
  'He shall first wash his hands; if his hands be not first
washed, he makes the whole of his body unclean. When he has washed
his hands three times, after his hands have been washed, thou
shalt sprinkle with water the forepart of his skull.'

How so?  
'If the Nasu has already been expelled by the corpse-eating dogs
or the corpse-eating birds, he shall wash his body with gomez;
he shall wash it thirty times, he shall rub it dry with the hand
thirty times, beginning every time with the head.
99.

dogs or the corpse-eating birds, he shall wash his body with gomez;

fifteen times.

he meets some man on his way, and he shall cry out aloud: "Here
am I, one who has touched the corpse of a man, and who is powerless
in mind, powerless in tongue, powerless in hand. Do make me clean."
Thus shall he run until he overtakes the man. If the man will
not cleanse him, he remits him the third of his trespass.

until he overtakes a man; if the man will not cleanse him, he
remits him the half of his trespass.

time until he overtakes a man; if the man will not cleanse him,
he remits him the whole of his trespass.

borough, a town, an inhabited district, and he shall cry out with
a loud voice: "Here am I, one who has touched the corpse
of a man, and who is powerless in mind, powerless in tongue, powerless
in hand. Do make me clean." If they will not cleanse him,
he shall cleanse his body with gomez and water; thus shall he
be clean.'

on his way and the water make him subject to a penalty, what is

Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! To whom shall they
apply here below, who want to cleanse their body defiled by the
dead?'

  Ahura Mazda answered: 'To a pious man, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
who knows how to speak, who speaks truth, who has learned the
Holy Word, who is pious, and knows best the rites of cleansing
according to the law of Mazda. That man shall fell the trees off
the surface of the ground on a space of nine Vibazus square;

holes, outside the [six other] holes. At each of the three times
nine feet, thou shalt place stones as steps to the holes; or potsherds,

  'Thou shalt cleanse a priest for a blessing of the just.  
'Thou shalt cleanse the lord of a province for the value of a
camel of high value.  
'Thou shalt cleanse the lord of a town for the value of a stallion
of high value.  
'Thou shalt cleanse the lord of a borough for the value of a bull
of high value.  
'Thou shalt cleanse the master of a house for the value of a cow
three years old.
38.
  'Thou shalt cleanse the wife of the master of a house for
the value of a ploughing cow.  
'Thou shalt cleanse a menial for the value of a draught cow. 'Thou
shalt cleanse a young child for the value of a lamb.

  'These are the heads of cattle - flocks or herds - that the
worshippers of Mazda shall give to the man who has cleansed them,
if they can afford it; if they cannot afford it, they shall give
him any other value that may make him leave their houses well
pleased with them, and free from anger.
40.
  'For if the man who has cleansed them leave their houses displeased
with them, and full of anger, then the Druj Nasu enters them from
the nose [of the dead], from the eyes, from the tongue, from the
jaws, from the sexual organs, from the hinder parts.
41.
  'And the Druj Nasu rushes upon them even to the end of the
nails, and they are unclean thenceforth for ever and ever.  
'It grieves the sun indeed, O Spitama Zarathushtra! to shine upon
a man defiled by the dead; it grieves the moon, it grieves the
stars.
42.
  'That man delights them, O Spitama Zarathushtra! who cleanses
from the Nasu the man defiled by the dead; he delights the fire,
he delights the water, he delights the earth, he delights the
cow, he delights the trees, he delights the faithful, both men
and women.'
43.
  Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Maker of the material world,
thou Holy One! What shall be his reward, after his soul has parted
from his body, who has cleansed from the Nasu the man defiled
by the dead?'
44.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'The welfare of Paradise thou canst
promise to that man, for his reward in the other world.'
45.
  Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Maker of the material world,
thou Holy One! How shall I fight against that Druj who from the
dead rushes upon the living? How shall I fight against that Nasu
who from the dead defiles the living?'
46.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Say aloud those words in the Gathas
that are to be said twice.  
'Say aloud those words in the Gathas that are to be said thrice.
  
'Say aloud those words in the Gathas that are to be said four
times.  
'And the Druj shall fly away like the well-darted arrow, like
the felt of last year, like the annual garment of the earth.'

47.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man who
does not know the rites of cleansing according to the law of Mazda,
offers to cleanse the unclean, how shall I then fight against
that Druj who from the dead rushes upon the living? How shall
I fight against that Druj who from the dead defiles the living?
48.
  Ahura Mazda answered : 'Then, O Spitama Zarathushtra! the
Druj Nasu appears to wax stronger than she was before. Stronger
then are sickness and death and the working of the fiend than
they were before.'
49.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! What is the
penalty that he shall pay?  
Ahura Mazda answered: 'The worshippers of Mazda shall bind him;
they shall bind his hands first; then they shall strip him of
his clothes, they shall cut the head off his neck, and they shall
give over his corpse unto the greediest of the corpse-eating creatures
made by the beneficent Spirit, unto the vultures, with these words:
-  
'"The man here has repented of all his evil thoughts, words,
and deeds.
50.
  '"If he has committed any other evil deed, it is remitted
by his repentance; if he has committed no other evil deed, he
is absolved by his repentance for ever and ever."'
51.
  Who is he, O Ahura Mazda! who threatens to take away fullness
and increase from the world, and to bring in sickness and death?
52.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is the ungodly Ashemaogha, O Spitama
Zarathushtra! who in this material world cleanses the unclean
without knowing the rites of cleansing according to the law of
Mazda.
53.
  'For until then, O Spitama Zarathushtra! sweetness and fatness
would flow out from that land and from those fields, with health
and healing, with fullness and increase and growth, and a growing
of corn and grass.'
54.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! When are sweetness
and fatness to come back again to that land and to those fields,
with health and healing, with fullness and increase and growth,
and a growing of corn and grass?
55, 56.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Sweetness and fatness will never come
back again to that land and to those fields, with health and healing,
with fullness and increase and growth, and a growing of corn and
grass, until that ungodly Ashemaogha has been smitten to death
on the spot, and the holy Sraosha of that place has been offered
up a sacrifice, for three days and three nights, with fire blazing,
with Baresma tied up, and with Haoma prepared. 57. 'Then sweetness
and fatness will come back again to that land and to those fields,
with health and healing, with fullness and increase and growth,
and a growing of corn and grass.'

death on the spot, and the holy soul of the dog has been offered

of puberty, with ear-rings in her ears and past her fifteenth
year.
16.
  'He shall godly and piously give to holy men twice seven head
of small cattle, to redeem his own soul.'  
'He shall bring up twice seven whelps.  
'He shall throw twice seven bridges over canal.
17.
  'He shall put into repair twice nine stables that are out
of repair.  
'He shall cleanse twice nine dogs from stipti, anairiti, and vyangura,
and all the diseases that are produced on the body of a dog.  
'He shall treat twice nine godly men to their fill of meat, bread,
strong drink, and wine.
18.
  'This is the penalty, this is the atonement which saves the
faithful man who submits to it not him who does not submit to
it. Such a one shall surely be an inhabitant in the mansion of
the Druj.'

Regarding certain sins and obligations 

			I.
1.
  How many are the sins that men commit and that, being committed
and not confessed, nor atoned for, make their committer a Peshotanu?
2.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'There are five such sins, O holy Zarathushtra!
It is the first of these sins that men commit when a man teaches
one of the faithful another faith, another law, a lower doctrine,
and he leads him astray with a full knowledge and conscience of
the sin: the man who has done the deed becomes a Peshotanu.
3.
  'It is the second of these sins when a man gives bones too
hard or food too hot to a shepherd's dog or to a house-dog;
4.
  'If the bones stick in the dog's teeth or stop in his throat;
or if the food too hot burn his mouth or his tongue, he may come
to grief thereby; if he come to grief thereby, the man who has
done the deed becomes a Peshotanu.
5.
  'It is the third of these sins when a man smites a bitch big
with young or affrights her by running after her, or shouting
or clapping with the hands;
6.
  'If the bitch fall into a hole, or a well, or a precipice,
or a river, or a canal, she may come to grief thereby; if she
come to grief thereby, the man who has done the deed becomes a
Peshotanu.
7.
  'It is the fourth of these sins when a man has intercourse
with a woman who has the whites or sees the blood, the man that
has done the deed becomes a Peshotanu.
8.
  'It is the fifth of these sins when a man has intercourse
with a woman quick with child, whether the milk has already come
to her breasts or has not yet come: she may come to grief thereby;
if she come to grief thereby, the man who has done the deed becomes
a Peshotanu.

  'If a man come near unto a damsel, either dependent on the
chief of the family or not dependent, either delivered [unto a
husband] or not delivered, and she conceives by him, let her not,
being ashamed of the people, produce in herself the menses, against
the course of nature, by means of water and plants.
10.
  'And if the damsel, being ashamed of the people, shall produce
in herself the menses gainst the course of nature, by means of
water and plants, it is a fresh sin as heavy [as the first]3.
11.
  'If a man come near unto a damsel, either dependent on the
chief of the family or not dependent, either delivered [unto a
husband] or not delivered, and she conceives by him, let her not,
being ashamed of the people, destroy the fruit in her womb.
12.
  'And if the damsel, being ashamed of the people, shall destroy
the fruit in her womb, the sin is on both the father and herself,
the murder is on both the father and herself; both the father
and herself shall pay the penalty for willful murder.


			IIb.
13.
  'If a man come near unto a damsel, either dependent on the
chief of the family or not dependent, either delivered [unto a
husband] or not delivered, and she conceives by him, and she says,
"I have conceived by thee;" and he replies, "Go
then to the old woman and apply to her for one of her drugs, that
she may procure thee miscarriage;"
14.
  'And the damsel goes to the old woman and applies to her for
one of her drugs, that she may procure her miscarriage; and the
old woman brings her some Banga, or Shaeta, a drug that kills
in the womb or one that expels out of the womb, or some other
of the drugs that produce miscarriage and [the man says], "Cause
thy fruit to perish!" and she causes her fruit to perish;
the sin is on the head of all three, the man, the damsel, and
the old woman.
15.
  'If a man come near unto a damsel, either dependent on the
chief of the family or not dependent, either delivered [unto a
husband] or not delivered, and she conceives by him, so long shall
he support her, until the child be born.
16.
  'If he shall not support her, so that the child comes to grief,
for want of proper support, he shall pay for it the penalty for
willful murder.'
17.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If she be near
her time, which is the worshipper of Mazda that shall support
her?
18.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'If a man come near unto a damsel, either
dependent on the chief of the family or not dependent, either
delivered [unto a husband] or not delivered, and she conceives
by him, so long shall he support her, until the child be born.
19.

'It lies with the faithful to look in the same way after every
pregnant female, either two-footed or four-footed, two-footed
woman or four-footed bitch.'

care of supporting her is his; so long shall he support her, until
the whelps be born.

willful murder.'

29.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a bitch be
near her time and be lying in a stable for oxen, which is the
worshipper of Mazda that shall support her?

whoso holds it, the care of supporting her is his; so long shall
he support her, until the whelps be born.
31.
  'If he shall not support her, so that the whelps come to grief,

32.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a bitch be
near her time and be lying in a sheep-fold, which is the worshipper
of Mazda that shall support her?
33.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'He who built the sheepfold or whoso
holds it, the care of supporting her is his; so long shall he
support her, until the whelps be born.
34.
  'If he shall not support her so that the whelps come to grief,
for want of proper support, he shall pay for it the penalty for
willful murder.'
35.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a bitch be
near her time and be lying on the earth-wall, which is the worshipper
of Mazda that shall support her?
36.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'He who erected the wall or whoso holds
it, the care of supporting her is his; so long shall he support
her, until the whelps be born.
37.
  'If he shall not support her, so that the whelps come to grief,

38.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a bitch be
near her time and be lying in the moat, which is the worshipper
of Mazda that shall support her?

her, until the whelps be born.
40.
  'If he shall not support her, so that the whelps come to grief,

41.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a bitch be
near her time and be lying in the middle of a pasture-field, which
is the worshipper of Mazda that shall support her?
42.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'He who sowed the pasture-field or whoso
holds it, the care of supporting her is his; [so long shall he
support her, until the whelps be born. If he shall not support
her, so that the whelps come to grief, for want of proper support,
he shall pay for it the penalty for willful murder.]
43.
  'He shall take her to rest upon a litter of nemovanta or of
any foliage fit for a litter; so long shall he support her, until
the young dogs are capable of self-defense and self-subsistence.'
44.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! When are the
dogs capable of self-defense and self-subsistence?
45.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'When they are able to run about in
a circuit of twice seven houses around. Then they may be let loose,
whether it be winter or summer.  
'Young dogs ought to be supported for six months, children for
seven years.  
'Atar, the son of Ahura Mazda, watches as well (over a pregnant
bitch) as he does over a woman.'


			IV.
46.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If worshippers
of Mazda want to have a bitch so covered that the offspring shall
be one of a strong nature, what shall they do?
47.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'They shall dig a hole in the earth,
in the middle of the fold half a foot deep if the earth be hard,
half the height of a man if the earth be soft.
48.
  'They shall first tie up [the bitch] there, far from children
and from the Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, and they shall watch
by her until a dog comes there from anywhere; then another again,
and then a third again, each being kept apart from the former,
lest they should assail one another.
49.
  'The bitch being thus covered by three dogs, grows big with
young, and the milk comes to her teats and she brings forth a
young one that is born from several dogs.'
50.
  If a man smite a bitch who has been covered by three dogs,
and who has already milk, and who shall bring forth a young one
born from several dogs, what is the penalty that he shall pay?
51.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Seven hundred stripes with the Aspahe-astra,
seven hundred stripes with the Sraosho-charana.'

  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be
in the house of a worshipper of Mazda a woman who has the whites
or sees blood, what shall the worshippers of Mazda do?
2.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'They shall clear the way of the wood
there, both plants and trees; they shall strew dry dust on the
ground; and they shall isolate a half, or a third, or a fourth,
or a fifth part of the house, lest her look should fall upon the
fire.'
3.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from
the fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated
bundles of Baresma? How far from the faithful?

paces from the water, fifteen paces from the consecrated bundles
of Baresma, three paces from the faithful.'

  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from
her shall he stay, who brings food to a woman who has the whites
or sees the blood?

who brings food to a woman who has the whites or sees the blood.'
  
In what kind of vessels shall he bring her bread? In what kind
of vessels shall he bring her barley-drink?  
'In vessels of brass, or of lead, or of any common metal.'

  How much bread shall he bring to her? How much barley-drink
shall he bring?

11.
  'If she still see blood after nine nights have passed, this

and glorification of the Daevas.  
'The worshippers of Mazda shall clear the way of the wood there,
both plants and trees;

13.
  If a worshipper of Mazda shall suppress the issue of a woman
who has the whites or sees blood, what is the penalty that he

Ahura Mazda answered: 'He is a Peshotanu: two hundred stripes
with the Aspahe-astra, two hundred stripes with the Sraosho-charana.'
14.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man shall
again and again lasciviously touch the body of a woman who has
the whites or sees blood, so that the whites turn to the blood
or the blood turns to the whites, what is the penalty that he
shall pay?

her, for the first time he lies by her, thirty stripes with the
Aspahe-astra, thirty stripes with the Sraosho-charana.

time he lies by her, if he shall press the body under her clothes,
if he shall go in between the unclean thighs, but without sexual
intercourse, what is the penalty that he shall pay?  
Ahura Mazda answered: 'Ninety stripes with the Aspahe-astra, ninety
stripes with the Sraosho-charana.
17.
  'Whosoever shall he in sexual intercourse with a woman who
has the whites or sees blood does no better deed than if he should

Hair and nails

  Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which is the
most deadly deed whereby a man offers up a sacrifice to the Daevas!'
2.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is when a man here below, combing
his hair or shaving it off, or paring off his nails, drops them
in a hole or in a crack.
3.
  'Then by this transgression of the rites, Daevas are produced
in the earth; by this transgression of the rites, those Khrafstras
are produced in the earth which men call lice, and which eat up
the corn in the corn-field and the clothes in the wardrobe.
4.
  'Therefore, thou, O Zarathushtra! whenever here below thou
shalt comb thy hair or shave it off, or pare off thy nails, thou
shalt take them away ten paces from the faithful, twenty paces
from the fire, thirty paces from the water, fifty paces from the
consecrated bundles of Baresma.

  'Then thou shalt dig a hole, a disti [ten fingers] deep if
the earth be hard, a vitasti [twelve fingers] deep if it be soft;
thou shalt take the hair down there and thou shalt say aloud these
victorious words: "For him, as a reward, Mazda made the plants
grow up."

  'Then thou shalt draw three furrows with a knife of metal
around the hole, or six furrows or nine, and thou shalt chant

ill-speaking people call Kahrkatas, O holy Zarathushtra! the bird
that lifts up his voice against the mighty Ushah:
16.
  '"Arise, O men! recite the Ashem yad vahistem
that smites down the Daevas. Lo! here is Bushyasta, the long-handed,
coming upon you, who lulls to sleep again the whole living world,

good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; on the three abominable
things be ever intent, namely, bad thoughts, bad words, and bad

calls the master of the house for help, saying:

  '"Up! arise, thou master of the house! put on thy girdle
on thy clothes, wash thy hands, take wood, bring it unto me, and
let me burn bright with the clean wood, carried by thy well-washed
hands. Here comes Azi, made by the Daevas, who consumes me and
wants to put me out of the world."

here is the cock calling me up." Whichever of the two first
gets up shall first enter Paradise: whichever of the two shall
first, with well-washed hands, bring clean wood unto Atar, the
son of Ahura Mazda, Atar, well pleased with him and not angry,
and fed as it required, will thus bless him:

  '"May herds of oxen and sons accrue to thee: may thy
mind be master of its vow, may thy soul be master of its vow,
and mayst thou live on in the joy of thy soul all the nights of
thy life."

dry wood, well examined by the light of the day, well cleansed
with godly intent.

  'And whosoever will kindly and piously present one of the
faithful with a pair of these my Parodars birds, a male and a
female, O Spitama Zarathushtra! it is as though he had given a
house with a hundred columns, a thousand beams, ten thousand large
windows, ten thousand small windows.

much of it as the body of this Parodars bird of mine, I, Ahura

  'For there are four males of mine; and they make me conceive
progeny as other males make their females conceive by their seed.'
33.
  The holy Sraosha, letting his club down upon her, asked the
Druj: 'O thou wretched, worthless Druj! Who is the first of those
males of thine?'
34.
  The Druj demon answered: 'O holy, well-formed Sraosha! He
is the first of my males who, being entreated by one of the faithful,
does not give him anything, be it ever so little, of the riches
he has treasured up.
35.
  'That man makes me conceive progeny as other males make their
females conceive by their seed.'
36.
  The holy Sraosha, letting his club down upon her, asked the
Druj: 'O thou wretched, worthless Druj! What is the thing that
can undo that?'
37.
  The Druj demon answered: 'O holy, well-formed Sraosha! This
is the thing that undoes it, namely, when a man unasked, kindly
and piously, gives to one of the faithful something, be it ever
so little, of the riches he has treasured up.
38.
  'He does thereby as thoroughly destroy the fruit of my womb
as a four-footed wolf does, who tears the child out of a mother's
womb.'
39.
  The holy Sraosha, letting down his club upon her, asked the
Druj: 'O thou wretched, worthless Druj! Who is the second of those
males of thine?'
40.
  The Druj demon answered: 'O holy, well-formed Sraosha! He
is the second of my males who, making water, lets it fall along
the upper forepart of his foot.
41.
  'That man makes me conceive progeny as other males make their
females conceive by their seed.'
42.
  The holy Sraosha, letting his club down upon her, asked the
Druj: 'O thou wretched, worthless Druj! What is the thing that
can undo that?'
43.
  The Druj demon answered: 'O holy, wall-formed Sraosha! This
is the thing that undoes it, namely, when the man rising up and
stepping three steps further off, shall say three Ahuna-Vairya,
two humatanam, three hukhshathrotemam, and then chant the Ahuna-Vairya
and offer up one Yenhe hatam.
44.
  'He does thereby as thoroughly destroy the fruit of my womb
as a four-footed wolf does, 'who tears the child out of a mother's
womb.'
45.
  The holy Sraosha, letting his club down upon her, asked the
Druj: 'O thou wretched, worthless Druj! Who is the third of those
males of thine?'
46.
  The Druj demon answered: 'O holy, well-formed Sraosha! He
is the third of my males who during his sleep emits seed.
47.
  'That man makes me conceive progeny as other males make their
females conceive progeny by their seed.'
48.
  The holy Sraosha, letting his club down upon her, asked the
Druj: 'O thou wretched, worthless Druj! What is the thing that
can undo that?'
49.
  The Druj demon answered: 'O holy, well-formed Sraosha! this
is the thing that undoes it, namely, if the man, when he has risen
from sleep, shall say three Ahuna-Vairya, two humatanam, three
hukhshathrotemam, and then chant the Ahuna-Vairya and offer up
one Yenhe hatam.
50.
  'He does thereby as thoroughly destroy the fruit of my womb
as a four-footed wolf does who tears the child out of a mother's
womb.'
51.
  Then he shall speak unto Spenta Armaiti, saying: 'O Spenta
Armaiti, this man do I deliver unto thee; this man deliver thou
back unto me, against the happy day of resurrection; deliver him
back as one who knows the Gathas, who knows the Yasna, and the
revealed Law, a wise and clever man, who is Obedience incarnate.
52.
  'Then thou shalt call his name "Fire-creature, Fire-seed,
Fire-offspring, Fire-land," or any name wherein is the word
Fire.'
53.
  The holy Sraosha, letting his club down upon her, asked the
Druj: 'O thou wretched, worthless Druj! Who is the fourth of those
males of thine?'
54.
  The Druj demon answered: 'O holy, well-formed Sraosha! This
one is my fourth male who, either man or woman, being more than
fifteen years of age, walks without wearing the sacred girdle
and the sacred shirt.
55.
  'At the fourth step we Daevas, at once, wither him even to
the tongue and the marrow, and he goes thenceforth with power
to destroy the world of Righteousness, and he destroys it like
the Yatus and the Zandas.'
56.
  The holy Sraosha, letting his club down upon her, asked the
Druj: 'O thou wretched, worthless Druj, what is the thing that
can undo that?'
57.
  The Druj demon answered: 'O holy, well-formed Sraosha! There
is no means of undoing it;
58.
  'When a man or a woman, being more than fifteen years of age,
walks without wearing the sacred girdle or the sacred shirt.
59.
  'At the fourth step we Daevas, at once, wither him even to
the tongue and the marrow, and he goes thenceforth with power
to destroy the world of Righteousness, and he destroys it like
the Yatus and the Zandas.'

most beneficent of all beings, the best knowing, the most pleased
in answering what is asked of me; demand of me that thou mayst
be the better, that thou mayst be the happier.
61.
  Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'Who grieves thee with the
sorest grief? Who pains thee with the sorest pain?'
62.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is the Jahi [courtesan], O Spitama
Zarathushtra! who mixes in her the seed of the faithful and the
unfaithful, of the worshippers of Mazda and the worshippers of
the Daevas, of the wicked and the righteous.
63.
  'Her look dries up one-third of the mighty floods that run
from the mountains, O Zarathushtra; her look withers one-third
of the beautiful, golden-hued, growing plants, O Zarathushtra;
64.
  'Her look withers one-third of the strength of Spenta Armaiti;
and her touch withers in the faithful one-third of his good thoughts,
of his good words, of his good deeds, one-third of his strength,
of his victorious power, and of his holiness.
65.
  'Verily I say unto thee, O Spitama Zarathushtra! such creatures
ought to be killed even more than gliding snakes, than howling
wolves, than the wild she-wolf that falls upon the fold, or than
the she-frog that falls upon the waters with her thousandfold
brood.'

66.
  Demand of me, thou upright one! of me who am the Maker, the
most beneficent of all beings, the best knowing, the most pleased
in answering what is asked of me; demand of me that thou mayst
be the better, that thou mayst be the happier.
67-68.
  Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'If a man shall come unto
a woman who has the whites or sees blood, and he does so wittingly
and knowingly, and she allows it willfully, wittingly, and knowingly,
what is the atonement for it, what is the penalty that he shall
pay to atone for the deed they have done?'
69.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'If a man shall come unto a woman who
has the whites or sees blood, and he does so wittingly and knowingly,
and she allows it willfully, wittingly, and knowingly;
70.
  'He shall slay a thousand head of small cattle; he shall godly
and piously offer up to the fire the entrails thereof together
with Zaothra-libations; he shall bring the shoulder bones to the
Good Waters.
71.
  'He shall godly and piously bring unto the fire a thousand
loads of soft wood, of Urvasna, Vohu-gaona, Vohu-kereti, Hadha-naepata,
or of any sweet-scented plant.
72.
  'He shall tie and consecrate a thousand bundles of Baresma;
he shall godly and piously offer up to the Good Waters a thousand
Zaothra-libations, together with the Haoma and the milk, cleanly
prepared and well strained, - cleanly prepared and well strained
by a pious man, and mixed with the roots of the tree known as
Hadha-naepata.
73.
  'He shall kill a thousand snakes of those that go upon the
belly, two thousand of the other kind; he shall kill a thousand
land-frogs and two thousand water-frogs; he shall kill a thousand
corn-carrying ants and two thousand of the other kind.
74.
  'He shall throw thirty bridges over canals; he shall undergo
a thousand stripes with the Aspahe-astra, a thousand stripes with
the Sraosho-karana.
75.
  'This is the atonement, this is the penalty that he shall
pay to atone for the deed that he has done.
76.
  'If he shall pay it, he makes himself a viaticum into the
world of the holy ones; if he shall not pay it, he makes himself
a viaticum into the world of the wicked, into that world, made
of darkness, the offspring of darkness, which is Darkness' self.'

1.
  From the region of the north, from the regions of the north,
forth rushed Angra Mainyu, the deadly, the Daeva of the Daevas.
And thus spake the evil-doer Angra Mainyu, the deadly: 'Druj,
rush down and kill him,' O holy Zarathushtra! The Druj came rushing
along, the demon Buiti, who is deceiving, unseen death.
2.
  Zarathushtra chanted aloud the Ahuna-Vairya: 'The will of
the Lord is the law of righteousness. The gifts of Vohu-mano to
the deeds done in this world for Mazda. He who relieves the poor
makes Ahura king.'  
He offered the sacrifice to the good waters of the good Daitya!
He recited the profession of the worshippers of Mazda!  
The Druj dismayed, rushed away, the demon Buiti, who is deceiving,
unseen death.
3.
  And the Druj said unto Angra Mainyu: 'Thou, tormenter, Angra
Mainyu! I see no way to kill Spitama Zarathushtra, so great is
the glory of the holy Zarathushtra.'  
Zarathushtra saw (all this) within his soul: 'The wicked, the
evil-doing Daevas (thought he) take counsel together for my death.'


			Ia.
4.
  Up started Zarathushtra, forward went Zarathushtra, unabated
by Akem-mano, by the hardness of his malignant riddles; he went
swinging stones in his hand, stones as big as a house, which he
obtained from the Maker, Ahura Mazda, he the holy Zarathushtra.
  
'Whereat on this wide, round earth, whose ends lie afar, whereat
dost thou swing (those stones), thou who standest by the upper
bank of the river Dareja, in the mansion of Pourushaspa?'
5.
  Thus Zarathushtra answered Angra Mainyu: 'O evil-doer, Angra
Mainyu! I will smite the creation of the Daeva; I will smite the
Nasu, a creature of the Daeva; I will smite the Pairika Knathaiti,
till the victorious Saoshyant come up to life out of the lake
Kasava, from the region of the dawn, from the regions of the dawn.'
6.
  Again to him said the Maker of the evil world, Angra Mainyu:
'Do not destroy my creatures, O holy Zarathushtra! Thou art the
son of Pourushaspa; by thy mother I was invoked. Renounce the
good Religion of the worshippers of Mazda, and thou shalt gain
such a boon as Vadhaghna gained, the ruler of the nations.'
7.
  Spitama Zarathushtra said in answer: 'No! never will I renounce
the good Religion of the worshippers of Mazda, either for body
or life, though they should tear away the breath!'
8.
  Again to him said the Maker of the evil world, Angra Mainyu:
'By whose Word wilt thou strike, by whose Word wilt thou repel,
by whose weapon will the good creatures (strike and repel) my
creation, who am Angra Mainyu?'
9.
  Spitama Zarathushtra said in answer: 'The sacred mortar, the
sacred cups, the Haoma, the Word taught by Mazda, these are my
weapons, my best weapons! By this Word will I strike, by this
Word will I repel, by this weapon will the good creatures (strike
and repel thee), O evil-doer, Angra Mainyu! The Good Spirit made
the creation; he made it in the boundless Time. The Amesha-Spentas
made the creation, the good, the wise Sovereigns.'
10.
  Zarathushtra chanted aloud the Ahuna-Vairya.  
The holy Zarathushtra said aloud: 'This I ask thee: teach me the
truth, O Lord! ...'


			II.
11.
  Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! [he was sitting
by the upper bank of the Dareja, before Ahura Mazda, before the
good Vohu-mana, before Asha Vahista, Khshathra Vairya, and Spenta
Armaiti;]
12.
  'How shall I free the world from that Druj, from that evil-doer,
Angra Mainyu? How shall I drive away direct defilement? How indirect
defilement? How shall I drive the Nasu from the house of the worshippers
of Mazda? How shall I cleanse the faithful man? How shall I cleanse
the faithful woman?'
13.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Invoke, O Zarathushtra! the good Religion
of Mazda.  
'Invoke, O Zarathushtra! though thou see them not, the Amesha-Spentas
who rule over the seven Karshvares of the earth.  
'Invoke, O Zarathushtra! the sovereign Heaven, the boundless Time,
and Vayu, whose action is most high.  
'Invoke, O Zarathushtra! the powerful Wind, made by Mazda; and
Spenta [Armaiti], the fair daughter of Ahura Mazda.
14.
  'Invoke, O Zarathushtra! my Fravashi, who am Ahura Mazda,
the greatest, the best, the fairest of all beings, the most solid,
the most intelligent, the best shapen, the highest in holiness,
and whose soul is the holy Word!  
'Invoke, O Zarathushtra! this creation of mine, who am Ahura Mazda.'
15.
  Zarathushtra imitated my words from me, (and said): 'I invoke
the holy creation of Ahura Mazda.  
'I invoke Mithra, the lord of the rolling countryside, a god armed
with beautiful weapons, with the most glorious of all weapons,
with the most victorious of all weapons.  
'I invoke the holy, well-formed Sraosha', who wields a club in
his hand, to bear upon the heads of the fiends'.
16.
  'I invoke the most glorious Holy Word.  
'I invoke the sovereign Heaven, the boundless Time, and Vayu,
whose action is most high.  
'I invoke the mighty Wind, made by Mazda, and Spenta (Armaiti),
the fair daughter of Ahura Mazda.  
'I invoke the good Religion of Mazda, the fiend-destroying Law
of Zarathushtra.'


			III.
17.
  Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Maker of the good world,
Ahura Mazda! With what manner of sacrifice shall I worship, with
what manner of sacrifice shall I make people worship this creation
of Ahura Mazda?'
18.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Go, O Spitama Zarathushtra! towards
the high-growing trees, and before one of them that is beautiful,
high-growing, and mighty, say thou these words: "Hail to
thee! O good, holy tree, made by Mazda! Ashem vohu!"
19.
  '[The priest] shall cut off a twig of Baresma, long as an
aesha, thick as a yava. The faithful one, holding it in his left
hand, shall keep his eyes upon it without ceasing, whilst he is
offering up to Ahura Mazda and to the Amesha-Spentas, the high
and beautiful golden Haomas, and Good Thought and the good Rata,
made by Mazda, holy and excellent.'


			IV.
20.
  Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O thou, all-knowing Ahura
Mazda! thou art never asleep, never intoxicated, thou Ahura Mazda!
Vohu-mano gets directly defiled: Vohu-mano gets indirectly defiled;
the Daevas defile him from the bodies smitten by the Daevas: let
Vohu-mano be made clean.'
21.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Thou shalt take some gomez from a bull
ungelded and such as the law requires it. Thou shalt take the
man who is to be cleansed to the field made by Ahura, and the
man that is to cleanse him shall draw the furrows.
22.
  'He shall recite a hundred Ashem vohu: "Holiness is the
best of all good: it is also happiness. Happy the man who is holy
with perfect holiness!"  
'He shall chant two hundred Ahuna-Vairya: "The will of the
Lord is the law of righteousness. The gifts of Vohu-mano to the
deeds done in this world for Mazda! He who relieves the poor makes
Ahura king."  
'He shall wash himself four times with the gomez from the ox,
and twice with the water made by Mazda.
23.
  'Thus Vohu-mano shall be made clean, and clean shall be the
man. The man shall take up Vohu-mano with the left arm and the
right, with the right arm and the left: and thou shalt lay down
Vohu-mano under the mighty light of the heavens by the light of
the stars made by the gods, until nine nights have passed away.
24.
  'When nine nights have passed away, thou shalt bring libations
unto the fire, thou shalt bring hard wood unto the fire, thou
shalt bring incense of Vohu-gaona unto the fire, and thou shalt
perfume Vohu-mano therewith.
25.
  'Thus shall Vohu-mano be made clean, and clean shall be the
man. He shall take up Vohu-mano with the right arm and the left,
with the left arm and the right, and Vohu-mano shall say aloud:
"Glory be to Ahura Mazda! Glory be to the Amesha-Spentas!
Glory be to all the other holy beings."'


			V.
26.
  Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O thou all-knowing Ahura
Mazda: Should I urge upon the godly man, should I urge upon the
godly woman, should I urge upon the wicked Daeva-worshipper who
lives in sin, to give the earth made by Ahura, the water that
runs, the corn that grows, and all the rest of their wealth?'
  
Ahura Mazda answered: 'Thou shouldst, O holy Zarathushtra.'
27.
  O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Where are the
rewards given? Where does the rewarding take place? Where is the
rewarding fulfilled? Whereto do men come to take the reward that,
during their life in the material world, they have won for their
souls?
28.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'When the man is dead, when his time
is over, then the wicked, evil-doing Daevas cut off his eyesight.
On the third night, when the dawn appears and brightens up, when
Mithra, the god with beautiful weapons, reaches the all-happy
mountains, and the sun is rising:
29.
  'Then the fiend, named Vizaresha, O Spitama Zarathushtra,
carries off in bonds the souls of the wicked Daeva-worshippers
who live in sin. The soul enters the way made by Time, and open
both to the wicked and to the righteous. At the head of the Chinwad
bridge, the holy bridge made by Mazda, they ask for their spirits
and souls the reward for the worldly goods which they gave away
here below.
30.
  'Then comes the beautiful, well-shapen, strong and well-formed
maid, with the dogs at her sides, one who can distinguish, who
has many children, happy, and of high understanding.  
'She makes the soul of the righteous one go up above the Hara-berezaiti;
above the Chinwad bridge she places it in the presence of the
heavenly gods themselves.
31.
  'Up rises Vohu-mano from his golden seat; Vohu-mano exclaims:
"How hast thou come to us, thou Holy One, from that decaying
world into this undecaying one?"
32.
  'Gladly pass the souls of the righteous to the golden seat
of Ahura Mazda, to the golden seat of the Amesha-Spentas, to the
Garo-nmanem, the abode of Ahura Mazda, the abode of the Amesha-Spentas,
the abode of all the other holy beings.
33.
  'As to the godly man that has been cleansed, the wicked evil-doing
Daevas tremble at the perfume of his soul after death, as doth
a sheep on which a wolf is pouncing.
34.
  'The souls of the righteous are gathered together there: Nairyo-sangha
is with them; a messenger of Ahura Mazda is Nairyo-sangha.


			IIa.
  'Invoke, O Zarathushtra! this very creation of Ahura Mazda.'
35.
  Zarathushtra imitated those words of mine: 'I invoke the holy
world, made by Ahura Mazda.  
'I invoke the earth made by Ahura, the water made by Mazda, the
holy trees.  
'I invoke the sea Vouru-kasha.

  'Offer up the sacrifice to the holy Sraosha, that the holy

Thrita, the First Healer.

1.
  Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Who was he
who first of the healers, of the wise, the happy, the wealthy,
the glorious, the strong, the Paradhatas, drove back sickness
to sickness, drove back death to death; and first turned away
the point of the sword and the fire of fever from the bodies of
mortals?'
2.
  Ahura Mazda answered: 'Thrita it was who first of the healers,
of the wise, the happy, the wealthy, the glorious, the strong,
the Paradhatas, drove back sickness to sickness, drove back death
to death, and first turned away the point of the sword and the
fire of fever from the bodies of mortals.

  'He asked for a source of remedies; he obtained it from Khshathra-Vairya,
to withstand sickness and to withstand death; to withstand pain
and to withstand fever; to withstand Sarana and to withstand Sarastya;
to withstand Azana and to withstand Azahva; to withstand Kurugha
and. to withstand Azivaka; to withstand Duruka and to 'withstand
Astairya; to withstand the evil eye, rottenness, and infection
which Angra Mainyu had created against the bodies of mortals.

many hundreds, by many thousands, by many myriads, grow up all
