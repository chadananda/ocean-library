<H1>Tehillim &nbsp; <small><i>(Psalms)</i></small></h2>

<p><b>1,1</b> Happy is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked, <b>{N}</b><br>nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful.<br>
<b>1,2</b> But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in His law doth he meditate day and night.<br>
<b>1,3</b> And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, <b>{N}</b><br>that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf doth not wither; and in whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper.<br>
<b>1,4</b> Not so the wicked; but they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.<br>
<b>1,5</b> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br>
<b>1,6</b> For the LORD regardeth the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>2,1</b> Why are the nations in an uproar? And why do the peoples mutter in vain?<br>
<b>2,2</b> The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together, <b>{N}</b><br>against the LORD, and against His anointed:<br>
<b>2,3</b> 'Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.'<br>
<b>2,4</b> He that sitteth in heaven laugheth, the Lord hath them in derision.<br>
<b>2,5</b> Then will He speak unto them in His wrath, and affright them in His sore displeasure:<br>
<b>2,6</b> 'Truly it is I that have established My king upon Zion, My holy mountain.'<br>
<b>2,7</b> I will tell of the decree: the LORD said unto me: 'Thou art My son, this day have I begotten thee.<br>
<b>2,8</b> Ask of Me, and I will give the nations for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy possession.<br>
<b>2,9</b> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.'<br>
<b>2,10</b> Now therefore, O ye kings, be wise; be admonished, ye judges of the earth.<br>
<b>2,11</b> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.<br>
<b>2,12</b> Do homage in purity, lest He be angry, and ye perish in the way, when suddenly His wrath is kindled. <b>{N}</b><br>Happy are all they that take refuge in Him. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>3,1</b> A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.<br>
<b>3,2</b> LORD, how many are mine adversaries become! Many are they that rise up against me.<br>
<b>3,3</b> Many there are that say of my soul: 'There is no salvation for him in God.' Selah<br>
<b>3,4</b> But thou, O LORD, art a shield about me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.<br>
<b>3,5</b> With my voice I call unto the LORD, and He answereth me out of His holy mountain. Selah<br>
<b>3,6</b> I lay me down, and I sleep; I awake, for the LORD sustaineth me.<br>
<b>3,7</b> I am not afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.<br>
<b>3,8</b> Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God; for Thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek, <b>{N}</b><br>Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.<br>
<b>3,9</b> Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; Thy blessing be upon Thy people. Selah <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>4,1</b> For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of David.<br>
<b>4,2</b> Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness, Thou who didst set me free when I was in distress; be gracious unto me, and hear my prayer.<br>
<b>4,3</b> O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be put to shame, in that ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah<br>
<b>4,4</b> But know that the LORD hath set apart the godly man as His own; the LORD will hear when I call unto Him.<br>
<b>4,5</b> Tremble, and sin not; commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah<br>
<b>4,6</b> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.<br>
<b>4,7</b> Many there are that say: 'Oh that we could see some good!' LORD, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us.<br>
<b>4,8</b> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than when their corn and their wine increase.<br>
<b>4,9</b> In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; for Thou, LORD, makest me dwell alone in safety. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>5,1</b> For the Leader; upon the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.<br>
<b>5,2</b> Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.<br>
<b>5,3</b> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; for unto Thee do I pray.<br>
<b>5,4</b> O LORD, in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice; in the morning will I order my prayer unto Thee, and will look forward.<br>
<b>5,5</b> For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; evil shall not sojourn with Thee.<br>
<b>5,6</b> The boasters shall not stand in Thy sight; Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.<br>
<b>5,7</b> Thou destroyest them that speak falsehood; the LORD abhorreth the man of blood and of deceit.<br>
<b>5,8</b> But as for me, in the abundance of Thy lovingkindness will I come into Thy house; I will bow down toward Thy holy temple in the fear of Thee.<br>
<b>5,9</b> O LORD, lead me in Thy righteousness because of them that lie in wait for me; make Thy way straight before my face.<br>
<b>5,10</b> For there is no sincerity in their mouth; their inward part is a yawning gulf, their throat is an open sepulchre; they make smooth their tongue.<br>
<b>5,11</b> Hold them guilty, O God, let them fall by their own counsels; <b>{N}</b><br>cast them down in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against Thee.<br>
<b>5,12</b> So shall all those that take refuge in Thee rejoice, they shall ever shout for joy, and Thou shalt shelter them; <b>{N}</b><br>let them also that love Thy name exult in Thee.<br>
<b>5,13</b> For Thou dost bless the righteous; O LORD, Thou dost encompass him with favour as with a shield. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>6,1</b> For the Leader; with string-music; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.<br>
<b>6,2</b> O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy wrath.<br>
<b>6,3</b> Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I languish away; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are affrighted.<br>
<b>6,4</b> My soul also is sore affrighted; and Thou, O LORD, how long?<br>
<b>6,5</b> Return, O LORD, deliver my soul; save me for Thy mercy's sake.<br>
<b>6,6</b> For in death there is no remembrance of Thee; in the nether-world who will give Thee thanks?<br>
<b>6,7</b> I am weary with my groaning; every night make I my bed to swim; I melt away my couch with my tears.<br>
<b>6,8</b> Mine eye is dimmed because of vexation; it waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.<br>
<b>6,9</b> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.<br>
<b>6,10</b> The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD receiveth my prayer.<br>
<b>6,11</b> All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore affrighted; they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>7,1</b> Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning Cush a Benjamite.<br>
<b>7,2</b> O LORD my God, in Thee have I taken refuge; save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me;<br>
<b>7,3</b> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.<br>
<b>7,4</b> O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;<br>
<b>7,5</b> If I have requited him that did evil unto me, or spoiled mine adversary unto emptiness;<br>
<b>7,6</b> Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it, and tread my life down to the earth; yea, let him lay my glory in the dust. Selah<br>
<b>7,7</b> Arise, O LORD, in Thine anger, lift up Thyself in indignation against mine adversaries; yea, awake for me at the judgment which Thou hast commanded.<br>
<b>7,8</b> And let the congregation of the peoples compass Thee about, and over them return Thou on high.<br>
<b>7,9</b> O LORD, who ministerest judgment to the peoples, judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.<br>
<b>7,10</b> Oh that a full measure of evil might come upon the wicked, and that Thou wouldest establish the righteous; <b>{N}</b><br>for the righteous God trieth the heart and reins.<br>
<b>7,11</b> My shield is with God, who saveth the upright in heart.<br>
<b>7,12</b> God is a righteous judge, yea, a God that hath indignation every day:<br>
<b>7,13</b> If a man turn not, He will whet His sword, He hath bent His bow, and made it ready;<br>
<b>7,14</b> He hath also prepared for him the weapons of death, yea, His arrows which He made sharp.<br>
<b>7,15</b> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; yea, he conceiveth mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood.<br>
<b>7,16</b> He hath digged a pit, and hollowed it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.<br>
<b>7,17</b> His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate.<br>
<b>7,18</b> I will give thanks unto the LORD according to His righteousness; and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>8,1</b> For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of David.<br>
<b>8,2</b> O LORD, our Lord, how glorious is Thy name in all the earth! <b>{N}</b><br>whose majesty is rehearsed above the heavens.<br>
<b>8,3</b> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou founded strength, <b>{N}</b><br>because of Thine adversaries; that Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.<br>
<b>8,4</b> When I behold Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, <b>{N}</b><br>the moon and the stars, which Thou hast established;<br>
<b>8,5</b> What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that Thou thinkest of him?<br>
<b>8,6</b> Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.<br>
<b>8,7</b> Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:<br>
<b>8,8</b> Sheep and oxen, all of them, yea, and the beasts of the field;<br>
<b>8,9</b> The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea; whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.<br>
<b>8,10</b> O LORD, our Lord, how glorious is Thy name in all the earth! <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>9,1</b> For the Leader; upon Muthlabben. A Psalm of David.<br>
<b>9,2</b> I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart; I will tell of all Thy marvellous works.<br>
<b>9,3</b> I will be glad and exult in Thee; I will sing praise to Thy name, O Most High:<br>
<b>9,4</b> When mine enemies are turned back, they stumble and perish at Thy presence;<br>
<b>9,5</b> For Thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sattest upon the throne as the righteous Judge.<br>
<b>9,6</b> Thou hast rebuked the nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked, Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.<br>
<b>9,7</b> O thou enemy, the waste places are come to an end for ever; and the cities which thou didst uproot, their very memorial is perished.<br>
<b>9,8</b> But the LORD is enthroned for ever; He hath established His throne for judgment.<br>
<b>9,9</b> And He will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples with equity.<br>
<b>9,10</b> The LORD also will be a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble;<br>
<b>9,11</b> And they that know Thy name will put their trust in Thee; for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek Thee.<br>
<b>9,12</b> Sing praises to the LORD, who dwelleth in Zion; declare among the peoples His doings.<br>
<b>9,13</b> For He that avengeth blood hath remembered them; He hath not forgotten the cry of the humble.<br>
<b>9,14</b> Be gracious unto me, O LORD, behold mine affliction at the hands of them that hate me; Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;<br>
<b>9,15</b> That I may tell of all Thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion, that I may rejoice in Thy salvation.<br>
<b>9,16</b> The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made; in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.<br>
<b>9,17</b> The LORD hath made Himself known, He hath executed judgment, the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah<br>
<b>9,18</b> The wicked shall return to the nether-world, even all the nations that forget God.<br>
<b>9,19</b> For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.<br>
<b>9,20</b> Arise, O LORD, let not man prevail; let the nations be judged in Thy sight.<br>
<b>9,21</b> Set terror over them, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>10,1</b> Why standest Thou afar off, O LORD? Why hidest Thou Thyself in times of trouble?<br>
<b>10,2</b> Through the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued, they are taken in the devices that they have imagined.<br>
<b>10,3</b> For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and the covetous vaunteth himself, though he contemn the LORD.<br>
<b>10,4</b> The wicked, in the pride of his countenance [, saith]: 'He will not require'; all his thoughts are: 'There is no God.'<br>
<b>10,5</b> His ways prosper at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight; as for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.<br>
<b>10,6</b> He saith in his heart: 'I shall not be moved, I who to all generations shall not be in adversity.'<br>
<b>10,7</b> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.<br>
<b>10,8</b> He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; in secret places doth he slay the innocent; his eyes are on the watch for the helpless.<br>
<b>10,9</b> He lieth in wait in a secret place as a lion in his lair, he lieth in wait to catch the poor; <b>{N}</b><br>he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him up in his net.<br>
<b>10,10</b> He croucheth, he boweth down, and the helpless fall into his mighty claws.<br>
<b>10,11</b> He hath said in his heart: 'God hath forgotten; He hideth His face; He will never see.'<br>
<b>10,12</b> Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up Thy hand; forget not the humble.<br>
<b>10,13</b> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, and say in his heart: 'Thou wilt not require'?<br>
<b>10,14</b> Thou hast seen; for Thou beholdest trouble and vexation, to requite them with Thy hand; <b>{N}</b><br>unto Thee the helpless committeth himself; Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.<br>
<b>10,15</b> Break Thou the arm of the wicked; and as for the evil man, search out his wickedness, till none be found.<br>
<b>10,16</b> The LORD is King for ever and ever; the nations are perished out of His land.<br>
<b>10,17</b> LORD, Thou hast heard the desire of the humble: Thou wilt direct their heart, Thou wilt cause Thine ear to attend;<br>
<b>10,18</b> To right the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is of the earth may be terrible no more. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>11,1</b> For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David. <b>{N}</b><br>In the LORD have I taken refuge; how say ye to my soul: 'Flee thou! to your mountain, ye birds'?<br>
<b>11,2</b> For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, they have made ready their arrow upon the string, <b>{N}</b><br>that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.<br>
<b>11,3</b> When the foundations are destroyed, what hath the righteous wrought?<br>
<b>11,4</b> The LORD is in His holy temple, the LORD, His throne is in heaven; <b>{N}</b><br>His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men.<br>
<b>11,5</b> The LORD trieth the righteous; but the wicked and him that loveth violence His soul hateth.<br>
<b>11,6</b> Upon the wicked He will cause to rain coals; fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.<br>
<b>11,7</b> For the LORD is righteous, He loveth righteousness; the upright shall behold His face. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>12,1</b> For the Leader; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.<br>
<b>12,2</b> Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.<br>
<b>12,3</b> They speak falsehood every one with his neighbour; with flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.<br>
<b>12,4</b> May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things!<br>
<b>12,5</b> Who have said: 'Our tongue will we make mighty; our lips are with us: who is lord over us?'<br>
<b>12,6</b> 'For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, <b>{N}</b><br>now will I arise', saith the LORD; 'I will set him in safety at whom they puff.'<br>
<b>12,7</b> The words of the LORD are pure words, <b>{N}</b><br>as silver tried in a crucible on the earth, refined seven times.<br>
<b>12,8</b> Thou wilt keep them, O LORD; Thou wilt preserve us from this generation for ever.<br>
<b>12,9</b> The wicked walk on every side, when vileness is exalted among the sons of men. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>13,1</b> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<br>
<b>13,2</b> How long, O LORD, wilt Thou forget me for ever? How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me?<br>
<b>13,3</b> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart by day? <b>{N}</b><br>How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?<br>
<b>13,4</b> Behold Thou, and answer me, O LORD my God; lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;<br>
<b>13,5</b> Lest mine enemy say: 'I have prevailed against him'; lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.<br>
<b>13,6</b> But as for me, in Thy mercy do I trust; my heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation. <b>{N}</b><br>I will sing unto the LORD, because He hath dealt bountifully with me. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>14,1</b> For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David. <b>{N}</b><br>The fool hath said in his heart: 'There is no God'; <b>{N}</b><br>they have dealt corruptly, they have done abominably; there is none that doeth good.<br>
<b>14,2</b> The LORD looked forth from heaven upon the children of men, <b>{N}</b><br>to see if there were any man of understanding, that did seek after God.<br>
<b>14,3</b> They are all corrupt, they are together become impure; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br>
<b>14,4</b> 'Shall not all the workers of iniquity know it, who eat up My people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD?'<br>
<b>14,5</b> There are they in great fear; for God is with the righteous generation.<br>
<b>14,6</b> Ye would put to shame the counsel of the poor, but the LORD is his refuge.<br>
<b>14,7</b> Oh that the salvation of Israel <b>{N}</b><br>were come out of Zion! When the LORD turneth the captivity of His people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>15,1</b> A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell upon Thy holy mountain?<br>
<b>15,2</b> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh truth in his heart;<br>
<b>15,3</b> That hath no slander upon his tongue, nor doeth evil to his fellow, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour;<br>
<b>15,4</b> In whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he honoureth them that fear the LORD; <b>{N}</b><br>he that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;<br>
<b>15,5</b> He that putteth not out his money on interest, nor taketh a bribe against the innocent. <b>{N}</b><br>He that doeth these things shall never be moved. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>16,1</b> Michtam of David. Keep me, O God; for I have taken refuge in Thee.<br>
<b>16,2</b> I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art my Lord; I have no good but in Thee';<br>
<b>16,3</b> As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all my delight.<br>
<b>16,4</b> Let the idols of them be multiplied that make suit unto another; <b>{N}</b><br>their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take their names upon my lips.<br>
<b>16,5</b> O LORD, the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup, Thou maintainest my lot.<br>
<b>16,6</b> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.<br>
<b>16,7</b> I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel; yea, in the night seasons my reins instruct me.<br>
<b>16,8</b> I have set the LORD always before me; surely He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.<br>
<b>16,9</b> Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in safety;<br>
<b>16,10</b> For Thou wilt not abandon my soul to the nether-world; neither wilt Thou suffer Thy godly one to see the pit.<br>
<b>16,11</b> Thou makest me to know the path of life; <b>{N}</b><br>in Thy presence is fulness of joy, in Thy right hand bliss for evermore. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>17,1</b> A Prayer of David. <b>{N}</b><br>Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry; give ear unto my prayer <b>{N}</b><br>from lips without deceit.<br>
<b>17,2</b> Let my judgment come forth from Thy presence; let Thine eyes behold equity.<br>
<b>17,3</b> Thou hast tried my heart, Thou hast visited it in the night; Thou hast tested me, and Thou findest not <b>{N}</b><br>that I had a thought which should not pass my mouth.<br>
<b>17,4</b> As for the doings of men, by the word of Thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent.<br>
<b>17,5</b> My steps have held fast to Thy paths, my feet have not slipped.<br>
<b>17,6</b> As for me, I call upon Thee, for Thou wilt answer me, O God; incline Thine ear unto me, hear my speech.<br>
<b>17,7</b> Make passing great Thy mercies, O Thou that savest by Thy right hand from assailants them that take refuge in Thee.<br>
<b>17,8</b> Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me in the shadow of Thy wings,<br>
<b>17,9</b> From the wicked that oppress, my deadly enemies, that compass me about.<br>
<b>17,10</b> Their gross heart they have shut tight, with their mouth they speak proudly.<br>
<b>17,11</b> At our every step they have now encompassed us; they set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.<br>
<b>17,12</b> He is like a lion that is eager to tear in pieces, and like a young lion lurking in secret places.<br>
<b>17,13</b> Arise, O LORD, confront him, cast him down; <b>{N}</b><br>deliver my soul from the wicked, by Thy sword;<br>
<b>17,14</b> From men, by Thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, <b>{N}</b><br>whose portion is in this life, and whose belly Thou fillest with Thy treasure; <b>{N}</b><br>who have children in plenty, and leave their abundance to their babes.<br>
<b>17,15</b> As for me, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>18,1</b> For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD, <b>{N}</b><br>who spoke unto the LORD the words of this song <b>{N}</b><br>in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul;<br>
<b>18,2</b> And he said: I love thee, O LORD, my strength.<br>
<b>18,3</b> The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; <b>{N}</b><br>my God, my rock, in Him I take refuge; my shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower.<br>
<b>18,4</b> Praised, I cry, is the LORD, and I am saved from mine enemies.<br>
<b>18,5</b> The cords of Death compassed me, and the floods of Belial assailed me.<br>
<b>18,6</b> The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of Death confronted me.<br>
<b>18,7</b> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God; <b>{N}</b><br>out of His temple He heard my voice, and my cry came before Him unto His ears.<br>
<b>18,8</b> Then the earth did shake and quake, the foundations also of the mountains did tremble; <b>{N}</b><br>they were shaken, because He was wroth.<br>
<b>18,9</b> Smoke arose up in His nostrils, and fire out of His mouth did devour; <b>{N}</b><br>coals flamed forth from Him.<br>
<b>18,10</b> He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and thick darkness was under His feet.<br>
<b>18,11</b> And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, He did swoop down upon the wings of the wind.<br>
<b>18,12</b> He made darkness His hiding-place, His pavilion round about Him; <b>{N}</b><br>darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.<br>
<b>18,13</b> At the brightness before Him, there passed through His thick clouds hailstones and coals of fire.<br>
<b>18,14</b> The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High gave forth His voice; hailstones and coals of fire.<br>
<b>18,15</b> And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them; and He shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them.<br>
<b>18,16</b> And the channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid bare, <b>{N}</b><br>at Thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils.<br>
<b>18,17</b> He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.<br>
<b>18,18</b> He delivered me from mine enemy most strong, and from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.<br>
<b>18,19</b> They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was a stay unto me.<br>
<b>18,20</b> He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because He delighted in me.<br>
<b>18,21</b> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me.<br>
<b>18,22</b> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.<br>
<b>18,23</b> For all His ordinances were before me, and I put not away His statutes from me.<br>
<b>18,24</b> And I was single-hearted with Him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.<br>
<b>18,25</b> Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.<br>
<b>18,26</b> With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful, with the upright man Thou dost show Thyself upright;<br>
<b>18,27</b> With the pure Thou dost show Thyself pure; and with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle.<br>
<b>18,28</b> For Thou dost save the afflicted people; but the haughty eyes Thou dost humble.<br>
<b>18,29</b> For Thou dost light my lamp; the LORD my God doth lighten my darkness.<br>
<b>18,30</b> For by Thee I run upon a troop; and by my God do I scale a wall.<br>
<b>18,31</b> As for God, His way is perfect; <b>{N}</b><br>the word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him.<br>
<b>18,32</b> For who is God, save the LORD? And who is a Rock, except our God?<br>
<b>18,33</b> The God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way straight;<br>
<b>18,34</b> Who maketh my feet like hinds', and setteth me upon my high places;<br>

<b>18,37</b> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped.<br>
<b>18,38</b> I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them; neither did I turn back till they were consumed.<br>
<b>18,39</b> I have smitten them through, so that they are not able to rise; they are fallen under my feet.<br>
<b>18,40</b> For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.<br>
<b>18,41</b> Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, and I did cut off them that hate me.<br>
<b>18,42</b> They cried, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but He answered them not.<br>

<b>19,4</b> There is no speech, there are no words, neither is their voice heard.<br>
<b>19,5</b> Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. <b>{N}</b><br>In them hath He set a tent for the sun,<br>

<b>19,7</b> His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.<br>
<b>19,8</b> The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.<br>
<b>19,9</b> The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.<br>

<b>22,3</b> O my God, I call by day, but Thou answerest not; and at night, and there is no surcease for me.<br>
<b>22,4</b> Yet Thou art holy, O Thou that art enthroned upon the praises of Israel.<br>
<b>22,5</b> In Thee did our fathers trust; they trusted, and Thou didst deliver them.<br>
<b>22,6</b> Unto Thee they cried, and escaped; in Thee did they trust, and were not ashamed.<br>
<b>22,7</b> But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.<br>

<b>22,9</b> 'Let him commit himself unto the LORD! let Him rescue him; let Him deliver him, seeing He delighteth in him.'<br>
<b>22,10</b> For Thou art He that took me out of the womb; Thou madest me trust when I was upon my mother's breasts.<br>
<b>22,11</b> Upon Thee I have been cast from my birth; Thou art my God from my mother's womb.<br>
<b>22,12</b> Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.<br>

<b>32,5</b> I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid; <b>{N}</b><br>I said: 'I will make confession concerning my transgressions unto the LORD'-- <b>{N}</b><br>and Thou, Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah<br>
<b>32,6</b> For this let every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found; <b>{N}</b><br>surely, when the great waters overflow, they will not reach unto him.<br>
<b>32,7</b> Thou art my hiding-place; Thou wilt preserve me from the adversary; <b>{N}</b><br>with songs of deliverance Thou wilt compass me about. Selah<br>
<b>32,8</b> 'I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will give counsel, Mine eye being upon thee.'<br>
<b>32,9</b> Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; <b>{N}</b><br>whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, that they come not near unto thee.<br>
<b>32,10</b> Many are the sorrows of the wicked; but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy compasseth him about.<br>
<b>32,11</b> Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous; and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>33,1</b> Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous, praise is comely for the upright.<br>
<b>33,2</b> Give thanks unto the LORD with harp, sing praises unto Him with the psaltery of ten strings.<br>
<b>33,3</b> Sing unto Him a new song; play skilfully amid shouts of joy.<br>
<b>33,4</b> For the word of the LORD is upright; and all His work is done in faithfulness.<br>
<b>33,5</b> He loveth righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the lovingkindness of the LORD.<br>
<b>33,6</b> By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.<br>
<b>33,7</b> He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap; He layeth up the deeps in storehouses.<br>
<b>33,8</b> Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.<br>
<b>33,9</b> For He spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood.<br>
<b>33,10</b> The LORD bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought; He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.<br>
<b>33,11</b> The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations.<br>
<b>33,12</b> Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD; the people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance.<br>
<b>33,13</b> The LORD looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men;<br>
<b>33,14</b> From the place of His habitation He looketh intently upon all the inhabitants of the earth;<br>
<b>33,15</b> He that fashioneth the hearts of them all, that considereth all their doings.<br>
<b>33,16</b> A king is not saved by the multitude of a host; a mighty man is not delivered by great strength.<br>
<b>33,17</b> A horse is a vain thing for safety; neither doth it afford escape by its great strength.<br>
<b>33,18</b> Behold, the eye of the LORD is toward them that fear Him, toward them that wait for His mercy;<br>
<b>33,19</b> To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.<br>
<b>33,20</b> Our soul hath waited for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.<br>
<b>33,21</b> For in Him doth our heart rejoice, because we have trusted in His holy name.<br>

<p><b>34,1</b> [A Psalm] of David; when he changed his demeanour before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.<br>

<b>34,3</b> My soul shall glory in the LORD; the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.<br>
<b>34,4</b> O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt His name together.<br>
<b>34,5</b> I sought the LORD, and He answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.<br>
<b>34,6</b> They looked unto Him, and were radiant; and their faces shall never be abashed.<br>
<b>34,7</b> This poor man cried, and the LORD heard, and saved him out of all his troubles.<br>
<b>34,8</b> The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.<br>
<b>34,9</b> O consider and see that the LORD is good; happy is the man that taketh refuge in Him.<br>
<b>34,10</b> O fear the LORD, ye His holy ones; for there is no want to them that fear Him.<br>
<b>34,11</b> The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek the LORD want not any good thing.<br>
<b>34,12</b> Come, ye children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.<br>
<b>34,13</b> Who is the man that desireth life, and loveth days, that he may see good therein?<br>
<b>34,14</b> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.<br>
<b>34,15</b> Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.<br>
<b>34,16</b> The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, and His ears are open unto their cry.<br>
<b>34,17</b> The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.<br>
<b>34,18</b> They cried, and the LORD heard, and delivered them out of all their troubles.<br>
<b>34,19</b> The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.<br>
<b>34,20</b> Many are the ills of the righteous, but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.<br>
<b>34,21</b> He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken.<br>
<b>34,22</b> Evil shall kill the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall be held guilty.<br>

<p><b>35,1</b> A Psalm of David. Strive, O LORD, with them that strive with me; fight against them that fight against me.<br>
<b>35,2</b> Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise up to my help.<br>
<b>35,3</b> Draw out also the spear, and the battle-axe, against them that pursue me; say unto my soul: 'I am Thy salvation.'<br>
<b>35,4</b> Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion that seek after my soul; let them be turned back and be abashed that devise my hurt.<br>
<b>35,5</b> Let them be as chaff before the wind, the angel of the LORD thrusting them.<br>
<b>35,6</b> Let their way be dark and slippery, the angel of the LORD pursuing them.<br>
<b>35,7</b> For without cause have they hid for me the pit, even their net, without cause have they digged for my soul.<br>
<b>35,8</b> Let destruction come upon him unawares; <b>{N}</b><br>and let his net that he hath hid catch himself; with destruction let him fall therein.<br>
<b>35,9</b> And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD; it shall rejoice in His salvation.<br>
<b>35,10</b> All my bones shall say: 'LORD, who is like unto Thee, <b>{N}</b><br>who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?'<br>
<b>35,11</b> Unrighteous witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that I know not.<br>
<b>35,12</b> They repay me evil for good; bereavement is come to my soul.<br>
<b>35,13</b> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth, I afflicted my soul with fasting; <b>{N}</b><br>and my prayer, may it return into mine own bosom.<br>
<b>35,14</b> I went about as though it had been my friend or my brother; I bowed down mournful, as one that mourneth for his mother.<br>
<b>35,15</b> But when I halt they rejoice, and gather themselves together; <b>{N}</b><br>the abjects gather themselves together against me, and those whom I know not; <b>{N}</b><br>they tear me, and cease not;<br>
<b>35,16</b> With the profanest mockeries of backbiting they gnash at me with their teeth.<br>
<b>35,17</b> Lord, how long wilt Thou look on? <b>{N}</b><br>Rescue my soul from their destructions, mine only one from the lions.<br>
<b>35,18</b> I will give Thee thanks in the great congregation; I will praise Thee among a numerous people.<br>
<b>35,19</b> Let not them that are wrongfully mine enemies rejoice over me; neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.<br>
<b>35,20</b> For they speak not peace; but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.<br>
<b>35,21</b> Yea, they open their mouth wide against me; they say: 'Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.'<br>
<b>35,22</b> Thou hast seen, O LORD; keep not silence; O Lord, be not far from me.<br>
<b>35,23</b> Rouse Thee, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.<br>
<b>35,24</b> Judge me, O LORD my God, according to Thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.<br>
<b>35,25</b> Let them not say in their heart: 'Aha, we have our desire'; let them not say: 'We have swallowed him up.'<br>
<b>35,26</b> Let them be ashamed and abashed together that rejoice at my hurt; <b>{N}</b><br>let them be clothed with shame and confusion that magnify themselves against me.<br>
<b>35,27</b> Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that delight in my righteousness; <b>{N}</b><br>yea, let them say continually: 'Magnified be the LORD, who delighteth in the peace of His servant.'<br>

<p><b>36,1</b> For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD.<br>
<b>36,2</b> Transgression speaketh to the wicked, methinks--there is no fear of God before his eyes.<br>
<b>36,3</b> For it flattereth him in his eyes, until his iniquity be found, and he be hated.<br>
<b>36,4</b> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; he hath left off to be wise, to do good.<br>
<b>36,5</b> He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.<br>
<b>36,6</b> Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, is in the heavens; Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies.<br>
<b>36,7</b> Thy righteousness is like the mighty mountains; Thy judgments are like the great deep; man and beast Thou preservest, O LORD.<br>
<b>36,8</b> How precious is Thy lovingkindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Thy wings.<br>
<b>36,9</b> They are abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Thy house; and Thou makest them drink of the river of Thy pleasures.<br>
<b>36,10</b> For with Thee is the fountain of life; in Thy light do we see light.<br>
<b>36,11</b> O continue Thy lovingkindness unto them that know Thee; and Thy righteousness to the upright in heart.<br>
<b>36,12</b> Let not the foot of pride overtake me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.<br>
<b>36,13</b> There are the workers of iniquity fallen; they are thrust down, and are not able to rise. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>37,1</b> [A Psalm] of David. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness.<br>
<b>37,2</b> For they shall soon wither like the grass, and fade as the green herb.<br>
<b>37,3</b> Trust in the LORD, and do good; dwell in the land, and cherish faithfulness.<br>
<b>37,4</b> So shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and He shall give thee the petitions of thy heart.<br>
<b>37,5</b> Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in Him, and He will bring it to pass.<br>
<b>37,6</b> And He will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, and thy right as the noonday.<br>
<b>37,7</b> Resign thyself unto the LORD, and wait patiently for Him; <b>{N}</b><br>fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.<br>
<b>37,8</b> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing.<br>
<b>37,9</b> For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait for the LORD, they shall inherit the land.<br>
<b>37,10</b> And yet a little while, and the wicked is no more; yea, thou shalt look well at his place, and he is not.<br>
<b>37,11</b> But the humble shall inherit the land, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<br>
<b>37,12</b> The wicked plotteth against the righteous, and gnasheth at him with his teeth.<br>
<b>37,13</b> The Lord doth laugh at him; for He seeth that his day is coming.<br>
<b>37,14</b> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow; <b>{N}</b><br>to cast down the poor and needy, to slay such as are upright in the way;<br>
<b>37,15</b> Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.<br>
<b>37,16</b> Better is a little that the righteous hath than the abundance of many wicked.<br>
<b>37,17</b> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.<br>
<b>37,18</b> The LORD knoweth the days of them that are wholehearted; and their inheritance shall be for ever.<br>
<b>37,19</b> They shall not be ashamed in the time of evil; and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.<br>
<b>37,20</b> For the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs--they shall pass away in smoke, they shall pass away.<br>
<b>37,21</b> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not; but the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.<br>
<b>37,22</b> For such as are blessed of Him shall inherit the land; and they that are cursed of Him shall be cut off.<br>
<b>37,23</b> It is of the LORD that a man's goings are established; and He delighted in his way.<br>
<b>37,24</b> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the LORD upholdeth his hand.<br>
<b>37,25</b> I have been young, and now am old; <b>{N}</b><br>yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.<br>
<b>37,26</b> All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.<br>
<b>37,27</b> Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.<br>
<b>37,28</b> For the LORD loveth justice, and forsaketh not His saints; they are preserved for ever; <b>{N}</b><br>but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
<b>37,29</b> The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.<br>
<b>37,30</b> The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, and his tongue speaketh justice.<br>
<b>37,31</b> The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps slide.<br>
<b>37,32</b> The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.<br>
<b>37,33</b> The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor suffer him to be condemned when he is judged.<br>
<b>37,34</b> Wait for the LORD, and keep His way, and He will exalt thee to inherit the land; <b>{N}</b><br>when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.<br>
<b>37,35</b> I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a leafy tree in its native soil.<br>
<b>37,36</b> But one passed by, and, lo, he was not; yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.<br>
<b>37,37</b> Mark the man of integrity, and behold the upright; for there is a future for the man of peace.<br>
<b>37,38</b> But transgressors shall be destroyed together; the future of the wicked shall be cut off.<br>
<b>37,39</b> But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.<br>
<b>37,40</b> And the LORD helpeth them, and delivereth them; He delivereth them from the wicked, and saveth them, because they have taken refuge in Him. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>38,1</b> A Psalm of David, to make memorial.<br>
<b>38,2</b> O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine anger; neither chasten me in Thy wrath.<br>
<b>38,3</b> For Thine arrows are gone deep into me, and Thy hand is come down upon me.<br>
<b>38,4</b> There is no soundness in my flesh because of Thine indignation; neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.<br>
<b>38,5</b> For mine iniquities are gone over my head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.<br>
<b>38,6</b> My wounds are noisome, they fester, because of my foolishness.<br>
<b>38,7</b> I am bent and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day.<br>
<b>38,8</b> For my loins are filled with burning; and there is no soundness in my flesh.<br>
<b>38,9</b> I am benumbed and sore crushed; I groan by reason of the moaning of my heart.<br>
<b>38,10</b> Lord, all my desire is before Thee; and my sighing is not hid from Thee.<br>
<b>38,11</b> My heart fluttereth, my strength faileth me; as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.<br>
<b>38,12</b> My friends and my companions stand aloof from my plague; and my kinsmen stand afar off.<br>
<b>38,13</b> They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; and they that seek my hurt speak crafty devices, and utter deceits all the day.<br>
<b>38,14</b> But I am as a deaf man, I hear not; and I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.<br>
<b>38,15</b> Yea, I am become as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no arguments.<br>
<b>38,16</b> For in Thee, O LORD, do I hope; Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God.<br>
<b>38,17</b> For I said: 'Lest they rejoice over me; when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.'<br>
<b>38,18</b> For I am ready to halt, and my pain is continually before me.<br>
<b>38,19</b> For I do declare mine iniquity; I am full of care because of my sin.<br>
<b>38,20</b> But mine enemies are strong in health; and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.<br>
<b>38,21</b> They also that repay evil for good are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.<br>
<b>38,22</b> Forsake me not, O LORD; O my God, be not far from me.<br>

<p><b>39,1</b> For the Leader, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.<br>
<b>39,2</b> I said: 'I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue; <b>{N}</b><br>I will keep a curb upon my mouth, while the wicked is before me.'<br>
<b>39,3</b> I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, had no comfort; and my pain was held in check.<br>
<b>39,4</b> My heart waxed hot within me; while I was musing, the fire kindled; then spoke I with my tongue:<br>
<b>39,5</b> 'LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; let me know how short-lived I am.<br>
<b>39,6</b> Behold, Thou hast made my days as hand-breadths; and mine age is as nothing before Thee; <b>{N}</b><br>surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah<br>
<b>39,7</b> Surely man walketh as a mere semblance; surely for vanity they are in turmoil; <b>{N}</b><br>he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.<br>
<b>39,8</b> And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope, it is in Thee.<br>
<b>39,9</b> Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the base.<br>
<b>39,10</b> I am dumb, I open not my mouth; because Thou hast done it.<br>
<b>39,11</b> Remove Thy stroke from off me; I am consumed by the blow of Thy hand.<br>
<b>39,12</b> With rebukes dost Thou chasten man for iniquity, and like a moth Thou makest his beauty to consume away; <b>{N}</b><br>surely every man is vanity. Selah<br>
<b>39,13</b> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; <b>{N}</b><br>keep not silence at my tears; <b>{N}</b><br>for I am a stranger with Thee, a sojourner, as all my fathers were.<br>

<p><b>40,1</b> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<br>
<b>40,2</b> I waited patiently for the LORD; and He inclined unto me, and heard my cry.<br>
<b>40,3</b> He brought me up also out of the tumultuous pit, out of the miry clay; <b>{N}</b><br>and He set my feet upon a rock, He established my goings.<br>
<b>40,4</b> And He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God; <b>{N}</b><br>many shall see, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.<br>
<b>40,5</b> Happy is the man that hath made the LORD his trust, <b>{N}</b><br>and hath not turned unto the arrogant, nor unto such as fall away treacherously.<br>
<b>40,6</b> Many things hast Thou done, O LORD my God, <b>{N}</b><br>even Thy wonderful works, and Thy thoughts toward us; <b>{N}</b><br>there is none to be compared unto Thee! If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be told.<br>
<b>40,7</b> Sacrifice and meal-offering Thou hast no delight in; mine ears hast Thou opened; <b>{N}</b><br>burnt-offering and sin-offering hast Thou not required.<br>
<b>40,8</b> Then said I: 'Lo, I am come with the roll of a book which is prescribed for me;<br>
<b>40,9</b> I delight to do Thy will, O my God; yea, Thy law is in my inmost parts.'<br>
<b>40,10</b> I have preached righteousness in the great congregation, lo, I did not refrain my lips; <b>{N}</b><br>O LORD, Thou knowest.<br>
<b>40,11</b> I have not hid Thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation; <b>{N}</b><br>I have not concealed Thy mercy and Thy truth from the great congregation.<br>
<b>40,12</b> Thou, O LORD, wilt not withhold Thy compassions from me; <b>{N}</b><br>let Thy mercy and Thy truth continually preserve me.<br>
<b>40,13</b> For innumerable evils have compassed me about, <b>{N}</b><br>mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; <b>{N}</b><br>they are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.<br>
<b>40,14</b> Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me.<br>
<b>40,15</b> Let them be ashamed and abashed together that seek after my soul to sweep it away; <b>{N}</b><br>let them be turned backward and brought to confusion that delight in my hurt.<br>
<b>40,16</b> Let them be appalled by reason of their shame that say unto me: 'Aha, aha.'<br>
<b>40,17</b> Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; <b>{N}</b><br>let such as love Thy salvation say continually: 'The LORD be magnified.'<br>
<b>40,18</b> But, as for me, that am poor and needy, the Lord will account it unto me; <b>{N}</b><br>Thou art my help and my deliverer; O my God, tarry not. <b>{P}</b></p>

<b>41,4</b> The LORD support him upon the bed of illness; mayest Thou turn all his lying down in his sickness.<br>
<b>41,5</b> As for me, I said: 'O LORD, be gracious unto me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee.'<br>
<b>41,6</b> Mine enemies speak evil of me: 'When shall he die, and his name perish?'<br>
<b>41,7</b> And if one come to see me, he speaketh falsehood; his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he speaketh of it.<br>
<b>41,8</b> All that hate me whisper together against me, against me do they devise my hurt:<br>
<b>41,9</b> 'An evil thing cleaveth fast unto him; and now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.'<br>
<b>41,10</b> Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread, <b>{N}</b><br>hath lifted up his heel against me.<br>
<b>41,11</b> But Thou, O LORD, be gracious unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.<br>
<b>41,12</b> By this I know that Thou delightest in me, that mine enemy doth not triumph over me.<br>

<b>43,3</b> O send out Thy light and Thy truth; let them lead me; <b>{N}</b><br>let them bring me unto Thy holy mountain, and to Thy dwelling-places.<br>
<b>43,4</b> Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God, my exceeding joy; <b>{N}</b><br>and praise Thee upon the harp, O God, my God.<br>
<b>43,5</b> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why moanest thou within me? <b>{N}</b><br>Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>44,1</b> For the Leader; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil.<br>
<b>44,2</b> O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us; <b>{N}</b><br>a work Thou didst in their days, in the days of old.<br>
<b>44,3</b> Thou with Thy hand didst drive out the nations, and didst plant them in; <b>{N}</b><br>Thou didst break the peoples, and didst spread them abroad.<br>
<b>44,4</b> For not by their own sword did they get the land in possession, neither did their own arm save them; <b>{N}</b><br>but Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance, because Thou wast favourable unto them.<br>
<b>44,5</b> Thou art my King, O God; command the salvation of Jacob.<br>
<b>44,6</b> Through Thee do we push down our adversaries; through Thy name do we tread them under that rise up against us.<br>
<b>44,7</b> For I trust not in my bow, neither can my sword save me.<br>
<b>44,8</b> But Thou hast saved us from our adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us.<br>
<b>44,9</b> In God have we gloried all the day, and we will give thanks unto Thy name for ever. Selah<br>
<b>44,10</b> Yet Thou hast cast off, and brought us to confusion; and goest not forth with our hosts.<br>
<b>44,11</b> Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; and they that hate us spoil at their will.<br>
<b>44,12</b> Thou hast given us like sheep to be eaten; and hast scattered us among the nations.<br>
<b>44,13</b> Thou sellest Thy people for small gain, and hast not set their prices high.<br>
<b>44,14</b> Thou makest us a taunt to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.<br>
<b>44,15</b> Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.<br>
<b>44,16</b> All the day is my confusion before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,<br>
<b>44,17</b> For the voice of him that taunteth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the revengeful.<br>
<b>44,18</b> All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten Thee, neither have we been false to Thy covenant.<br>
<b>44,19</b> Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from Thy path;<br>
<b>44,20</b> Though Thou hast crushed us into a place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.<br>
<b>44,21</b> If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god;<br>
<b>44,22</b> Would not God search this out? For He knoweth the secrets of the heart.<br>
<b>44,23</b> Nay, but for Thy sake are we killed all the day; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.<br>
<b>44,24</b> Awake, why sleepest Thou, O Lord? Arouse Thyself, cast not off for ever.<br>
<b>44,25</b> Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?<br>
<b>44,26</b> For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly cleaveth unto the earth.<br>
<b>44,27</b> Arise for our help, and redeem us for Thy mercy's sake. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>45,1</b> For the Leader; upon Shoshannim; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves.<br>
<b>45,2</b> My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter; I say: 'My work is concerning a king'; <b>{N}</b><br>my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.<br>
<b>45,3</b> Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured upon thy lips; <b>{N}</b><br>therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.<br>
<b>45,4</b> Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, thy glory and thy majesty.<br>
<b>45,5</b> And in thy majesty prosper, ride on, in behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness; <b>{N}</b><br>and let thy right hand teach thee tremendous things.<br>
<b>45,6</b> Thine arrows are sharp--the peoples fall under thee--[they sink] into the heart of the king's enemies.<br>
<b>45,7</b> Thy throne given of God is for ever and ever; a sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.<br>
<b>45,8</b> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; <b>{N}</b><br>therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br>
<b>45,9</b> Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia are all thy garments; out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.<br>
<b>45,10</b> Kings' daughters are among thy favourites; at thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.<br>
<b>45,11</b> 'Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;<br>
<b>45,12</b> So shall the king desire thy beauty; for he is thy lord; and do homage unto him.<br>
<b>45,13</b> And, O daughter of Tyre, the richest of the people shall entreat thy favour with a gift.'<br>
<b>45,14</b> All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace; her raiment is of chequer work inwrought with gold.<br>
<b>45,15</b> She shall be led unto the king on richly woven stuff; the virgins her companions in her train being brought unto thee.<br>
<b>45,16</b> They shall be led with gladness and rejoicing; they shall enter into the king's palace.<br>
<b>45,17</b> Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons, whom thou shalt make princes in all the land.<br>
<b>45,18</b> I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations; therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever and ever. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>46,1</b> For the Leader; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah; upon Alamoth. A Song.<br>
<b>46,2</b> God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.<br>
<b>46,3</b> Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, and though the mountains be moved into the heart of the seas;<br>
<b>46,4</b> Though the waters thereof roar and foam, though the mountains shake at the swelling thereof. Selah<br>
<b>46,5</b> There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, the holiest dwelling-place of the Most High.<br>
<b>46,6</b> God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her, at the approach of morning.<br>
<b>46,7</b> Nations were in tumult, kingdoms were moved; He uttered His voice, the earth melted.<br>
<b>46,8</b> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high tower. Selah<br>
<b>46,9</b> Come, behold the works of the LORD, who hath made desolations in the earth.<br>
<b>46,10</b> He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; <b>{N}</b><br>He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; He burneth the chariots in the fire.<br>
<b>46,11</b> 'Let be, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.'<br>
<b>46,12</b> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high tower. Selah <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>47,1</b> For the Leader; a Psalm for the sons of Korah.<br>
<b>47,2</b> O clap your hands, all ye peoples; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.<br>
<b>47,3</b> For the LORD is most high, awful; a great King over all the earth.<br>
<b>47,4</b> He subdueth peoples under us, and nations under our feet.<br>
<b>47,5</b> He chooseth our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob whom He loveth. Selah<br>
<b>47,6</b> God is gone up amidst shouting, the LORD amidst the sound of the horn.<br>
<b>47,7</b> Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises.<br>
<b>47,8</b> For God is the King of all the earth; sing ye praises in a skilful song.<br>
<b>47,9</b> God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon His holy throne.<br>
<b>47,10</b> The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham; <b>{N}</b><br>for unto God belong the shields of the earth; He is greatly exalted. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>48,1</b> A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.<br>
<b>48,2</b> Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised, in the city of our God, His holy mountain,<br>
<b>48,3</b> Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth; <b>{N}</b><br>even mount Zion, the uttermost parts of the north, the city of the great King.<br>
<b>48,4</b> God in her palaces hath made Himself known for a stronghold.<br>
<b>48,5</b> For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, they came onward together.<br>
<b>48,6</b> They saw, straightway they were amazed; they were affrighted, they hasted away.<br>
<b>48,7</b> Trembling took hold of them there, pangs, as of a woman in travail.<br>
<b>48,8</b> With the east wind Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish.<br>
<b>48,9</b> As we have heard, so have we seen <b>{N}</b><br>in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God-- <b>{N}</b><br>God establish it for ever. Selah<br>
<b>48,10</b> We have thought on Thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of Thy temple.<br>
<b>48,11</b> As is Thy name, O God, so is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth; <b>{N}</b><br>Thy right hand is full of righteousness.<br>

<p><b>49,1</b> For the Leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.<br>
<b>49,2</b> Hear this, all ye peoples; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,<br>
<b>49,3</b> Both low and high, rich and poor together.<br>
<b>49,4</b> My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.<br>
<b>49,5</b> I will incline mine ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying upon the harp.<br>
<b>49,6</b> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my supplanters compasseth me about,<br>
<b>49,7</b> Of them that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches?<br>
<b>49,8</b> No man can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him--<br>
<b>49,9</b> For too costly is the redemption of their soul, and must be let alone for ever--<br>
<b>49,10</b> That he should still live alway, that he should not see the pit.<br>
<b>49,11</b> For he seeth that wise men die, the fool and the brutish together perish, <b>{N}</b><br>and leave their wealth to others.<br>
<b>49,12</b> Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling-places to all generations; <b>{N}</b><br>they call their lands after their own names.<br>
<b>49,13</b> But man abideth not in honour; he is like the beasts that perish.<br>
<b>49,14</b> This is the way of them that are foolish, and of those who after them approve their sayings. Selah<br>
<b>49,15</b> Like sheep they are appointed for the nether-world; death shall be their shepherd; <b>{N}</b><br>and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their form shall be for the nether-world to wear away, that there be no habitation for it.<br>
<b>49,16</b> But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether-world; for He shall receive me. Selah<br>
<b>49,17</b> Be not thou afraid when one waxeth rich, when the wealth of his house is increased;<br>
<b>49,18</b> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; his wealth shall not descend after him.<br>
<b>49,19</b> Though while he lived he blessed his soul: 'Men will praise thee, when thou shalt do well to thyself';<br>
<b>49,20</b> It shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see the light.<br>
<b>49,21</b> Man that is in honour understandeth not; he is like the beasts that perish. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>50,1</b> A Psalm of Asaph. <b>{N}</b><br>God, God, the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth <b>{N}</b><br>from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.<br>

<b>50,3</b> Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence; <b>{N}</b><br>a fire devoureth before Him, and round about Him it stormeth mightily.<br>
<b>50,4</b> He calleth to the heavens above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people:<br>
<b>50,5</b> 'Gather My saints together unto Me; those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.'<br>
<b>50,6</b> And the heavens declare His righteousness; for God, He is judge. Selah<br>
<b>50,7</b> 'Hear, O My people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: <b>{N}</b><br>God, thy God, am I.<br>
<b>50,8</b> I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; and thy burnt-offerings are continually before Me.<br>
<b>50,9</b> I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds.<br>
<b>50,10</b> For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.<br>
<b>50,11</b> I know all the fowls of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field are Mine.<br>
<b>50,12</b> If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is Mine, and the fulness thereof.<br>
<b>50,13</b> Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?<br>
<b>50,14</b> Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the Most High;<br>

<b>50,18</b> When thou sawest a thief, thou hadst company with him, and with adulterers was thy portion.<br>

<b>50,20</b> Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.<br>
<b>50,21</b> These things hast thou done, and should I have kept silence? Thou hadst thought that I was altogether such a one as thyself; <b>{N}</b><br>but I will reprove thee, and set the cause before thine eyes.<br>
<b>50,22</b> Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear in pieces, and there be none to deliver.<br>

<b>51,5</b> For I know my transgressions; and my sin is ever before me.<br>
<b>51,6</b> Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in Thy sight; <b>{N}</b><br>that Thou mayest be justified when Thou speakest, and be in the right when Thou judgest.<br>
<b>51,7</b> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br>
<b>51,8</b> Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts; make me, therefore, to know wisdom in mine inmost heart.<br>
<b>51,9</b> Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>
<b>51,10</b> Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which Thou hast crushed may rejoice.<br>

<b>51,18</b> For Thou delightest not in sacrifice, else would I give it; Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.<br>
<b>51,19</b> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; <b>{N}</b><br>a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.<br>
<b>51,20</b> Do good in Thy favour unto Zion; build Thou the walls of Jerusalem.<br>
<b>51,21</b> Then wilt Thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt-offering and whole offering; <b>{N}</b><br>then will they offer bullocks upon Thine altar. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>52,1</b> For the Leader. Maschil of David;<br>
<b>52,2</b> when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, <b>{N}</b><br>and said unto him: 'David is come to the house of Ahimelech.'<br>
<b>52,3</b> Why boastest thou thyself of evil, O mighty man? The mercy of God endureth continually.<br>
<b>52,4</b> Thy tongue deviseth destruction; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.<br>
<b>52,5</b> Thou lovest evil more than good; falsehood rather than speaking righteousness. Selah<br>
<b>52,6</b> Thou lovest all devouring words, the deceitful tongue.<br>
<b>52,7</b> God will likewise break thee for ever, <b>{N}</b><br>He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah<br>

<b>52,9</b> 'Lo, this is the man that made not God his stronghold; <b>{N}</b><br>but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.'<br>
<b>52,10</b> But as for me, I am like a leafy olive-tree in the house of God; <b>{N}</b><br>I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.<br>

<b>53,2</b> The fool hath said in his heart: 'There is no God'; <b>{N}</b><br>they have dealt corruptly, and have done abominable iniquity; there is none that doeth good.<br>
<b>53,3</b> God looked forth from heaven upon the children of men, <b>{N}</b><br>to see if there were any man of understanding, that did seek after God.<br>
<b>53,4</b> Every one of them is unclean, they are together become impure; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br>

<p><b>54,1</b> For the Leader; with string-music. Maschil of David:<br>

<b>54,3</b> O God, save me by Thy name, and right me by Thy might.<br>
<b>54,4</b> O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.<br>
<b>54,5</b> For strangers are risen up against me, and violent men have sought after my soul; <b>{N}</b><br>they have not set God before them. Selah<br>

<p><b>55,1</b> For the Leader; with string-music. Maschil of David.<br>
<b>55,2</b> Give ear, O God, to my prayer; and hide not Thyself from my supplication.<br>
<b>55,3</b> Attend unto me, and hear me; I am distraught in my complaint, and will moan;<br>

<b>55,16</b> May He incite death against them, let them go down alive into the nether-world; for evil is in their dwelling, and within them.<br>
<b>55,17</b> As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.<br>
<b>55,18</b> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I complain, and moan; and He hath heard my voice.<br>
<b>55,19</b> He hath redeemed my soul in peace so that none came nigh me; for they were many that strove with me.<br>
<b>55,20</b> God shall hear, and humble them, even He that is enthroned of old, Selah <b>{N}</b><br>such as have no changes, and fear not God.<br>

<b>55,22</b> Smoother than cream were the speeches of his mouth, but his heart was war; <b>{N}</b><br>his words were softer than oil, yet were they keen-edged swords.<br>
<b>55,23</b> Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and He will sustain thee; <b>{N}</b><br>He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.<br>
<b>55,24</b> But Thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the nethermost pit; <b>{N}</b><br>men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days; <b>{N}</b><br>but as for me, I will trust in Thee. <b>{P}</b></p>

<b>57,7</b> They have prepared a net for my steps, my soul is bowed down; <b>{N}</b><br>they have digged a pit before me, they are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. Selah<br>

<p><b>58,1</b> For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam.<br>
<b>58,2</b> Do ye indeed speak as a righteous company? Do ye judge with equity the sons of men?<br>
<b>58,3</b> Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh out in the earth the violence of your hands.<br>
<b>58,4</b> The wicked are estranged from the womb; the speakers of lies go astray as soon as they are born.<br>
<b>58,5</b> Their venom is like the venom of a serpent; they are like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ear;<br>
<b>58,6</b> Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, or of the most cunning binder of spells.<br>
<b>58,7</b> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth; break out the cheek-teeth of the young lions, O LORD.<br>
<b>58,8</b> Let them melt away as water that runneth apace; <b>{N}</b><br>when he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.<br>
<b>58,9</b> Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away; like the untimely births of a woman, that have not seen the sun.<br>
<b>58,10</b> Before your pots can feel the thorns, He will sweep it away with a whirlwind, the raw and the burning alike.<br>
<b>58,11</b> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.<br>
<b>58,12</b> And men shall say: 'Verily there is a reward for the righteous; verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.' <b>{P}</b></p>

<b>59,3</b> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from the men of blood.<br>
<b>59,4</b> For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; the impudent gather themselves together against me; <b>{N}</b><br>not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.<br>
<b>59,5</b> Without my fault, they run and prepare themselves; awake Thou to help me, and behold.<br>
<b>59,6</b> Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, arouse Thyself to punish all the nations; <b>{N}</b><br>show no mercy to any iniquitous traitors. Selah<br>

<b>59,10</b> Because of his strength, I will wait for Thee; for God is my high tower.<br>
<b>59,11</b> The God of my mercy will come to meet me; God will let me gaze upon mine adversaries.<br>
<b>59,12</b> Slay them not, lest my people forget, make them wander to and fro by Thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield.<br>
<b>59,13</b> For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, <b>{N}</b><br>let them even be taken in their pride, and for cursing and lying which they speak.<br>
<b>59,14</b> Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they be no more; <b>{N}</b><br>and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, unto the ends of the earth. Selah<br>
<b>59,15</b> And they return at evening, they howl like a dog, and go round about the city;<br>
<b>59,16</b> They wander up and down to devour, and tarry all night if they have not their fill.<br>
<b>59,17</b> But as for me, I will sing of Thy strength; yea, I will sing aloud of Thy mercy in the morning; <b>{N}</b><br>for Thou hast been my high tower, and a refuge in the day of my distress.<br>

<b>60,4</b> Thou hast made the land to shake, Thou hast cleft it; heal the breaches thereof; for it tottereth.<br>
<b>60,5</b> Thou hast made Thy people to see hard things; Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering.<br>
<b>60,6</b> Thou hast given a banner to them that fear Thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah<br>
<b>60,7</b> That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and answer me.<br>
<b>60,8</b> God spoke in His holiness, that I would exult; that I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.<br>
<b>60,9</b> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.<br>
<b>60,10</b> Moab is my washpot; upon Edom do I cast my shoe; Philistia, cry aloud because of me!<br>
<b>60,11</b> Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me unto Edom?<br>
<b>60,12</b> Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.<br>

<b>61,3</b> From the end of the earth will I call unto Thee, when my heart fainteth; <b>{N}</b><br>lead me to a rock that is too high for me.<br>
<b>61,4</b> For Thou hast been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy.<br>
<b>61,5</b> I will dwell in Thy Tent for ever; I will take refuge in the covert of Thy wings. Selah<br>
<b>61,6</b> For Thou, O God, hast heard my vows; Thou hast granted the heritage of those that fear Thy name.<br>

<b>62,2</b> Only for God doth my soul wait in stillness; from Him cometh my salvation.<br>

<b>62,4</b> How long will ye set upon a man, that ye may slay him, all of you, <b>{N}</b><br>as a leaning wall, a tottering fence?<br>
<b>62,5</b> They only devise to thrust him down from his height, delighting in lies; <b>{N}</b><br>they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah<br>
<b>62,6</b> Only for God wait thou in stillness, my soul; for from Him cometh my hope.<br>
<b>62,7</b> He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower, I shall not be moved.<br>

<b>62,10</b> Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; <b>{N}</b><br>if they be laid in the balances, they are together lighter than vanity.<br>
<b>62,11</b> Trust not in oppression, and put not vain hope in robbery; <b>{N}</b><br>if riches increase, set not your heart thereon.<br>
<b>62,12</b> God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this: that strength belongeth unto God;<br>

<b>64,4</b> Who have whet their tongue like a sword, and have aimed their arrow, a poisoned word;<br>
<b>64,5</b> That they may shoot in secret places at the blameless; suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.<br>
<b>64,6</b> They encourage one another in an evil matter; they converse of laying snares secretly; <b>{N}</b><br>they ask, who would see them.<br>
<b>64,7</b> They search out iniquities, they have accomplished a diligent search; <b>{N}</b><br>even in the inward thought of every one, and the deep heart.<br>
<b>64,8</b> But God doth shoot at them with an arrow suddenly; thence are their wounds.<br>
<b>64,9</b> So they make their own tongue a stumbling unto themselves; all that see them shake the head.<br>
<b>64,10</b> And all men fear; and they declare the work of God, and understand His doing.<br>
<b>64,11</b> The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall take refuge in Him; and all the upright in heart shall glory. <b>{P}</b></p>

<b>66,5</b> Come, and see the works of God; He is terrible in His doing toward the children of men.<br>

<b>68,8</b> O God, when Thou wentest forth before Thy people, when Thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah<br>

<b>69,5</b> They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; <b>{N}</b><br>they that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are many; should I restore that which I took not away?<br>
<b>69,6</b> O God, Thou knowest my folly; and my trespasses are not hid from Thee.<br>
<b>69,7</b> Let not them that wait for Thee be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; <b>{N}</b><br>let not those that seek Thee be brought to confusion through me, O God of Israel.<br>
<b>69,8</b> Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach; confusion hath covered my face.<br>
<b>69,9</b> I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.<br>
<b>69,10</b> Because zeal for Thy house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that reproach Thee are fallen upon me.<br>
<b>69,11</b> And I wept with my soul fasting, and that became unto me a reproach.<br>
<b>69,12</b> I made sackcloth also my garment, and I became a byword unto them.<br>

<b>71,5</b> For Thou art my hope; O Lord GOD, my trust from my youth.<br>
<b>71,6</b> Upon Thee have I stayed myself from birth; Thou art He that took me out of my mother's womb; my praise is continually of Thee.<br>
<b>71,7</b> I am as a wonder unto many; but Thou art my strong refuge.<br>
<b>71,8</b> My mouth shall be filled with Thy praise, and with Thy glory all the day.<br>
<b>71,9</b> Cast me not off in the time of old age; when my strength faileth, forsake me not.<br>
<b>71,10</b> For mine enemies speak concerning me, and they that watch for my soul take counsel together,<br>
<b>71,11</b> Saying: 'God hath forsaken him; pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.'<br>
<b>71,12</b> O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me.<br>
<b>71,13</b> Let them be ashamed and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and confusion that seek my hurt.<br>
<b>71,14</b> But as for me, I will hope continually, and will praise Thee yet more and more.<br>
<b>71,15</b> My mouth shall tell of Thy righteousness, and of Thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.<br>
<b>71,16</b> I will come with Thy mighty acts, O Lord GOD; I will make mention of Thy righteousness, even of Thine only.<br>
<b>71,17</b> O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth; and until now do I declare Thy wondrous works.<br>
<b>71,18</b> And even unto old age and hoary hairs, O God, forsake me not; <b>{N}</b><br>until I have declared Thy strength unto the next generation, Thy might to every one that is to come.<br>
<b>71,19</b> Thy righteousness also, O God, which reacheth unto high heaven; <b>{N}</b><br>Thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto Thee?<br>
<b>71,20</b> Thou, who hast made me to see many and sore troubles, <b>{N}</b><br>wilt quicken me again, and bring me up again from the depths of the earth.<br>
<b>71,21</b> Thou wilt increase my greatness, and turn and comfort me.<br>
<b>71,22</b> I also will give thanks unto Thee with the psaltery, even unto Thy truth, O my God; <b>{N}</b><br>I will sing praises unto Thee with the harp, O Thou Holy One of Israel.<br>
<b>71,23</b> My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing praises unto Thee; and my soul, which Thou hast redeemed.<br>
<b>71,24</b> My tongue also shall tell of Thy righteousness all the day; <b>{N}</b><br>for they are ashamed, for they are abashed, that seek my hurt. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>72,1</b> [A Psalm] of Solomon. Give the king Thy judgments, O God, and Thy righteousness unto the king's son;<br>
<b>72,2</b> That he may judge Thy people with righteousness, and Thy poor with justice.<br>
<b>72,3</b> Let the mountains bear peace to the people, and the hills, through righteousness.<br>
<b>72,4</b> May he judge the poor of the people, and save the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor.<br>
<b>72,5</b> They shall fear Thee while the sun endureth, and so long as the moon, throughout all generations.<br>

<p><b>73,1</b> A Psalm of Asaph. <b>{N}</b><br>Surely God is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart.<br>
<b>73,2</b> But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.<br>
<b>73,3</b> For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<br>
<b>73,4</b> For there are no pangs at their death, and their body is sound.<br>
<b>73,5</b> In the trouble of man they are not; neither are they plagued like men.<br>
<b>73,6</b> Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; violence covereth them as a garment.<br>
<b>73,7</b> Their eyes stand forth from fatness; they are gone beyond the imaginations of their heart.<br>
<b>73,8</b> They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression; they speak as if there were none on high.<br>
<b>73,9</b> They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.<br>
<b>73,10</b> Therefore His people return hither; and waters of fullness are drained out by them.<br>
<b>73,11</b> And they say: 'How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?'<br>
<b>73,12</b> Behold, such are the wicked; and they that are always at ease increase riches.<br>
<b>73,13</b> Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocency;<br>
<b>73,14</b> For all the day have I been plagued, and my chastisement came every morning.<br>
<b>73,15</b> If I had said: 'I will speak thus', behold, I had been faithless to the generation of Thy children.<br>
<b>73,16</b> And when I pondered how I might know this, it was wearisome in mine eyes;<br>
<b>73,17</b> Until I entered into the sanctuary of God, and considered their end.<br>
<b>73,18</b> Surely Thou settest them in slippery places; Thou hurlest them down to utter ruin.<br>
<b>73,19</b> How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are wholly consumed by terrors.<br>
<b>73,20</b> As a dream when one awaketh, so, O Lord, when Thou arousest Thyself, Thou wilt despise their semblance.<br>
<b>73,21</b> For my heart was in a ferment, and I was pricked in my reins.<br>
<b>73,22</b> But I was brutish, and ignorant; I was as a beast before Thee.<br>
<b>73,23</b> Nevertheless I am continually with Thee; Thou holdest my right hand.<br>
<b>73,24</b> Thou wilt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me with glory.<br>
<b>73,25</b> Whom have I in heaven but Thee? And beside Thee I desire none upon earth.<br>
<b>73,26</b> My flesh and my heart faileth; but God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever.<br>
<b>73,27</b> For, lo, they that go far from Thee shall perish; Thou dost destroy all them that go astray from Thee.<br>
<b>73,28</b> But as for me, the nearness of God is my good; <b>{N}</b><br>I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all Thy works. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>74,1</b> Maschil of Asaph. <b>{N}</b><br>Why, O God, hast Thou cast us off for ever? Why doth Thine anger smoke against the flock of Thy pasture?<br>
<b>74,2</b> Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast gotten of old, which Thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of Thine inheritance; <b>{N}</b><br>and mount Zion, wherein Thou hast dwelt.<br>
<b>74,3</b> Lift up Thy steps because of the perpetual ruins, even all the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.<br>
<b>74,4</b> Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of Thy meeting-place; they have set up their own signs for signs.<br>
<b>74,5</b> It seemed as when men wield upwards axes in a thicket of trees.<br>
<b>74,6</b> And now all the carved work thereof together they strike down with hatchet and hammers.<br>
<b>74,7</b> They have set Thy sanctuary on fire; they have profaned the dwelling-place of Thy name even to the ground.<br>
<b>74,8</b> They said in their heart: 'Let us make havoc of them altogether'; they have burned up all the meeting-places of God in the land.<br>
<b>74,9</b> We see not our signs; there is no more any prophet; neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.<br>
<b>74,10</b> How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme Thy name for ever?<br>
<b>74,11</b> Why withdrawest Thou Thy hand, even Thy right hand? Draw it out of Thy bosom and consume them.<br>
<b>74,12</b> Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.<br>
<b>74,13</b> Thou didst break the sea in pieces by Thy strength; Thou didst shatter the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.<br>
<b>74,14</b> Thou didst crush the heads of leviathan, Thou gavest him to be food to the folk inhabiting the wilderness.<br>
<b>74,15</b> Thou didst cleave fountain and brook; Thou driedst up ever-flowing rivers.<br>
<b>74,16</b> Thine is the day, Thine also the night; Thou hast established luminary and sun.<br>
<b>74,17</b> Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; Thou hast made summer and winter.<br>
<b>74,18</b> Remember this, how the enemy hath reproached the LORD, and how a base people have blasphemed Thy name.<br>
<b>74,19</b> O deliver not the soul of Thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast; forget not the life of Thy poor for ever.<br>
<b>74,20</b> Look upon the covenant; for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.<br>
<b>74,21</b> O let not the oppressed turn back in confusion; let the poor and needy praise Thy name.<br>
<b>74,22</b> Arise, O God, plead Thine own cause; remember Thy reproach all the day at the hand of the base man.<br>
<b>74,23</b> Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries, the tumult of those that rise up against Thee which ascendeth continually. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>75,1</b> For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.<br>
<b>75,2</b> We give thanks unto Thee, O God, we give thanks, and Thy name is near; men tell of Thy wondrous works.<br>
<b>75,3</b> 'When I take the appointed time, I Myself will judge with equity.<br>
<b>75,4</b> When the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved, I Myself establish the pillars of it.' Selah<br>
<b>75,5</b> I say unto the arrogant: 'Deal not arrogantly'; and to the wicked: 'Lift not up the horn.'<br>
<b>75,6</b> Lift not up your horn on high; speak not insolence with a haughty neck.<br>
<b>75,7</b> For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the wilderness, cometh lifting up.<br>
<b>75,8</b> For God is judge; He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.<br>
<b>75,9</b> For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, with foaming wine, full of mixture, and He poureth out of the same; <b>{N}</b><br>surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.<br>
<b>75,10</b> But as for me, I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.<br>
<b>75,11</b> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>76,1</b> For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.<br>
<b>76,2</b> In Judah is God known; His name is great in Israel.<br>
<b>76,3</b> In Salem also is set His tabernacle, and His dwelling-place in Zion.<br>
<b>76,4</b> There He broke the fiery shafts of the bow; the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah<br>
<b>76,5</b> Glorious art Thou and excellent, coming down from the mountains of prey.<br>
<b>76,6</b> The stout-hearted are bereft of sense, they sleep their sleep; <b>{N}</b><br>and none of the men of might have found their hands.<br>
<b>76,7</b> At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they are cast into a dead sleep, the riders also and the horses.<br>
<b>76,8</b> Thou, even Thou, art terrible; and who may stand in Thy sight when once Thou art angry?<br>
<b>76,9</b> Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,<br>
<b>76,10</b> When God arose to judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah<br>
<b>76,11</b> Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee; the residue of wrath shalt Thou gird upon Thee.<br>
<b>76,12</b> Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God; let all that are round about Him bring presents unto Him that is to be feared;<br>
<b>76,13</b> He minisheth the spirit of princes; He is terrible to the kings of the earth. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>77,1</b> For the Leader; for Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.<br>
<b>77,2</b> I will lift up my voice unto God, and cry; I will lift up my voice unto God, that He may give ear unto me.<br>
<b>77,3</b> In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; <b>{N}</b><br>with my hand uplifted, [mine eye] streameth in the night without ceasing; my soul refuseth to be comforted.<br>
<b>77,4</b> When I think thereon, O God, I must moan; when I muse thereon, my spirit fainteth. Selah<br>
<b>77,5</b> Thou holdest fast the lids of mine eyes; I am troubled, and cannot speak.<br>
<b>77,6</b> I have pondered the days of old, the years of ancient times.<br>
<b>77,7</b> In the night I will call to remembrance my song; I will commune with mine own heart; and my spirit maketh diligent search:<br>
<b>77,8</b> 'Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will He be favourable no more?<br>
<b>77,9</b> Is His mercy clean gone for ever? Is His promise come to an end for evermore?<br>
<b>77,10</b> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath He in anger shut up his compassions?' Selah<br>
<b>77,11</b> And I say: 'This is my weakness, that the right hand of the Most High could change.<br>
<b>77,12</b> I will make mention of the deeds of the LORD; yea, I will remember Thy wonders of old.<br>
<b>77,13</b> I will meditate also upon all Thy work, and muse on Thy doings.'<br>
<b>77,14</b> O God, Thy way is in holiness; who is a great god like unto God?<br>
<b>77,15</b> Thou art the God that doest wonders; Thou hast made known Thy strength among the peoples.<br>
<b>77,16</b> Thou hast with Thine arm redeemed Thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah<br>
<b>77,17</b> The waters saw Thee, O God; the waters saw Thee, they were in pain; the depths also trembled.<br>
<b>77,18</b> The clouds flooded forth waters; the skies sent out a sound; Thine arrows also went abroad.<br>
<b>77,19</b> The voice of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook.<br>
<b>77,20</b> Thy way was in the sea, and Thy path in the great waters, and Thy footsteps were not known.<br>
<b>77,21</b> Thou didst lead Thy people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>78,1</b> Maschil of Asaph. <b>{N}</b><br>Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<br>
<b>78,2</b> I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter dark sayings concerning days of old;<br>
<b>78,3</b> That which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us,<br>
<b>78,4</b> We will not hide from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, <b>{N}</b><br>and His strength, and His wondrous works that He hath done.<br>
<b>78,5</b> For He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, <b>{N}</b><br>which He commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;<br>
<b>78,6</b> That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; who should arise and tell them to their children,<br>
<b>78,7</b> That they might put their confidence in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments;<br>
<b>78,8</b> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; <b>{N}</b><br>a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.<br>
<b>78,9</b> The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow, that turned back in the day of battle.<br>
<b>78,10</b> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in His law;<br>
<b>78,11</b> And they forgot His doings, and His wondrous works that He had shown them.<br>
<b>78,12</b> Marvellous things did He in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<br>
<b>78,13</b> He cleaved the sea, and caused them to pass through; and He made the waters to stand as a heap.<br>
<b>78,14</b> By day also He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.<br>
<b>78,15</b> He cleaved rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep.<br>
<b>78,16</b> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.<br>
<b>78,17</b> Yet went they on still to sin against Him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.<br>
<b>78,18</b> And they tried God in their heart by asking food for their craving.<br>
<b>78,19</b> Yea, they spoke against God; they said: 'Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<br>
<b>78,20</b> Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; <b>{N}</b><br>can He give bread also? or will He provide flesh for His people?'<br>
<b>78,21</b> Therefore the LORD heard, and was wroth; <b>{N}</b><br>and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel;<br>
<b>78,22</b> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in His salvation.<br>
<b>78,23</b> And He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;<br>
<b>78,24</b> And He caused manna to rain upon them for food, and gave them of the corn of heaven.<br>
<b>78,25</b> Man did eat the bread of the mighty; He sent them provisions to the full.<br>
<b>78,26</b> He caused the east wind to set forth in heaven; and by His power He brought on the south wind.<br>
<b>78,27</b> He caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust, and winged fowl as the sand of the seas;<br>
<b>78,28</b> And He let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their dwellings.<br>
<b>78,29</b> So they did eat, and were well filled; and He gave them that which they craved.<br>
<b>78,30</b> They were not estranged from their craving, their food was yet in their mouths,<br>
<b>78,31</b> When the anger of God went up against them, and slew of the lustieth among them, <b>{N}</b><br>and smote down the young men of Israel.<br>
<b>78,32</b> For all this they sinned still, and believed not in His wondrous works.<br>
<b>78,33</b> Therefore He ended their days as a breath, and their years in terror.<br>
<b>78,34</b> When He slew them, then they would inquire after Him, and turn back and seek God earnestly.<br>
<b>78,35</b> And they remembered that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.<br>
<b>78,36</b> But they beguiled Him with their mouth, and lied unto Him with their tongue.<br>
<b>78,37</b> For their heart was not stedfast with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant.<br>
<b>78,38</b> But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not; <b>{N}</b><br>yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away, and doth not stir up all His wrath.<br>
<b>78,39</b> So He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<br>
<b>78,40</b> How oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness, and grieve Him in the desert!<br>
<b>78,41</b> And still again they tried God, and set bounds to the Holy One of Israel.<br>
<b>78,42</b> They remembered not His hand, nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary.<br>
<b>78,43</b> How He set His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the field of Zoan;<br>
<b>78,44</b> And turned their rivers into blood, so that they could not drink their streams.<br>
<b>78,45</b> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.<br>
<b>78,46</b> He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust.<br>
<b>78,47</b> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-trees with frost.<br>
<b>78,48</b> He gave over their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to fiery bolts.<br>
<b>78,49</b> He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a sending of messengers of evil.<br>
<b>78,50</b> He levelled a path for His anger; He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;<br>
<b>78,51</b> And smote all the first-born in Egypt, the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;<br>
<b>78,52</b> But He made His own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br>
<b>78,53</b> And He led them safely, and they feared not; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br>
<b>78,54</b> And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had gotten.<br>
<b>78,55</b> He drove out the nations also before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, <b>{N}</b><br>and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br>
<b>78,56</b> Yet they tried and provoked God, the Most High, and kept not His testimonies;<br>
<b>78,57</b> But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.<br>
<b>78,58</b> For they provoked Him with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.<br>
<b>78,59</b> God heard, and was wroth, and He greatly abhorred Israel;<br>
<b>78,60</b> And He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He had made to dwell among men;<br>
<b>78,61</b> And delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the adversary's hand.<br>
<b>78,62</b> He gave His people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with His inheritance.<br>
<b>78,63</b> Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins had no marriage-song.<br>
<b>78,64</b> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.<br>
<b>78,65</b> Then the Lord awaked as one asleep, like a mighty man recovering from wine.<br>
<b>78,66</b> And He smote His adversaries backward; He put upon them a perpetual reproach.<br>
<b>78,67</b> Moreover He abhorred the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;<br>
<b>78,68</b> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which He loved.<br>
<b>78,69</b> And He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He hath founded for ever.<br>
<b>78,70</b> He chose David also His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;<br>
<b>78,71</b> From following the ewes that give suck He brought him, to be shepherd over Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.<br>
<b>78,72</b> So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart; and lead them by the skilfulness of his hands. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>79,1</b> A Psalm of Asaph. <b>{N}</b><br>O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance; they have defiled Thy holy temple; <b>{N}</b><br>they have made Jerusalem into heaps.<br>
<b>79,2</b> They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants to be food unto the fowls of the heaven, <b>{N}</b><br>the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.<br>
<b>79,3</b> They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, with none to bury them.<br>
<b>79,4</b> We are become a taunt to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.<br>
<b>79,5</b> How long, O LORD, wilt Thou be angry for ever? How long will Thy jealousy burn like fire?<br>
<b>79,6</b> Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not, <b>{N}</b><br>and upon the kingdoms that call not upon Thy name.<br>
<b>79,7</b> For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation.<br>
<b>79,8</b> Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers; <b>{N}</b><br>let Thy compassions speedily come to meet us; for we are brought very low.<br>
<b>79,9</b> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of Thy name; <b>{N}</b><br>and deliver us, and forgive our sins, for Thy name's sake.<br>
<b>79,10</b> Wherefore should the nations say: 'Where is their God?' <b>{N}</b><br>Let the avenging of Thy servants' blood that is shed be made known among the nations in our sight.<br>
<b>79,11</b> Let the groaning of the prisoner come before Thee; according to the greatness of Thy power set free those that are appointed to death;<br>
<b>79,12</b> And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, <b>{N}</b><br>wherewith they have reproached Thee, O Lord.<br>
<b>79,13</b> So we that are Thy people and the flock of Thy pasture will give Thee thanks for ever; <b>{N}</b><br>we will tell of Thy praise to all generations. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>80,1</b> For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. A testimony. A Psalm of Asaph.<br>

<b>80,3</b> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Thy might, <b>{N}</b><br>and come to save us.<br>

<b>80,5</b> O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt Thou be angry against the prayer of Thy people?<br>
<b>80,6</b> Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.<br>
<b>80,7</b> Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours; and our enemies mock as they please.<br>
<b>80,8</b> O God of hosts, restore us; and cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.<br>
<b>80,9</b> Thou didst pluck up a vine out of Egypt; Thou didst drive out the nations, and didst plant it.<br>
<b>80,10</b> Thou didst clear a place before it, and it took deep root, and filled the land.<br>
<b>80,11</b> The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, and the mighty cedars with the boughs thereof.<br>
<b>80,12</b> She sent out her branches unto the sea, and her shoots unto the River.<br>
<b>80,13</b> Why hast Thou broken down her fences, so that all they that pass by the way do pluck her?<br>
<b>80,14</b> The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, that which moveth in the field feedeth on it.<br>
<b>80,15</b> O God of hosts, return, we beseech Thee; <b>{N}</b><br>look from heaven, and behold, and be mindful of this vine,<br>
<b>80,16</b> And of the stock which Thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that Thou madest strong for Thyself.<br>

<b>81,4</b> Blow the horn at the new moon, at the full moon for our feast-day.<br>
<b>81,5</b> For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.<br>
<b>81,6</b> He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when He went forth against the land of Egypt. <b>{N}</b><br>The speech of one that I knew not did I hear:<br>

<b>81,10</b> There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any foreign god.<br>

<b>81,12</b> But My people hearkened not to My voice; and Israel would none of Me.<br>

<p><b>82,1</b> A Psalm of Asaph. <b>{N}</b><br>God standeth in the congregation of God; in the midst of the judges He judgeth:<br>

<b>83,5</b> They have said: 'Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.'<br>

<b>88,2</b> O LORD, God of my salvation, what time I cry in the night before Thee,<br>

<b>88,4</b> For my soul is sated with troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.<br>
<b>88,5</b> I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am become as a man that hath no help;<br>

<b>88,7</b> Thou hast laid me in the nethermost pit, in dark places, in the deeps.<br>
<b>88,8</b> Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and all Thy waves Thou pressest down. Selah<br>
<b>88,9</b> Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them; I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.<br>

<b>88,11</b> Wilt Thou work wonders for the dead? Or shall the shades arise and give Thee thanks? Selah<br>

<p><b>89,1</b> Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.<br>
<b>89,2</b> I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever; to all generations will I make known Thy faithfulness with my mouth.<br>

<b>89,5</b> For ever will I establish thy seed, and build up thy throne to all generations.' Selah<br>
<b>89,6</b> So shall the heavens praise Thy wonders, O LORD, Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.<br>
<b>89,7</b> For who in the skies can be compared unto the LORD, who among the sons of might can be likened unto the LORD,<br>
<b>89,8</b> A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared of all them that are about Him?<br>
<b>89,9</b> O LORD God of hosts, who is a mighty one, like unto Thee, O LORD? And Thy faithfulness is round about Thee.<br>
<b>89,10</b> Thou rulest the proud swelling of the sea; when the waves thereof arise, Thou stillest them.<br>
<b>89,11</b> Thou didst crush Rahab, as one that is slain; Thou didst scatter Thine enemies with the arm of Thy strength.<br>
<b>89,12</b> Thine are the heavens, Thine also the earth; the world and the fulness thereof, Thou hast founded them.<br>
<b>89,13</b> The north and the south, Thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Thy name.<br>

<b>89,26</b> I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers.<br>
<b>89,27</b> He shall call unto Me: Thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.<br>
<b>89,28</b> I also will appoint him first-born, the highest of the kings of the earth.<br>
<b>89,29</b> For ever will I keep for him My mercy, and My covenant shall stand fast with him.<br>
<b>89,30</b> His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.<br>
<b>89,31</b> If his children forsake My law, and walk not in Mine ordinances;<br>
<b>89,32</b> If they profane My statutes, and keep not My commandments;<br>
<b>89,33</b> Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes.<br>
<b>89,34</b> But My mercy will I not break off from him, nor will I be false to My faithfulness.<br>
<b>89,35</b> My covenant will I not profane, nor alter that which is gone out of My lips.<br>
<b>89,36</b> Once have I sworn by My holiness: Surely I will not be false unto David;<br>
<b>89,37</b> His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before Me.<br>
<b>89,38</b> It shall be established for ever as the moon; and be stedfast as the witness in sky.' Selah<br>
<b>89,39</b> But Thou hast cast off and rejected, Thou hast been wroth with Thine anointed.<br>

<b>89,41</b> Thou hast broken down all his fences; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.<br>
<b>89,42</b> All that pass by the way spoil him; he is become a taunt to his neighbours.<br>
<b>89,43</b> Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.<br>
<b>89,44</b> Yea, Thou turnest back the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.<br>
<b>89,45</b> Thou hast made his brightness to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.<br>
<b>89,46</b> The days of his youth hast Thou shortened; Thou hast covered him with shame. Selah<br>
<b>89,47</b> How long, O LORD, wilt Thou hide Thyself for ever? How long shall Thy wrath burn like fire?<br>

<b>94,6</b> They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.<br>
<b>94,7</b> And they say: 'The LORD will not see, neither will the God of Jacob give heed.'<br>
<b>94,8</b> Consider, ye brutish among the people; and ye fools, when will ye understand?<br>
<b>94,9</b> He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, shall He not see?<br>
<b>94,10</b> He that instructeth nations, shall not He correct? even He that teacheth man knowledge?<br>
<b>94,11</b> The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.<br>
<b>94,12</b> Happy is the man whom Thou instructest, O LORD, and teachest out of Thy law;<br>
<b>94,13</b> That Thou mayest give him rest from the days of evil, until the pit be digged for the wicked.<br>
<b>94,14</b> For the LORD will not cast off His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance.<br>
<b>94,15</b> For right shall return unto justice, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.<br>
<b>94,16</b> Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?<br>
<b>94,17</b> Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had soon dwelt in silence.<br>
<b>94,18</b> If I say: 'My foot slippeth', Thy mercy, O LORD, holdeth me up.<br>
<b>94,19</b> When my cares are many within me, Thy comforts delight my soul.<br>
<b>94,20</b> Shall the seat of wickedness have fellowship with Thee, which frameth mischief by statute?<br>
<b>94,21</b> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn innocent blood.<br>
<b>94,22</b> But the LORD hath been my high tower, and my God the rock of my refuge.<br>
<b>94,23</b> And He hath brought upon them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own evil; <b>{N}</b><br>the LORD our God will cut them off. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>95,1</b> O come, let us sing unto the LORD; let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.<br>
<b>95,2</b> Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, let us shout for joy unto Him with psalms.<br>
<b>95,3</b> For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods;<br>
<b>95,4</b> In whose hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are His also.<br>
<b>95,5</b> The sea is His, and He made it; and His hands formed the dry land.<br>
<b>95,6</b> O come, let us bow down and bend the knee; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker;<br>
<b>95,7</b> For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the flock of His hand. <b>{N}</b><br>To-day, if ye would but hearken to His voice!<br>

<b>95,10</b> For forty years was I wearied with that generation, and said: It is a people that do err in their heart, <b>{N}</b><br>and they have not known My ways;<br>

<p><b>96,1</b> O sing unto the LORD a new song; sing unto the LORD, all the earth.<br>
<b>96,2</b> Sing unto the LORD, bless His name; proclaim His salvation from day to day.<br>
<b>96,3</b> Declare His glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.<br>
<b>96,4</b> For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.<br>
<b>96,5</b> For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought; but the LORD made the heavens.<br>
<b>96,6</b> Honour and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.<br>
<b>96,7</b> Ascribe unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples, ascribe unto the LORD glory and strength.<br>

<p><b>97,1</b> The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad.<br>
<b>97,2</b> Clouds and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.<br>
<b>97,3</b> A fire goeth before Him, and burneth up His adversaries round about.<br>
<b>97,4</b> His lightnings lighted up the world; the earth saw, and trembled.<br>
<b>97,5</b> The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.<br>
<b>97,6</b> The heavens declared His righteousness, and all the peoples saw His glory.<br>
<b>97,7</b> Ashamed be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of things of nought; <b>{N}</b><br>bow down to Him, all ye gods.<br>
<b>97,8</b> Zion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced; <b>{N}</b><br>because of Thy judgments, O LORD.<br>
<b>97,9</b> For Thou, LORD, art most high above all the earth; <b>{N}</b><br>Thou art exalted far above all gods.<br>
<b>97,10</b> O ye that love the LORD, hate evil; <b>{N}</b><br>He preserveth the souls of His saints; He delivered them out of the hand of the wicked.<br>
<b>97,11</b> Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.<br>
<b>97,12</b> Be glad in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks to His holy name. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>98,1</b> A Psalm. O sing unto the LORD a new song; for He hath done marvellous things; <b>{N}</b><br>His right hand, and His holy arm, hath wrought salvation for Him.<br>
<b>98,2</b> The LORD hath made known His salvation; His righteousness hath He revealed in the sight of the nations.<br>
<b>98,3</b> He hath remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel; <b>{N}</b><br>all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.<br>
<b>98,4</b> Shout unto the LORD, all the earth; break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.<br>
<b>98,5</b> Sing praises unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp and the voice of melody.<br>
<b>98,6</b> With trumpets and sound of the horn shout ye before the King, the LORD.<br>
<b>98,7</b> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein;<br>

<b>99,6</b> Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name, <b>{N}</b><br>did call upon the LORD, and He answered them.<br>
<b>99,7</b> He spoke unto them in the pillar of cloud; they kept His testimonies, and the statute that He gave them.<br>
<b>99,8</b> O LORD our God, Thou didst answer them; <b>{N}</b><br>a forgiving God wast Thou unto them, though Thou tookest vengeance of their misdeeds.<br>
<b>99,9</b> Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at His holy hill; <b>{N}</b><br>for the LORD our God is holy. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>101,1</b> A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and justice; unto Thee, O LORD, will I sing praises.<br>
<b>101,2</b> I will give heed unto the way of integrity; oh when wilt Thou come unto me? <b>{N}</b><br>I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.<br>
<b>101,3</b> I will set no base thing before mine eyes; <b>{N}</b><br>I hate the doing of things crooked; it shall not cleave unto me.<br>
<b>101,4</b> A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil thing.<br>
<b>101,5</b> Whoso slandereth his neighbour in secret, him will I destroy; <b>{N}</b><br>whoso is haughty of eye and proud of heart, him will I not suffer.<br>
<b>101,6</b> Mine eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; <b>{N}</b><br>he that walketh in a way of integrity, he shall minister unto me.<br>
<b>101,7</b> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house; <b>{N}</b><br>he that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.<br>
<b>101,8</b> Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; <b>{N}</b><br>to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the LORD. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>102,1</b> A Prayer of the afflicted, when he fainteth, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD.<br>
<b>102,2</b> O LORD, hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto Thee.<br>
<b>102,3</b> Hide not Thy face from me in the day of my distress; <b>{N}</b><br>incline Thine ear unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily.<br>
<b>102,4</b> For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as a hearth.<br>
<b>102,5</b> My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; for I forget to eat my bread.<br>
<b>102,6</b> By reason of the voice of my sighing my bones cleave to my flesh.<br>
<b>102,7</b> I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places.<br>
<b>102,8</b> I watch, and am become like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop.<br>
<b>102,9</b> Mine enemies taunt me all the day; they that are mad against me do curse by me.<br>
<b>102,10</b> For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,<br>
<b>102,11</b> Because of Thine indignation and Thy wrath; for Thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.<br>
<b>102,12</b> My days are like a lengthening shadow; and I am withered like grass.<br>
<b>102,13</b> But Thou, O LORD, sittest enthroned for ever; and Thy name is unto all generations.<br>
<b>102,14</b> Thou wilt arise, and have compassion upon Zion; for it is time to be gracious unto her, for the appointed time is come.<br>
<b>102,15</b> For Thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and love her dust.<br>
<b>102,16</b> So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth Thy glory;<br>
<b>102,17</b> When the LORD hath built up Zion, when He hath appeared in His glory;<br>
<b>102,18</b> When He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, and hath not despised their prayer.<br>
<b>102,19</b> This shall be written for the generation to come; and a people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.<br>
<b>102,20</b> For He hath looked down from the height of His sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;<br>
<b>102,21</b> To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;<br>
<b>102,22</b> That men may tell of the name of the LORD in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem;<br>
<b>102,23</b> When the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.<br>
<b>102,24</b> He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.<br>
<b>102,25</b> I say: 'O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days, Thou whose years endure throughout all generations.<br>
<b>102,26</b> Of old Thou didst lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of Thy hands.<br>
<b>102,27</b> They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure; <b>{N}</b><br>yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall pass away;<br>
<b>102,28</b> But Thou art the selfsame, and Thy years shall have no end.<br>
<b>102,29</b> The children of Thy servants shall dwell securely, and their seed shall be established before Thee.' <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>103,1</b> [A Psalm] of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name.<br>
<b>103,2</b> Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits;<br>
<b>103,3</b> Who forgiveth all thine iniquity; who healeth all Thy diseases;<br>
<b>103,4</b> Who redeemeth Thy life from the pit; who encompasseth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;<br>
<b>103,5</b> Who satisfieth thine old age with good things; so that Thy youth is renewed like the eagle.<br>
<b>103,6</b> The LORD executeth righteousness, and acts of justice for all that are oppressed.<br>
<b>103,7</b> He made known His ways unto Moses, His doings unto the children of Israel.<br>
<b>103,8</b> The LORD is full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.<br>
<b>103,9</b> He will not always contend; neither will He keep His anger for ever.<br>
<b>103,10</b> He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor requited us according to our iniquities.<br>
<b>103,11</b> For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them that fear Him.<br>
<b>103,12</b> As far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us.<br>
<b>103,13</b> Like as a father hath compassion upon his children, so hath the LORD compassion upon them that fear Him.<br>
<b>103,14</b> For He knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust.<br>
<b>103,15</b> As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.<br>
<b>103,16</b> For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof knoweth it no more.<br>
<b>103,17</b> But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him, <b>{N}</b><br>and His righteousness unto children's children;<br>
<b>103,18</b> To such as keep His covenant, and to those that remember His precepts to do them.<br>
<b>103,19</b> The LORD hath established His throne in the heavens; and His kingdom ruleth over all.<br>
<b>103,20</b> Bless the LORD, ye angels of His, <b>{N}</b><br>ye mighty in strength, that fulfil His word, hearkening unto the voice of His word.<br>
<b>103,21</b> Bless the LORD, all ye His hosts; ye ministers of His, that do His pleasure.<br>
<b>103,22</b> Bless the LORD, all ye His works, in all places of His dominion; <b>{N}</b><br>bless the LORD, O my soul. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>104,1</b> Bless the LORD, O my soul. <b>{N}</b><br>O LORD my God, Thou art very great; Thou art clothed with glory and majesty.<br>
<b>104,2</b> Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;<br>
<b>104,3</b> Who layest the beams of Thine upper chambers in the waters, <b>{N}</b><br>who makest the clouds Thy chariot, who walkest upon the wings of the wind;<br>
<b>104,4</b> Who makest winds Thy messengers, the flaming fire Thy ministers.<br>
<b>104,5</b> Who didst establish the earth upon its foundations, that it should not be moved for ever and ever;<br>
<b>104,6</b> Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains.<br>
<b>104,7</b> At Thy rebuke they fled, at the voice of Thy thunder they hasted away--<br>
<b>104,8</b> The mountains rose, the valleys sank down--unto the place which Thou hadst founded for them;<br>
<b>104,9</b> Thou didst set a bound which they should not pass over, that they might not return to cover the earth.<br>
<b>104,10</b> Who sendest forth springs into the valleys; they run between the mountains;<br>
<b>104,11</b> They give drink to every beast of the field, the wild asses quench their thirst.<br>
<b>104,12</b> Beside them dwell the fowl of the heaven, from among the branches they sing.<br>
<b>104,13</b> Who waterest the mountains from Thine upper chambers; the earth is full of the fruit of Thy works.<br>
<b>104,14</b> Who causeth the grass to spring up for the cattle, and herb for the service of man; <b>{N}</b><br>to bring forth bread out of the earth,<br>
<b>104,15</b> And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, making the face brighter than oil, <b>{N}</b><br>and bread that stayeth man's heart.<br>
<b>104,16</b> The trees of the LORD have their fill, the cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted;<br>
<b>104,17</b> Wherein the birds make their nests; as for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.<br>
<b>104,18</b> The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the conies.<br>
<b>104,19</b> Who appointedst the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down.<br>
<b>104,20</b> Thou makest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.<br>
<b>104,21</b> The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.<br>
<b>104,22</b> The sun ariseth, they slink away, and couch in their dens.<br>
<b>104,23</b> Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.<br>
<b>104,24</b> How manifold are Thy works, O LORD! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; <b>{N}</b><br>the earth is full of Thy creatures.<br>
<b>104,25</b> Yonder sea, great and wide, <b>{N}</b><br>therein are creeping things innumerable, living creatures, both small and great.<br>
<b>104,26</b> There go the ships; there is leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to sport therein.<br>
<b>104,27</b> All of them wait for Thee, that Thou mayest give them their food in due season.<br>
<b>104,28</b> Thou givest it unto them, they gather it; Thou openest Thy hand, they are satisfied with good.<br>
<b>104,29</b> Thou hidest Thy face, they vanish; <b>{N}</b><br>Thou withdrawest their breath, they perish, and return to their dust.<br>
<b>104,30</b> Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created; and Thou renewest the face of the earth.<br>
<b>104,31</b> May the glory of the LORD endure for ever; let the LORD rejoice in His works!<br>
<b>104,32</b> Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.<br>
<b>104,33</b> I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.<br>
<b>104,34</b> Let my musing be sweet unto Him; as for me, I will rejoice in the LORD.<br>
<b>104,35</b> Let sinners cease out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. <b>{N}</b><br>Bless the LORD, O my soul. <b>{N}</b><br>Hallelujah.<br>
<b>105,1</b> O give thanks unto the LORD, call upon His name; make known His doings among the peoples.<br>
<b>105,2</b> Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him; speak ye of all His marvellous works.<br>
<b>105,3</b> Glory ye in His holy name; let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.<br>
<b>105,4</b> Seek ye the LORD and His strength; seek His face continually.<br>
<b>105,5</b> Remember His marvellous works that He hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth;<br>
<b>105,6</b> O ye seed of Abraham His servant, ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones.<br>
<b>105,7</b> He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth.<br>
<b>105,8</b> He hath remembered His covenant for ever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations;<br>
<b>105,9</b> [The covenant] which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac;<br>
<b>105,10</b> And He established it unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant;<br>
<b>105,11</b> Saying: 'Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.'<br>
<b>105,12</b> When they were but a few men in number. Yea, very few, and sojourners in it,<br>
<b>105,13</b> And when they went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,<br>
<b>105,14</b> He suffered no man to do them wrong, yea, for their sake He reproved kings:<br>
<b>105,15</b> 'Touch not Mine anointed ones, and do My prophets no harm.'<br>
<b>105,16</b> And He called a famine upon the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.<br>
<b>105,17</b> He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant;<br>
<b>105,18</b> His feet they hurt with fetters, his person was laid in iron;<br>
<b>105,19</b> Until the time that his word came to pass, the word of the LORD tested him.<br>
<b>105,20</b> The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the peoples, and set him free.<br>
<b>105,21</b> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions;<br>
<b>105,22</b> To bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his elders wisdom.<br>
<b>105,23</b> Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.<br>
<b>105,24</b> And He increased His people greatly, and made them too mighty for their adversaries.<br>
<b>105,25</b> He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal craftily with His servants.<br>
<b>105,26</b> He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron whom He had chosen.<br>
<b>105,27</b> They wrought among them His manifold signs, and wonders in the land of Ham.<br>
<b>105,28</b> He sent darkness, and it was dark; and they rebelled not against His word.<br>
<b>105,29</b> He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.<br>
<b>105,30</b> Their land swarmed with frogs, in the chambers of their kings.<br>
<b>105,31</b> He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats in all their borders.<br>
<b>105,32</b> He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.<br>
<b>105,33</b> He smote their vines also and their fig-trees; and broke the trees of their borders.<br>
<b>105,34</b> He spoke, and the locust came, and the canker-worm without number,<br>
<b>105,35</b> And did eat up every herb in their land, and did eat up the fruit of their ground.<br>
<b>105,36</b> He smote also all the first-born in their land, the first-fruits of all their strength.<br>
<b>105,37</b> And He brought them forth with silver and gold; and there was none that stumbled among His tribes.<br>
<b>105,38</b> Egypt was glad when they departed; for the fear of them had fallen upon them.<br>
<b>105,39</b> He spread a cloud for a screen; and fire to give light in the night.<br>
<b>105,40</b> They asked, and He brought quails, and gave them in plenty the bread of heaven.<br>
<b>105,41</b> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; they ran, a river in the dry places.<br>
<b>105,42</b> For He remembered His holy word unto Abraham His servant;<br>
<b>105,43</b> And He brought forth His people with joy, His chosen ones with singing.<br>
<b>105,44</b> And He gave them the lands of the nations, and they took the labour of the peoples in possession;<br>
<b>105,45</b> That they might keep His statutes, and observe His laws. <b>{N}</b><br>Hallelujah.<br>
<b>106,1</b> Hallelujah. <b>{N}</b><br>O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.<br>
<b>106,2</b> Who can express the mighty acts of the LORD, or make all His praise to be heard?<br>
<b>106,3</b> Happy are they that keep justice, that do righteousness at all times.<br>
<b>106,4</b> Remember me, O LORD, when Thou favourest Thy people; O think of me at Thy salvation;<br>
<b>106,5</b> That I may behold the prosperity of Thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation, <b>{N}</b><br>that I may glory with Thine inheritance.<br>
<b>106,6</b> We have sinned with our fathers, we have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly.<br>
<b>106,7</b> Our fathers in Egypt gave no heed unto Thy wonders; <b>{N}</b><br>they remembered not the multitude of Thy mercies; <b>{N}</b><br>but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.<br>
<b>106,8</b> Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, that He might make His mighty power to be known.<br>
<b>106,9</b> And He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; and He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.<br>
<b>106,10</b> And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.<br>
<b>106,11</b> And the waters covered their adversaries; there was not one of them left.<br>
<b>106,12</b> Then believed they His words; they sang His praise.<br>
<b>106,13</b> They soon forgot His works; they waited not for His counsel;<br>
<b>106,14</b> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tried God in the desert.<br>
<b>106,15</b> And He gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.<br>
<b>106,16</b> They were jealous also of Moses in the camp, and of Aaron the holy one of the LORD.<br>
<b>106,17</b> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.<br>
<b>106,18</b> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.<br>
<b>106,19</b> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped a molten image.<br>
<b>106,20</b> Thus they exchanged their glory for the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.<br>
<b>106,21</b> They forgot God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt;<br>
<b>106,22</b> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea.<br>
<b>106,23</b> Therefore He said that He would destroy them, <b>{N}</b><br>had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, <b>{N}</b><br>to turn back His wrath, lest He should destroy them.<br>
<b>106,24</b> Moreover, they scorned the desirable land, they believed not His word;<br>
<b>106,25</b> And they murmured in their tents, they hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.<br>
<b>106,26</b> Therefore He swore concerning them, that He would overthrow them in the wilderness;<br>
<b>106,27</b> And that He would cast out their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.<br>
<b>106,28</b> They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.<br>
<b>106,29</b> Thus they provoked Him with their doings, and the plague broke in upon them.<br>
<b>106,30</b> Then stood up Phinehas, and wrought judgment, and so the plague was stayed.<br>
<b>106,31</b> And that was counted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for ever.<br>
<b>106,32</b> They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses because of them;<br>
<b>106,33</b> For they embittered his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips.<br>
<b>106,34</b> They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them;<br>
<b>106,35</b> But mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works;<br>
<b>106,36</b> And they served their idols, which became a snare unto them;<br>
<b>106,37</b> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,<br>
<b>106,38</b> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; <b>{N}</b><br>and the land was polluted with blood.<br>
<b>106,39</b> Thus were they defiled with their works, and went astray in their doings.<br>
<b>106,40</b> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against His people, and He abhorred His inheritance.<br>
<b>106,41</b> And He gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them.<br>
<b>106,42</b> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were subdued under their hand.<br>
<b>106,43</b> Many times did He deliver them; <b>{N}</b><br>but they were rebellious in their counsel, and sank low through their iniquity.<br>
<b>106,44</b> Nevertheless He looked upon their distress, when He heard their cry;<br>
<b>106,45</b> And He remembered for them His covenant, and repented according to the multitude of His mercies.<br>
<b>106,46</b> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captive.<br>
<b>106,47</b> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, <b>{N}</b><br>that we may give thanks unto Thy holy name, that we may triumph in Thy praise.<br>
<b>106,48</b> Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting, <b>{N}</b><br>and let all the people say: 'Amen.' <b>{N}</b><br>Hallelujah. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>107,1</b> 'O give thanks unto the LORD, for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.'<br>
<b>107,2</b> So let the redeemed of the LORD say, whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary;<br>
<b>107,3</b> And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the sea.<br>
<b>107,4</b> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; they found no city of habitation.<br>
<b>107,5</b> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.<br>
<b>107,6</b> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses.<br>
<b>107,7</b> And He led them by a straight way, that they might go to a city of habitation.<br>
<b>107,8</b> Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, and for His wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
<b>107,9</b> For He hath satisfied the longing soul, and the hungry soul He hath filled with good.<br>
<b>107,10</b> Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron--<br>
<b>107,11</b> Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High.<br>
<b>107,12</b> Therefore He humbled their heart with travail, they stumbled, and there was none to help--<br>
<b>107,13</b> They cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them out of their distresses.<br>
<b>107,14</b> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bands in sunder.<br>
<b>107,15</b> Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, and for His wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
<b>107,16</b> For He hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.<br>
<b>107,17</b> Crazed because of the way of their transgression, and afflicted because of their iniquities--<br>
<b>107,18</b> Their soul abhorred all manner of food, and they drew near unto the gates of death--<br>
<b>107,19</b> They cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them out of their distresses;<br>
<b>107,20</b> He sent His word, and healed them, and delivered them from their graves.<br>
<b>107,21</b> Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, and for His wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
<b>107,22</b> And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His works with singing.<br>
<b>107,23</b> They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters--<br>
<b>107,24</b> These saw the works of the LORD, and His wonders in the deep;<br>
<b>107,25</b> For He commanded, and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves thereof;<br>
<b>107,26</b> They mounted up to the heaven, they went down to the deeps; their soul melted away because of trouble;<br>
<b>107,27</b> They reeled to and fro, and staggered like a drunken man, and all their wisdom was swallowed up--<br>
<b>107,28</b> They cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distresses.<br>
<b>107,29</b> He made the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof were still.<br>
<b>107,30</b> Then were they glad because they were quiet, and He led them unto their desired haven.<br>
<b>107,31</b> Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, and for His wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
<b>107,32</b> Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people, and praise Him in the seat of the elders.<br>
<b>107,33</b> He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and watersprings into a thirsty ground;<br>
<b>107,34</b> A fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.<br>
<b>107,35</b> He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, and a dry land into watersprings.<br>
<b>107,36</b> And there He maketh the hungry to dwell, and they establish a city of habitation;<br>
<b>107,37</b> And sow fields, and plant vineyards, which yield fruits of increase.<br>
<b>107,38</b> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly, and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.<br>
<b>107,39</b> Again, they are minished and dwindle away through oppression of evil and sorrow.<br>
<b>107,40</b> He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.<br>
<b>107,41</b> Yet setteth He the needy on high from affliction, and maketh his families like a flock.<br>
<b>107,42</b> The upright see it, and are glad; and all iniquity stoppeth her mouth.<br>
<b>107,43</b> Whoso is wise, let him observe these things, and let them consider the mercies of the LORD. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>109,1</b> For the Leader. A Psalm of David. <b>{N}</b><br>O God of my praise, keep not silence;<br>
<b>109,2</b> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me; they have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.<br>
<b>109,3</b> They compassed me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.<br>
<b>109,4</b> In return for my love they are my adversaries; but I am all prayer.<br>
<b>109,5</b> And they have laid upon me evil for good, and hatred for my love:<br>
<b>109,6</b> 'Set Thou a wicked man over him; and let an adversary stand at his right hand.<br>
<b>109,7</b> When he is judged, let him go forth condemned; and let his prayer be turned into sin.<br>
<b>109,8</b> Let his days be few; let another take his charge.<br>
<b>109,9</b> Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.<br>
<b>109,10</b> Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; and let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.<br>
<b>109,11</b> Let the creditor distrain all that he hath; and let strangers make spoil of his labour.<br>
<b>109,12</b> Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; neither let there be any to be gracious unto his fatherless children.<br>
<b>109,13</b> Let his posterity be cut off; in the generation following let their name be blotted out.<br>
<b>109,14</b> Let the iniquity of his fathers be brought to remembrance unto the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.<br>
<b>109,15</b> Let them be before the LORD continually, that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth.<br>
<b>109,16</b> Because that he remembered not to do kindness, <b>{N}</b><br>but persecuted the poor and needy man, and the broken in heart he was ready to slay.<br>
<b>109,17</b> Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; and he delighted not in blessing, and it is far from him.<br>
<b>109,18</b> He clothed himself also with cursing as with his raiment, and it is come into his inward parts like water, and like oil into his bones.<br>
<b>109,19</b> Let it be unto him as the garment which he putteth on, and for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.'<br>
<b>109,20</b> This would mine adversaries effect from the LORD, and they that speak evil against my soul.<br>

<b>132,2</b> How he swore unto the LORD, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob:<br>
<b>132,3</b> 'Surely I will not come into the tent of my house, nor go up into the bed that is spread for me;<br>
<b>132,4</b> I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids;<br>
<b>132,5</b> Until I find out a place for the LORD, a dwelling-place for the Mighty One of Jacob.'<br>
<b>132,6</b> Lo, we heard of it as being in Ephrath; we found it in the field of the wood.<br>
<b>132,7</b> Let us go into His dwelling-place; let us worship at His footstool.<br>
<b>132,8</b> Arise, O LORD, unto Thy resting-place; Thou, and the ark of Thy strength.<br>
<b>132,9</b> Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let Thy saints shout for joy.<br>
<b>132,10</b> For Thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of Thine anointed.<br>
<b>132,11</b> The LORD swore unto David in truth; He will not turn back from it: <b>{N}</b><br>'Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.<br>
<b>132,12</b> If thy children keep My covenant and My testimony that I shall teach them, <b>{N}</b><br>their children also for ever shall sit upon thy throne.'<br>
<b>132,13</b> For the LORD hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it for His habitation:<br>
<b>132,14</b> 'This is My resting-place for ever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it.<br>
<b>132,15</b> I will abundantly bless her provision; I will give her needy bread in plenty.<br>
<b>132,16</b> Her priests also will I clothe with salvation; and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.<br>
<b>132,17</b> There will I make a horn to shoot up unto David, there have I ordered a lamp for Mine anointed.<br>
<b>132,18</b> His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown shine.' <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>133,1</b> A Song of Ascents; of David. <b>{N}</b><br>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!<br>
<b>133,2</b> It is like the precious oil upon the head, <b>{N}</b><br>coming down upon the beard; even Aaron's beard, <b>{N}</b><br>that cometh down upon the collar of his garments;<br>
<b>133,3</b> Like the dew of Hermon, that cometh down upon the mountains of Zion; <b>{N}</b><br>for there the LORD commanded the blessing, <b>{N}</b><br>even life for ever. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>134,1</b> A Song of Ascents. <b>{N}</b><br>Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, <b>{N}</b><br>that stand in the house of the LORD in the night seasons.<br>
<b>134,2</b> Lift up your hands to the sanctuary, and bless ye the LORD.<br>
<b>134,3</b> The LORD bless thee out of Zion; even He that made heaven and earth. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>135,1</b> Hallelujah. <b>{N}</b><br>Praise ye the name of the LORD; give praise, O ye servants of the LORD,<br>
<b>135,2</b> Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.<br>
<b>135,3</b> Praise ye the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praises unto His name, for it is pleasant.<br>
<b>135,4</b> For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto Himself, and Israel for His own treasure.<br>
<b>135,5</b> For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.<br>
<b>135,6</b> Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that hath He done, <b>{N}</b><br>in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;<br>
<b>135,7</b> Who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; <b>{N}</b><br>He maketh lightnings for the rain; He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries.<br>
<b>135,8</b> Who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast.<br>
<b>135,9</b> He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.<br>
<b>135,10</b> Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings:<br>
<b>135,11</b> Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;<br>
<b>135,12</b> And gave their land for a heritage, a heritage unto Israel His people.<br>
<b>135,13</b> O LORD, Thy name endureth for ever; thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.<br>
<b>135,14</b> For the LORD will judge His people, and repent Himself for His servants.<br>
<b>135,15</b> The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.<br>
<b>135,16</b> They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;<br>
<b>135,17</b> They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.<br>
<b>135,18</b> They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them.<br>
<b>135,19</b> O house of Israel, bless ye the LORD; O house of Aaron, bless ye the LORD;<br>
<b>135,20</b> O house of Levi, bless ye the LORD; ye that fear the LORD, bless ye the LORD.<br>
<b>135,21</b> Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>137,1</b> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.<br>
<b>137,2</b> Upon the willows in the midst thereof we hanged up our harps.<br>
<b>137,3</b> For there they that led us captive asked of us words of song, and our tormentors asked of us mirth: <b>{N}</b><br>'Sing us one of the songs of Zion.'<br>
<b>137,4</b> How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a foreign land?<br>
<b>137,5</b> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.<br>

<p><b>139,1</b> For the Leader. A Psalm of David. <b>{N}</b><br>O LORD, Thou hast searched me, and known me.<br>
<b>139,2</b> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, Thou understandest my thought afar off.<br>
<b>139,3</b> Thou measurest my going about and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.<br>
<b>139,4</b> For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, Thou knowest it altogether.<br>
<b>139,5</b> Thou hast hemmed me in behind and before, and laid Thy hand upon me.<br>
<b>139,6</b> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; too high, I cannot attain unto it.<br>
<b>139,7</b> Whither shall I go from Thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?<br>
<b>139,8</b> If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there; if I make my bed in the nether-world, behold, Thou art there.<br>
<b>139,9</b> If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;<br>
<b>139,10</b> Even there would Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand would hold me.<br>
<b>139,11</b> And if I say: 'Surely the darkness shall envelop me, and the light about me shall be night';<br>
<b>139,12</b> Even the darkness is not too dark for Thee, <b>{N}</b><br>but the night shineth as the day; the darkness is even as the light.<br>
<b>139,13</b> For Thou hast made my reins; Thou hast knit me together in my mother's womb.<br>
<b>139,14</b> I will give thanks unto Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; <b>{N}</b><br>wonderful are Thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.<br>
<b>139,15</b> My frame was not hidden from Thee, <b>{N}</b><br>when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.<br>
<b>139,16</b> Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance, and in Thy book they were all written-- <b>{N}</b><br>even the days that were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.<br>
<b>139,17</b> How weighty also are Thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!<br>
<b>139,18</b> If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand; were I to come to the end of them, I would still be with Thee.<br>
<b>139,19</b> If Thou but wouldest slay the wicked, O God--depart from me therefore, ye men of blood;<br>
<b>139,20</b> Who utter Thy name with wicked thought, they take it for falsehood, even Thine enemies--<br>
<b>139,21</b> Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate Thee? And do not I strive with those that rise up against Thee?<br>
<b>139,22</b> I hate them with utmost hatred; I count them mine enemies.<br>
<b>139,23</b> Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts;<br>
<b>139,24</b> And see if there be any way in me that is grievous, and lead me in the way everlasting. <b>{P}</b></p>

<p><b>140,1</b> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<br>
<b>140,2</b> Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man; preserve me from the violent man;<br>
<b>140,3</b> Who devise evil things in their heart; every day do they stir up wars.<br>
<b>140,4</b> They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; vipers' venom is under their lips. Selah<br>
<b>140,5</b> Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; <b>{N}</b><br>who have purposed to make my steps slip.<br>
<b>140,6</b> The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; <b>{N}</b><br>they have set gins for me. Selah<br>
<b>140,7</b> I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art my God'; give ear, O LORD, unto the voice of my supplications.<br>
<b>140,8</b> O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, who hast screened my head in the day of battle,<br>
<b>140,9</b> Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; further not his evil device, so that they exalt themselves. Selah<br>
<b>140,10</b> As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.<br>
<b>140,11</b> Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, that they rise not up again.<br>
<b>140,12</b> A slanderer shall not be established in the earth; the violent and evil man shall be hunted with thrust upon thrust.<br>
<b>140,13</b> I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the poor, and the right of the needy.<br>

<b>141,3</b> Set a guard, O LORD, to my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.<br>
<b>141,4</b> Incline not my heart to any evil thing, <b>{N}</b><br>to be occupied in deeds of wickedness <b>{N}</b><br>with men that work iniquity; <b>{N}</b><br>and let me not eat of their dainties.<br>
<b>141,5</b> Let the righteous smite me in kindness, and correct me; <b>{N}</b><br>oil so choice let not my head refuse; <b>{N}</b><br>for still is my prayer because of their wickedness.<br>
<b>141,6</b> Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; and they shall hear my words, that they are sweet.<br>
<b>141,7</b> As when one cleaveth and breaketh up the earth, our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth.<br>
<b>141,8</b> For mine eyes are unto Thee, O GOD the Lord; in Thee have I taken refuge, O pour not out my soul.<br>

<b>142,6</b> I have cried unto Thee, O LORD; <b>{N}</b><br>I have said: 'Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.'<br>
<b>142,7</b> Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low; <b>{N}</b><br>deliver me from my persecutors; for they are too strong for me.<br>

<b>143,5</b> I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Thy doing; <b>{N}</b><br>I muse on the work of Thy hands.<br>
<b>143,6</b> I spread forth my hands unto Thee; my soul [thirsteth] after Thee, as a weary land. Selah<br>
<b>143,7</b> Answer me speedily, O LORD, my spirit faileth; <b>{N}</b><br>hide not Thy face from me; lest I become like them that go down into the pit.<br>
<b>143,8</b> Cause me to hear Thy lovingkindness in the morning, for in Thee do I trust; <b>{N}</b><br>cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.<br>
<b>143,9</b> Deliver me from mine enemies, O LORD; with Thee have I hidden myself.<br>
<b>143,10</b> Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God; <b>{N}</b><br>let Thy good spirit lead me in an even land.<br>
<b>143,11</b> For Thy name's sake, O LORD, quicken me; in Thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.<br>
