    <p class='Sdate' id='1'>27 February (1922)</p>
  
    <p id='2'>Honoured Sir:</p>
  
    <p id='3'>It is with regret and sorrow that I enclose at last the long-protracted translations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s answer to your letter. His sudden passing to the Great Beyond has plunged us all in profound grief and added heavily to our preoccupations and responsibilities. Happily, however, the full answer to your epistle, had been written, and signed by him many days before his passing and were it not for the desire to have it adequately rendered into English and French, it would have reached you far sooner than now. As I am not certain of your address at the present moment, I am enclosing a copy of the original text which bears his signature, hoping to forward the text as soon as I am assured of your true address.</p>
  
    <p id='4'>I am sending, too, a copy of the English version to Mr. A. Iṣfahání, a Bahá’í friend of ours who, I understand, has had the pleasure and privilege of meeting you on more than one occasion, and who I am sure will submit it to you, should this letter fail to reach its destination.</p>
  
    <p id='5'>The Bahá’ís the world over will be delighted to have copies of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s answer to your letter circulated amongst them, as it is unique in many respects and much appreciated in its nature and comprehensiveness. I have refrained from giving them copies until I hear of your desire to do so.</p>
  
    <p id='6'>Being a personal letter I thought it incumbent upon me to inform you and request you on this point.</p>
  
    <p id='7'>My very best wishes and kind regards and hoping to hear from you soon,</p>
  
    <p class='Ssignature' id='8'>I am yours very sincerely <br> Shoghi Rabbani <br> (grandson of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá) </p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='9'>5 January 1923</p>
  
    <p id='10'>The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. The glory of the All-Glorious rest upon them! Beloved brethren and sisters in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá!</p>
  
    <p id='11'>His honor, Jináb-i ‘Abdu’l-Ḥusayn-í Avárih, fired with the spirit of service and teaching which the passing of our beloved Master has kindled in every heart, is proceeding to Europe and will visit every Bahá’í centre in that great continent, that he may with the aid of the many friends in those regions raise the Call of Yá-Bahá’u’l-Abhá and stimulate interest in the Cause of God. He is indeed qualified for such an eminent noble task and I am confident that by the Grace of God and with the whole-hearted assistance of the loved ones of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he may be enabled to promote far and wide the universal Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
  
    <p id='12'>His wide experience and familiarity with the various aspects of the Movement, his profound and extensive knowledge of its history; his association with some of the early believers, the pioneers and martyrs of the Cause will I am sure to appeal to every one of you and will serve to acquaint you still further with the more intimate and tragic side of this remarkable Movement.</p>
  
    <p id='13'>May his sojourn in your country lend a fresh impetus to the onward march of the Cause in the West and arouse widespread interest in the history as well as the principles of the Bahá’í Movement! </p>

    <p id='15'>An die lieben Bahá’í Geschwister in Esslingen Meine geliebten Bahá’í Geschwister,</p>
  
    <p id='16'>Euren schönen Brief vom 9. Kaul hat unser geliebter Hüter, Shoghi Effendi erhalten und grosse Freude dadurch bekommen. Damit strömt die Liebe Gottes und der süsse Duft Eurer Harmonie, Einigkeit, Aufrichtigkeit und Ergebenheit der Wohlfahrt der heiligen Sache.</p>
  
    <p id='17'>Unser geliebter Hüter hat mich beauftragt, diese Zeilen an Euch zu schreiben und seine Liebe und herzliche Grússe euch zu übersenden. Er versichert Euch, dass er fúr Euch am heiligen Grabe Unsers Geliebten, ‘Abdu’l-Bahás mit ganzem Herzen betet. Er erwartet immer gute Nachrichten von Eurem Wohlsein und von dem Fortschritte der heiligen Sache in Eurem Land.</p>
  
    <p id='18'>Liebe Geschwister, die Angelegenheiten in meiner Heimat haben mich gezwungen, eine Reise nach Persien zu machen. Der geliebte Hüter hat mir Urlaub dáfúr bewilligt. Ich verlasse Haifa binnen drei oder vier Tagen. Da während meiner Abwesenheit von Haifa niemand hier ist, der Deutsch kann, sollen alle die Briefe und Nachrichten, die dem lieben Shoghi Effendi geschickt werden werden, auf Englisch geschrieben werden. Die heilige Familie lassen Euch auch herzliche Grússe.</p>
  
    <p id='19'>Mit treuer Liebe, verbleibe ich immer, Euer ergebener Bruder in Seinem heiligen Namen und Dienste unsers geliebten Hüter</p>

    <p id='21'>My dearest friends:</p>
  
    <p id='22'>This is to assure you personally of my continued and earnest prayers for your happiness, welfare and spiritual advancement. The Esslingen friends are near and dear to my heart. I have great admiration <span data-pg='8' id='pg8'></span> for their steadfastness, their love and devotion and cherish great hopes for their future. They are destined to achieve great things for our beloved Cause.</p>

    <h2 class='head'>Letter of 15 February 1926</h2>
  
    <p class='Sdate' id='24'>15 February 1926</p>
  
    <p id='25'>With regard to your first question on alcohol and drinking Bahá’u’lláh fully aware of the great misery that it brings about, prohibits it as He expressly states that everything that takes away the mind or in other words makes one drunk is forbidden. The Master has promoted the same idea.</p>
  
    <p id='26'>In connection with spiritualism, although the Master says that there is some element of truth in what some teach under the subject of auto-suggestion and others, spiritualism as such is not taught by the Bahá’í religion. Our Master has said that religion and true science must go together and most of these things have not been proved by science.</p>
  
    <p id='27'>As to your third question Shoghi Effendi would like you to understand that when one believes in one to be divinely inspired and when one is convinced that he has a great mission to the world in his teachings, he must very naturally be ready to accept all that that world-teacher that divinely-inspired man says. It is with this view that he feels that a real Bahá’í would be one who is convinced that Bahá’u’lláh was a world-teacher and a Messenger of God bearing to mankind a great Message, and would therefore be ready to accept all that Bahá’u’lláh has said and the same is true of the Master whom we believe to have been the great propounder of the Bahá’í teachings and the one through whom the Covenant of God was firmly established in the world. <span data-pg='9' id='pg9'></span></p>
  
    <p id='28'>With regard to the differentiation between Bahá’í and Bahá’í friend. This differentiation was not one which Bahá’u’lláh and the Master firmly established but because there are so many people who are attracted to the Bahá’í Cause just as they are attracted to some society and people who have not developed spiritually to look at the world and the spiritual elements of life in the proper light that a Bahá’í would look at it, it has become a habit of differentiating between what you might call beginners in the Bahá’í Movement and those who have studied the Movement thoroughly and who know its teachings exactly and who understand the real spirit that is back of it all. You should not think, however, that a Bahá’í is one who is superior to a Bahá’í friend, but only that he has studied the Movement better and realizes well the great and divine spirit that is at the root of all Bahá’í teachings.</p>
  
    <p id='29'>I hope that in spite of the briefness that has been necessary in answering your interesting questions, I have been able to explain to you properly the meaning of each answer. It is always through questioning and mature thought that we can arrive at the root of everything and in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh there are so many things which though at present seemingly unnecessary will be of great necessity in the future development of mankind. </p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='30'>4 November 1926</p>
  
    <p id='31'>The wine mentioned in the Tablets has undoubtedly a spiritual meaning for in the book of Aqdas we are definitely forbidden to take not only wine, but every thing that deranges the mind. In poetry as a whole wine is taken to have a different connotation than the ordinary intoxicating liquid. We see it thus used by the Persian Poets such as Sa’dí and Umar <u>Kh</u>ayám and Háfiz to mean that element which nears man to his divine beloved, which makes <span data-pg='10' id='pg10'></span> him forget his material self so as better to seek his spiritual desires. It is very necessary to tell the children what this wine means so that they may not confuse it with the ordinary wine.</p>
  
    <p id='32'>The books of laws or Aqdas has not yet been properly translated because as you mentioned we do not have any competent person for the work. When the Cause was first introduced to west one of the Arab friends made such an attempt but it was so misleading and confusing that the Master forbade any individual to make another trial. He said that it is the work of a group of competent translators and not of one person. Most of the important subjects mentioned there are, however, quite familiar to the friends through other tablets and there is no pressing need for such a work at present.</p>
  
    <p id='33'>[From the Guardian:]</p>
  
    <p id='34'>Your welcome letter, indicative of your perseverance in service, despite the great loss you have sustained, was a source of great comfort and strength to me. I hope and pray that your dear children will grow in spiritual understanding, wisdom and virtue and by their life, their conduct and future services to the Cause make the soul of their departed father radiant and joyous and prove a solace to your heart. Rest assured that you all occupy a warm and abiding place in my heart and are the object of my constant and fervent prayers at the holy Shrines. </p>

    <p id='49'>To the Bahá’ís in Karlsruhe.</p>
  
    <p id='50'>Dear Bahá’í brothers and sisters:</p>
  
    <p id='51'>Your kind words of New Year greetings to Shoghi Effendi has been received and it gave him much pleasure. He hopes that this coming year will bring to the Cause many spiritual victories, especially in Germany which stands as the heart of the present troubled Europe. If the banner of peace should not be raised in that continent, only God can foresee what will ensue, what calamities another war will bring, and what will happen to our present civilization.</p>

The beloved of the Lord in Karlsruhe are dear and near to my heart. I long to hear from them, and to learn of the progress of their activities. May the Almighty guide their steps, cheer their hearts, deepen their understanding and enable them to fulfil their heart’s desire.</p>

    <p id='58'>He hopes that your number may daily increase and include people of capacity and spiritual insight. It is true that the Cause in Germany has some difficult problems to solve and some differences to overcome, but these should merely arouse as to greater activity. The Cause ever since its inception has been confronting problems, but these have frozen to be a factor in strengthening our faith and adding to our energy.</p>
  
    <p id='59'>It is very necessary that we should endeavour to strengthen the National Assembly. Without it no unity and cooperation could be obtained throughout the country.</p>
  
    <p id='60'>As you say in your letter private, informal gatherings held in homes where different friendly individuals are invited often give better result for only those who are really interested are attracted and then once attracted they could be traced and kept in touch. </p>

    <p id='64'>Dr. Yúnís <u>Kh</u>án Afrú<u>kh</u>tih, an outstanding figure in the teaching and administrative activities of the believers in Persia, is proceeding to Europe in order to visit the Bahá’í centres and reinforce the bonds of Bahá’í fellowship that unite the East with the West. His mature experience, his wide knowledge of the state of affairs in Persia, his exemplary loyalty and devotion to the Cause, his ability and character eminently qualify him to undertake such a noble task, and I feel confident that his prolonged stay amongst <span data-pg='14' id='pg14'></span> you will prove of the utmost benefit to the interests of our beloved Cause.</p>
  
    <p id='65'>I urge every individual believer, and particularly every local Assembly, to endeavour to get into close touch with him, to obtain an insight into the material and spiritual conditions now prevailing in Persia and to seek a clearer understanding of the animating purpose, the distinguishing features and the moving history of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
  
    <p id='66'>May his deliberations and intimate companionship with you serve to draw closer the ties that bind the Eastern and Western sections of the Bahá’í World and prepare the way for the ultimate formation of that international body that must guard the unity, and reinforce the strength of the Bahá’í Faith.</p>

    <aside data-fnid='hd216:1'>to Mrs. Marta Brauns-Forel</aside>
  
    <p class='Sdate' id='99'>10 September 1931</p>
  
    <p id='100'>In regard to your father’s spiritual testament, which betrays on the part of the author an inadequate knowledge of the Bahá’í Faith, the Guardian feels that you should make it clear to all the inquirers that the late Dr. Forel, as many other persons who have embraced the Cause, did not have a complete understanding of the fundamentals of the Bahá’í religion. He was particularly interested in the social aspect of the Movement and owing to some psychological reasons he did not lay much emphasis on its doctrinal side. This can be explained by the fact that our lamented doctor being advanced in age at the time of his acquaintance with the Bahá’í teachings was not able to devote all his time to a deep study of the tenets of the Faith.</p>
  
    <p id='101'>Shoghi Effendi, however, in his letter addressed personally to your father explained to him that the Bahá’ís should firmly believe in the existence of God and in the immortality of the soul and in many other fundamental teachings which the Bahá’ís share with the adherents of many other religions. Our lamented doctor may have most probably considered it unwise to declare openly that he had rejected all his previous conceptions in regard to the existence of God and such similar ideas and preferred to express in an indirect way the many changes which the knowledge of the Faith had brought in his mind by declaring that he had become a Bahá’í.</p>
  
    <p id='102'>At any rate there is no doubt whatever that the well-known Tablet revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for him had brought a tremendous <span data-pg='19' id='pg19'></span> change in his monistic theories and induced him to accept the Message openly.</p>
  
    <p id='103'>However great the contradictions in Dr. Forel’s testament in regard to his attitude towards the Cause we cannot fail but to recognize him as a Bahá’í who had but a partial glimpse of the Bahá’í Revelation. No one can claim that his knowledge of this Revelation is adequate, especially at this time when the Bahá’í Faith is still in the embryonic stage of its development. Dr. Forel was sincere in his convictions but like every human being his comprehension was limited and this was not in his power to change.</p>
  
    <p id='104'>These are the ideas which came to Shoghi Effendi’s mind when he read a ‘résumé of Dr. Forel’s testament in one of the well-known Swiss journals and he wishes you to share them with all those who are interested to know of the Doctor’s attitude towards this Movement….</p>
  
    <p id='105'>[From the Guardian:]</p>
  
    <p id='106'>Dear and valued co-worker:</p>
  
    <p id='107'>The passing of your distinguished father has indeed grieved me profoundly and I wish to assure you of my heartfelt sympathy in your irreparable loss. I would deeply appreciate a written account of his eventful life and of the meritorious services he rendered humanity, either from your pen or any other friend in Germany, for publication in the next issue of the Bahá’í World. I feel that his reference to the Cause in the codicil of this testament indicates the perceptible change in his mental outlook since he penned the earlier passages of his will, for he must have known from the Tablet he received as well as from the letters I wrote him and from many other Bahá’í publications the fundamental and distinguishing features of the Cause. That is why I feel that with your consent and approval, the publication of his references to the Cause in his testament could very well be published in the Bahá’í World. With my best wishes and deepest sympathy,</p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='116'>14 January 1932</p>
  
    <p id='117'>Shoghi Effendi was very glad to learn that you devote a considerable amount of your time to the study of the teachings. It is absolutely essential for those who desire to spread the movement to be quite familiar with the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and the <span data-pg='21' id='pg21'></span> Master. Without that knowledge we may be spreading our own views and wrongly attributing to them things that are the result of our imaginings.</p>
  
    <p id='118'>Concerning cremation I have not seen anything in the writings. But as Bahá’u’lláh in the book of Aqdas directs the friends to bury their dead, he indirectly discourages cremation. Whether there is some basic reason for such a preference he does not say, but we may try and find it.</p>
  
    <p id='119'>‘Abdu’l-Bahá does often state that the medical science will much improve. With the appearance of every Revelation a new insight is created in man and this in turn expresses itself in the growth of science. This has happened in past dispensations and we find its earliest fruits in our present day. What we see however is only the beginning. With the spiritual awakening of man this force will develop and marvelous results will become manifest. Among other phases of human learning the medical science will have a place. There is a Tablet of Medicine that Bahá’u’lláh has revealed and which is translated into English.

    <p id='123'>Dear Bahá’í Brothers and Sisters:</p>
  
    <p id='124'>Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated November 28th 1932 written on the occasion of <span data-pg='22' id='pg22'></span> the commemoration of the passing away of our beloved Master ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.</p>
  
    <p id='125'>The Guardian is very glad to see that at such celebrations the friends come together and with a true spirit of service and devotion renew their determination to consecrate their life to the service of the Faith. It is only through such methods that the fire of enthusiasm can be kept burning in our hearts, and that we can keep the goal of our very being upon this earth ever present before our minds.</p>
  
    <p id='126'>In his moments of prayer at the blessed Shrines, Shoghi Effendi will think of you all and ask God to guide you and sustain your efforts. He trusts that through your constant efforts and God’s infinite grace the Cause will spread throughout that city and the neighbouring regions and your group become a center of attraction for those sincere souls who seek the spiritual life and desire the resuscitation of mankind….</p>

    <p id='128'>Dear co-workers:</p>
  
    <p id='129'>Your welcome message brought cheer and comfort to me in my great sorrow. I value your sentiments, your collaboration, your assurances of undying loyalty to the Cause of God. I will continue to supplicate for you all the Beloved’s blessings.</p>

    <p id='132'>It is surely very unfortunate that the material means do not permit you to travel as much as you desire. But these days are exceptional. Better days are sure to come, and you, as well as other souls who desire to serve, will find the way open for them. <span data-pg='23' id='pg23'></span></p>
  
    <p id='133'>Meanwhile you can try and teach those you meet—people who are within easy reach and who also need the spiritual enlightenment that the spirit and teachings of the Cause provide.</p>
  
    <p id='134'>The German people have true appreciation for spiritual matters and when they are interested in a certain sphere they are not satisfied with a shallow knowledge of it. They try to go deep in any subject they take up, and once they are convinced of its truth are ready to devote all their life to it. Such are the people that the Cause needs. Such should be the souls that you should try and interest in the Faith.</p>
  
    <p id='135'>[From the Guardian:]</p>
  
    <p id='136'>I greatly value your past and present services, and cherish bright hopes for your future contributions to the spread of our beloved Faith. Persevere in your efforts, and, if possible, travel to different centres in central and south-Eastern Europe, and do all you possibly can to further the interests of the Faith. This work is highly meritorious. May the Beloved inspire, sustain and bless you.</p>

    <p id='230'>He wishes me particularly to convey to you his most genuine appreciation of your services in connection with the publication of “La Nova Tago” which he hopes will, through your efforts and those of the Esperanto-speaking Bahá’ís both in Germany and abroad, develop gradually into a leading Esperanto review, and thus become an effective medium for the spread of Teachings in Esperantist circles throughout the world. It is in view of the far-reaching possibilities which this publication can have as a teaching organ, that he has urged the German N.S.A. to resume its publication when, a few months ago, they had almost decided to discontinue printing it.</p>
  
    <p id='231'>With regard to your request for a special article from the Guardian which you wish to have published in the forthcoming issue of your magazine. He would suggest that you should translate his general letter addressed to the friends a few years ago, entitled “The Goal of a New World Order”, as this, he feels, is a very suitable material for publication in that review, and is by far better than anything he can write at present.</p>
  
    <p id='232'>As to your suggestion regarding a more widespread use of the Esperanto among the Bahá’ís as a medium of correspondence. Shoghi Effendi, as you know, has been invariably encouraging the believers, both in the East and in the West, to make an intensive study of that language, and to consider it as an important medium for the spread of the Cause in international circles. He has been specially urging the friends to have the Cause well represented in all Esperanto Congresses and associations, and by this means cultivate greater friendship and cooperation between them and the Esperantists.</p>
  
    <p id='233'>But in this connection, he feels, he must make it clear that although the Cause views with much sympathy and appreciation the activities which the Esperantists are increasingly initiating for <span data-pg='37' id='pg37'></span> the spread of their language, yet it considers that the adoption of the Esperanto by the entire world is by no means an inevitable fact. Neither Bahá’u’lláh, nor even ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, ever stated that Esperanto will be the international auxiliary language. The Master simply expressed the hope that it may, provided certain conditions were fulfilled, develop into such a medium. </p>

    <p id='345'>Dear Bahá’í Friends:</p>
  
    <p id='346'>Your letter dated May 23rd has reached our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf, and to thank you for the loving greetings you sent him.</p>
  
    <p id='347'>He hopes that now the believers in Germany are at last free to work for the Cause they will strive together—as the Master desired—as one soul in many bodies and show forth such an example of love and unity within the Bahá’í Community that the hearts of the people will be attracted to them. The world is longing <span data-pg='51' id='pg51'></span> for example more than for anything else, for on all sides we hear good advice but see no sincerity and no practicing of what people are preaching!</p>
  
    <p id='348'>He assures you all his loving prayers are offered on your behalf and for the success of your Bahá’í work…</p>
  
    <p id='349'>[From the Guardian:]</p>
  
    <p id='350'>Dear and valued co-workers:</p>
  
    <p id='351'>I was so pleased to hear from you and to receive such expressions of devotion and determination in the service of our beloved Faith. Your centre is near and dear to my heart, and you are, I assure you, often in my thoughts. I will pray for your success, for the extension of your activities, and the speedy realization of the hopes you cherish for the advancement of our glorious Faith,</p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='353'>12 July 1946</p>
  
    <p id='354'>Dear Bahá’í Brother and Bahá’í Friends:</p>
  
    <p id='355'>The Post Card you sent our beloved Guardian on June 3rd reached him, and he was very happy to receive news from you direct and from your dear family and all the Bahá’í friends who were gathered together with you on that day in Neckärgemund.</p>
  
    <p id='356'>He hopes you (Dr. Grossmann) received the long letter he forwarded to you (in answer to yours) through Mr. Holley?</p>
  
    <p id='357'>The news of the devotion, enthusiasm, and renewed activity of the dear German Bahá’ís is a source of joy to him, and he hopes that the N.S.A. is able to meet often and conduct the affairs of the Faith in that country, where for so long it was banned and persecuted. <span data-pg='52' id='pg52'></span></p>
  
    <p id='358'>You may be sure his loving prayers are often offered on your behalf, for the success of your labours to promote the Faith, and for your protection and welfare…</p>
  
    <p id='359'>P.S. The Guardian is very anxious to receive reports of the work of the N.S.A. He considers it advisable that during the course of this year any groups which attain nine members should be allowed to form an Assembly at once without waiting until April 21st. in order to encourage the friends after so many years of suppression and suffering.</p>
  
    <p id='360'>[From the Guardian:]</p>
  
    <p id='361'>May the Spirit of Bahá’u’lláh sustain, guide and bless you in your truly exemplary and meritorious services, aid you to overcome all obstacles in your path, to extend the range of your activities, to proclaim the truths of this glorious Faith to the suffering masses, and to multiply and consolidate its God-given institutions,</p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='363'>25 July 1946</p>
  
    <p id='364'>He was delighted at the good news you conveyed to him; for some time now he has been anxiously awaiting news of the activities of the N.S.A.—if it is feasible, please send him reports of that body.</p>
  
    <p id='365'>He feels that, in view of all the German believers have passed through, their long period of persecution and suppression, that it is all right during this year to permit the formation of local assemblies, as soon as 9 or more believers are available, in order to encourage the friends and stimulate their work in the teaching field. </p>

    <p id='367'>He feels that the subject of the Bahá’í work in Esperanto in Germany is a matter for you to take up with the National Spiritual Assembly; we Bahá’ís do not claim Esperanto will be the auxiliary language of the future—but, as we firmly believe in the necessity of an auxiliary language we are glad to support this work by publishing books in Esperanto and encouraging the Bahá’ís to learn it, if they wish to. Cooperation with this society is an excellent means of spreading the Cause, as Martha Root demonstrated in her travels. However, all details in this matter must be decided by the N.S.A. You can contact Bahá’í Esperantists in England and the U.S.A. through their respective N.S.As. </p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='368'>30 July 1946</p>
  
    <p id='369'>He was so very happy to hear the wonderful news you conveyed of the receptivity you find among the German people, and especially the youth, to the Teachings.</p>
  
    <p id='370'>He considers the work of the Cause in Germany of primary importance; the German believers not only have the fertile field of their own people’s minds to cultivate, but must, eventually, do a large part of the teaching work to be carried out in the future in Central and Eastern Europe. So he is very anxious to have your affairs running on a smooth administrative basis, and to also have you receive the necessary literature or means of printing it.</p>
  
    <p id='371'>He was also delighted to hear the Sun of Truth is again being printed, and that you have been able, in spite of so many handicaps, to distribute thousands of pamphlets and hold so many important public meetings. <span data-pg='54' id='pg54'></span></p>
  
    <p id='372'>Now is certainly the time to carry on the work on an ever-increasing scale; the hearts have suffered much, and the minds are grasping for a solution to the terrible problems facing them. The Cause can surely, in this golden hour of opportunity, make greater headway than ever before in its history in Europe, and you may be sure he will do all in his power to assist you in your labours.</p>
  
    <p id='373'>He assures you his loving and ardent prayers will be offered on your behalf and for the success of the work you and the other friends are carrying on at present…</p>
  
    <p id='374'>P.S. The Guardian was very pleased to hear that the former adherents of Ruth White and Mr. Herrigel’s ideas have expressed the desire to be enrolled in the Faith, and to work according to the administrative Order. He recommends that the National Assembly, by all means, accept them, and assist them to fully grasp the fundamentals of the Will and Testament.</p>
  
    <p id='375'>[From the Guardian:]</p>
  
    <p id='376'>Dear and valued co-worker,</p>
  
    <p id='377'>I am so glad and grateful to learn of the progress of your activities and of the success attending your efforts in the service of our beloved Faith. I feel confident that you will, in the days to come, add fresh laurels to the crown you have already won in the service of our beloved Faith. Persevere, and rest assured that I will continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart.</p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='379'>29 December 1946</p>
  
    <p id='380'>The sufferings which the German Bahá’ís have passed through have grieved his heart very much—but he is very proud of their loyal and devoted spirit, and the way their faith in Bahá’u’lláh has <span data-pg='55' id='pg55'></span> come out of the fire of these war years pure and unstained and stronger than ever! They have a great future, promised them by the beloved Master…</p>
  
    <p id='381'>As you may perhaps have heard, our Guardian does not like to give pictures of himself to the believers—he prefers that they should keep in their homes photographs of the Master Who is our inspiration and Exemplar.</p>
  
    <p id='382'>He hopes very much that you will be able to teach other young Germans the Cause there. The youth in particular need desperately to be given the Message, for it is their lives that have suffered the greatest ruin through this cruel war. Teaching them should be your first duty… </p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='383'>18 January 1947</p>
  
    <p id='384'>Your welcome letters … were received, together with the poems you enclosed in them…</p>
  
    <p id='385'>He wishes me to assure you he will include some of the poems in the next volume of “Bahá’í World”; it is, unfortunately, too late to get them into the latest number which is now being printed in America.</p>
  
    <p id='386'>It seems now absolutely certain that our dear Bahá’í sister, Lydia Zamenhof, lost her life in a gas-chamber during the war! It is a great loss, as she could have rendered the Faith many services in Europe in these past-war days! But her services to the Cause and her memory are imperishable!</p>
  
    <p id='387'>He would be very pleased to receive an article from you about her for the next volume of Bahá’í World, but not for the “In Memoriam” section. Also he regrets he will not be able to publish <span data-pg='56' id='pg56'></span> in the Bahá’í World the In Memoriam article you sent about your dear parents. Only those people who have died in the period covered by each volume receive mention in that volume, and the next one will be for 1946–48!…</p>
  
    <p id='388'>P.S. He is very happy to hear dear Mr. Zabih is meeting the friends there; you may be sure he will pray that the way may open for him to help you all in Germany at the present time and serve the Faith in England later on.</p>
  
    <p id='389'>The Guardian assures you he is delighted to hear of the translations you have already made and are at present engaged upon; the German literature of the Faith is of the utmost importance, both because of the great future the Cause has there, and the fact that so many other Europeans read German. He hopes “Gleanings” and the “Dispensation” can soon be printed. These matters you should refer to your Nat. Spiritual Assembly.</p>
  
    <p id='390'>[From the Guardian:]</p>
  
    <p id='391'>My dear and valued co-worker:</p>
  
    <p id='392'>I am so glad and grateful to learn of the activity and perseverance of the dear German believers, and of your own valued and constant services to our beloved Faith. You are, I assure you, often in my thoughts and prayers, and I prize the spirit that animates you in His service. I cherish the brightest hopes for the future of your historic work for the promotion of the Faith, and wish you to persevere and rest assured that the Beloved will continue to guide and sustain you, and will reward you abundantly for your high endeavours.</p>

    <p id='395'>He realizes that every effort the friends make in Germany these days is made in the face of great obstacles and at the cost of real sacrifice. But they must ever keep their goals in sight, and persevere for the sake of the Cause and for the sake of their fellow-countrymen who now, in their greatest hour of need, have the right to hear of Bahá’u’lláh Who alone can save the world and lead it to peace and happiness.</p>
  
    <p id='396'>He will certainly pray that all obstacles may be soon overcome, and the printing work go ahead. He also hopes, and will pray, that the N.S.A. will make every effort to arrange its affairs so as to meet in Frankfurt. These things cannot be done over night, he fully realizes, but the believers must strive to accomplish them constantly.</p>
  
    <p id='397'>The services which you and your dear family are so constantly rendering the Faith are very, very deeply appreciated by him. Be happy that God has enabled you to do so much for His Faith!</p>

    <p id='406'>He was very happy to see that so many of you are now active in the Holy Faith in Plochingen and holding your Feasts and meetings regularly in such a spirit of dedication and Bahá’í love. This love and unity among the friends cannot but attract the blessings of Bahá’u’lláh upon your work for His Cause.</p>
  
    <p id='407'>Now is the time to teach the hungry, war-disillusioned people of Germany the Message of God for this day. He urges you to redouble your efforts to attract and confirm new souls, and to teach them not only the spiritual aspects of the Faith but its World Order as well—for this Divine solution to the ills of mankind is what the people need to hear of.</p>
  
    <p id='408'>He remembers the visit of Mrs. Henseler and Mrs. Victoria B. von Sigsfeld to Haifa, and is happy to hear both have been ceaselessly active in the Cause, the one until her death and the other up until the present day! To serve is indeed a blessed privilege!</p>

    <p id='436'>Your joint letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Jan. 19th, and announcing the formation of your joint Assembly, reached him, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf and congratulate you on this great step forward you have taken.</p>
  
    <p id='437'>He hopes that in the near future your numbers will grow sufficiently to enable you to form two separate Spiritual Assemblies, and he assures you all that he will pray in the Holy Shrines that this objective may speedily be achieved.</p>
  
    <p id='438'>Your services, in these days of toil and trouble for your native land, are of the utmost importance and upon them depends the future course of events in its spiritual unfoldment…</p>

    <p id='440'>May the Beloved of our hearts bless, guide and sustain you in your devoted endeavours and continued services to His Cause, aid you to extend the range of your activities, and enable you to win mighty victories for His Faith,</p>
  
    <p class='Ssignature' id='441'>Your true brother, <br> Shoghi March 1947</p>
  
    <p id='442'>Bahá’u’lláh has given His wonderful teachings and His New World Order to all men; it is up to each individual to accept this Divine Message and promote its healing laws and principles for himself. No one can decide for you what you must do. Your own heart must tell you that your place is serving this struggling new <span data-pg='62' id='pg62'></span> Faith in the days when it is still, for the most part, unrecognized by the masses. In the future, when it has won more adherents, and its true stature becomes obvious to all, it will not require the courage to sponsor it which it does today!</p>
  
    <p id='443'>We must always remember that the administrative Order is a means to an end, an instrument to co-ordinate and unify the efforts of the Bahá’ís. It is still imperfectly understood by them, but very great progress has been made already. Now, through this administration, it is becoming possible to at last bring the knowledge of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings to the masses, and this is a field you could render great services in. Your fire, your love for your fellow men, are qualities much needed in our work, and Shoghi Effendi hopes you will feel the urge to plunge yourself into the service of this glorious Cause.</p>
  
    <p id='444'>In Germany there is such a demand for the teachings that the German Bahá’ís, exhausted from the war and hampered by restrictions on travel, etc., find it almost impossible to meet the call on their teaching abilities. They are a very devoted, well organized Community, but could surely use all the extra help they can get. If you could see your way clear to go to Germany and aid them in the teaching work, it would be rendering that suffering land a great spiritual service. </p>

This is therefore the time for the Bahá’ís to teach the Cause as never <span data-pg='63' id='pg63'></span> before, especially to the young people, and spread the glad tidings that a solution to the world’s problems exists!</p>
  
    <p id='447'>The German National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís is now doing all it can to get more Bahá’í books printed; it also has many new and important translations of our books already made, and we hope very soon these will be printed and distributed.</p>

    <p id='454'>The Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Stuttgart.</p>
  
    <p id='455'>Dear Bahá’í Friends:</p>
  
    <p id='456'>The letter you wrote our beloved Guardian, dated Jan. 11th, 1947, was received, as well as the report you enclosed of the <span data-pg='64' id='pg64'></span> meetings held in Stuttgart, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>
  
    <p id='457'>He was very pleased to see that there are now as many as 95 believers there, and he hopes this number will steadily and rapidly increase. All the Bahá’ís, new and old alike, should devote themselves as much as possible to teaching the Faith; they should also realize that the atmosphere of true love and unity which they manifest within the Bahá’í Community will directly affect the public, and be the greatest magnet for attracting people to the Faith and confirming them.</p>
  
    <p id='458'>In considering purchasing the Schwarz home as a future headquarters for the Stuttgart Bahá’ís, (a plan which he fully approves of) he urges you to, at the same time, bear in mind the responsibility of all the Bahá’ís—in Stuttgart and elsewhere—towards the purchase and maintenance of a National Headquarters; this is of the utmost importance, and when such a headquarters is established it will greatly stimulate the work all over Germany, Stuttgart included.

    <aside data-fnid='hd270:1'>to Dr. Adelbert Mühlschlegel</aside>
  
    <p class='Sdate' id='472'>3 May 1947</p>
  
    <p id='473'>Your letters to our beloved Guardian, dated Feb. 7th and 11th, as well as the manuscript of “Hidden Words” have been received, and he has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.</p>
  
    <p id='474'>He is very happy to have this opportunity of communicating with you personally, and assuring you of how much he appreciates your devoted services in the path of our glorious Faith.</p>
  
    <p id='475'>Regarding the questions you have asked him:</p>
  
    <p id='476'>There is no correspondence or connection between the Hidden Word (Arabic) no. 1 and the last Arabic Hidden Word, or between these and any passage of the Seven Valleys.</p>
  
    <p id='477'>The Cairo edition of the Hidden Words, approved by the Master, is the one you must refer to for accuracy, and disregard all <span data-pg='66' id='pg66'></span> other texts. This answers the questions connected with Hidden Words number 18 and 39 and 1 (two) and 35 (two).</p>
  
    <p id='478'>Hidden Word no. 70: this is not addressed to any person but is a mystical expression and an allusion to the Manifestation of God.</p>
  
    <p id='479'>No marginal notes should be added except any of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself or the notes of the Cairo edition.</p>
  
    <p id='480'>The whole question of translation from the original text is very important. He has just written on this subject, at some length, to Baroness von Werthern, explaining to her that he considers now is not the time to translate the teachings into German from Persian and Arabic. No Persian with a sufficient expert knowledge of German is available to help in this matter; he does not feel, therefore, that such works as “Some Answered Questions”, “Seven Valleys”, etc. should be embarked upon at all. People who have not spent years steeped in the atmosphere and language and literature of the East cannot possibly grasp the subtleties of oriental usage. A good example of this very point is that Prof. Süssheim has not grasped what Bahá’u’lláh means by the word “[Arabic script]“. He is using it in a loose and colloquial sense which means “a passing thing”, a small amount, and not literally associating it with food.</p>
  
    <p id='481'>He feels you should continue your study of the teachings in the original and, from time to time, if you desire to, translate material from the original in short excerpts; but not at present important books and Tablets. These you can better translate from good English editions.</p>
  
    <p id='482'>There is so much teaching work, and administrative work, to be done in Germany at present that he urges you to concentrate on this form of service. The public need to receive the Message on a large scale, to have available literature at once, to read articles on the Bahá’í Faith; and in all these ways your services can be of great help.</p>
  
    <p id='483'>P.S. “Tur” and “Sinai” should not be taken literally; the first is an <span data-pg='67' id='pg67'></span> allusion to Mt. Sinai, which in this case means the Manifestation of God; the second, “Sinai”, represents the human heart.</p>
  
    <p id='484'>[From the Guardian:]</p>
  
    <p id='485'>May the Almighty bless, sustain and guide you, at all times and under all conditions, assist you to proclaim the verities of His Faith, and lend a tremendous impetus to the advancement and consolidation of its new-born and God-given institutions,</p>

    <aside data-fnid='hd271:1'>to Mrs. Anna Grossmann</aside>
  
    <p class='Sdate' id='487'>13 June 1947</p>
  
    <p id='488'>He was happy to hear the message had been broadcast over the Radio Frankfurt, and hopes this teaching method can often be used, as it reaches the people in their homes and many of them would not attend public meetings.</p>
  
    <p id='489'>The very encouraging report you sent him of the work in Germany was most welcome, and he wishes that the National Teaching Committee or the N.S.A. would send him a statement showing how many Spiritual Assemblies there are, how many groups and how many isolated Bahá’ís, and in which cities and towns they are to be found, respectively.</p>
  
    <p id='490'>Generally speaking his instructions to the American Bahá’ís and their N.S.A. are, whenever they concern administrative principles and procedure and general statements about and interpretations of the Faith, binding for all Bahá’ís everywhere. Naturally specific instructions to the American Bahá’ís are not applicable to other communities. “Bahá’í Procedure”, as Mr. Holley pointed out, is not binding on other National Assemblies, as many things <span data-pg='68' id='pg68'></span> in it are purely secondary rulings made by the American N.S.A. to facilitate the work of the Cause under its jurisdiction.</p>
  
    <p id='491'>The believers should certainly, under no circumstances, drink any alcoholic beverages as this has been forbidden in the Aqdas. Not all of its laws and precepts can be practiced at present; but those he has, in his instructions to America, laid down as applicable at present should be followed. </p>

In connection with the question you asked him about the advisability of putting on your house a name plate saying “Bahá’í Búro”, this is something you must get permission for either from the Spiritual Assembly of Berlin (if it is functioning by the time you return) or the National Assembly.</p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='521'>21 November 1947</p>
  
    <p id='522'>Regarding your questions: by holiness in our Bahá’í teachings is meant attachment to God, His Precepts and His Will. We are not ascetics in any sense of the word. On the contrary, Bahá’u’lláh says God has created all the good things in the world for us to enjoy and partake of. But we must not become attached to them and put them before the spiritual things. Chastity in the strict sense means not to have sexual intercourse, or sexual intimacies, before marriage. In the general sense it means not to be licentious. This does not mean we Bahá’ís believe sexual relations to be impure or wrong. On the contrary they are natural and should be considered one of God’s many blessings. He does not know anything about whether albumen and delicious food affect sex; this is a medical question. Sex is a very individual matter, some people are more passionate by nature than others, and might consequently suffer more if forced to be continent. But when the world becomes more spiritual there will not be such an exaggerated emphasis on sex, as there is today, and consequently it will be easier for young people to be chaste and control their passions. A man of noble character and strong willpower, could certainly remain faithful to his wife during a long absence!</p>
  
    <p id='523'>Any good orientalist could probably refer you to commentaries on the Qur’án and on the Buddhist Scriptures. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stated that all references of Muḥammad to fighting refer to defensive war, not to aggression. </p>

    <p id='585'>He has, as a result of your letter, just cabled you via Geneva asking you to please get from Mrs … the letter Hussein wrote her and forward it to him, as he wishes to see it.</p>
  
    <p id='586'>I cannot tell you how much and how bitterly our beloved Guardian has suffered from the disloyalty and dishonourable conduct of the members of the Master’s Family, and now his own family. They have not only disobeyed him, and flouted his advice and instructions, but done things which are so shameful he is unable to mention them. In view of this, he was forced in 1944, to expel Hussein—but not until he had of his own accord left the Master’s house gone to the Covenant-Breakers, and refused warnings and advice alike. His heart is unrepentant, and his character greatly changed, which is surely a great tragedy. <span data-pg='79' id='pg79'></span></p>
  
    <p id='587'>He was very pleased to hear you were able to visit the Bahá’í convention in Hamburg, and that you found the believers there so enthusiastic and devoted. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done everywhere, and such active and tireless workers, as you and your dear family, are needed urgently in every direction!</p>
  
    <p id='588'>He most deeply values your loyalty, your devotion and your services. You may be sure he will pray for you in the Holy Shrines and for your family and dear Mrs Benke….</p>
  
    <p id='589'>[From the Guardian:]</p>
  
    <p id='590'>Dear and valued co-worker:</p>
  
    <p id='591'>I deeply and increasingly appreciate the spirit that animates you, and wish to assure you of my abiding appreciation of your exemplary loyalty, your perseverance and splendid services to our glorious Faith. Persevere in your manifold and meritorious activities, and rest assured that the Beloved is well pleased with the standard of your accomplishments,</p>

    <p id='594'>He sees no objection to the Bahá’ís taking part in the movement for “World-Citizenship”, as this is marking towards one of our most cherished goals—the unification of the human race under some form of International government. As long as this movement takes no political sides of any nature and keeps quite clear of all forms of politics, the Bahá’ís may support it.</p>
  
    <p id='595'>He thinks it was a fine gesture for the National Assembly to invite Mr. Garry Davis to be present on Bahá’í-World-Youth-Day and he hopes, this courageous and independent man will be able to accept the invitation. </p>

    <p id='597'>You, as devoted and experienced believers, must do all in your power to urge the friends to unite in order to protect the Faith. The Hamburg difficulty is not insurmountable, as long as the friends all make up their minds that no sacrifice of personal feeling or opinion in this matter is too great to make in order to maintain the unity of the administrative order there and the unity of the believers. The more friends take sides, the more difficult it will be to solve this problem.</p>
  
    <p id='598'>He urges you both to encourage your son and brother to look upon the perfection of the Faith and not upon the imperfections of the believers—for we are all imperfect. </p>

    <p id='603'>He was very pleased indeed to learn you held such successful meetings on this occasion, and to see with what fervour and devotion you are assuming your responsibilities as young Bahá’ís who, in the not distant future, will be called upon to carry forward so much of the important work of the Faith as adult members of the Community. </p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='604'>20 March 1949</p>
  
    <p id='605'>Regarding your book: he feels that this can only come under the heading, judging by the outline you gave him, of a romance woven about a historical episode: the Báb and the events following His Martyr(dom); we do not know enough concrete facts about the relation of the Russian Court, the Russian consul, and what exact part he played in the events of those days to fill a large paragraph! He feels, therefore, that your book should be presented as such a romance, and not in any way as a historical narrative.</p>
  
    <p id='606'>There were many factors at work in releasing Bahá’u’lláh from the Síyáh <u>Ch</u>ál, not the last of which was the intervention of His own sister who presented very valuable gifts to the <u>Sh</u>áh himself while she interceded for her Brother’s life. So you see your information—not merely yours, any Bahá’ís at the present time—is far too scanty to permit of a really historical account being written. This does not mean you cannot get your book out as a romance. He certainly would not want you to destroy your manuscript! </p>

    <h2 class='head'>Letter of 31 March 1949</h2> <span data-pg='82' id='pg82'></span>
  
    <p class='Sdate' id='609'>31 March 1949</p>
  
    <p id='610'>First, let me say that one of the reasons God has given us the institution of Guardianship is to prevent men from crystallizing the Cause of God into a rigid system. Your questions are mostly along the line of trying to lay down a fixed pattern for future society, long before the time for such a pattern is ripe. Remember that Bahá’u’lláh says what is not already revealed, the International House of Justice must in the future legislate, and it can make, and abrogate if necessary, its own laws. This means not fixity in guiding society, but fluidity!</p>
  
    <p id='611'>No. 1 Bahá’u’lláh and the Master mention only Local, National and an International House of Justice. There is no provision for divisional ones. Each city will have its own Spiritual Assembly, not a number of district ones. Naturally, district 19 Day Feasts can be held where there are very many Bahá’ís in one city.</p>
  
    <p id='612'>No. 2 The Hands of the Cause will have executive authority in so far as they carry out the work of the Guardian.</p>
  
    <p id='613'>No. 3 Spiritual Assembly is the name at present for the body which in future will be called “House of Justice”.</p>
  
    <p id='614'>No. 4 The Badí Calendar will be used generally. The Bahá’í week has seven days.</p>
  
    <p id='615'>No. 5 There is nothing about “ground organization”. These details are left for future legislation.</p>
  
    <p id='616'>No. 6 No. Such things are for the consideration of the legislative bodies in future.</p>
  
    <p id='617'>No. 7 No. But ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated there are other worlds than ours which are inhabited by beings capable of knowing God.</p>
  
    <p id='618'>No. 8 The Bahá’í Temple in America has been dragging on, uncompleted, since 19..(figures unreadable); its completion is absolutely essential. We are builders, we have confidence in the protection of God. We cannot give up our work just because the atom bomb has been invented! This would be cowardly! The <span data-pg='83' id='pg83'></span> United Nations disposes of millions and millions of dollars and part of its work is to educate humanity towards peace and against war. Our completion of the Bahá’í Temple will cost 3/4 of a million; what could this sum do in comparison to the efforts of the United Nations?</p>
  
    <p id='619'>The thing the German believers must do is to deepen themselves in the Covenants of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Mere intellectual understanding of the teachings is not enough. Deep spirituality is essential, and the foundation of true spirituality is steadfastness in the Covenant. </p>

    <aside data-fnid='hd296:1'>to Dr. Hermann Grossmann</aside>
  
    <p class='Sdate' id='620'>11 April 1949</p>
  
    <p id='621'>He fully approves of Dr. Townshend being invited to speak in Germany, as you propose, providing, of course, that the necessary funds for his trip can be arranged for.</p>
  
    <p id='622'>The contact with intellectuals is very important, but so far, like the early days of Christianity, in the West, few of them have cared to identify themselves with this young and struggling Faith of ours! Let us hope, however, that the time is approaching when they will.</p>
  
    <p id='623'>The Guardian has been considerably disturbed by the inharmony that has arisen in Germany. He feels that what the German Bahá’ís need—and must have—more than anything else in the world is a far deeper understanding of the Covenants of both Bahá’u’lláh and the Master. This is the rock foundation without which no sound super-structure can be built. Neither the administration, nor the general teaching work of the Cause in Germany, will progress, or be able to accomplish anything, unless the believers are truly firm, deep, spiritually convinced Bahá’ís. <span data-pg='84' id='pg84'></span> An intellectual grasp of the teachings is purely superficial; with the first real test such believers are shaken from the bough! But once a Bahá’í has the profound conviction of the authority from God, nested in the Prophet, passed on to the Master, and by Him, to the Guardians, and which flows out through the assemblies and creates order based on obedience—once a Bahá’í has this, nothing can shake him. He, therefore, urges you, and the other members of the N.G.R., to devote as much time as you possibly can, to educating the believers in the Covenant. </p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='624'>15 April 1949</p>
  
    <p id='625'>As he has cabled the N.S.A. a few days ago, he feels that the difficulties which have arisen in Germany, and which called forth the letter you rightly felt was likely to cause more harm than good, are mainly due to the fact that the believers need to be deepened in their knowledge and appreciation of the Covenants of both Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This is the stronghold of the Faith of every Bahá’í, and that which enables him to withstand every test and the attacks of the enemies outside the Faith, and the far more dangerous, insidious, lukewarm people inside the Faith who have no real attachment to the Covenant, and consequently uphold the intellectual aspect of the teachings while at the same time undermining the spiritual foundation upon which the whole Cause of God rests.</p>
  
    <p id='626'>He feels you and your dear family should do all you can to teach the believers the Will and Testament to strengthen their understanding of its important provisions; for all the authority of the administrative bodies, as well as of the Guardian himself, is mainly derived from this tremendous document. </p>

    <p class='Sdate' id='627'>27 May 1949</p>
  
    <p id='628'>The Guardian, in spite of the fact that there is a larger community in Stuttgart, is very anxious to have the national affairs of the German Bahá’í Community centered in Frankfurt, which is far more central. He realizes at first this will present some difficulties for the friends, but every step forward in the Cause always is attended by complications and difficulties. The same was true in America, where for years New York was the center of the administration for America. When the National Headquarters were shifted to Chicago, it was at first very inconvenient, but it now has proved much more convenient and suitable than New York ever was. </p>

    <p id='631'>Dear Bahá’í Friends:</p>
  
    <p id='632'>Your letter to our beloved Guardian, of April 20, and conveying to him your loving Riḍván greetings, was received, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.</p>
  
    <p id='633'>He values very deeply your message of loyalty and devotion and your assurance that you will uphold the administration of our beloved Faith.</p>
  
    <p id='634'>The German friends must always remember that, after the long years of suppression, and the war, when they were both cut off from the Guardian and forbidden to hold organized meetings, it is only natural that difficulties should sometimes arise in the course of their progress. <span data-pg='86' id='pg86'></span></p>
  
    <p id='635'>The main thing, however, is that all the believers should at all times feel conscious of their deep unity and brotherhood in the Cause of God, and that with love and understanding they should arise to overcome every problem, knowing that the Master will help and assist them to do so.</p>
  
    <p id='636'>Firmness in the Covenant is their Fortress, their greatest protection, and new Bahá’ís should be taught this before they are admitted into the Community. In this way they will be given the spiritual strength to overcome the tests which are inevitable, and which strengthen the growth of the Community and drive its roots deeper in the soil of faith.</p>
  
    <p id='637'>He hopes your Bahá’í work will make great progress during this Bahá’í year…</p>

    <p id='639'>Dear and valued co-workers:</p>
  
    <p id='640'>Your joint and most welcome message brought great joy to my heart, as I feel greatly attached to, and greatly value the sentiments of the members of a community which has distinguished itself by its zeal, its accomplishments, its long record of service, and on which the Beloved has conferred such great bounties and blessings. I cherish great hopes for its future, and will supplicate on its behalf, that the Almighty may enable it to render His Faith still more notable services, and contribute, in an outstanding manner, to the onward march of the Faith and the development of its institutions in that promising country.</p>

However, this does not change the fact that in view of her inhered convictions about Bahá’u’lláh it is best for the Bahá’ís, including yourself, not to associate with her. That which is in the heart of those who have actively opposed the Manifestation of God is spiritually unhealthy, and although we in our limited human understanding cannot always see the wisdom of shunning them, the Master has instructed us to do so, and for our good, and the good of the Cause, we must obey this instruction.</p>
  
    <p id='645'>The matter of your giving up your church membership is a conscientious obligation.

    <p id='662'>He read with interest the report of the activities of the Youth, and was particularly pleased to see that Dr. Grossmann had given a course on the Covenant. The Youth must ponder deeply over the significance and implications of the Covenants of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, for these form the hub of the Bahá’í wheel, so to speak, the point of unity and strength for all the believers all over the world. Without these Covenants the Divine Protection of God over this new world Faith would not exist. Obedience to these Covenants is the stronghold of all the Bahá’ís, everywhere.</p>

    <p id='673'>He feels your Assembly, wisely and lovingly, must guide the friends to a firmer grasp of both the independent nature of our glorious Faith and the need to study and uphold its Administrative Order.</p>
  
    <p id='674'>To continue to be a member of the church places a Bahá’í in an insincere position—for we believe the Christ has come again, in Bahá’u’lláh, and that all His promises have been gloriously fulfilled. No church would tolerate one of its members believing such a thing, for the church is still blindly waiting the second coming. Therefore it is obvious why the Bahá’ís must leave the church, they are not leaving Christ, but rather rallying to His support in the new day of His coming.</p>
  
    <p id='675'>Also, he feels your Assembly should obey and work with the National Assembly in the greatest love and harmony. The past must be forgotten, and all the believers concentrate, unitedly on the spread of the Faith and strengthening its administration.</p>

    <p id='683'>As the Guardian already wrote the N.G.R., he feels that most of the trouble which recently arose in the German community was due to the fact that the believers everywhere did not seem to know how to function administratively—almost everything they did was irregular and this caused added confusion, more wounded feelings, and confused the entire situation. He trusts that by now the whole situation has been straightened out and that the N.G.R. and the assemblies will work strongly and unitedly for the fulfilment of their Plan.</p>
  
    <p id='684'>He was very glad that dear doctor Grossmann could attend the Brussels Conference. All the believers there were so happy to have a German brother with them! Also, he has received reports of the <span data-pg='92' id='pg92'></span> excellent teaching work on the Covenant that your dear husband is doing. This is very important, especially at this time when Ahmad Sohrab is trying to again become active in Germany.</p>
  
    <p id='685'>The German friends must learn to put the teachings above personalities and stop taking sides. This is a sign of immaturity and this old and beloved community cannot afford to linger in childhood, but must become a strong adult community of united, alert and active believers….</p>

    <p id='688'>I am deeply grateful to you for your constant and splendid services to our beloved Faith. These services and achievements will, no doubt, attract the blessings of Bahá’u’lláh.

    <aside data-fnid='hd2106:1'>to Dr. Hermann Grossmann</aside>
  
    <p class='Sdate' id='690'>12 November (1949?)</p>
  
    <p id='691'>The Guardian is in receipt of your letter of October 26th, and feels very much pleased at the news of the completion of the German translation of “The Seven Valleys”. He wishes me to congratulate you most heartily for this great service you have been able to render the Cause, and which no doubt will serve to enrich the record of the manifold contributions you have, during the last few years, so brilliantly made towards the spread of the Faith throughout Germany. He is praying to Bahá’u’lláh that He may continue to guide and inspire you, and assist you in <span data-pg='93' id='pg93'></span> accomplishing still more outstanding works for the Cause in your country.</p>
  
    <p id='692'>Regarding the publication of the manuscript, he sees no objection that it should be undertaken by a non-Bahá’í publisher, inasmuch as it will then have a greater appeal to the general public. But, of course, in this as well as in all other local matters of this kind you should first seek the approval of the N.S.A. As to the expenses of printing the work, they should be preferably furnished by the national fund.</p>
  
    <p id='693'>The Guardian is also very much pleased to learn of the new publications which the N.S.A. is planning to issue very soon. The printing of the lectures delivered at the last Esslingen Summer School in a book form is, no doubt, highly useful. It is hoped that the funds required in this connection, as well as for other important publications, will be generously contributed by both the individual believers, and the local groups and assemblies.</p>
  
    <p id='694'>With reference to the publication of the “Kitáb-i-Íqán” into Esperanto, the Guardian also hopes that some action will be taken in this matter by the N.S.A. But obviously the printing of this, and other non-German works, should be subordinated to the publication of Bahá’í literature in German….</p>
  
    <p id='695'>[From the Guardian:]</p>
  
    <p id='696'>Dear and valued co-worker:</p>
  
    <p id='697'>I am so eager to learn that your health is fully restored, for I believe your services are a most valuable asset to the Faith you serve in these troublous days. I welcome your efficient and unrelaxing cooperation, in spite of the obstacles which face you, in so many fields of Bahá’í activity. I am confident that as a result of your strenuous endeavours the administrative institutions in your land will be further consolidated and extended and the cause of teaching receive an added impetus.</p>

    <p id='742'>Your suggestion regarding a book for the general public is a good one. The question is not only have we Bahá’ís competent to present this subject in a way which would catch the attention of the public, but also even if such a book existed would it achieve its end? We have, unfortunately, not very many capable Bahá’í writers, and the condition of confusion in the world is such that it seems doubtful if such a work would arrest the attention of distracted mankind.</p>

    <p id='749'>3rd. On <a href='gwb.html'>Page 312</a>, the words “I feign would hope” are merely a very elevated style of English for saying “I hope”. This tablet has nothing to do with Muḥammad-‘Alí.</p>

    <p id='809'>He trusts that from this Convention the friends have carried back to their homes a renewed spirit of dedication, in order to enable them to carry forward the teaching work, now in their own land, and later on, beyond its borders.</p>
  
    <p id='810'>In the Intercontinental Teaching Conference to be held in Stockholm in the summer of 1953, the German believers will have their part to play, and will have their goal allotted to them for the ten-year period beginning in 1953. Therefore, they must endeavor to realize the great importance of this Conference, and bend every effort towards its most complete success….</p>
  
    <p id='811'>[From the Guardian:]</p>
  
    <p id='812'>May the Almighty bless abundantly your noble endeavours, guide and sustain you always, remove every obstacle from your path, and enable you to win great and memorable victories in the service of His glorious Faith,</p>

    <p id='815'>He is happy to hear you are in Ṭihrán, and determined to help the friends directly with their teaching work, as this is the most important field of all. <span data-pg='106' id='pg106'></span></p>

    <p id='819'>He was happy to see you are so active, because very great things lie ahead of the Bahá’í Youth, in particular during the next ten years; when you see what the task of Germany must be, (the details of which he will be revealing at the time of the Stockholm Conference), you will understand how great is the need for your services during the next decade.</p>
  
    <p id='820'>The future has always belonged to youth, and now more than ever before, in order to ensure the fulfilment of Bahá’u’lláh’s plans for this planet, the youth must labour and pioneer.</p>
  
    <p id='821'>Now is the time, therefore, to consecrate yourselves and prepare yourselves for the work that lies ahead of you, and of all the young Bahá’ís the world-over. You must study both the teaching and the Administration, in order to be ready and qualified—qualified with both knowledge and shining personal characters…</p>

In most cases, this would be quite impossible financially, especially for people who, like yourself, have the responsibility of families to look after. No doubt, as the Cause grows in numbers, and has greater resources, <span data-pg='109' id='pg109'></span> it will be possible to assist the Hands to carry out definite teaching missions; but for the present, we must stretch our limited resources, and accomplish the most essential tasks first.

    <p id='840'>The tasks of the Auxiliary Boards will be under the direction of the Hands in their area, and in cooperation with the administrative bodies existing, to strengthen the teaching work.

    <p id='864'>I am writing you this little note on behalf of our beloved Guardian to reassure you, as he has heard from one of the friends that sometimes you feel you have failed in your services to our glorious Faith.</p>
  
    <p id='865'>He considers that you have no justification for ever having such dark thoughts. You have served the Cause of God unstintingly, and with complete loyalty and dedication year after year; and he feels confident that the Master has reserved a rich reward for you in the next world.</p>
  
    <p id='866'>Your loving devotion, and the harmony that you are able to produce amongst the friends, is very essential for the work in such an important Center as Frankfurt, which will soon, in addition to its being the administrative center of the Faith in Germany, possess the first Bahá’í Temple in Europe.</p>

    <p id='869'>The sudden passing of dear Dorothy Baker is indeed a great loss to the Faith, and leaves a sad gap in the ranks of the Hands of the Cause. She was exemplary in so many ways, and her services can ill be spared at this important period in Bahá’í history.</p>
  
    <p id='870'>No doubt there is a wisdom in such calamities; and through her death others may feel moved to become more consecrated to the service of the Faith. Surely such a soul’s influence will continue to be felt in this world.</p>
  
    <p id='871'>Your own constant and devoted labours for the promotion of the Cause of God, as well as those of your dear family, are very deeply appreciated by him, and you are often remembered in his prayers. He hopes that you are in good health; and urges you, while serving the Cause, not to neglect yourself.

    <p id='873'>As regards the question you asked in your letter about a concealed group of masters in the Himalayas or anywhere else, there is no foundation whatsoever for this in the Bahá’í Writings.

    <p class='Sdate' id='925'>26 March 1956</p>
  
    <p id='926'>Many of the problems which you see facing the German Community are akin to other Bahá’í Communities. There is a desperate need for deepening the Bahá’ís themselves in their own faith. They do not study the Teachings enough. They do not therefore either act as whole-heartedly as Bahá’ís as they should, or derive the spiritual strength from the Faith which studying, praying and meditating brings.</p>
  
    <p id='927'>The answer of course to many of these problems is that we need more Bahá’ís to share in the work, more money to finance traveling <span data-pg='119' id='pg119'></span> teachers, more understanding between the youth and older people, and a wiser distribution of the work of the Faith amongst those able to carry it on, whether young or old.</p>
  
    <p id='928'>As regards the question you have asked about your own obligations, he feels you should not resign from the National Assembly, as your presence on that Body is of great help in the work. On the other hand, he approves of your requesting that they do not give you so much work as a member of the National Assembly, and as a member of national committees, thus freeing you more for the teaching work as a “Hand”, and also enabling you to take better care of your health, which is a precious asset to the Faith. </p>

    <p id='954'>As regards Dr. Schück’s book, which the Guardian is very pleased to hear he has written, as we need always more literature to attract new people to the Faith through different approaches: Any Bahá’í book presenting the Faith should be reviewed by a competent body. This only means that they should ascertain whether there is any misrepresentation of the Teachings in it. Sometimes the friends think they have to go into literary reviews and interfere with the author’s style etc., which of course is wholly unnecessary. It should therefore not take long for your National Body or the Italo-Swiss National Assembly to pass upon the book. </p>

    <p id='1030'>You will be able, he hopes, on your return to Germany, to assist in the formation of a new Spiritual Assembly there, through taking up your residence where there is a Group. In this way you will be strengthening the Home Front, which is also a very important phase of our Bahá’í activities. If you must go back to Stuttgart, he hopes you can still live in its neighbourhood and be instrumental in forming another Assembly, rather than to be just one more Bahá’í in an already crowded Community. As you perhaps already know, he has urged the large communities to send out pioneers. Indeed, if only fifteen Bahá’ís remained in each city, willing to serve, it would be quite sufficient to maintain the Spiritual Assembly. The sooner the rest would arise to pioneer, the better it would be for them and for the Faith. </p>
