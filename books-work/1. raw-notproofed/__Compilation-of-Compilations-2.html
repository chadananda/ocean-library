<p>	Living the Life</p>
<p>	1266. How often the beloved Master was heard to say. Should each one
 of the friends take upon himself to carry out, in all its integrity and
 implications, only one of the teachings of the Faith, with devotion, 
detachment, constancy and perseverance and exemplify it in all his deeds
 and pursuits of life, the world would become another world and the face
 of the earth would mirror forth the splendours of the Abha Paradise. 
Consider what marvellous changes would be effected if the beloved of the
 Merciful conducted themselves, both in their individual and collective 
capacities, in accordance with the counsels and exhortations which have 
streamed from the Pen of Glory.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 January 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of Persia - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1267. The wish of 'Abdu'l-Baha, that which attracts His good 
pleasure and, indeed, His binding command, is that Baha'is, in all 
matters, even in small daily transactions and dealings with others, 
should act in accordance with the divine Teachings. He has commanded us 
not to be content with lowliness, humility and meekness, but rather to 
become manifestations of selflessness and utter nothingness. Of old, all
 have been exhorted to loyalty and fidelity, compassion and love; in 
this supreme Dispensation, the people of Baha are called upon to 
sacrifice their very lives. Notice the extent to which the friends have 
been required in the Sacred Epistles and Tablets, as well as in our 
Beloved's Testament, to be righteous, well-wishing, forbearing, 
sanctified, pure, detached from all else save God, severed from the 
trappings of this world and adorned with the mantle of a goodly 
character and godly attributes.</p>
<p>	First and foremost, one should use every possible means to purge 
one's heart and motives, otherwise, engaging in any form of enterprise 
would be futile. It is also essential to abstain from hypocrisy and 
blind imitation, inasmuch as their foul odour is soon detected by every 
man of understanding and wisdom. Moreover, the friends must observe the 
specific times for the remembrance of God, meditation, devotion and 
prayer, as it is highly unlikely, nay impossible, for any enterprise to 
prosper and develop when deprived of divine bestowals and<br>
 confirmation. One can hardly imagine what a great influence genuine 
love, truthfulness and purity of motives exert on the souls of men. But 
these traits cannot be acquired by any believer unless he makes a daily 
effort to gain them...</p>
<p>	It is primarily through the potency of noble deeds and character, 
rather than by the power of exposition and proofs, that the friends of 
God should demonstrate to the world that what has been promised by God 
is bound to happen, that it is already taking place and that the divine 
glad-tidings are clear, evident and complete. For unless some 
illustrious souls step forth into the arena of service and shine out 
resplendent in the assemblage of men, the task of vindicating the truth 
of this Cause before the eyes of enlightened people would be formidable 
indeed. However, if the friends become embodiments of virtue and good 
character, words and arguments will be superfluous. Their very deeds 
will well serve as eloquent testimony, and their noble conduct will 
ensure the preservation, integrity and glory of the Cause of God.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 December 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of the East - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1268. The chosen ones of God . . . should not look at the depraved 
condition of the society in which they live, nor at the evidences of 
moral degradation and frivolous conduct which the people around them 
display. They should not content themselves merely with relative 
distinction and excellence. Rather they should fix their gaze upon 
nobler heights by setting the counsels and exhortations of the Pen of 
Glory as their supreme goal. Then it will be readily realized how 
numerous are the stages that still remain to be traversed and how far 
off the desired goal lies -- a goal which is none other than 
exemplifying heavenly morals and virtues.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 October 1924 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Teheran)</p>
<p>	1269. It is our duty and privilege to translate the love and 
devotion we have for our beloved Cause into deeds and actions that will 
be conducive to the highest good of mankind. (From a letter dated 20 
November 1924 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual 
believer)<br>

</p><p>	1270. If you read the utterances of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha
 with selflessness and care and concentrate upon them, you will discover
 truths unknown to you before and will obtain an insight into the 
problems that have baffled the great thinkers of the world.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 January 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1271. The great thing is to "live the life" -- to have our lives so 
saturated with the Divine teachings and the Baha'i Spirit that people 
cannot fail to see a joy, a power, a love, a purity, a radiance, an 
efficiency in our character and work that will distinguish us from 
worldly-minded people and make people wonder what is the secret of this 
new life in us. We must become entirely selfless and devoted to God so 
that every day and every moment we seek to do only what God would have 
us do and in the way He would have us do it. If we do this sincerely 
then we shall have perfect unity and harmony with each other. Where 
there is want of harmony, there is lack of the true Baha'i Spirit. 
Unless we can show this transformation in our lives, this new power, 
this mutual love and harmony, then the Baha'i teachings are but a name 
to us.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 February 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1272. If we Baha'is cannot attain to cordial unity among ourselves, 
then we fail to realize the main purpose for which the Bab, Baha'u'llah 
and the Beloved Master lived and suffered.</p>
<p>	In order to achieve this cordial unity one of the first essentials 
insisted on by Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha is that we resist the 
natural tendency to let our attention dwell on the faults and failings 
of others rather than on our own. Each of us is responsible for one life
 only, and that is our own. Each of us is immeasurably far from being 
"perfect as our heavenly father is perfect" and the task of perfecting 
our own life and character is one that requires all our attention, our 
will-power and energy. If we allow our attention and energy to be taken 
up in efforts to keep others right and remedy their faults, we are 
wasting precious time. We are like ploughmen each of whom has his team 
to manage and his plough to direct, and in order to keep his furrow 
straight he must keep his eye on his goal and concentrate on his own 
task. If he looks to this side and that<br>
 to see how Tom and Harry are getting on and to criticize their ploughing, then his own furrow will assuredly become crooked.</p>
<p>	On no subject are the Baha'i teachings more emphatic than on the 
necessity to abstain from faultfinding and backbiting while being ever 
eager to discover and root out our own faults and overcome our own 
failings.</p>
<p>	If we profess loyalty to Baha'u'llah, to our Beloved Master and our 
dear Guardian, then we must show our love by obedience to these explicit
 teachings. Deeds not words are what they demand, and no amount of 
fervour in the use of expressions of loyalty and adulation will 
compensate for failure to live in the spirit of the teachings.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 May 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1273. As to the question whether it is right to tell an untruth in 
order to save another, he feels that under no condition should we tell 
an untruth but at the same time try and help the person in a more 
legitimate manner. Of course it is not necessary to be too outspoken 
until the question is directly put to us.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 December 1927 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1274. We should not, however, forget that an essential 
characteristic of this world is hardship and tribulation and that it is 
by overcoming them that we achieve our moral and spiritual development. 
As the Master says, sorrow is like furrows, the deeper they go the more 
plentiful are the fruits we obtain.</p>
<p>(From a letter dated 5 November 1931 written on behalf of Shoghi<br>
Effendi to an individual believer) </p>
<p>	1275. In the "Bayan" the Bab says that every religion of the past 
was fit to become universal. The only reason why they failed to attain 
that mark was the incompetence of their followers. He then proceeds to 
give a definite promise that this would not be the fate of the 
revelation of "Him Whom God would make manifest", that it will become 
universal and include all the people of the world. This shows that we 
will ultimately succeed. But could we not, through our shortcomings, 
failures to sacrifice and<br>
 reluctance to concentrate our efforts in spreading the Cause, retard 
the realization of that ideal? And what would that mean? It shall mean 
that we will be held responsible before God, that the race will remain 
longer in its state of waywardness, that wars would not be so soon 
averted, that human suffering will last longer.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 February 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1276. Every day has certain needs. In those early days the Cause 
needed Martyrs, and people who would stand all sorts of torture and 
persecution in expressing their faith and spreading the message sent by 
God. Those days are, however, gone. The Cause at present does not need 
martyrs who would die for the faith, but servants who desire to teach 
and establish the Cause throughout the world. To live to teach in the 
present day is like being martyred in those early days. It is the spirit
 that moves us that counts, not the act through which that spirit 
expresses itself; and that spirit is to serve the Cause of God with our 
heart and soul.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 3 August 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to an individual believer, quoted in "Baha'i News", 68, (Nov 
1932), p. 3)</p>
<p>	1277. He sincerely hopes that, through these sacrifices, that 
edifice will be completed and become a focal centre for the spirit and 
teachings of the Cause in that land; that from it the light of guidance 
will spread and bring joy and hope to the heart of this depressed 
humanity.</p>
<p>	If you study the history of Nabil you will see how the Faith has 
been fed by the constant sacrifices of the friends. Under hardships, 
persecutions and constant worries has the Message of Baha'u'llah been 
established throughout the world.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 November 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1278. The advice that Shoghi Effendi gave you regarding the division
 of your time between serving the Cause and attending to your other 
duties was also given to many other friends both by Baha'u'llah and the 
Master. It is a compromise between the two verses of the "Aqdas", one 
making it incumbent upon every Baha'i to serve the promotion of the 
Faith and the other that every soul should be occupied in some form of 
occupation that<br>
 will benefit society. In one of His Tablets Baha'u'llah says that the 
highest form of detachment in this day is to be occupied with some 
profession and be self-supporting. A good Baha'i, therefore, is the one 
who so arranges his life as to devote time both to his material needs 
and also to the service of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 February 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1279. I need not tell you how grievously he deplores the fact that 
there are so many negative forces prevailing in Baha'i gatherings and 
particularly in such an important meeting as the Convention. The 
oft-repeated words of the Master concerning unity and harmonious 
co-operation among the friends should be carefully and thoughtfully 
remembered now more than ever. Nothing is more contrary to the spirit of
 the Cause than discord and strife, which are the inevitable outcome of 
selfishness and greed. Pure detachment and selfless service, these 
should be the sole motives of every true believer. And unless each and 
every one of the friends succeeds in translating such qualities into 
living action, no hope of further progress can be entertained. It is now
 that unity of thought and action is most needed. It is now, when the 
Cause is entering a new phase of development, when its Administration is
 being gradually consolidated amid the welter and chaos of a tottering 
civilization, that the friends should present a united front to those 
forces of internal dissension, which, if not completely wiped out, will 
bring our work to inevitable destruction.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 24 September 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1280. He, indeed, highly deplores the fact that the representatives 
of the highest administrative institution in your country have permitted
 such differences and misunderstandings to assume such a proportion, 
especially when the principles and laws of the Administration have been 
each and all clearly and emphatically stated by him in so many 
communications and ever since the passing of the Master. Such 
difficulties, if not checked immediately and vigorously, can do 
incalculable harm to the body of the Cause, and may retard not only the 
flow but also the effectiveness of its spirit in the world. If deeply 
and dispassionately examined the source of all these troubles and 
disputes is<br>
 to be found invariably in feelings of egotism and selfishness. And 
unless these poisonous feelings are fully overcome there can be no hope 
for the effective working and progress of the administrative machinery 
of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 9 May 1934 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1281. While he would urge you to courageously meet and overcome the 
many obstacles that stand in your way, he would at the same time advise 
you that in case of failure and no matter what befalls you, you should 
remain radiantly content at, and entirely submissive to, the Divine 
will. Our afflictions, tests and trials are sometimes blessings in 
disguise, as they teach us to have more faith and confidence in God, and
 bring us nearer to Him.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 April 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1282. Has not Baha'u'llah assured us that sufferings and privations 
are blessings in disguise, that through them our inner spiritual forces 
become stimulated, purified and ennobled? Remain, therefore, confident 
that your material hardships will, far from hindering your activities 
for the Cause, impart to your heart a powerful impetus to better serve 
and promote its interests.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 November 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1283. Personal effort is indeed a vital prerequisite to the 
recognition and acceptance of the Cause of God. No matter how strong the
 measure of Divine grace, unless supplemented by personal, sustained and
 intelligent effort it cannot become fully effective and be of any real 
and abiding advantage.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 27 February 1938 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1284. Such hindrances, no matter how severe and insuperable they may
 at first seem, can and should be effectively overcome through the 
combined and sustained power of prayer and of determined and continued 
effort.<br>
 For have not Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha both repeatedly assured us 
that the Divine and unseen hosts of victory will ever reinforce and 
strengthen those who valiantly and confidently labour in their name? 
This assurance should indeed enable you to overcome any feeling of 
unworthiness, of incapacity to serve, and any inner or outer limitation 
which threatens to handicap your labours for the Cause. You should 
therefore arise, and with a heart filled with joy and confidence 
endeavour to contribute any share that is in your power toward the wider
 diffusion and greater consolidation of our beloved Faith.</p>
<p>	Whatever the particular field of service you may choose, whether 
teaching or administrative, the essential is for you to persevere, and 
not to allow any consciousness of your limitations to dampen your zeal, 
much less to deter you from serving joyously and actively.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 February 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1285. The greater your trials and sufferings, the stronger should 
wax your attachment and devotion to the Cause. For only through repeated
 tribulations and trials does God test His servants, and these they 
should therefore view as blessings in disguise, and as opportunities 
whereby they can acquire a fuller consciousness of the Divine Will and 
Purpose.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 February 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)</p>
<p>	1286. The course on character building to be given by Miss Flora 
Hottes, the Guardian feels, is particularly important and should be 
given due emphasis and studied carefully and thoroughly, especially by 
the young believers in attendance at the school. These standards of 
Baha'i conduct, which he himself has set forth in his last general 
epistle, "The Advent of Divine Justice", and which it should be the 
paramount duty of every loyal and conscientious believer to endeavour to
 uphold and promote, deserve serious study and meditation, and should 
constitute the main central theme of this year's programme at all the 
three Baha'i Summer Schools in the States.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 May 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1287. Regarding ...'s appeal: the Guardian feels the best course
 of action in this matter is to ask both of the believers concerned to 
forgive and forget the entire matter. He does not want the friends to 
form the habit of taking up a kind of Baha'i litigation against each 
other. Their duties to humanity are too sacred and urgent in these days,
 when the Cause is struggling to spread and assert its independence, for
 them to spend their precious time, and his precious time, in this way. 
Ask them, therefore, to unite, forget the past, and serve as never 
before.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 July 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand)</p>
<p>	1288. Indeed the believers have not yet fully learned to draw on 
each other's love for strength and consolation in time of need. The 
Cause of God is endowed with tremendous powers, and the reason the 
believers do not gain more from it is because they have not learned to 
fully draw on these mighty forces of love and strength and harmony 
generated by the Faith. He would advise you to leave your friend ... to 
herself for the time being, and pray for her. As she does not at the 
moment wish your help you can only help her inwardly.</p>
<p>	You have rendered the Cause many valuable services, and are still doing so, and this should be your greatest consolation...</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 May 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1289. The friends must be patient with each other and must realize 
that the Cause is still in its infancy and its institutions are not yet 
functioning perfectly. The greater the patience, the loving 
understanding and the forbearance the believers show towards each other 
and their shortcomings, the greater will be the progress of the whole 
Baha'i community at large.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 27 February 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1290. We must realize our imperfection and not permit ourselves to 
get too upset over the unfortunate things which occur, sometimes in<br>
 Conventions, sometimes in Assemblies or on Committees, etc. Such things
 are essentially superficial and in time will be outgrown.</p>
<p>(From a letter dated 17 March 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi<br>
Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1291. Not all of us are capable of serving in the same way, but the 
one way every Baha'i can spread the Faith is by example. This moves the 
hearts of people far more deeply than words ever can.</p>
<p>	The love we show others, the hospitality and understanding, the 
willingness to help them, these are the very best advertisements of the 
Faith. They will want to hear about it when they see these things in our
 lives.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 October 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1292. You have complained of the unsatisfactory conditions 
prevailing in the ... Baha'i Community; the Guardian is well aware of 
the situation of the Cause there, but is confident that whatever the 
nature of the obstacles that confront the Faith they will be eventually 
overcome. You should, under no circumstances, feel discouraged, and 
allow such difficulties, even though they may have resulted from the 
misconduct, or the lack of capacity and vision of certain members of the
 Community, to make you waver in your faith and basic loyalty to the 
Cause. Surely, the believers, no matter how qualified they may be, 
whether as teachers or administrators, and however high their 
intellectual and spiritual merits, should never be looked upon as a 
standard whereby to evaluate and measure the divine authority and 
mission of the Faith. It is to the Teachings themselves, and to the 
lives of the Founders of the Cause that the believers should look for 
their guidance and inspiration, and only by keeping strictly to such [a]
 true attitude can they hope to establish their loyalty to Baha'u'llah 
upon an enduring and unassailable basis. You should take heart, 
therefore, and with unrelaxing vigilance and unremitting effort 
endeavour to play your full share in the gradual unfoldment of this 
Divine World Order.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 August 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1293. These, indeed, are the days when heroism is needed on the 
part of the believers. Self-sacrifice, courage, indomitable hope and 
confidence are the characteristics they should show forth, because these
 very attributes cannot but fix the attention of the public and lead 
them to enquire what, in a world so hopelessly chaotic and bewildered, 
leads these people to be so assured, so confident, so full of devotion? 
Increasingly, as time goes by, the characteristics of the Baha'is will 
be that which captures the attention of their fellow-citizens. They must
 show their aloofness from the hatreds and recriminations which are 
tearing at the heart of humanity, and demonstrate by deed and word their
 profound belief in the future peaceful unification of the entire human 
race.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 October 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1294. We must always look ahead and seek to accomplish in the future
 what we may have failed to do in the past. Failures, tests, and trials,
 if we use them correctly, can become the means of purifying our 
spirits, strengthening our characters, and enable us to rise to greater 
heights of service.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 December 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1295. Regarding the points you refer to in your letter: the complete
 and entire elimination of the ego would imply perfection -- which man 
can never completely attain -- but the ego can and should be 
ever-increasingly subordinated to the enlightened soul of man. This is 
what spiritual progress implies.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 December 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1296. He was very pleased to hear that the Convention was so well 
attended, and the believers enthusiastic and united. One of the most 
paramount needs of the Cause in ... is that the friends should unite, 
should become really keenly conscious of the fact that they are one 
spiritual family, held together by bonds more sacred and eternal than 
those physical ties which make people of the same family. If the friends
 will forget all personal differences and open their hearts to a great 
love for each other for the<br>
 sake of Baha'u'llah, they will find that their powers are vastly 
increased; they will attract the heart of the public, and will witness a
 rapid growth of the Holy Faith in... The National Spiritual Assembly 
should do all in its power to foster unity among the believers, and to 
educate them in the Administration as this is the channel through which 
their community life must flow, and which, when properly understood and 
practised, will enable the work of the Cause to go ahead by leaps and 
bounds.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 October 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1297. Ultimately all the battle of life is within the individual. No
 amount of organization can solve the inner problems or produce or 
prevent, as the case may be, victory or failure at a crucial moment. In 
such times as these particularly, individuals are torn by great forces 
at large in the world, and we see some weak ones suddenly become 
miraculously strong, and strong ones fail -- we can only try, through 
loving advice, as your Committee has done, to bring about the act on the
 part of the believer which will be for the highest good of the Cause. 
Because obviously something bad for the Cause cannot be the highest good
 of the individual Baha'i.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 December 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1298. The thing the world needs today is the Baha'i spirit. People 
are craving for love, for a high standard to look up to, as well as for 
solutions to their many grave problems. The Baha'is should shower on 
those whom they meet the warm and living spirit of the Cause, and this, 
combined with teaching, cannot but attract the sincere truth-seekers to 
the Faith.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 December 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1299. Regarding your question about the need for greater unity among
 the friends, there is no doubt that this is so, and the Guardian feels 
that one of the chief instruments for promoting it is to teach the 
Baha'is themselves, in classes and through precepts, that love of God, 
and consequently of men, is the essential foundation of every religion, 
our own included. A greater degree of love will produce a greater unity,<br>
 because it enables people to bear with each other, to be patient and forgiving.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 7 July 1944 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
 to an individual believer, quoted in "Baha'i News", 173, (Feb 1945), p.
 3)</p>
<p>	1300. He hopes that you will develop into Baha'is in character as 
well as in belief. The whole purpose of Baha'u'llah is that we should 
become a new kind of people, people who are upright, kind, intelligent, 
truthful, and honest and who live according to His great laws laid down 
for this new epoch in man's development. To call ourselves Baha'is is 
not enough, our inmost being must become ennobled and enlightened 
through living a Baha'i life.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 August 1944 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Louhelen School Youth Session)</p>
<p>	1301. So many misunderstandings arise from the passionate attachment
 of the friends to the Faith and also their immaturity. We must 
therefore be very patient and loving with each other and try to 
establish unity in the Baha'i family. The differences ... which you 
describe in your letter he feels are caused by the above and not by 
enmity to the Faith or insincerity.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 October 1944 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1302. He was very happy to hear from you, and to learn that Green 
Acre this year was pervaded with a love and harmony that was 
instrumental in confirming many new souls in the Faith. This love 
amongst the believers is the magnet which will, above all else, attract 
the hearts and bring new souls into the Cause. Because obviously the 
teachings - however wonderful - cannot change the world unless the 
Spirit of Baha'u'llah's love is mirrored in the Baha'i Communities.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 27 October 1944 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1303. Indeed if the friends could seek, and exert themselves, to 
become 100 per cent Baha'is they would see how greatly their influence 
over others would be increased, and how rapidly the Cause would spread. 
The world is seeking not a compromise but the embodiment of a high and<br>
 shining ideal. The more the friends live up to our teachings in every 
aspect of their lives, in their homes, in business, in their social 
relationships, the greater will be the attraction they exercise over the
 hearts of others.</p>
<p>	He is pleased to see you have naturally, with conviction and good 
will towards all, been mingling with and teaching the coloured people. 
When the Baha'is live up to their teachings as they should, although it 
may arouse the opposition of some it will arouse still more the 
admiration of fair-minded people.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 January 1945 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1304. Indeed when we see the increasing darkness in the world today 
we can fully realize that unless the Message of Baha'u'llah reaches into
 the hearts of men and transforms them, there can be no peace and no 
spiritual progress in the future.</p>
<p>	His constant hope is that the believers will conduct themselves, 
individually and in their Baha'i Community life, in such a manner as to 
attract the attention of others to the Cause. The world is not only 
starving for lofty principles and ideals, it is, above all, starving for
 a shining example which the Baha'is can and must provide.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 February 1945 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1305. The need is very great, everywhere in the world, in and 
outside the Faith, for a true spiritual awareness to pervade and 
motivate people's lives. No amount of administrative procedure or 
adherence to rules can take the place of this soul-characteristic, this 
spirituality which is the essence of Man. He is very glad to see you are
 stressing this and aiding the friends to realize its supreme 
importance.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 April 1945 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1306. Regarding the matter of ... and the inharmony that seems to 
exist among certain of the friends ... when Baha'is permit the dark 
forces of the world to enter into their own relationships within the 
Faith they gravely jeopardize its progress; it is the paramount duty of 
the believers, the Local Assemblies, and particularly the National 
Spiritual Assembly to<br>
 foster harmony, understanding and love amongst the friends. All should 
be ready and willing to set aside every personal sense of grievance -- 
justified or unjustified -- for the good of the Cause, because the 
people will never embrace it until they see in its community life 
mirrored what is so conspicuously lacking in the world: love and unity.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 13 May 1945 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand)</p>
<p>	1307. Most important of all is that love and unity should prevail in
 the Baha'i Community, as this is what people are most longing for in 
the present dark state of the world. Words without the living example 
will never be sufficient to breathe hope into the hearts of a 
disillusioned and often cynical generation.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 October 1945 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1308. Since you have turned to him for guidance, he will very frankly give you his opinion.</p>
<p>	He feels that the present inharmony prevailing amongst you ... is 
very detrimental to the advancement of the Cause, and can only lead to 
disruption and the chilling of the interest of new believers. You ... 
should forget about your personal grievances, and unite for the 
protection of the Faith which he well knows you are all loyally devoted 
to and ready to sacrifice for. Perhaps the greatest test Baha'is are 
ever subjected to is from each other; but for the sake of the Master 
they should be ever ready to overlook each other's mistakes, apologize 
for harsh words they have uttered, forgive and forget. He strongly 
recommends to you this course of action. Also he feels that you and ... 
should not remain away from the meetings and Feasts in ...; you have now
 got an enthusiastic group of young Baha'is in ..., and you should show 
them a strong example of Baha'i discipline and the unity which can and 
must prevail amongst the Community of the Most Great Name.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 December 1945 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1309. You ask about "spiritual indigestion": Baha'is should seek
 to be many-sided, normal and well balanced, mentally and spiritually. 
We must not give the impression of being fanatics, but at the same time 
we must live up to our principles.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 March 1946 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1310. You may be sure he will pray for the unity of the ... 
believers, as this is of paramount importance, and upon it depends the 
development of the Cause there, and the success of every teaching 
effort. The thing the friends need -- everywhere -- is a greater love 
for each other, and this can be acquired by greater love for 
Baha'u'llah; for if we love Him deeply enough, we will never allow 
personal feelings and opinions to hold His Cause back; we will be 
willing to sacrifice ourselves to each other for the sake of the Faith, 
and be, as the Master said, one soul in many bodies.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 September 1946 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1311. He heartily agrees with you that unless we practise the 
Teachings we cannot possibly expect the Faith to grow, because the 
fundamental purpose of all religions -- including our own -- is to bring
 man nearer to God, and to change his character, which is of the utmost 
importance. Too much emphasis is often laid on the social and economic 
aspects of the Teachings; but the moral aspect cannot be 
over-emphasized.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 September 1946 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1312. The fact that you had a course on 'Baha'i character' pleased 
him very much, as he considers one of the greatest obligations of your 
generation of believers is to live a Baha'i life; you must demonstrate, 
by your high moral standards, your courtesy, your integrity and 
nobility, that our Faith, is not one of words but truly changes the 
heart and conduct of its adherents.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 September 1946 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Louhelen School Junior Youth Session, U.S.A.)<br>

</p><p>	1313. He feels that the youth, in particular, must constantly 
and determinedly strive to exemplify a Baha'i life. In the world around 
us we see moral decay, promiscuity, indecency, vulgarity, bad manners --
 the Baha'i young people must be the opposite of these things, and, by 
their chastity, their uprightness, their decency, their consideration 
and good manners, attract others, old and young, to the Faith. The world
 is tired of words; it wants example, and it is up to the Baha'i youth 
to furnish it.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 September 1946 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Green Acre Summer School)</p>
<p>	1314. The friends must, at all times, bear in mind that they are, in
 a way, like soldiers under attack. The world is at present in an 
exceedingly dark condition spiritually; hatred and prejudice, of every 
sort, are literally tearing it to pieces. We, on the other hand, are the
 custodians of the opposite forces, the forces of love, of unity, of 
peace and integration, and we must constantly be on our guard, whether 
as individuals or as an Assembly or Community, lest through us these 
destructive, negative forces enter into our midst. In other words we 
must beware lest the darkness of society become reflected in our acts 
and attitudes, perhaps all unconsciously. Love for each other, the deep 
sense that we are a new organism, the dawn-breakers of a New World 
Order, must constantly animate our Baha'i lives, and we must pray to be 
protected from the contamination of society which is so diseased with 
prejudice.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 February 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Atlanta, Georgia)</p>
<p>	1315. The Cause in ... is growing very rapidly, and the more it 
spreads the more the attention of the public will be fixed upon it. This
 imposes a heavy responsibility on the believers, as they must show 
forth such a spirit of love and unity among themselves as will attract 
the hearts of others and encourage them to enter the Faith in large 
numbers. We must always remember that the Teachings are perfect, and 
that the only reason more of our fellow men have not as yet embraced 
them is because we Baha'is, the world over, are ourselves not yet as 
selfless and radiant mirrors of Baha'u'llah's Truth as we should and 
could be! We must constantly strive to better exemplify His Teachings.<br>

</p><p>	(From a letter dated 18 February 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1316. We must concentrate on perfecting our characters as individual
 Baha'is, and on maturing our still embryonic, and as yet improperly 
understood, World Order; on spreading the Message, according to the 
provisions of the Divine Plan; and on building a tightly knit world-wide
 Baha'i Community. We are relatively few in numbers, and have such a 
precious, unique and responsible task to carry out. We must concentrate 
our full forces upon it.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 9 May 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi 
to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	1317. It is upon the individual believer, constituting the 
fundamental unit in the structure of the home front, that the 
revitalization, the expansion, and the enrichment of the home front must
 ultimately depend. The more strenuous the effort exerted, daily and 
methodically, by the individual labouring on the home front to rise to 
loftier heights of consecration, and of self-abnegation, to contribute, 
through pioneering at home, to the multiplication of Baha'i isolated 
centres, groups and Assemblies, and to raise, through diligent, 
painstaking and continual endeavour to convert receptive souls to the 
Faith he has espoused, the number of its active and whole-hearted 
supporters; the sooner will the vast and multiple enterprises, launched 
beyond the confines of the homeland, now so desperately calling for a 
greater supply of men and means, be provided with the necessary support 
that will ensure their uninterrupted development and hasten their 
ultimate fruition ...</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 September 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	1318. Regarding the questions you asked: self has really two 
meanings, or is used in two senses, in the Baha'i writings; one is self,
 the identity of the individual created by God. This is the self 
mentioned in such passages as "he hath known God who hath known 
himself", etc. The other self is the ego, the dark, animalistic heritage
 each one of us has, the lower nature that can develop into a monster of
 selfishness, brutality, lust and so on. It<br>
 is this self we must struggle against, or this side of our natures, in 
order to strengthen and free the spirit within us and help it to attain 
perfection.</p>
<p>	Self-sacrifice means to subordinate this lower nature and its 
desires to the more godly and noble side of our selves. Ultimately, in 
its highest sense, self-sacrifice means to give our will and our all to 
God to do with as He pleases. Then He purifies and glorifies our true 
self until it becomes a shining and wonderful reality.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 10 December 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1319. It is the quality of devotion and self-sacrifice that brings 
rewards in the service of this Faith rather than means, ability or 
financial backing.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 May 1948 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand)</p>
<p>	1320. We must never dwell too much on the attitudes and feelings of 
our fellow-believers towards us. What is most important is to foster 
love and harmony and ignore any rebuffs we may receive; in this way the 
weaknesses of human nature and the peculiarity or attitude of any 
particular person is not magnified, but pales into insignificance in 
comparison with our joint service to the Faith we all love.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 September 1948 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1321. It is often difficult for us to do things because they are so 
very different from what we are used to, not because the thing itself is
 particularly difficult. With you, and indeed most Baha'is, who are now,
 as adults, accepting this glorious Faith, no doubt some of the 
ordinances, like fasting and daily prayer, are hard to understand and 
obey at first. But we must always think that these things are given to 
all men for a thousand years to come. For Baha'i children who see these 
things practised in the home, they will be as natural and necessary a 
thing as going to church on Sunday was to the more pious generation of 
Christians. Baha'u'llah would not have given us these things if they 
would not greatly benefit us, and, like children who are sensible enough
 to realize their father is wise and does what is good for them, we must
 accept to obey these ordinances even<br>
 though at first we may not see any need for them. As we obey them we 
will gradually come to see in ourselves the benefits they confer.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 16 March 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1322. ...as we suffer these misfortunes we must remember that the 
Prophets of God Themselves were not immune from these things which men 
suffer. They knew sorrow, illness and pain too. They rose above these 
things through Their spirits, and that is what we must try and do too, 
when afflicted. The troubles of this world pass, and what we have left 
is what we have made of our souls; so it is to this we must look -- to 
becoming more spiritual, drawing nearer to God, no matter what our human
 minds and bodies go through.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 August 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1323. He was grieved to hear of some of the things you describe. It 
shows great spiritual immaturity on the part of some of the Baha'is and 
an astonishing lack of understanding and study of the teachings. To live
 up to our Faith's moral teachings is a task far harder than to live up 
to those noble principles the Moral Re-Armament inculcates, fine and 
encompassing as they are! Every other word of Baha'u'llah's and 
'Abdu'l-Baha's writings is a preachment on moral and ethical conduct; 
all else is the form, the chalice, into which the pure spirit must be 
poured; without the spirit and the action which must demonstrate it, it 
is a lifeless form.</p>
<p>	He judges, from what you say, that the friends have not or at least 
many of them have not, been properly taught in the beginning. There is 
certainly no objection to stressing the "four standards" of the Moral 
Re-Armament -- though any teaching of our precious Faith would go much 
more deeply into these subjects and add more to them. When we realize 
that Baha'u'llah says adultery retards the progress of the soul in the 
afterlife -- so grievous is it -- and that drinking destroys the mind, 
and not to so much as approach it, we see how clear are our teachings on
 these subjects. You must not make the great mistake of judging our 
Faith by one community which obviously needs to study and obey the 
Baha'i teachings.<br>
 Human frailties and peculiarities can be a great test. But the only 
way, or perhaps I should say the first and best way, to remedy such 
situations, is to oneself do what is right. One soul can be the cause of
 the spiritual illumination of a continent. Now that you have seen, and 
remedied, a great fault in your own life, now that you see more clearly 
what is lacking in your own community, there is nothing to prevent you 
from arising and showing such an example, such a love and spirit of 
service, as to enkindle the hearts of your fellow Baha'is.</p>
<p>	He urges you to study deeply the teachings, teach others, study with
 those Baha'is who are anxious to do so, the deeper teachings of our 
Faith, and through example, effort and prayer, bring about a change.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 September 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1324. Without the spirit of real love for Baha'u'llah, for His Faith
 and its Institutions, and the believers for each other, the Cause can 
never really bring in large numbers of people. For it is not preaching 
and rules the world wants, but love and action.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 October 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1325. However, he feels very strongly that if ... is in the state 
your letter would seem to indicate it is certainly conducting its 
affairs in the wrong way. This does not mean the Assembly, it means 
everyone. For where is Baha'i love? Where is putting unity and harmony 
first? Where is the willingness to sacrifice one's personal feelings and
 opinions to achieve love and harmony? What makes the Baha'is think that
 when they sacrifice the spiritual laws the administrative laws are 
going to work? . . .</p>
<p>	He urges you to exert your utmost to get the ... Baha'is to put 
aside such obnoxious terms as "radical", "conservative", "progressive", 
"enemies of the Cause", "squelching the teachings", etc. If they paused 
for one moment to think for what purpose the Bab and the Martyrs gave 
their lives, and Baha'u'llah and the Master accepted so much suffering, 
they would never let such definitions and accusations cross their lips 
when speaking of each other. As long as the friends quarrel amongst 
themselves their efforts will not be blessed for they are disobeying 
God.<br>

</p><p>	(From a letter dated 24 February 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1326. There are two kinds of Baha'is, one might say: those whose 
religion is Baha'i and those who live for the Faith. Needless to say, if
 one can belong to the latter category, if one can be in the vanguard of
 heroes, martyrs and saints, it is more praiseworthy in the sight of 
God....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 16 April 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1327. ... We must reach a spiritual plane where God comes first and 
great human passions are unable to turn us away from Him. All the time 
we see people who either through the force of hate or the passionate 
attachment they have to another person, sacrifice principle or bar 
themselves from the Path of God.</p>
<p>	We must love God, and in this state, a general love for all men 
becomes possible. We cannot love each human being for himself, but our 
feeling towards humanity should be motivated by our love for the Father 
Who created all men.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 4 October 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1328. He urges you to do all you can to promote unity and love 
amongst the members of the Community there, as this seems to be their 
greatest need.</p>
<p>	So often young communities, in their desire to administer the Cause,
 lose sight of the fact that these spiritual relationships are far more 
important and fundamental than the rules and regulations which must 
govern the conduct of community affairs.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 4 October 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1329. The greatest need it seems everywhere inside the Cause is to 
impress upon the friends the need for love among them. There is a 
tendency to mix up the functions of the Administration and try to apply 
it in individual<br>
 relationships, which is abortive, because the Assembly is a nascent 
House of Justice and is supposed to administer, according to the 
Teachings, the affairs of the community. But individuals toward each 
other are governed by love, unity, forgiveness and a sin-covering eye. 
Once the friends grasp this they will get along much better, but they 
keep playing Spiritual Assembly to each other and expect the Assembly to
 behave like an individual. . .</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 October 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to an individual believer, quoted in "Baha'i News" 241 (March 
1951), p. 2)</p>
<p>	1330. When criticism and harsh words arise within a Baha'i 
community, there is no remedy except to put the past behind one, and 
persuade all concerned to turn over a new leaf, and for the sake of God 
and His Faith refrain from mentioning the subjects which have led to 
misunderstanding and inharmony. The more the friends argue back and 
forth and maintain, each side, that their point of view is the right 
one, the worse the whole situation becomes.</p>
<p>	When we see the condition the world is in today, we must surely 
forget these utterly insignificant internal disturbances, and rush, 
unitedly, to the rescue of humanity. You should urge your fellow-Baha'is
 to take this point of view, and to support you in a strong effort to 
suppress every critical thought and every harsh word, in order to let 
the spirit of Baha'u'llah flow into the entire community, and unite it 
in His love and in His service.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 16 February 1951 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1331. The Guardian feels sure that the contribution which has been 
made by your friend who has not been active in the Cause for a short 
time will be the means of stimulating her to renewed service. There is 
nothing that brings success in the Faith like service. Service is the 
magnet which draws the divine confirmations. Thus, when a person is 
active, they are blessed by the Holy Spirit. When they are inactive, the
 Holy Spirit cannot find a repository in their being, and thus they are 
deprived of its healing and quickening rays.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 July 1952 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1332. The Guardian feels that your attitude towards the corrupt 
practice of accepting commissions from fellow physicians and pharmacists
 is most admirable. The more upright and noble the Baha'is are in their 
conduct, the more they will impress the public with the spiritual 
vitality of the Faith they believe in.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 October 1953 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1333. This challenge, so severe and insistent, and yet so glorious, 
faces no doubt primarily the individual believer on whom, in the last 
resort, depends the fate of the entire community. He it is who 
constitutes the warp and woof on which the quality and pattern of the 
whole fabric must depend. He it is who acts as one of the countless 
links in the mighty chain that now girdles the globe. He it is who 
serves as one of the multitude of bricks which support the structure and
 ensure the stability of the administrative edifice now being raised in 
every part of the world. Without his support, at once whole-hearted, 
continuous and generous, every measure adopted, and every plan 
formulated, by the Body which acts as the national representative of the
 community to which he belongs is foredoomed to failure. The World 
Centre of the Faith itself is paralysed if such a support on the part of
 the rank and file of the community is denied it. The Author of the 
Divine Plan Himself is impeded in His purpose if the proper instruments 
for the execution of His design are lacking. The sustaining strength of 
Baha'u'llah Himself, the Founder of the Faith, will be withheld from 
every and each individual who fails in the long run to arise and play 
his part.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 June 1954 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	1334. When a person becomes a Baha'i, actually what takes place is 
that the seed of the spirit starts to grow in the human soul. This seed 
must be watered by the outpourings of the Holy Spirit. These gifts of 
the spirit are received through prayer, meditation, study of the Holy 
Utterances and service to the Cause of God. The fact of the matter is 
that service in the Cause is like the plough which ploughs the physical 
soil when seeds are sown. It is necessary that the soil be ploughed up, 
so that it can be enriched, and thus cause a stronger growth of the 
seed. In exactly the<br>
 same way the evolution of the spirit takes place through ploughing up 
the soil of the heart so that it is a constant reflection of the Holy 
Spirit. In this way the human spirit grows and develops by leaps and 
bounds.</p>
<p>	Naturally there will be periods of distress and difficulty, and even
 severe tests; but if that person turns firmly toward the divine 
Manifestation, studies carefully His spiritual teachings and receives 
the blessings of the Holy Spirit, he will find that in reality these 
tests and difficulties have been the gifts of God to enable him to grow 
and develop. Thus you might look upon your own difficulties in the path 
of service. They are the means of your spirit growing and developing. 
You will suddenly find that you have conquered many of the problems 
which upset you, and then you will wonder why they should have troubled 
you at all. An individual must center his whole heart and mind on 
service to the Cause, in accordance with the high standards set by 
Baha'u'llah. When this is done, the Hosts of the Supreme Concourse will 
come to the assistance of the individual, and every difficulty and trial
 will gradually be overcome.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 October 1954 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1335. The road is stony, and there are many tests; but as you say, 
if the friends will learn to live according to Baha'u'llah's teachings, 
they will discover that they work indeed in mysterious and forceful 
ways; and that there is always help at hand, that obstacles are 
overcome, and that success is assured in the end.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 April 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1336. The individual alone must assess its character, consult his 
conscience, prayerfully consider all its aspects, manfully struggle 
against the natural inertia that weighs him down in his effort to arise,
 shed, heroically and irrevocably, the trivial and superfluous 
attachments which hold him back, empty himself of every thought that may
 tend to obstruct his path, mix, in obedience to the counsels of the 
Author of His Faith, and in imitation of the One Who is its true 
Exemplar, with men and women, in all walks of life, seek to touch their 
hearts through the distinction which characterizes his thoughts, his 
words and his acts, and win them over,<br>
 tactfully, lovingly, prayerfully and persistently, to the Faith he himself has espoused.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 July 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	1337. He was very sorry to learn of the inharmony amongst the 
friends there; and he feels that the only wise course of action is for 
all the believers to devote themselves to teaching the Faith and 
co-operating with their National Body.</p>
<p>	Often these trials and tests which all Baha'i communities inevitably
 pass through seem terrible, at the moment, but in retrospect we 
understand that they were due to the frailty of human nature, to 
misunderstandings, and to the growing pains which every Baha'i community
 must experience.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 November 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1338. He is very happy to see that you have put into practice one of
 the most encouraging precepts of 'Abdu'l-Baha in which He said that we 
should try and make every stumbling-block a stepping-stone to progress. 
In the course of your past life you have all stumbled very gravely; but,
 far from being embittered or defeated by this experience, you are 
determined to make it a means of purifying your natures, improving your 
characters, and enabling you to become better citizens in the future. 
This is truly pleasing in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 March 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of Kitalya Farm Prison)</p>
<p>	1339. ...the Baha'is must, in view of the condition of the world 
today, stand forth firmly and courageously as followers of Baha'u'llah, 
obeying His Laws, and seeking to build His World Order. Through 
compromise we will never be able to establish our Faith or win others' 
hearts to it. This involves often great personal sacrifice, but we know 
that, when we do the right thing, God gives us the strength to carry it 
out, and we attract His blessing. We learn at such times that our 
calamity is indeed a blessing.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 May 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believer)<br>

</p><p>	1340. It is not enough for the friends to make the excuse that 
their best teachers and their exemplary believers have arisen and 
answered the call to pioneer. A "best teacher" and an "exemplary 
believer" is ultimately neither more nor less than an ordinary Baha'i 
who has consecrated himself to the work of the Faith, deepened his 
knowledge and understanding of its Teachings, placed his confidence in 
Baha'u'llah, and arisen to serve Him to the best of his ability. This 
door is one which we are assured will open before the face of every 
follower of the Faith who knocks hard enough, so to speak. When the will
 and the desire are strong enough, the means will be found and the way 
opened either to do more work locally, to go to a new goal town within 
the United States, or to enter the foreign pioneer field...</p>
<p>	Not only must your Body provide the encouragement and leadership 
required, and stimulate the friends to arise and play their part, but 
the Local Assemblies must likewise do everything in their power to help 
the friends to go forth and attain their objectives. Each individual 
Baha'i must likewise feel that it is his personal duty to the Cause at 
this time and his greatest privilege, and must ask himself what he can 
do during the coming six years, beginning now, to hasten the attainment 
of the goals of the World Crusade. The Baha'is are the leaven of God, 
which must leaven the lump of their nation. In direct ratio to their 
success will be the protection vouchsafed, not only to them but to their
 country. These are the immutable laws of God, from which there is no 
escape: "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much 
required."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 September 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	Revised July 1990<br>

</p><p>	THE LOCAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLIES</p>
<p>	(Based on extracts of communications from the Universal House of Justice)</p>
<p>	I. The Importance of the Local Spiritual Assembly</p>
<p>	1341. "As the Baha'i Administrative Order rapidly expands throughout
 the world it behooves everyone associated with it to familiarize 
himself with its principles, to understand its import and to put its 
precepts into practice. Only as individual members of Local Spiritual 
Assemblies deepen themselves in the fundamental verities of the Faith 
and in the proper application of the principles governing the operation 
of the Assembly will this institution grow and develop toward its full 
potential."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 August 1970 to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	1342. "The divinely ordained institution of the Local Spiritual 
Assembly operates at the first levels of human society and is the basic 
administrative unit of Baha'u'llah's World Order. It is concerned with 
individuals and families whom it must constantly encourage to unite in a
 distinctive Baha'i society, vitalized and guarded by the laws, 
ordinances and principles of Baha'u'llah's Revelation. It protects the 
Cause of God; it acts as the loving shepherd of the Baha'i flock.</p>
<p>	"Strengthening and development of Local Spiritual Assemblies is a 
vital objective... Success in this one goal will greatly enrich the 
quality of Baha'i life, will heighten the capacity of the Faith to deal 
with entry by troops which is even now taking place and, above all, will
 demonstrate the solidarity and ever-growing distinctiveness of the 
Baha'i community, thereby attracting more and more thoughtful souls to 
the Faith and offering a refuge to the leaderless and hapless millions 
of the spiritually bankrupt, moribund present order.</p>
<p>	"The friends are called upon to give their whole-hearted support and
 cooperation to the Local Spiritual Assembly, first by voting for the 
membership and then by energetically pursuing its plans and programmes, 
by turning to it in time of trouble or difficulty, by praying for its 
success and taking delight in its rise to influence and honour. This 
great prize, this gift of God within each community must be cherished, 
nurtured, loved, assisted, obeyed and prayed for.<br>

</p><p>	"Such a firmly founded, busy and happy community life as is 
envisioned when Local Spiritual Assemblies are truly effective, will 
provide a firm home foundation from which the friends may derive courage
 and strength and loving support in bearing the Divine Message to their 
fellow-men and conforming their lives to its benevolent rule."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated Naw-Ruz 1974 to the Baha'is of the World)</p>
<p>	1343. "The institution of the Local Spiritual Assembly is of primary
 importance in the firm establishment of the Faith, and we hope that you
 will give particular attention to ensuring that as many as possible, 
and in increasing numbers, are, in the words of the beloved 
Guardian,'broadly based, securely grounded' and 'efficiently 
functioning'."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated Naw-Ruz 1974 to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	1344. "...the one vital activity which will enrich the quality of 
Baha'i life is the strengthening of Local Assemblies, for in this 
institution, operating at the first level of human society, rests the 
greatest opportunity to foster the sound and healthy growth of the 
Baha'i community. In other words, however efficient the National 
Assembly and its staff may be, and however diligently the national 
committees may function, it is only when the Local Spiritual Assemblies 
begin to operate vigorously that a firm home base can be provided from 
which to carry the Divine Message further afield."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 3 April 1974 to the National Spiritual Assembly of South and West Africa)</p>
<p>	1345. "It is becoming increasingly understood by the friends why ...
 such great emphasis upon the firmness of the foundation and the 
efficiency of the operation of the Local Spiritual Assemblies. This is 
very heartening, for upon the degree to which the members of these 
Assemblies grasp the true significance of the divine institution on 
which they serve, arise selflessly to fulfil their prescribed and sacred
 duties, and persevere in their endeavours, depends to a large extent 
the healthy growth of the world-wide community of the Most Great Name, 
the force of its outward thrust, and the strength of its supporting 
roots."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 May 1975 to all National Spiritual Assemblies)<br>

</p><p>	II. The Development of the Local Spiritual Assemblies:</p>
<p>	1346. "Local Spiritual Assemblies are at the present newly born 
institutions, struggling for the most part to establish themselves both 
in the Baha'i community and in the world. They are as yet only embryos 
of the majestic institutions ordained by Baha'u'llah in His Writings....</p>
<p>	"What we find expounded in the writings of our Faith is the lofty 
station Local Spiritual Assemblies must attain in their gradual and at 
times painful development.... "Among the more salient objectives to be 
attained by the Local Spiritual Assembly in its process of development 
to full maturity are to act as a loving shepherd to the Baha'i flock, 
promote unity and concord among the friends, direct the teaching work, 
protect the Cause of God, arrange for Feasts, Anniversaries and regular 
meetings of the community, familiarize the Baha'is with its plans, 
invite the community to offer its recommendations, promote the welfare 
of youth and children, and participate, as circumstances permit, in 
humanitarian activities. In its relationship to the individual believer,
 the Assembly should continuously invite and encourage him to study the 
Faith, to deliver its glorious message, to live in accordance with its 
teachings, to contribute freely and regularly to the Fund, to 
participate in community activities, and to seek refuge in the Assembly 
for advice and help, when needed. "In its own meetings it must endeavour
 to develop skill in the difficult but highly rewarding art of Baha'i 
consultation, a process which will require great self-discipline on the 
part of all members and complete reliance on the power of Baha'u'llah. 
It should hold regular meetings and ensure that all its members are 
currently informed of the activities of the Assembly, that its Secretary
 carries out his duties, and its Treasurer holds and disburses the funds
 of the Faith to its satisfaction, keeping proper accounts and issuing 
receipts for all contributions. Many Assemblies find that some of their 
activities such as teaching, observance of Feasts and Anniversaries, 
solution of personal problems, and other duties are best dealt with by 
committees appointed by the Assembly and responsible to it."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 July 1972 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Bolivia)</p>
<p>	1347. "The time has come, we believe, when increasing numbers of 
Local Spiritual Assemblies should assume responsibility for helping the<br>
 teaching work of groups, isolated believers, and other Spiritual 
Assemblies in their neighborhood. Such extension teaching goals should 
be assigned by the National Spiritual Assembly or one of its teaching 
committees, or can be spontaneously adopted by Local Spiritual 
Assemblies, and should be carried out within the framework of the 
overall teaching plans of the country. It should also be made clear that
 by being given such goals a Spiritual Assembly is not being given any 
jurisdiction over believers outside its area, still less over other 
Local Spiritual Assemblies, but is being called upon to collaborate with
 them in their work."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated Naw-Ruz 1974 to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	1348. 'We long to see every Local Spiritual Assembly either 
spontaneously adopt its own goals or warmly welcome those it has been or
 will be given by its National Spiritual Assembly, swell the number of 
the adherents who compose its local community and, guided by the general
 policy outlined by its National Spiritual Assembly, proclaim the Faith 
more effectively, energetically pursue its extension teaching and 
consolidation goals, arrange the observances of the Holy Days, regularly
 hold its Nineteen Day Feasts and its sessions for deepening, initiate 
and maintain community projects, and encourage the participation of 
every member of its community in giving to the Fund and undertaking 
teaching activities and administrative services, so as to make each 
locality a stronghold of the Faith and a torch-bearer of the Covenant."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 May 1975 to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	1349. "The adoption of a local plan by the Local Assembly can exert a
 far-reaching influence on its work and on the life of the community."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 24 December 1975 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Reunion)</p>
<p>	III. The Supporting Role of the Auxiliary Board Members and their Assistants:</p>
<p>	1350. The National Spiritual Assemblies in consultation with the 
Counsellors should avail themselves of the services of the Auxiliary 
Board members and their assistants, who, together "...with the 
travelling teachers selected by the Assembly or its Teaching Committees,
 should be<br>
 continuously encouraged to conduct deepening courses ... and to make regular visits to Local Spiritual Assemblies...."</p>
<p>	The visitors, whether Auxiliary Board members, their assistants or 
travelling teachers "...should meet on such occasions not only with the 
Local Assembly but, of course, with the local community members, 
collectively at general meetings and even, if necessary, individually in
 their homes." The subjects to be discussed at such meetings with the 
Local Assembly and the friends should include among others the following
 points:</p>
<p>	1. the extent of the spread and stature of the Faith today;</p>
<p>	2. the importance of the daily obligatory prayers (at least the short prayer);</p>
<p>	3. the need to educate Baha'i children in the Teachings of the Faith and encourage them to memorize some of the prayers;</p>
<p>	4. the stimulation of youth to participate in community life by 
giving talks, etc. and having their own activities, if possible;</p>
<p>	5. the necessity to abide by the laws of marriage, namely, the need 
to have a Baha'i ceremony, to obtain the consent of parents, to observe 
monogamy; faithfulness after marriage; likewise the importance of 
abstinence from all intoxicating drinks and drugs;</p>
<p>	6. the local Fund and the need for the friends to understand that 
the voluntary act of contributing to the Fund is both a privilege and a 
spiritual obligation. There should also be discussion of various methods
 that could be followed by the friends to facilitate their contributions
 and the ways open to the Local Assembly to utilize its local Fund to 
serve the interests of its community and the Cause;</p>
<p>	7. the importance of the Nineteen Day Feast and the fact that it 
should be a joyful occasion and rallying point of the entire community;</p>
<p>	8. the manner of election with as many workshops as required, 
including teaching of simple methods of balloting for illiterates, such 
as having one central home as the place for balloting and arranging for 
one literate person, if only a child, to be present at that home during 
the whole day, if necessary;</p>
<p>	9. last but not least, the all-important teaching work, both in the 
locality and its neighbouring centres, as well as the need to<br>
 continuously deepen the friends in the essentials of the Faith. The 
friends should be made to realize that in teaching the Faith to others 
they should not only aim at assisting the seeking soul to join the 
Faith, but also at making him a teacher of the Faith and its active 
supporter.</p>
<p>	"All the above points should, of course, be stressed within the 
framework of the importance of the Local Spiritual Assembly, which 
should be encouraged to vigorously direct its attention to these vital 
functions and become the very heart of the community life of its own 
locality, even if its meetings should become burdened with the problems 
of the community. The local friends should understand the importance of 
the law of consultation and realize that it is to the Local Spiritual 
Assembly that they should turn, abide by its decisions, support its 
projects, co-operate whole-heartedly with it in its task to promote the 
interests of the Cause, and seek its advice and guidance in the solution
 of personal problems and the adjudication of disputes, should any arise
 amongst the members of the community."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 2 February 1966 to all National Spiritual Assemblies Engaged in Mass Teaching Work)</p>
<p>	1351. "It is at this local level of Baha'i community life, the very 
foundation of the administrative structure of the Faith, that we so 
often find lack of adequate strength and efficiency. It is at this same 
level that our beloved Guardian urged Auxiliary Board Members to 
establish contact with Local Spiritual Assemblies, groups, isolated 
centres and the individual believers, and through periodic and 
systematic visits to localities as well as by correspondence help in 
promoting the interests of the Plan, assist in the efficient and prompt 
execution of the goals, watch over the security of the Faith, stimulate 
and strengthen the teaching and pioneer work, impress upon the friends 
the importance of individual effort, initiative and sacrifice, and 
encourage them to participate in Baha'i activities and be unified under 
all circumstances."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 November 1971 to the Continental Boards of Counsellors)</p>
<p>	1352. The aims of the Auxiliary Board members and their assistants, 
stated previously in relation to the services of the assistants, 
"...should be to<br>
 activate and encourage Local Spiritual Assemblies, to call the 
attention of Local Spiritual Assembly members to the importance of 
holding regular meetings, to encourage local communities to meet for the
 Nineteen Day Feasts and Holy Days, to help deepen their 
fellow-believers' understanding of the Teachings,..."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 7 October 1973 to the Baha'is of the World)</p>
<p>	1353. 'We are confident that the institution of the Boards of 
Counsellors will lend its vital support and, through the Counsellors' 
own contacts with the friends, through their Auxiliary Boards and their 
assistants, will nourish the roots of each local community, enrich and 
cultivate the soil of knowledge of the teachings and irrigate it with 
the living waters of love for Baha'u'llah. Thus will the saplings grow 
into mighty trees, and the trees bear their golden fruit."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 May 1975 to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	IV. Suggested Goals for Local Spiritual Assemblies:</p>
<p>	1354. "Any plan must have a term and specific goals, expressed 
preferably and if possible in numbers. For a Local Spiritual Assembly it
 would be better, at least in the early stages of its development, to 
have a term of nine months to a year. Of course it is also quite 
possible to have a series of plans of very short terms of say two to 
three months each, throughout the year.</p>
<p>	"The examples of local goals listed below are in the form of 
questions which each Assembly could put to itself, or may be directed to
 it by the National Spiritual Assembly. The questions are meant to lead 
to the adoption of a specific goal. An explanatory note follows items 
which may need clarification or comment.</p>
<p>	A) Teaching</p>
<p>	1. How many new believers? (The Plan calls for a "great increase in 
the number of believers" and confirming individuals "from every stratum 
of society". The ideal is for each local community to double itself 
every year, since every believer should, in accordance with the wish of 
the Master, guide one soul to the Cause of God every year. In some areas
 this may be an ambitious<br>
 project at the beginning, and at the outset a more modest goal could be adopted.)</p>
<p>	2. How many firesides? (Shoghi Effendi urged the friends to hold one
 fireside every nineteen days in their homes. The friends willing to 
respond to this wish, could give their names to the Local Assembly.)</p>
<p>	3. Can a pledge be made to have extension teaching activities 
outside the local area of jurisdiction? (Obviously only strong Local 
Assemblies can sustain such a goal.)</p>
<p>	B) Proclamation</p>
<p>	4. Are mass media facilities such as radio, television, and the 
press available to the Local Assembly? Can a goal be adopted for such 
activities?</p>
<p>	5. Can public meetings be anticipated? If so, how many?</p>
<p>	6. What methods can be adopted for the dissemination of Baha'i 
literature, such as distribution of books to local libraries, etc....? 
Can this goal be expressed in a challenging form?</p>
<p>	7. Can the local community participate in the social and 
humanitarian activities of the society of which it forms a part? Could a
 modest step be taken along this line?</p>
<p>	C) Consolidation</p>
<p>	8. Can the attendance of the friends at Nineteen Day Feasts be 
improved upon? What about the Anniversaries? Can the increase in 
attendance be expressed numerically, such as in terms of the percentage 
of those attending?</p>
<p>	9. Can regular meetings for the benefit of the local friends be 
held? If so, how often and when? (In the recent compilation on 
"Meetings" released to all National Spiritual Assemblies,'Abdu'l-Baha 
exhorts the friends to hold such meetings as a "constant" activity, and 
praises weekly meetings. He repeatedly counsels the believers to read 
and recite the Holy Word in such meetings and deliver speeches on the 
teachings, the proofs and the history of the Faith.)</p>
<p>	10. Can daily early morning prayer sessions be held? If so, where 
and when? (If this is not feasible every day, an effort could be made to
 hold such sessions less frequently. At such devotional meetings<br>
 not only prayers, but suitable selections from the Sacred Writings 
could be read. Baha'u'llah has pointed out that upon the Word of God 
"must depend the gathering together and spiritual resurrection of all 
men", that "every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God is 
endowed with such potency as can instill new life into every human 
frame", and that were man to "taste the sweetness of the words which the
 lips of the All-Merciful have willed to utter, he would, though the 
treasures of the earth be in his possession, renounce them one and all, 
that he might vindicate the truth of even one of His commandments". It 
is because of such considerations that the Five Year Plan calls for the 
friends to memorize selections from the Writings. If a believer finds it
 difficult to memorize, he may be encouraged to make for his own use a 
selection of extracts, however brief, which he could reread and enjoy at
 his own leisure, to satisfy his inner soul.)</p>
<p>	11. Can youth activities be encouraged? If so, in what way?</p>
<p>	12. Can activities and classes for children be established? If so, could a specific goal be adopted?</p>
<p>	13. Can youth activities be maintained? Could this be expressed in the form of a goal?</p>
<p>	14. Is the community strong enough to establish a local Haziratu'l-Quds?</p>
<p>	15. Can a local endowment be acquired and maintained, and possibly used as an investment for the community?</p>
<p>	16. How can local contributions to the local Fund be encouraged? Can a target be adopted?</p>
<p>	17. Can the local community serve as host to a district conference of neighbouring communities and localities?</p>
<p>	18. Can the Local Assembly issue a regular Newsletter?</p>
<p>	"When the goals are finally decided upon, it is important that they 
should be announced to the friends. It should be borne in mind that 
Shoghi Effendi longed to see every believer involved in Baha'i service, 
so that universal participation may be achieved. It would be most 
effective if the Local Assembly, prior to such an announcement, would 
appoint local committees, to each of which a branch of activity or one 
or more of the local goals could be assigned. Such committees need not 
consist of<br>
 many members. When the committee appointments are made, the Local 
Assembly will be fully prepared to announce its goals and its committee 
appointments to the community at a Nineteen Day Feast or a specially 
called meeting of the community."</p>

</p><p>	I. Establishment and Station:</p>
<p>	1355. ...The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of 
Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of
 Baha, and should it exceed this number it does not matter. It behoveth 
them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard 
themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on 
earth....</p>
<p>	(Baha'u'llah, cited in a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by Shoghi
 Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United
 States and Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932" [rev. ed.], (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 
1980), p. 21)</p>
<p>	1356. Addressing the nations, the Ancient Beauty ordaineth that in 
every city in the world a house be established in the name of justice 
wherein shall gather pure and steadfast souls to the number of the Most 
Great Name. At this meeting they should feel as if they were entering 
the Presence of God, inasmuch as this binding command hath flowed from 
the Pen of Him Who is the Ancient of Days. The glances of God are 
directed towards this Assembly.</p>
<p>	(Baha'u'llah - provisional translation)</p>
<p>	1357. 'Abdu'l-Baha is constantly engaged in ideal communication with
 any Spiritual Assembly which is instituted through the divine bounty, 
and the members of which, in the utmost devotion, turn to the divine 
Kingdom and are firm in the Covenant. To them he is whole-heartedly 
attached and with them he is linked by everlasting ties....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 89)</p>
<p>	1358. These Spiritual Assemblies are aided by the Spirit of God. 
Their defender is 'Abdu'l-Baha. Over them He spreadeth His Wings. What 
bounty is there greater than this? These Spiritual Assemblies are 
shining lamps and heavenly gardens, from which the fragrances of 
holiness are diffused over all regions, and the lights of knowledge are 
shed abroad over all created things. From them the spirit of life 
streameth in every<br>
 direction. They, indeed, are the potent sources of the progress of man, at all times and under all conditions.</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, cited in Shoghi Effendi, "God Passes By"; rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), p. 332)</p>
<p>	1359. ...it is of the utmost importance that in accordance with the 
explicit text of the "Kitab-i-Aqdas", the Most Holy Book, in every 
locality, be it city or hamlet, where the number of adult (21 years and 
above) declared believers exceeds nine,[1] a local "Spiritual Assembly" 
be forthwith established. To it When the number of believers is exactly 
nine, they constitute themselves as the Local Spiritual Assembly by 
joint declaration. All local matters pertaining to the Cause must be 
directly and immediately referred for full consultation and decision. 
The importance, nay the absolute necessity of these local Assemblies is 
manifest when we realize that in the days to come they will evolve into 
the local Houses of Justice...<br>
 [1 When the number of believers is exactly nine, they constitute 
themselves as the Local Spiritual Assembly by joint declaration.]</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 March 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
Baha'is of America, Australasia, France, Germany, British Isles, Italy, 
Japan and Switzerland, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932", p. 37)</p>
<p>	1360. Let us recall His explicit and often repeated assurances that 
every Assembly elected in that rarefied atmosphere of selflessness and 
detachment is in truth appointed of God, that its verdict is truly 
inspired, that one and all should submit to its decision unreservedly 
and with cheerfulness.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 February 1924 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the Baha'is of America, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932" p. 65)</p>
<p>	1361. Designated as "Spiritual Assemblies" -- an appellation that 
must in the course of time be replaced by their permanent and more 
descriptive title of "Houses of Justice," bestowed upon them by the 
Author of the Baha'i Revelation; instituted, without any exception, in 
every city, town and village where nine or more adult believers are 
resident; annually and directly elected, on the first day of the 
greatest Baha'i Festival by all adult<br>
 believers, men and women alike; invested with an authority rendering 
them unanswerable for their acts and decisions to those who elect them; 
solemnly pledged to follow, under all conditions, the dictates of the 
"Most Great Justice" that can alone usher in the reign of the "Most 
Great Peace" which Baha'u'llah has proclaimed and must ultimately 
establish; charged with the responsibility of promoting at all times the
 best interests of the communities within their jurisdiction, of 
familiarizing them with their plans and activities and of inviting them 
to offer any recommendations they might wish to make; cognizant of their
 no less vital task of demonstrating, through association with all 
liberal and humanitarian movements, the universality and 
comprehensiveness of their Faith; dissociated entirely from all 
sectarian organizations, whether religious or secular; assisted by 
committees annually appointed by, and directly responsible to, them, to 
each of which a particular branch of Baha'i activity is assigned for 
study and action; supported by local funds to which all believers 
voluntarily contribute; these Assemblies, the representatives and 
custodians of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, numbering at the present time, 
several hundred, and whose membership is drawn from the diversified 
races, creeds and classes constituting the world-wide Baha'i community, 
have, in the course of the last two decades, abundantly demonstrated, by
 virtue of their achievements, their right to be regarded as the chief 
sinews of Baha'i society, as well as the ultimate foundation of its 
administrative structure.</p>
<p>(Shoghi Effendi, "God Passes By", p. 33</p>
<p>	1362. That the Spiritual Assemblies of today will be placed in time 
by the I louses of Justice, and are to all intents and purposes 
identical and not separate bodies, is abundantly confirmed by 
'Abdu'l-Baha Himself. He has in fact in a Tablet addressed to the 
members of the first Chicago Spiritual Assembly, the first elected 
Baha'i body instituted in the United States, referred to them as the 
members of the "House of Justice" for that city, and has thus with His 
own pen established beyond any doubt the identity of the present Baha'i 
Spiritual Assemblies with the Houses of Justice referred to by 
Baha'u'llah. For reasons which are not difficult to discover, it has 
been found advisable to bestow upon the elected representatives of 
Baha'i communities throughout the world the temporary appellation of 
Spiritual Assemblies, a term which, as the<br>
 position and aims of the Baha'i Faith are better understood and more 
fully recognized, will gradually be superseded by the permanent and more
 appropriate designation of House of Justice....</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters",
 2nd rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982) p. 6)</p>
<p>	II. Membership - Qualifications, Election:</p>
<p>	1363. If we but turn our gaze to the high qualifications of the 
members of Baha'i Assemblies ... we are filled with feelings of 
unworthiness and dismay, and would feel truly disheartened but for the 
comforting thought that if we rise to play nobly our part every 
deficiency in our lives will be more than compensated by the 
all-conquering spirit of His grace and power. Hence it is incumbent upon
 the chosen delegates to consider without the least trace of passion and
 prejudice, and irrespective of any material consideration, the names of
 only those who can best combine the necessary qualities of unquestioned
 loyalty, of selfless devotion, of a well-trained mind, of recognized 
ability and mature experience....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 3 June 1925 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
delegates and visitors at the convention of the United States and 
Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 
1922-1932", p. 88)</p>
<p>	1364. With reference to your next question concerning the 
qualifications of the members of the Spiritual Assembly: there is a 
distinction of fundamental importance which should be always remembered 
in this connection, and this is between the Spiritual Assembly as an 
institution, and the persons who compose it. These are by no means 
supposed to be perfect, nor can they be considered as being inherently 
superior to the rest of their fellow-believers. It is precisely because 
they are subject to the same human limitations that characterize the 
other members of the community that they have to be elected every year. 
The existence of elections is a sufficient indication that Assembly 
members, though forming part of an institution that is divine and 
perfect, are nevertheless themselves imperfect. But this does not 
necessarily imply that their judgement is defective. For as 'Abdu'l-Baha
 has repeatedly emphasized Baha'i Assemblies are under the guidance and 
protection of God. The elections, especially when annual, give the 
community a good opportunity to remedy any defect or imperfection from 
which the<br>
 Assembly may suffer as a result of the actions of its members. Thus a 
safe method has been established whereby the quality of membership in 
Baha'i Assemblies can be continually raised and improved. But, as 
already stated, the institution of the Spiritual Assembly should under 
no circumstances be identified with, or be estimated merely through, the
 personal qualifications of the members that compose it.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 15 November 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)</p>
<p>	1365. ...I feel that reference to personalities before the election 
would give rise to misunderstanding and differences. What the friends 
should do is to get thoroughly acquainted with one another, to exchange 
views, to mix freely and discuss among themselves the requirements and 
qualifications for such a membership without reference or application, 
however indirect, to particular individuals. We should refrain from 
influencing the opinion of others, of canvassing for any particular 
individual, but should stress the necessity of getting fully acquainted 
with the qualifications of membership referred to in our Beloved's 
Tablets and of learning more about one another through direct, personal 
experience rather than through the reports and opinions of our friends.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 May 1927 written by Shoghi Effendi to a 
Local Spiritual Assembly, published in "Baha'i News" 18 (June 1927), p. 
9)</p>
<p>	1366. These local Spiritual Assemblies will have to be elected 
directly by the friends, and every declared believer of 21 years and 
above, far from standing aloof and assuming an indifferent or 
independent attitude, should regard it his sacred duty to take part, 
conscientiously and diligently, in the election, the consolidation, and 
the efficient working of his own local Assembly.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 March 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
Baha'is of America, Australasia, France, Germany, British Isles, Italy, 
Japan, Switzerland, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932", p. 39)</p>
<p>	1367. ...the elector ... is called upon to vote for none but those 
whom prayer and reflection have inspired him to uphold....the practice 
of nomination, so detrimental to the atmosphere of a silent and 
prayerful election, is<br>
 viewed with mistrust inasmuch as it gives the right to the majority of a
 body that, in itself, under the present circumstances, often 
constitutes a minority of all the elected delegates, to deny that 
God-given right of every elector to vote only in favour of those whom he
 is conscientiously convinced are the most worthy candidates....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 27 May 1927 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, published 
in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 136)</p>
<p>	III. Taking Counsel Together - Functions:</p>
<p>	1368. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have
 regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as 
they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and 
seemly. Thus hath the Lord your God ... commanded you. Beware lest ye 
put away that which is clearly revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, O ye 
that perceive!</p>
<p>	(Baha'u'llah, cited in a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by Shoghi
 Effendi to the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, published in 
"Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 21)</p>
<p>	1369. When in session it behooveth them to converse, on behalf of 
the servants of God, on matters dealing with the affairs and interests 
of the public. For instance, teaching the Cause of God must be accorded 
precedence, inasmuch as it is a matter of paramount importance, so that 
thereby all men may enter the pavilion of unity and all the peoples of 
the earth be regarded even as a single body...</p>
<p>	Teaching the Cause must be viewed according to the conditions of the
 age and of the times so as to see what course is deemed proper to take.
 Other matters also should be dealt with in like manner. They must, 
however, take care that nothing doth take place contrary to the divine 
verses sent down in this glorious Manifestation, inasmuch as naught but 
that which hath been prescribed by the True One -- exalted be His glory 
-- would serve the interests of His servants. He, in truth, is more 
merciful to you than ye are unto yourselves. He, verily, is the One Who 
knoweth and is well informed of all. Should these souls comply with the 
prescribed conditions, they shall indeed, be aided through His invisible
 bestowals. This is truly a matter whose benefits will be conferred on 
all men...<br>

</p><p>	(Baha'u'llah, provisional translation)</p>
<p>	1370. The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are 
purity of motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God,
 attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst His
 loved ones, patience and long-suffering in difficulties and servitude 
to His exalted Threshold. Should they be graciously aided to acquire 
these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of Baha shall be 
vouchsafed to them. In this day, assemblies of consultation are of the 
greatest importance and a vital necessity. Obedience unto them is 
essential and obligatory. The members thereof must take counsel together
 in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. 
This can be attained when every member expresseth with absolute freedom 
his own opinion and setteth forth his argument. Should any one oppose, 
he must on no account feel hurt for not until matters are fully 
discussed can the right way be revealed. The shining spark of truth 
cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions. If after 
discussion a decision be carried unanimously, well and good; but if, the
 Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a majority of voices 
must prevail.[1]<br>

<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, cited in a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by 
Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, published
 in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", pp. 21-22)</p>
<p>	1371. ...Whenever ye enter the council-chamber, recite this prayer 
with a heart throbbing with the love of God and a tongue purified from 
all but His remembrance, that the All-Powerful may graciously aid you to
 achieve supreme victory: "O God, my God! We are servants of Thine that 
have turned with devotion to Thy Holy Face, that have detached ourselves
 from all beside Thee in this glorious Day. We have gathered in this 
spiritual assembly, united in our views and thoughts, with our purposes 
harmonized to exalt Thy Word amidst mankind. O Lord, our God! Make us 
the signs of Thy divine Guidance, the Standards of Thy exalted Faith 
amongst men, servants to Thy mighty Covenant, O Thou our Lord Most High!
 Manifestations of Thy Divine Unity in Thine Abha Kingdom, and 
resplendent stars shining upon all regions. Lord! Aid us to become seas<br>
 surging with the billows of Thy wondrous Grace, streams flowing from 
Thy all-glorious Heights, goodly fruits upon the Tree of Thy heavenly 
Cause, trees waving through the breezes of Thy Bounty in Thy celestial 
Vineyard. O God! Make our souls dependent upon the Verses of Thy Divine 
Unity, our hearts cheered with the outpourings of Thy Grace, that we may
 unite even as the waves of one sea and become merged together as the 
rays of Thine effulgent Light; that our thoughts, our views, our 
feelings may become as one reality, manifesting the spirit of union 
throughout the world. Thou art the Gracious, the Bountiful, the 
Bestower, the Almighty, the Merciful, the Compassionate."</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, cited in a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by 
Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, published
 in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", pp. 20-21)</p>
<p>	1372. ...The first condition is absolute love and harmony amongst 
the members of the assembly. They must be wholly freed from estrangement
 and must manifest in themselves the Unity of God, for they are the 
waves of one sea, the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the 
rays of one sun, the trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. 
Should harmony of thought and absolute unity be non-existent, that 
gathering shall be dispersed and that assembly be brought to naught. The
 second condition: they must when coming together turn their faces to 
the Kingdom on High and ask aid from the Realm of Glory. They must then 
proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care and moderation
 to express their views. They must in every matter search out the truth 
and not insist upon their own opinion, for stubbornness and persistence 
in one's views will lead ultimately to discord and wrangling and the 
truth will remain hidden. The honoured members must with all freedom 
express their own thoughts, and it is in no wise permissible for one to 
belittle the thought of another, nay, he must with moderation set forth 
the truth, and should differences of opinion arise a majority of voices 
must prevail, and all must obey and submit to the majority. It is again 
not permitted that any one of the honoured members object to or censure,
 whether in or out of the meeting, any decision arrived at previously 
though that decision be not right, for such criticism would prevent any 
decision from being enforced. In short, whatsoever thing is arranged in 
harmony and with love and purity of motive, its result is light, and 
should the least trace of<br>
 estrangement prevail the result shall be darkness upon darkness.... If 
this be so regarded, that assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it 
shall lead to coolness and alienation that proceed from the Evil One....</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, cited in a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by 
Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, published
 in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 22)</p>
<p>	1373. Discussions must all be confined to spiritual matters that 
pertain to the training of souls, the instruction of children, the 
relief of the poor, the help of the feeble throughout all classes in the
 world, kindness to all peoples, the diffusion of the fragrances of God 
and the exaltation of His Holy Word. Should they endeavour to fulfil 
these conditions the Grace of the Holy Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto 
them, and that assembly shall become the centre of the Divine blessings,
 the hosts of Divine confirmation shall come to their aid, and they 
shall day by day receive a new effusion of Spirit.</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, cited in a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by 
Shoghi Effendi) to the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, 
published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", pp. 
22-23)</p>
<p>	1374. A perusal of some of the words of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha
 on the duties and functions of the Spiritual Assemblies in every land 
(later to be designated as the local Houses of Justice) emphatically 
reveals the sacredness of their nature, the wide scope of their 
activity, and the grave responsibility which rests upon them. </p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	The matter of Teaching, its direction, its ways and means, its 
extension, its consolidation, essential as they are to the interests of 
the Cause, constitute by no means the only issue which should receive 
the full attention of these Assemblies. A careful study of Baha'u'llah's
 and 'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets will reveal that other duties, no less vital
 to the interests of the Cause, devolve upon the elected representatives
 of the friends in every locality. It is incumbent upon them to be 
vigilant and cautious, discreet and watchful, and protect at all times 
the Temple of the Cause from the dart of the mischief-maker and the 
onslaught of the enemy.<br>

</p><p>	They must endeavour to promote amity and concord amongst the 
friends, efface every lingering trace of distrust, coolness and 
estrangement from every heart, and secure in its stead an active and 
whole-hearted cooperation for the service of the Cause. They must do 
their utmost to extend at all times the helping hand to the poor, the 
sick, the disabled, the orphan, the widow, irrespective of colour, caste
 and creed. They must promote by every means in their power the material
 as well as the spiritual enlightenment of youth, the means for the 
education of children, institute, whenever possible, Baha'i educational 
institutions, organize and supervise their work and provide the best 
means for their progress and development.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p> They must undertake the arrangement of the regular meetings of the 
friends, the feasts and the anniversaries, as well as the special 
gatherings designed to serve and promote the social, intellectual and 
spiritual interests of their fellow-men. These rank among the most 
outstanding obligations of the members of every Spiritual Assembly....</p>
<p>	(The first paragraph is from a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by

<p>	1375. ...he feels that you should turn to your Local Assembly, in 
the strictest confidence, and seek their aid and advice. These bodies 
have the sacred obligation to help, advise, protect, and guide the 
believers in every way within their power when appealed to -- indeed 
they were established just for the purpose of keeping order and unity 
and obedience to the law of God amongst the believers. You should go to 
them as a child would to its parents...</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 September 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1376. Baha'u'llah has given the promise that in every Assembly 
where unity and harmony prevail there His glorious spirit will not only 
be present, but will animate, sustain and guide all the friends in all 
their deliberations.</p>
<p>	It is to unity that the Guardian has been continually calling the 
friends. For where a united will exists, nothing can effectively oppose 
and hamper the forces of constructive development....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 November 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the Local Spiritual Assemblies of Evanston and Wilmette, Il. 
U.S.A., published in "Baha'i News" 190 (December 1946), p. 1)</p>
<p>	1377. The members of these Assemblies, on their part, must disregard
 utterly their own likes and dislikes, their personal interests and 
inclinations, and concentrate their minds upon those measures that will 
conduce to the welfare and happiness of the Baha'i Community and promote
 the common weal.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 March 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
Baha'is of America, Australasia, France, Germany, British Isles, Italy, 
Japan and Switzerland, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932", p. 41)</p>
<p>	1378. Let us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies 
the principle of the undoubted right of the individual to 
self-expression, his freedom to declare his conscience and set forth his
 views....</p>
<p>	And when they are called upon to arrive at a certain decision, they 
should, after dispassionate, anxious, and cordial consultation, turn to 
God in prayer, and with earnestness and conviction and courage record 
their vote and abide by the voice of the majority, which we are told by 
our Master to be the voice of truth, never to be challenged, and always 
to be whole-heartedly enforced. To this voice the friends must heartily 
respond, and regard it as the only means that can ensure the protection 
and advancement of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 February 1924 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the Baha'is of America, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932", pp. 63-64)<br>

</p><p>	1379. Baha'is are not required to vote on an Assembly against 
their consciences. It is better if they submit to the majority view and 
make it unanimous. But they are not forced to. What they must do, 
however, is to abide by the majority decision, as this is what becomes 
effective. They must not go around undermining the Assembly by saying 
they disagreed with the majority. In other words, they must put the 
Cause first and not their own opinions. He (a Spiritual Assembly member)
 can ask the Assembly to reconsider a matter, but he has no right to 
force them or create inharmony because they won't change. Unanimous 
votes are preferable, but certainly cannot be forced upon Assembly 
members by artificial methods such as are used by other societies.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 October 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 202 
(December 1947), p. 3)</p>
<p>	1380. But before the majority of the Assembly comes to a decision, 
it is not only the right but the sacred obligation of every member to 
express freely and openly his views, without being afraid of displeasing
 or alienating any of his fellow-members. In view of this important 
administrative principle of frank and open consultation, the Guardian 
would advise you to give up the method of asking other members to voice 
your opinion and suggestions. This indirect way of expressing your views
 to the Assembly not only creates an atmosphere of secrecy which is most
 alien to the spirit of the Cause, but would also lead to many 
misunderstandings and complications. The Assembly members must have the 
courage of their convictions, but must also express whole-hearted and 
unqualified obedience to the well-considered judgement and directions of
 the majority of their fellow-members.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 October 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1381. The friends should therefore not feel discouraged at the 
differences of opinion that may prevail among the members of an 
Assembly, for these, as experience has shown, and as the Master's words 
attest, fulfil a valuable function in all Assembly deliberations. But 
once the opinion of the majority has been ascertained, all the members 
should automatically and unreservedly obey it, and faithfully carry it 
out. Patience and restraint, however, should at all times characterize 
the discussions and<br>
 deliberations of the elected representatives of the local community, 
and no fruitless and hair-splitting discussions indulged in, under any 
circumstances.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 April 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1382. There is only one principle on which to conduct the work of an
 Assembly, and that is the supremacy of the will of the majority. The 
majority decisions must be courageously adopted and carried out by the 
Assembly, quite regardless of the opinionated adherence to their own 
views which any minority may cling to.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 November 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1383. He ... pointed out to them that the attitude of "all for one 
and one for all" was very incorrect. An Assembly constitutes within its 
area of jurisdiction the Trustees of the Faith. Its members must at all 
times put the interests of the Faith above personality and impartially 
go into any matter brought to its attention. Theoretically it is always 
possible for a member of an Assembly to be unworthy or insincere. To 
take the attitude that any blame cast upon or any charge made against an
 Assembly member is a charge against the body itself is very wrong. An 
Assembly must protect the Faith and neither blindly accuse nor blindly 
defend one of its members....</p>
<p>	The Baha'is must learn to forget personalities and to overcome the 
desire -- so natural in people -- to take sides and fight about it. They
 must also learn to really make use of the great principle of 
consultation. There is a time set aside at the Nineteen Day Feasts for 
the Community to express its views and make suggestions to its Assembly;
 the Assembly and the believers should look forward to this happy period
 of discussion, and neither fear it nor suppress it. Likewise the 
Assembly members should fully consult, and in their decisions put the 
interests of the Cause first and not personalities, the will of the 
majority prevailing.</p>
<p>	One of the healing remedies Baha'u'llah has given to a sick world is
 the Assembly (which in future will become a House of Justice); its 
members have very sacred and heavy responsibilities, its power to steer 
the Community, to protect and assist its members is likewise very great.<br>

</p><p>	(From a letter dated 30 June 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria)</p>
<p>	IV. Attendance and Resignation</p>
<p>	1384. ...it is only too obvious that unless a member can attend 
regularly the meetings of his Local Assembly, it would be impossible for
 him to discharge the duties incumbent upon him, and to fulfil his 
responsibilities, as a representative of the community. Membership in a 
Local Spiritual Assembly carries with it, indeed, the obligation and 
capacity to remain in close touch with local Baha'i activities, and 
[the] ability to attend regularly the sessions of the Assembly.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 16 February 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada, published in "Principles of Baha'i Administration: A 
Compilation" 1st Indian ed. (New Delhi: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), 
p. 51)</p>
<p>	1385. ...it is establishing a dangerous precedent to allow 
Assemblies to put a time limit on non-attendance of their members at 
meetings of the S.A., beyond which that person is automatically dropped 
from the Assembly and a vacancy declared... There should be no time 
limit fixed by Assemblies beyond which a person is dropped. Every case 
of prolonged absence from the sessions of the Assembly should be 
considered separately by that Assembly, and if the person is seen to not
 want to attend meetings, or to be held away from them indefinitely 
because of illness or travel, then a vacancy could legitimately be 
declared and a new member be elected.</p>
<p>	(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual, published in "Baha'i News" 208 (June 1948), p. 7)</p>
<p>	1386. With reference to your question whether it would be 
permissible for a believer to resign from the Local Assembly: under 
special circumstances, such as illness, one may do so, but only after, 
and never before, one has been elected to the membership of the 
Assembly. Personal differences and disagreements among Assembly members 
surely afford no sufficient ground for such resignation, and certainly 
can not justify absence from Assembly meetings. Through the clash of 
personal opinions, as<br>
 'Abdu'l-Baha has stated, the spark of truth is often ignited, and Divine guidance revealed....</p>
<p>(From a letter dated 18 April 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi<br>
Effendi to an individual believer) </p>
<p>	1387. The remedy to Assembly inharmony cannot be in the resignation 
or abstinence of any of its members. It must learn, in spite of 
disturbing elements, to continue to function as a whole, otherwise the 
whole system would become discredited through the introduction of 
exceptions to the rule.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 November 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	V. Assembly- Relation to Believers</p>
<p>	1388. Let us also bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God 
is not dictatorial authority, but humble fellowship, not arbitrary 
power, but the spirit of frank and loving consultation.</p>
<p>	Nothing short of the spirit of a true Baha'i can hope to reconcile 
the principles of mercy and justice, of freedom and submission, of the 
sanctity of the right of the individual and of self-surrender, of 
vigilance, discretion and prudence on the one hand and fellowship, 
candour and courage on the other.</p>
<p>	The duties of those whom the friends have freely and conscientiously
 elected as their representatives are no less vital and binding than the
 obligations of those who have chosen them. Their function is not to 
dictate, but to consult, and consult not only among themselves, but as 
much as possible with the friends whom they represent. They must regard 
themselves in no other light but that of chosen instruments for a more 
efficient and dignified presentation of the Cause of God. They should 
never be led to suppose that they are the central ornaments of the body 
of the Cause, intrinsically superior to others in capacity or merit, and
 sole promoters of its teachings and principles. They should approach 
their task with extreme humility, and endeavour by their 
open-mindedness, their high sense of justice and duty, their candour, 
their modesty, their entire devotion to the welfare and interests of the
 friends, the Cause, and humanity, to win not only the confidence and 
the genuine support and respect of those whom they should serve, but 
also their esteem and real affection. They must at all times avoid the 
spirit of exclusiveness, the<br>
 atmosphere of secrecy, free themselves from a domineering attitude, and
 banish all forms of prejudice and passion from their deliberations. 
They should, within the limits of wise discretion, take the friends into
 their confidence, acquaint them with their plans, share with them their
 problems and anxieties, and seek their advice and counsel....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 February 1924 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the Baha'is of America, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932", pp. 63-63)</p>
<p>	1389. The first quality for leadership, both among individuals and 
Assemblies, is the capacity to use the energy and competence that exists
 in the rank and file of its followers. Otherwise the more competent 
members of the group will go at a tangent and try to find elsewhere a 
field of work and where they could use their energy.</p>
<p>	Shoghi Effendi hopes that the Assemblies will do their utmost in 
planning such teaching activities that every single soul will be kept 
busy.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 August 1930 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada)</p>
<p>	1390. The administrators of the Faith of God must be like unto 
shepherds. Their aim should be to dispel all the doubts, 
misunderstandings and harmful differences which may arise in the 
community of the believers. And this they can adequately achieve 
provided they are motivated by a true sense of love for their 
fellow-brethren coupled with a firm determination to act with justice in
 all the cases which are submitted to them for their consideration.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 9 March 1934 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1391. There is no task more urgently necessary than the assurance of
 perfect harmony and fellowship among the friends, especially between 
the Local Assemblies and individual believers. The Local Assemblies 
should inspire confidence in the individual believers, and these in 
their turn should express their readiness to fully abide by the 
decisions and directions of the Local Assembly. The two must learn to 
co-operate, and to realize that only through such a cooperation can the 
institutions of the Cause effectively and permanently function. While 
obedience to the<br>
 Local Assembly should be unqualified and whole-hearted, yet that body 
should enforce its decisions in such a way as to avoid giving the 
impression that it is animated by dictatorial motives. The spirit of the
 Cause is one of mutual co-operation, and not that of a dictatorship.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 October 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	VI. Believers - Relation to Assembly</p>
<p>	1392. ...It is incumbent upon everyone not to take any step without 
consulting the Spiritual Assembly, and they must assuredly obey with 
heart and soul its bidding and be submissive unto it, that things may be
 properly ordered and well arranged. Otherwise every person will act 
independently and after his own judgement, will follow his own desire, 
and do harm to the Cause.</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, quoted in a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by 
Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, published
 in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932"p. 21)</p>
<p>	1393. ...all matters without any exception whatsoever, regarding the
 interests of the Cause in ... [a] locality, individually or 
collectively, should be referred exclusively to the Spiritual Assembly 
in that locality, which shall decide upon it, unless it be a matter of 
national interest, in which case it shall be referred to the National 
Body....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
Baha'is of the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i 
Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 23)</p>
<p>	1394. In order to avoid division and disruption, that the Cause may 
not fall a prey to conflicting interpretations, and lose thereby its 
purity and pristine vigour, that its affairs may be conducted with 
efficiency and promptness, it is necessary that everyone should 
conscientiously take an active part in the election of these Assemblies,
 abide by their decision, enforce their decree, and co-operate with them
 whole-heartedly in their task of stimulating the growth of the Movement
 throughout all regions....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 march 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
Baha'is of America, Australasia, France, Germany, British Isles, Italy, 
Japan and<br>
 Switzerland, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 41)</p>
<p>	1395. I fully approve and whole-heartedly and unreservedly uphold 
the principle to which you refer that personalities should not be made 
centres around which the community may revolve, but that they should be 
subordinated under all conditions and however great their merits to the 
properly constituted Assemblies. You and your co-workers can never 
overestimate or overemphasize this cardinal principle of Baha'i 
Administration.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 April 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada, published in "Principles of Baha'i Administration: A 
Compilation", p. 58)</p>
<p>	1396. Regarding the principle that the Cause must not be allowed to 
centre around any Baha'i personality, the Guardian wishes to make it 
clear that it was never intended that well-qualified individual teachers
 should not receive from Local Assemblies every encouragement and 
facilities to address the public. What the Guardian meant was that the 
personality and the popularity of such a speaker should never be allowed
 to eclipse the authority, or detract from the influence of, the body of
 the elected representatives in every local community. Such an 
individual should not only seek the approval, advice and assistance of 
the body that represents the Cause in his locality, but should strive to
 attribute any credit he may obtain to the collective wisdom and 
capacity of the Assembly under whose jurisdiction he performs his 
services. Assemblies and not individuals constitute the bedrock on which
 the Administration is built. Everything else must be subordinated to, 
and be made to serve and advance the best interests of, these elected 
custodians and promoters of the Law of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 August 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to an individual believer, published in "Principles of Baha'i 
Administration: A Compilation, p. 19)</p>
<p>	1397. Regarding consultation: Any person can refer a matter to the 
Assembly for consultation whether the other party wishes to or not. In 
matters which affect the Cause the Assembly should, if it deems it<br>
 necessary, intervene even if both sides don't want it to, because the 
whole purpose of the Assemblies is to protect the Faith, the Communities
 and the individual Baha'is as well.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 October 1944 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 177 
(November 1945), p. 2)</p>
<p>	1398. The believers should learn to turn more often to their 
Assemblies for advice and help and at an earlier date, and the 
Assemblies, on the other hand, should act with more vigilance and a 
greater sense of Community responsibility towards every situation that 
may damage the prestige of the Faith in the eyes of the public. When 
decisions have been reached by the Assembly, they must be carried out 
loyally and willingly by all concerned.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 13 March 1944 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1399. One of the fundamentals involved in our Administrative Order, 
which we must remember will become the pattern for our World Order, is 
that even if an Assembly makes an ill-advised decision it must be upheld
 in order to preserve the unity of the Community. Appeal can be made 
from the Local Assembly's decision to the National Assembly... But the 
principle of authority invested in our elected bodies must be upheld. 
This is not something which can be learned without trial and test....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 June 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria)</p>
<p>	1400. The believers should have confidence in the directions and 
orders of their Assembly, even though they may not be convinced of their
 justice or right. Once the Assembly, through a majority vote of its 
members, comes to a decision the friends should readily obey it. 
Specially those dissenting members within the Assembly whose opinion is 
contrary to that of the majority of their fellow- members should set a 
good example before the community by sacrificing their personal views 
for the sake of obeying the principle of majority vote that underlies 
the functioning of all Baha'i Assemblies.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 October 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1401. The Assembly may make a mistake, but, as the Master 
pointed out, if the Community does not abide by its decisions, or the 
individual Baha'i, the result is worse, as it undermines the very 
institution which must be strengthened in order to uphold the principles
 and laws of the Faith. He tells us God will right the wrongs done. We 
must have confidence in this and obey our Assemblies. He therefore 
strongly urges you to work directly under your Baha'i Assembly, to 
accept your responsibilities as a voting member, and do your utmost to 
create harmony within the community.</p>
<p>	(From letter dated 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1402. What the Master desired to protect the friends against was 
continual bickering and opinionatedness. A believer can ask the Assembly
 why they made a certain decision and politely request them to 
reconsider. But then he must leave it at that, and not go on disrupting 
local affairs through insisting on his own views. This applies to an 
Assembly member as well. We all have a right to our opinions, we are 
bound to think differently; but a Baha'i must accept the majority 
decision of his Assembly, realizing that acceptance and harmony -- even 
if a mistake has been made -- are the really important things, and when 
we serve the Cause properly, in the Baha'i way, God will right any 
wrongs done in the end.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 October 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1403. Just as the individual believers a[re] bound to support and 
sustain their Local Spiritual Assembly, for the preservation of the 
unity of the Faith and the strengthening of its as yet embryonic World 
Order, so must the Local Assemblies obey and sustain their national 
representatives. The closer the co-operation between Local and National 
Assemblies, the greater will be the power and radiance which can and 
must stream forth from these institutions to the suffering ranks of 
humanity.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 29 July 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Bombay)</p>
<p>	VII. Prospects of the Future</p>
<p>	1404. The administrative machinery of the Cause having now 
sufficiently evolved, its aim and object fairly well grasped and 
understood, and its<br>
 method and working made more familiar to every believer, I feel the 
time is ripe when it should be fully and consciously utilized to further
 the purpose for which it has been created. It should, I strongly feel, 
be made to serve a twofold purpose. On one hand, it should aim at a 
steady and gradual expansion of the Movement along lines that are at 
once broad, sound and universal; and on the other, it should ensure the 
internal consolidation of the work already achieved....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 May 1926 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, published 
in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 109)</p>
<p>	1405. The friends must never mistake the Baha'i administration for 
an end in itself. It is merely the instrument of the spirit of the 
Faith. This Cause is a Cause which God has revealed to humanity as a 
whole. It is designed to benefit the entire human race, and the only way
 it can do this is to re-form the community life of mankind, as well as 
seeking to regenerate the individual. The Baha'i Administration is only 
the first shaping of what in future will come to be the social life and 
laws of community living. As yet the believers are only just beginning 
to grasp and practise it properly. So we must have patience if at times 
it seems a little self-conscious and rigid in its workings. It is 
because we are learning something very difficult but very wonderful -- 
how to live together as a community of Baha'is, according to the 
glorious teachings.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 October 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)</p>
<p>	1406. Ours, dearly-beloved co-workers, is the paramount duty to 
continue, with undimmed vision and unabated zeal, to assist in the final
 erection of that Edifice the foundations of which Baha'u'llah has laid 
in our hearts, to derive added hope and strength from the general trend 
of recent events, however dark their immediate effects, and to pray with
 unremitting fervour that He may hasten the approach of the realization 
of that Wondrous Vision which constitutes the brightest emanation of His
 Mind and the fairest fruit of the fairest civilization the world has 
yet seen.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 November 1931 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the Baha'is of the West, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: 
Selected Letters", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), 
p. 48)<br>

</p><p>	1407. And now as I look into the future, I hope to see the 
friends at all times, in every land, and of every shade of thought and 
character, voluntarily and joyously rallying round their local and in 
particular their national centres of activity, upholding and promoting 
their interests with complete unanimity and contentment, with perfect 
understanding, genuine enthusiasm, and sustained vigour. This indeed is 
the one joy and yearning of my life, for it is the fountain-head from 
which all future blessings will flow, the broad foundation upon which 
the security of the Divine Edifice must ultimately rest....</p>

</p><p>	March 1968</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE AND THE GUARDIAN REGARDING TEACHING THE MASSES</p>
<p>	When the masses of mankind are awakened and enter the Faith of God, a
 new process is set in motion and the growth of a new civilization 
begins. Witness the emergence of Christianity and of Islam. These masses
 are the rank and file, steeped in traditions of their own, but 
receptive to the new Word of God, by which, when they truly respond to 
it, they become so influenced as to transform those who come in contact 
with them. God's standards are different from those of men. According to
 men's standards, the acceptance of any cause by people of distinction, 
of recognized fame and status, determines the value and greatness of 
that cause. But, in the words of Baha'u'llah:'The summons and the 
message which We gave were never intended to reach or to benefit one 
land or one people only. Mankind in its entirety must firmly adhere to 
whatsoever hath been revealed and vouchsafed unto it." Or again, "He 
hath endowed every soul with the capacity to recognize the signs of God.
 How could He, otherwise, have fulfilled His testimony unto men, if ye 
be of them that ponder His Cause in their hearts." In countries where 
teaching the masses has succeeded, the Baha'is have poured out their 
time and effort in village areas to the same extent as they had formerly
 done in cities and towns. The results indicate how unwise it is to 
solely concentrate on one section of the population. Each National 
Assembly therefore should so balance its resources and harmonize its 
efforts that the Faith of God is taught not only to those who are 
readily accessible but to all sections of society, however remote they 
may be. The unsophisticated people of the world -- and they form the 
large majority of its population -- have the same right to know of the 
Cause of God as others. When the friends are teaching the Word of God 
they should be careful to give the Message in the same simplicity as it 
is enunciated in our Teachings. In their contacts they must show genuine
 -and divine love. The heart of an unlettered soul is extremely 
sensitive;<br>
 any trace of prejudice on the part of the pioneer or teacher is immediately sensed.</p>
<p>	When teaching among the masses, the friends should be careful not to
 emphasize the charitable and humanitarian aspects of the Faith as a 
means to win recruits. Experience has shown that when facilities such as
 schools, dispensaries, hospitals, or even clothes and food are offered 
to the people being taught, many complications arise. The prime motive 
should always be the response of man to God's message, and the 
recognition of His Messenger. Those who declare themselves as Baha'is 
should become enchanted with the beauty of the Teachings; and touched by
 the love of Baha'u'llah. The declarants need not know all the proofs, 
history, laws, and principles of the Faith, but in the process of 
declaring themselves they must, in addition to catching the spark of 
faith, become basically informed about the Central Figures of the Faith,
 as well as the existence of laws they must follow and an administration
 they must obey. After declaration, the new believers must not be left 
to their own devices. Through correspondence and dispatch of visitors, 
through conferences and training courses, these friends must be 
patiently strengthened and lovingly helped to develop into full Baha'i 
maturity. The beloved Guardian referring to the duties of Baha'i 
Assemblies in assisting the newly declared believer has written: "...the
 members of each and every Assembly should endeavour, by their patience,
 their love, their tact and wisdom, to nurse, subsequent to his 
admission, the newcomer into Baha'i maturity, and win him over gradually
 to the unreserved acceptance of whatever has been ordained in the 
teachings."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 13 July 1964 written by the Universal House of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	From reports and minutes we receive from various National Spiritual 
Assemblies, it is evident that your efforts to attract a greater number 
of receptive souls to the Cause of God, to open new areas for increased 
teaching activity and to consolidate the work so far accomplished are 
dependent upon more local travelling teachers and pioneers being 
assisted by the Fund to spend more of their time in Baha'i teaching 
services under your direction. There is a danger in this situation which
 must be avoided at all costs. Despite the pressing requirements of the 
Nine Year Plan, no Baha'i<br>
 teacher anywhere should consider himself as permanently employed by the
 Faith. We do not have in the Cause of God any paid career open to 
Baha'i teachers.</p>
<p>	The beloved Guardian elucidated this basic principle of Baha'i 
Administration through his repeated letters to National Assemblies from 
which we quote:</p>
<p>	At present it would be quite impossible to spread the Cause if those
 who arise to serve it as teachers or pioneers were not given financial 
assistance. All must realize, however, that the monies they receive are 
only to enable them to fulfil their objectives, and that they cannot 
consider themselves permanently entitled to be supported by the Cause.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 August 1944 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	Likewise travelling teachers should be assisted financially to carry
 out the "projects" assigned to them. The friends should not for a 
moment confuse this type of support with the creation of a paid clergy. 
Any Baha'i can, at the discretion of the NSA receive this necessary 
assistance and it is clearly understood it is temporary and only to 
carry out a specific plan.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 29 May 1946 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles)</p>
<p>	Each National Assembly, through its auxiliary Teaching Committees, 
should be able to so plan the time and efforts of its band of subsidized
 travelling teachers that no impression of permanency is given. As far 
as possible each "project" must be definite in objective and in 
duration. Likewise, when pioneer projects are envisaged, it must be made
 clear to the pioneer that he must make every effort to establish 
himself in some position in his pioneering post and thus become freed 
from the necessity of drawing further on Baha'i funds. Experience has 
shown that the observance of these principles is essential for the 
rearing of healthy communities; wherever they have been ignored 
difficulties and complications have arisen. In the application of these 
principles, if you have any difficulty, you should feel free to consult 
with us. Also, if you have found any particular scheme proving to be<br>
 successful without violating the above principles, you are welcome to 
send the details to us so that we may share your methods with other 
National Assemblies and enable them to benefit from your experience.</p>
<p>	Another problem closely linked with the above and which directly 
affects areas where mass teaching work is being carried out is the 
extent to which the local believers contribute to the Fund. As you note,
 one of the objectives of the Nine Year Plan is universal participation 
in Baha'i community life. This can be possible when each believer 
understands that his personal spiritual life will be enriched and 
universal blessings will descend only if each Baha'i participates in 
contributing, however poor he may be, however small the contribution, 
and in whatever form it is offered. Your Assembly must devote enough 
time at each meeting to consider carefully this basic process. We must 
be confident that the principles laid down in our Writings are not only 
workable, but are the only solution to the ills of mankind. With such 
confidence in their hearts, the members of each National Assembly faced 
with this stupendous problem must deliberate, and within the framework 
of the social and economic conditions of the communities they are 
serving, they must find ways and means that would gradually, yet 
positively, help in realising this purpose.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 June 1964 written by the Universal House of 
Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies engaged in teaching work 
among the masses)</p>
<p>	It has been due to the splendid victories in large-scale conversion 
that the Faith of Baha'u'llah has entered a new phase in its development
 and establishment throughout the world. It is imperative, therefore, 
that the process of teaching the masses be not only maintained but 
accelerated. The teaching committee structure that each National 
Assembly may adopt to ensure best results in the extension of its 
teaching work is a matter left entirely to its discretion, but an 
efficient teaching structure there must be, so that the tasks are 
carried out with dispatch and in accordance with the administrative 
principles of our Faith. From among the believers native to each 
country, competent travelling teachers must be selected and teaching 
projects worked out. In the words of our beloved Guardian, commenting 
upon the teaching work in Latin America: "Strong and sustained support 
should be given to the vitally needed and highly meritorious activities 
started by the native ... travelling teachers, ...<br>
 who, as the mighty task progresses, must increasingly bear the brunt of
 responsibility for the propagation of the Faith in their homelands."</p>
<p>	While this vital teaching work is progressing each National Assembly
 must ever bear in mind that expansion and consolidation are inseparable
 processes that must go hand in hand. The inter-dependence of these 
processes is best elucidated in the following passage from the writings 
of the beloved Guardian: "Every outward thrust into new fields, every 
multiplication of Baha'i institutions, must be paralleled by a deeper 
thrust of the roots which sustain the spiritual life of the community 
and ensure its sound development. From this vital, this ever-present 
need attention must, at no time, be diverted; nor must it be, under any 
circumstances neglected, or subordinated to the no less vital and urgent
 task of ensuring the outer expansion of Baha'i administrative 
institutions. That this community ... may maintain a proper balance 
between these two essential aspects of its development ... is the ardent
 hope of my heart...." To ensure that the spiritual life of the 
individual believer is continuously enriched, that local communities are
 becoming increasingly conscious of their collective duties, and that 
the institutions of an evolving administration are operating 
efficiently, is, therefore, as important as expanding into new fields 
and bringing in the multitudes under the shadow of the Cause. These 
objectives can only be attained when each National Spiritual Assembly 
makes proper arrangements for all the friends to be deepened in the 
knowledge of the Faith. The National Spiritual Assemblies in 
consultation with the Hands of the Cause, who are the Standard-Bearers 
of the Nine Year Plan, should avail themselves of the assistance of 
Auxiliary Board members, who, together with the travelling teachers 
selected by the Assembly or its Teaching Committees, should be 
continuously encouraged to conduct deepening courses at Teaching 
Institutes and to make regular visits to Local Spiritual Assemblies. The
 visitors, whether Board members or travelling teachers should meet on 
such occasions not only with the Local Assembly but, of course, with the
 local community members, collectively at general meetings and even, if 
necessary, individually in their homes. The subjects to be discussed at 
such meetings with the Local Assembly and the friends should include 
among others the following points:</p>
<p>	1). the extent of the spread and stature of the Faith today;<br>

</p><p>	2). the importance of the daily obligatory prayers (at least the short prayer);</p>
<p>	3). the need to educate Baha'i children in the Teachings of the Faith and encourage them to memorize some of the prayers;</p>
<p>	4). the stimulation of youth to participate in community life by 
giving talks, etc. and having their own activities, if possible;</p>
<p>	5). the necessity to abide by the laws of marriage, namely, the need
 to have a Baha'i ceremony, to obtain the consent of parents, to observe
 monogamy; faithfulness after marriage; likewise the importance of 
abstinence from all intoxicating drinks and drugs;</p>
<p>	6). the local Fund and the need for the friends to understand that 
the voluntary act of contributing to the Fund is both a privilege and a 
spiritual obligation. There should also be discussion of various methods
 that could be followed by the friends to facilitate their contributions
 and the ways open to the Local Assembly to utilize its local Fund to 
serve the interests of its community and the Cause;</p>
<p>	7). the importance of the Nineteen Day Feast and the fact that it 
should be a joyful occasion and rallying point of the entire community;</p>
<p>	8). the manner of election with as many workshops as required, 
including teaching of simple methods of balloting for illiterates, such 
as having one central home as the place for balloting and arranging for 
one literate person, if only a child, to be present at that home during 
the whole day, if necessary;</p>
<p>	9). last but not least, the all-important teaching work, both in the
 locality and its neighbouring centres, as well as the need to 
continuously deepen the friends in the essentials of the Faith. The 
friends should be made to realize that in teaching the Faith to others 
they should not only aim at assisting the seeking soul to join the 
Faith, but also at making him a teacher of the Faith and its active 
supporter.</p>
<p>	All the above points should, of course, be stressed within the 
framework of the importance of the Local Spiritual Assembly, which 
should be encouraged to vigorously direct its attention to these vital 
functions and become the very heart of the community life of its own 
locality, even if its meetings should become burdened with the problems<br>
 of the community. The local friends should understand the importance of
 the law of consultation and realize that it is to the Local Spiritual 
Assembly that they should turn, abide by its decisions, support its 
projects, co-operate whole-heartedly with it in its task to promote the 
interests of the Cause, and seek its advice and guidance in the solution
 of personal problems and the adjudication of disputes, should any arise
 amongst the members of the community.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 2 February 1966 written by the Universal House 
of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies engaged in mass teaching
 work)</p>
<p>	As it has already been pointed out, in various communications to 
you, it is important for the National Spiritual Assemblies to work out 
ways and means of creating a sense of belonging in the hearts of the 
believers. One of the ways this can be done is to bring to their 
attention the needs of the Fund. The National Assembly should neither 
feel embarrassed nor ashamed in turning to the friends, continuously 
appealing to them to exemplify their faith and devotion to the Cause by 
sacrificing for it, and pointing out to them that they will grow 
spiritually through their acts of self-abnegation, that the fear of 
poverty should not deter them from sacrificing for the Fund, and that 
the assistance and bounty of the Source of all good and of all wealth 
are unfailing and assured.... It might be useful to share with the 
friends extracts from the writings of the beloved Guardian, such as the 
two passages we quote below:</p>
<p>	Every Baha'i, no matter how poor, must realize what a grave 
responsibility he has to shoulder in this connection, and should have 
confidence that his spiritual progress as a believer in the World Order 
of Baha'u'llah will largely depend upon the measure in which he proves, 
in deeds, his readiness to support materially the divine institutions of
 His Faith.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 July 1937 written on behalf of the Guardian 
to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	The institution of the National Fund, so vital and essential for the
 uninterrupted progress of these activities must, in particular, be 
assured of the whole-hearted, the ever-increasing and universal support 
of the mass of believers, for whose welfare, and in whose<br>
 name, these beneficent activities have been initiated and have been 
conducted. All, no matter how modest their resources, must participate.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 August 1957 written on behalf of the Guardian
 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Central and East 
Africa)</p>
<p>	We feel that each National Assembly should carefully and regularly 
consult on this vital aspect of the education of the friends, spare no 
effort and lose no opportunity in bringing to their attention the needs 
of the hour. For example, where land is difficult to obtain, or where 
funds for the purchase of endowments are not available, the friends 
should be appealed to in a dignified and effective manner to donate from
 their own land for the use of Baha'i institutions. In the construction 
of local Baha'i centres, the National Assembly should carefully devise 
methods of appealing to the friends to contribute manpower or local 
materials for the construction of such buildings. If ready cash is not 
available for contributions to the Fund, the National Assembly should 
guide the friends in ways they could raise funds by a collective effort 
to cultivate a piece of land, by contributing cash crops, livestock or 
home-made dishes, sweetmeats, or handicrafts. Special meetings could 
also be arranged for the sale of such contributions in kind. In the 
matter of attendance of delegates at Conventions, the desirability of 
the friends themselves being self-supporting should be pointed out by 
the National Assembly. If a delegate cannot his own expenses in 
attending the Convention, the Local Assembly or the believers in the 
electoral unit from which the delegate comes should be encouraged by the
 National Assembly to defray such expenses, so that only when funds are 
unavailable from those sources, the National Assembly is approached to 
consider offering financial assistance. The same principle holds true 
about other activities, such as attendance at Institutes, Conferences 
and Summer Schools.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 9 February 1967 written by the Universal House of Justice to various National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	Many National Spiritual Assemblies in carrying out their plans for 
expansion and consolidation have found it necessary to select a number 
of believers for service as travelling teachers. While we appreciate the
 valuable services these travelling teachers have already rendered we 
are<br>
 nevertheless deeply conscious of the problems facing your National 
Assemblies in your desire to carry out your teaching programmes with as 
much dispatch as possible. The purpose of this letter is to draw your 
attention to the fact that these problems could well be minimized if the
 selection of such teachers were done with great care and discretion.</p>
<p>	It must be realized that people who are mostly illiterate cannot 
have the benefit of reading for themselves the written word and of 
deriving directly from it the spiritual sustenance they need for the 
enrichment of their Baha'i lives. They become dependent, therefore, to a
 large extent on their contacts with visiting teachers. The spiritual 
calibre or moral quality of these teachers assumes, therefore, great 
importance. The National Spiritual Assembly or the Teaching Committees 
responsible for the selection of these teachers should bear in mind that
 their choice must depend, not only on the knowledge or grasp of the 
teachings on the part of the teachers, but primarily upon their pure 
spirit and their true love for the Cause, and their capacity to convey 
that spirit and love to others. ...What wonderful results will soon be 
witnessed in the areas under your jurisdiction if you devise ways and 
means to ensure, as far as circumstances permit, that the travelling 
teachers you are encouraging to circulate among the friends will all be 
of the standard called for in these quotations -- pure and sanctified 
souls, with nothing but true devotion and self-sacrifice motivating them
 in their services to God's Holy Cause....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 October 1967 written by the Universal House 
of Justice to National Spiritual Assemblies engaged in mass teaching)</p>
<p>	The paramount goal of the teaching work at the present time is to 
carry the message of Baha'u'llah to every stratum of human society and 
every walk of life. An eager response to the teachings will often be 
found in the most unexpected quarters, and any such response should be 
quickly followed up, for success in a fertile area awakens a response in
 those who were at first uninterested. The same presentation of the 
teachings will not appeal to everybody; the method of expression and the
 approach must be varied in accordance with the outlook and interests of
 the hearer. An approach which is designed to appeal to everybody will 
usually result in attracting the middle section, leaving both extremes 
untouched. No effort must be spared to ensure that the healing Word of 
God reaches the rich and the poor, the<br>
 learned and the illiterate, the old and the young, the devout and the 
atheist, the dweller in the remote hills and islands, the inhabitant of 
the teeming cities, the suburban businessman, the labourer in the slums,
 the nomadic tribesman, the farmer, the university student; all must be 
brought consciously within the teaching plans of the Baha'i Community.</p>
<p>	Whereas plans must be carefully made, and every useful means adopted
 in the furtherance of this work, your Assemblies must never let such 
plans eclipse the shining truth expounded in the enclosed quotations: 
that it is the purity of heart, detachment, uprightness, devotion and 
love of the teacher that attracts the divine confirmations and enables 
him, however ignorant he be in this world's learning, to win the hearts 
of his fellowmen to the Cause of God.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 31 October 1967 written by the Universal House of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	The growth of the Cause in India during the past several years has 
been vast and awe inspiring, and it is quite natural that this growth 
should have been accompanied by problems and responsibilities that taxed
 the administrative experience and capacities of your National Assembly 
to the utmost. ...Travelling teachers and foreign pioneers could 
doubtless stimulate the friends and assist them in the teaching work, 
but essentially, the progress and growth of the Cause in India depend 
upon the services of your own people, and, to this end, a concerted 
effort should be made to integrate the friends in India into the work of
 the Cause in all its aspects, to assure universal participation that 
will result in winning even greater victories for the Cause. In this 
connection, your idea of engaging a number of well trained travelling 
teachers in India is, in principle, correct. You have various Teaching 
Institutes and a number of devoted, well-informed teachers at your 
disposal for this service. One of the most important duties of such 
travelling teachers should be to develop nuclei of devoted and active 
believers in the many centres who would inspire and assist the friends 
in active participation in the work to be done in their villages and 
towns. A plan should be developed to enable such travelling teachers to 
spend more time in fewer places instead of making brief visits in 
numerous centres. This would enable them to, in turn, train resident 
teachers in the various localities to spearhead the work of<br>
 expansion and consolidation in their areas. The names of the believers 
thus trained should be given to the administrative bodies in charge of 
teaching. Teaching Institutes, Summer Schools, Conferences, etc. should 
be utilized to provide further encouragement and training for those 
believers whenever such opportunities arise.</p>
<p>	In all your training programmes, the Baha'i Administration should 
have special attention. The believers should know that our 
administration is part of our religion. For this reason, not only should
 you patiently and lovingly train the believers, but should also strive 
to attract to the Faith individuals who possess qualities and capacities
 that will add to the administrative strength of the Community as a 
whole. The beloved Guardian has stated: "There is no doubt that the 
poorer classes should be taught the Cause and given every opportunity to
 embrace it. More especially in order to demonstrate to people our 
cardinal lack of prejudice... However, he feels that the great point is 
to confirm people of true capacity and ability -- from whatever social 
stratum they may be -- because the Cause needs now, and will 
ever-increasingly need, souls of great ability who can bring it before 
the public at large, administer its ever-growing affairs, and contribute
 to its advancement in every field." We note with deep satisfaction that
 the Message of God is being given to a cross section of all the people 
of India, as evidenced by your success in attracting a large number of 
college students to the Faith, as well as others representing various 
classes of people.</p>

</p><p>	COMPILATION OF EXTRACTS FROM THE BAHA'I WRITINGS ON MUSIC</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Baha'u'llah: 1408. Intone, O My servant, the 
verses of God that have been received by thee, as intoned by them who 
have drawn nigh unto Him, that the sweetness of thy melody may kindle 
thine own soul, and attract the hearts of all men....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 295)</p>
<p>	1409. We have permitted you to listen to music and singing. Beware 
lest such listening cause you to transgress the bounds of decency and 
dignity. Rejoice in the joy of My Most Great Name through which the 
hearts are enchanted and the minds of the well-favoured are attracted.</p>
<p>	We have made music a ladder by which souls may ascend to the realm 
on high. Change it not into wings for self and passion. I seek refuge in
 God that you be not of the ignorant.</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Aqdas" - Provisional translation from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	1410. Blessed is he who directeth his steps towards the 
Mashriqu'l-Adhkar at the hour of dawn, communing with Him, attuned to 
His remembrance, imploring His forgiveness. And having entered therein, 
let him sit in silence to hearken unto the verses of God, the Sovereign,
 the Almighty, the All-Praised. Say, the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is in truth 
any House raised in towns or villages, for mention of Me. Thus hath it 
been named before His Throne; would that ye know it. And those who chant
 the verses of the Merciful in most melodious tones will attain thereby 
unto that with which the kingdoms of earth and heaven can never compare.
 And they will inhale therefrom the fragrance of My realms which none 
discerneth in this day save those who have been granted vision by this 
sublime Beauty. Say, verily, the verses of the Merciful uplift the 
stainless hearts unto those realms of the spirit which cannot be 
described in words or expressed in symbols. Blessed are they that 
hearken!</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Aqdas" - Provisional translation from the Arabic)<br>

</p><p>	1411. Teach your children that which hath been sent down from 
the heaven of majesty and power that they may recite the Tablets of the 
Merciful in the halls of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkars in most melodious tones.
 Verily, he who hath been drawn by the magnet of the love of My Name, 
the Merciful, will recite the verses of God in such wise as to enrapture
 the hearts of those who are fast asleep. Well is it with him who hath 
quaffed the choice wine of immortal life from the utterances of his 
Lord, the Lord of Mercy, through the power of this exalted Name whereby 
every high and lofty mountain hath been reduced to dust.</p>

<p>	From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha</p>
<p>	1412. This wonderful age has rent asunder the veils of superstition and has condemned the prejudice of the people of the East.</p>
<p>	Among some of the nations of the Orient, music and harmony was not 
approved of, but the Manifested Light, Baha'u'llah, in this glorious 
period has revealed in Holy Tablets that singing and music are the 
spiritual food of the hearts and souls. In this dispensation, music is 
one of the arts that is highly approved and is considered to be the 
cause of the exaltation of sad and desponding hearts.</p>
<p>	Therefore ... set to music the verses and the divine words so that 
they may be sung with soul-stirring melody in the Assemblies and 
gatherings, and that the hearts of the listeners may become tumultuous 
and rise towards the Kingdom of Abha in supplication and prayer.</p>

<p>	1413. Thank thou God that thou art instructed in music and melody, 
singing with pleasant voice the glorification and praise of the Eternal,
 the Living. I pray to God that thou mayest employ this talent in prayer
 and supplication, in order that the souls may become quickened, the 
hearts may become attracted and all may become inflamed with the fire of
 the love of God!</p>

</p><p>	1414. ...although sound is but the vibrations of the air which 
affect the tympanum of the ear, and vibrations of the air are but an 
accident among the accidents which depend upon the air, consider how 
much marvelous notes or a charming song influence the spirits! A 
wonderful song giveth wings to the spirit and filleth the heart with 
exaltation....</p>
<p>	("Baha'i World Faith: Selected Writings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 334)</p>
<p>	1415. The utmost joy was attained, for -- praise be to God! -- the 
friends of the Merciful passed some time on that day joyous and singing 
in the land of the Mashrak-el-Azcar and enjoyed commemorating the Lord 
of the verses with the greatest joy.</p>
<p>	I am hopeful that, during the coming Rizwan,[1] a great feast shall 
be held in the land of the Mashrak-el-Azcar, a spiritual celebration 
prepared and the melodies of the violin and the mandolin and hymns in 
praise and glorification of the Lord of Hosts make all the audience 
joyous and ecstatic.<br>

</p><p>	1419. O servant of Baha! Music is regarded as a praiseworthy 
science at the Threshold of the Almighty, so that thou mayest chant 
verses at large gatherings and congregations in a most wondrous melody 
and raise such hymns of praise at the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar to enrapture the
 Concourse on High. By virtue of this, consider how much the art of 
music is admired and praised. Try, if thou canst, to use spiritual 
melodies, songs and tunes, and to bring the earthly music into harmony 
with the celestial melody. Then thou wilt notice what a great influence 
music hath and what heavenly joy and life it conferreth. Strike up such a
 melody and tune as to cause the nightingales of divine mysteries to be 
filled with joy and ecstasy.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	Extracts from the Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha</p>
<p>	1420. What a wonderful meeting this is! These are the children of 
the Kingdom. The song we have just listened to was very beautiful in 
melody and words. The art of music is divine and effective. It is the 
food of the soul and spirit. Through the power and charm of music the 
spirit of man is uplifted. It has wonderful sway and effect in the 
hearts of children, for their hearts are pure, and melodies have great 
influence in them. The latent talents with which the hearts of these 
children are endowed will find expression through the medium of music. 
Therefore, you must exert yourselves to make them proficient; teach them
 to sing with excellence and effect. It is incumbent upon each child to 
know something of music, for without knowledge of this art the melodies 
of instrument and voice cannot be rightly enjoyed. Likewise, it is 
necessary that the schools teach it in order that the souls and hearts 
of the pupils may become vivified and exhilarated and their lives be 
brightened with enjoyment.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912, 
2nd. ed. Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 52)</p>
<p>	1421. Music is one of the important arts. It has a great effect upon
 the human spirit. Musical melodies are a certain something which prove 
to be accidental upon etheric vibrations, for voice is nothing but the 
expression of vibrations, which, reaching the tympanum, affect the 
nerves of hearing. Musical melodies are, therefore, those peculiar 
effects<br>
 produced by, or from, vibration. However, they have the keenest effect 
upon the spirit. In sooth, although music is a material affair, yet its 
tremendous effect is spiritual, and its greatest attachment is to the 
realm of the spirit. If a person desires to deliver a discourse, it will
 prove more effectual after musical melodies. The ancient Greeks, as 
well as Persian philosophers, were in the habit of delivering their 
discourses in the following manner: -- First, playing a few musical 
melodies, and when their audience attained a certain receptivity thereby
 they would leave their instruments at once and begin their discourse. 
Among the most renowned musicians of Persia was one named Barbod, who, 
whenever a great question had been pleaded for at the court of the King,
 and the Ministry had failed to persuade the King, they would at once 
refer the matter to Barbod, whereupon he would go with his instrument to
 the court and play the most appropriate and touching music, the end 
being at once attained, because the King was immediately affected by the
 touching musical melodies, certain feelings of generosity would swell 
up in his heart, and he would give way. You may try this: If you have a 
great desire and wish to attain your end, try to do so on a large 
audience after a great solo has been rendered, but it must be on an 
audience on which music is effective, for there are some people who are 
like stones, and music cannot affect stones.</p>
<p>	Music is an important means to the education and development of 
humanity, but the only true way is through the Teachings of God. Music 
is like this glass, which is perfectly pure and polished. It is 
precisely like this pure chalice before us, and the Teachings of God, 
the utterances of God, are like the water. When the glass or chalice is 
absolutely pure and clear, and the water is perfectly fresh and limpid, 
then it will confer Life; wherefore, the Teachings of God, whether they 
be in the form of anthems or communes or prayers, when they are 
melodiously sung, are most impressive. It was for this reason that His 
Holiness David sang the psalms in the Holy of Holies at Jerusalem with 
sweet melodies. In this Cause the art of music is of paramount 
importance. The Blessed Perfection, when He first came to the barracks 
(Acca) repeated this statement: "If among the immediate followers there 
had been those who could have played some musical instrument, i.e., 
flute or harp, or could have sung, it would have charmed every one." In 
short, musical melodies form an important role<br>
 in the associations, or outward and inward characteristics, or 
qualities of man, for it is the inspirer or motive power of both the 
material and spiritual susceptibilities. What a motive power it is in 
all feelings of love! When man is attached to the Love of God, music has
 a great effect upon him.</p>
<p>	("Table Talk" Acca, July 1909, quoted in "Herald of the South" (January 13, 1933), pp. 2-3)</p>
<p>	1422. Voice is the vibration of the air, and is like the waves of 
the sea. The voice is produced through the instrumentality of the lips, 
throat, teeth, tongue, etc. These cause a wave in the air, and this wave
 reaches the nerve of the ear, which is thereby affected. This is the 
voice.</p>
<p>	There are two kinds of voices. One when the complete instrument is 
perfect, then the emission of sound is perfect. The second is when the 
instrument is imperfect, it affects the voice in such a way that it is 
far from pleasing. What we have just said refers to the voice itself.</p>
<p>	It is natural for the heart and spirit to take pleasure and 
enjoyment in all things that show forth symmetry, harmony, and 
perfection. For instance: a beautiful house, a well designed garden, a 
symmetrical line, a graceful motion, a well written book, pleasing 
garments -- in fact, all things that have in themselves grace or beauty 
are pleasing to the heart and spirit -- therefore, it is most certain 
that a true voice causes deep pleasure.</p>
<p>	What is music? It is a combination of harmonious sounds. What is 
poetry? It is a symmetrical collection of words. Therefore, they are 
pleasing through harmony and rhythm. Poetry is much more effective and 
complete than prose. It stirs more deeply, for it is of a finer 
composition.</p>
<p>	A fine voice when joined to beautiful music causes a great effect, 
for both are desirable and pleasing. All these have in themselves an 
organization, and are constructed on natural law. Therefore, they 
correspond to the order of existence like something which would fit into
 a mold. A true voice fits into the mold of nature. When it is so, this 
affects the nerves, and they affect the heart and spirit.</p>
<p>	In the world of existence physical things have a connection with 
spiritual realities. One of these things is the voice, which connects 
itself<br>
 with the spirit; and the spirit can be uplifted by this means -- for 
though it is a physical thing, it is one of the material, natural 
organizations -- therefore, it is effective.</p>
<p>	All forms when understood aright gladden the spirit. Melodies are 
like water. The voice is like a goblet. The pure water in a pure glass 
is pleasing. Therefore, it is acceptable. But even though the water be 
pure, if it be in a goblet which is not so, this receptacle will make it
 unacceptable. Therefore, a faulty voice even though the music be good, 
is unpleasing. </p>
<p>	In short: melodies, though they are material, are connected with the
 spiritual, therefore, they produce a great effect. A certain kind of 
melody makes the spirit happy, another kind makes it sad, another 
excites it to action.</p>
<p>	All these feelings can be caused by voice and music, for through the
 nerves it moves and stirs the spirit. Even over animals, music has an 
effect. For example: When they wish to take a camel over a desert road, 
they attach to him some bells, or they play upon a flute, and this sound
 prevents him from realizing the fatigue of the journey; his nerves are 
affected, but he does not have an increase of thought, he feels nothing 
but physical sensation.</p>
<p>	Whatever is in the heart of man, melody moves and awakens. If a 
heart full of good feelings and a pure voice are joined together, a 
great effect is produced. For instance: if there be love in the heart, 
through melody, it will increase until its intensity can scarcely be 
borne; but if bad thoughts are in the heart, such as hatred, it will 
increase and multiply. For instance: the music used in war awakens the 
desire for bloodshed. The meaning is that melody causes whatever feeling
 is in the heart to increase.</p>
<p>	Some feelings occur accidentally and some have a foundation. For 
example: some people are naturally kind, but they may be accidentally 
upset by a wave of anger. But if they hear music, the true nature will 
reassert itself. Music really awakens the real, natural nature, the 
individual essence.</p>
<p>	With whatever purpose you listen to music, that purpose will be 
increased. For instance: there will be a concert given for the poor and 
unfortunate, and if you go there thinking of the aim, the music will 
increase your compassion and generosity. This is the reason why music is<br>
 used in war. And so it is with all the things that cause the excitation of the nerves.<br>
	('Abdu'l-Baha's words to Mrs. Mary L. Lucas, as quoted in "A Brief 
Account of My Visit to Acca" (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Society, 1905),
 pp. 11-14)</p>
<p>	From Letters Written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	1423. With regard to singing some of the hymns written by Mrs...., 
he thinks that it would be a splendid idea and when Mrs. Lua Getsinger 
was living with the Master's family, she often sang them and tried to 
teach them to the small children in the family.</p>
<p>	(22 March 1928 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1424. He thinks that it would especially be beautiful to see little children singing them in groups.... </p>
<p>	(22 March 1928 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1425. The Guardian values the hymns that you are so beautifully 
composing. They certainly contain the realities of the Faith, and will 
indeed help you to give the Message to the young ones. It is the music 
which assists us to affect the human spirit; it is an important means 
which helps us to communicate with the soul. The Guardian hopes that 
through this assistance you will give the Message to the people, and 
will attract their hearts.</p>
<p>	(15 November 1932 to an individual believer, cited in "Baha'i News" 71 (February 1933), p. 2)</p>
<p>	1426. In regard to the main question you have raised in connection 
with the singing of hymns at Baha'i meetings: He wishes me to assure you
 that he sees no objection to it whatsoever. The element of music is, no
 doubt, an important feature of all Baha'i gatherings. The Master 
Himself has emphasized its importance. But the friends should in this, 
as well as in all other things, not pass beyond the limits of 
moderation, and should take great care to maintain the strict spiritual 
character of all their gatherings. Music should lead to spirituality, 
and provided it creates such an atmosphere there can be no objection 
against it.<br>

    A distinction of vital importance should, however, be<br>
clearly established between the singing of hymns composed by<br>
the believers and the chanting of the Holy Utterances.<br>
(17 March 1935 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1427. With regard to your question concerning the use of music in 
the Nineteen Day Feasts, he wishes you to assure all the friends that he
 not only approves of such a practice, but thinks it even advisable that
 the believers should make use, in their meetings, of hymns composed by 
Baha'is themselves, and also of such hymns, poems and chants as are 
based on the Holy Words.</p>
<p>	(7 April 1935 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1428. Although now is only the very beginning of Baha'i art, yet the
 friends who feel they are gifted in such matters should endeavour to 
develop and cultivate their gifts and through their works to reflect, 
however inadequately, the Divine Spirit which Baha'u'llah has breathed 
into the world.</p>
<p>	(4 November 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1429. Music, as one of the arts, is a natural cultural development, 
and the Guardian does not feel that there should be any cultivation of 
"Baha'i Music" any more than we are trying to develop a Baha'i school of
 painting or writing. The believers are free to paint, write and compose
 as their talents guide them. If music is written, incorporating the 
sacred writings, the friends are free to make use of it, but it should 
never be considered a requirement at Baha'i meetings to have such music.
 The further away the friends keep from any set forms, the better, for 
they must realize that the Cause is absolutely universal, and what might
 seem a beautiful addition to their mode of celebrating a Feast, etc., 
would perhaps fall on the ears of people of another country as 
unpleasant sounds -- and vice versa. As long as they have music for its 
own sake it is all right, but they should not consider it Baha'i music.</p>
<p>	(20 July 1946 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	1430. Instrumental music may be used at the Baha'i Feasts.<br>

</p><p>	(20 August 1956 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1431. As regards producing a book of Baha'i songs, your 
understanding that there is no cultural expression which could be called
 Baha'i at this time (distinctive music, literature, art, architecture, 
etc., being the flower of the civilization and not coming at the 
beginning of a new Revelation), is correct. However, that does not mean 
that we haven't Baha'i songs, in other words, songs written by Baha'is 
on Baha'i subjects....</p>
<p>	(21 September 1957 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	1432. You should try and work out the questions about songs with the
 Reviewing Committee or the National Spiritual Assembly. A Baha'i can 
write songs, mentioning the Faith. This is not "Baha'i Music", but music
 in which the Faith is mentioned. This is probably what the National 
Spiritual Assembly meant.</p>

<p>	I. Membership, Authority and Role</p>
<p>	1433. Regarding the establishment of "National Assemblies", it is of
 vital importance that in every country, where the conditions are 
favourable and the number of the friends has grown and reached a 
considerable size, such as America, Great Britain and Germany, that a 
"National Spiritual Assembly" be immediately established, representative
 of the friends throughout that country.</p>
<p>	Its immediate purpose is to stimulate, unify and co-ordinate, by 
frequent personal consultations, the manifold activities of the friends 
as well as the local Assemblies; and by keeping in close and constant 
touch with the Holy Land, initiate measures, and direct in general the 
affairs of the Cause in that country. It serves also another purpose, no
 less essential than the first, as in the course of time it shall evolve
 into the National House of Justice (referred to in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Will 
as the "secondary House of Justice"), which according to the explicit 
text of the Testament will have, in conjunction with the other National 
Assemblies throughout the Baha'i world, to elect directly the members of
 the International House of Justice, that Supreme Council that will 
guide, organize and unify the affairs of the Movement throughout the 
world.</p>
<p>	It is expressly recorded in 'Abdu'l-Baha's Writings that these 
National Assemblies must be indirectly elected by the friends; that is, 
the friends in every country must elect a certain number of delegates, 
who in their turn will elect from among all the friends in that country 
the members of the National Spiritual Assembly....</p>
<p>	This National Spiritual Assembly, which pending the establishment of
 the Universal House of Justice will have to be re-elected once a year, 
obviously assumes grave responsibilities, for it has to exercise full 
authority over all the local Assemblies in its province, and will have 
to direct the activities of the friends, guard vigilantly the Cause of 
God, and control and supervise the affairs of the Movement in general.</p>
<p>	With it too rests the decision whether a certain point at issue is 
strictly local in its nature, and should be reserved for the 
consideration and decision of the local Assembly, or whether it should 
fall under its own province and be regarded as a matter which ought to 
receive its special attention. The National Spiritual Assembly will also
 decide upon such<br>
 matters which in its opinion should be referred to the Holy Land for consultation and decision.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 March 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
National Spiritual Assemblies of the Baha'is of America, Australasia, 
France, Germany, British Isles, Italy, Japan and Switzerland, published 
in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932" [rev. ed.], 
(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), pp. 39-41)</p>
<p>	1434. It is, I firmly believe, of the utmost urgent importance that,
 with unity of purpose and action firmly established in our midst, and 
with every trace of the animosity and mistrust of the past banished from
 our hearts, we should form one united front, and combat, wisely and 
tactfully, every force that might darken the spirit of the Movement, 
cause division in its ranks, and narrow it by dogmatic and sectarian 
belief.</p>
<p>	It is primarily upon the elected members of the National Spiritual 
Assemblies throughout the Baha'i world that this highly important duty 
devolves, as in their hands the direction and management of all 
spiritual Baha'i activities have been placed and centralized, and as 
they constitute in the eyes of the people of their country the supreme 
body in that land that officially represents, promotes and safeguards 
the various interests of the Cause. It is my fervent prayer and my most 
cherished desire that the unfailing guidance of Baha'u'llah and the 
blessings of our beloved Master will enable them to set a high and true 
example to all other Baha'i institutions and Local Assemblies, and will 
show them what absolute harmony, mature deliberation and whole-hearted 
co-operation can achieve. Should such a representative and responsible 
body fail to realize this fundamental requisite for all successful 
achievement, the whole structure is sure to crumble, and the Great Plan 
of the Future, as unfolded by the Master's Will and Testament, will be 
rudely disturbed and grievously delayed.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 9 April 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, published 
in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932" pp. 45-46)</p>
<p>	1435. Regarding the method to be adopted for the election of the 
National Spiritual Assemblies, it is clear that the text of the 
Beloved's Testament<br>
 gives us no indication as to the manner in which these Assemblies are 
to be elected. In one of His earliest Tablets, however, addressed to a 
friend in Persia, the following is expressly recorded:</p>
<p>	"At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country appoint 
their delegates, and these in turn elect their representatives, and 
these representatives elect a body, that body shall be regarded as the 
Supreme Baytu'l-'Adl (Universal House of Justice)". These words clearly 
indicate that a three-stage election has been provided by 'Abdu'l-Baha 
for the formation of the International House of Justice, and as it is 
explicitly provided in His Will and Testament that the "Secondary Houses
 of Justice (i.e. National Assemblies) must elect the members the 
Universal One", it is obvious that the members of the National Spiritual
 Assemblies will have to be indirectly elected by the body of the 
believers in their respective provinces....</p>
<p>	Should the appointing of the delegates be made a part of the 
functions of Local Spiritual Assemblies, who are already elected bodies,
 the principle of a four-stage election would be introduced, which would
 be at variance with the provisions explicitly laid down in the Master's
 Tablet. On the other hand, were the Local Spiritual Assemblies, the 
number of whose members is strictly confined to nine, to elect directly 
the members of the National Spiritual Assembly -- thus maintaining the 
principle of a three-stage election -- all Baha'i localities, which must
 necessarily differ in numerical strength, would then have to share 
equally in the election of the National Spiritual Assembly -- a practice
 which would be contrary to fairness and justice. Moreover, the central 
principle guiding for the present the administration of the Cause has 
been to make the Baha'i National Spiritual Assemblies as independent as 
possible in the conduct of such affairs as fall within their province, 
and to lessen the hampering influence of any institution within their 
jurisdiction that might, whether directly or indirectly, impair their 
authority and prestige.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 May 1925 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, published 
in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", pp. 84-85)</p>
<p>	1436. High aims and pure motives, however laudable in themselves, 
will surely not suffice if unsupported by measures that are practicable 
and methods that are sound. Wealth of sentiment, abundance of goodwill 
and<br>
 effort, will prove of little avail if we should fail to exercise 
discrimination and restraint and neglect to direct their flow along the 
most profitable channels. The unfettered freedom of the individual 
should be tempered with mutual consultation and sacrifice, and the 
spirit of initiative and enterprise should be reinforced by a deeper 
realization of the supreme necessity for concerted action and a fuller 
devotion to the common weal.</p>
<p>	It would be impossible at this stage to ignore the indispensability 
or to overestimate the unique significance of the institution of the 
National Spiritual Assembly -- the pivot round which revolve the 
activities of the believers throughout the American continent. Supreme 
is their position, grave their responsibilities, manifold and arduous 
their duties. How great the privilege, how delicate the task of the 
assembled delegates whose function it is to elect such national 
representatives as would by their record of service ennoble and enrich 
the annals of the Cause! If we but turn our gaze to the high 
qualifications of the members of Baha'i Assemblies, as enumerated in 
'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets, we are filled with feelings of unworthiness and 
dismay, and would feel truly disheartened but for the comforting thought
 that if we rise to play nobly our part every deficiency in our lives 
will be more than compensated by the all-conquering spirit of His grace 
and power. Hence it is incumbent upon the chosen delegates to consider 
without the least trace of passion and prejudice, and irrespective of 
any material consideration, the names of only those who can best combine
 the necessary qualities of unquestioned loyalty, of selfless devotion, 
of a well-trained mind, of recognized ability and mature experience. May
 the incoming National Spiritual Assembly -- the privileged and chosen 
servants of the Cause -- immortalize their term of stewardship by deeds 
of loving service, deeds that will redound to the honour, the glory and 
the power of the Most Great Name.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 3 June 1925 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
delegates and visitors at the Convention of the National Spiritual 
Assembly of the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i 
Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932" pp. 87-88)</p>
<p>	1437. The administrative machinery of the Cause having now 
sufficiently evolved, its aim and object fairly well grasped and 
understood, and its method and working made more familiar to every 
believer, I feel the time is ripe when it should be fully and 
consciously utilized to further the<br>
 purpose for which it has been created. It should, I strongly feel, be 
made to serve a twofold purpose. On one hand, it should aim at a steady 
and gradual expansion of the Movement along lines that are at once 
broad, sound and universal; and on the other, it should ensure the 
internal consolidation of the work already achieved. It should both 
provide the impulse whereby the dynamic forces latent in the Faith can 
unfold, crystallize, and shape the lives and conduct of men, and serve 
as a medium for the interchange of thought and the co-ordination of 
activities among the divers elements that constitute the Baha'i 
community.</p>
<p>	Such in their broad outline are the guiding principles which those 
who have been placed in charge of the administration of the affairs of 
the Cause should at present endeavour to promote, explain and securely 
establish. Nothing short of the spirit of unwavering faith, of 
continuous vigilance and patient endeavour can hope to secure eventually
 the realization of this our cherished desire.</p>
<p>	May America's national representatives arise with clear vision, with
 unswerving determination and renewed vigour to carry out in its 
entirety the sacred task they have purposed to perform.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 May 1926 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, published 
in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", pp. 109-110)</p>
<p>	1438. Now that the N.S.A. has been properly constituted and its 
officers duly appointed, it is incumbent upon each and all to introduce 
and promote such measures as will consolidate the work that you have so 
well begun. The institution of the National Fund, a Baha'i Bulletin 
similar to the News Letter issued by the American N.S.A., a vigorous and
 well-conceived campaign of Teaching, a continuous and purposeful 
endeavour to co-ordinate the activities of the Local Assemblies and 
groups throughout India and Burma and the sending of detailed and 
frequent reports to the Holy Land are among the most primary and urgent 
requirements of the new day that has dawned upon India. I eagerly await 
your reports and assure you of my continued prayers for the success of 
your arduous labours.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 28
 October 1926 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly 
of India and<br>
 Burma, published in "Dawn of a New Day" (New Delhi: Baha'i Publishing Trust, n.d. [1970]), pp. 1415)</p>
<p>	1439. I wish to reaffirm, in clear and categorical language, the 
principle already enunciated upholding the supreme authority of the 
National Assembly in all matters that affect the interests of the Faith 
in that land. There can be no conflict of authority, no duality under 
any form or circumstances in any sphere of Baha'i jurisdiction whether 
local, national or international. The National Assembly, however, 
although the sole interpreter of its Declaration of Trust and by-laws, 
is directly and morally responsible if it allows any body or institution
 within its jurisdiction to abuse its privileges or to decline in the 
exercise of its rights and prerogatives. It is the trusted guardian and 
the mainspring of the manifold activities and interests of every 
national community in the Baha'i world. It constitutes the sole link 
that binds these communities to the International House of Justice -- 
the supreme administrative body in the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(In the hand writing of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 
11 June 1934 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of
 the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	1440. ...the Guardian was very pleased to learn of the progress made
 by the Indian National Spiritual Assembly in its efforts to 
consolidate, widen and maintain the scope of its national activities. 
The difficulties in your way are tremendous. The differences of language
 and of social and intellectual background do, undoubtedly, render the 
work somewhat difficult to carry out and may temporarily check the 
efficient and smooth working of the national administrative machinery of
 the Faith. They, nevertheless, impart to the deliberations of the 
National Assembly a universality which they would be otherwise lacking, 
and give to its members a breadth of view which is their duty to 
cultivate and foster. It is not uniformity which we should seek in the 
formation of any National or Local Assembly. For the bedrock of the 
Baha'i administrative order is the principle of unity in diversity, 
which has been so strongly and so repeatedly emphasized in the writings 
of the Cause. Differences which are not fundamental and contrary to the 
basic teachings of the Cause should be maintained, while the underlying 
unity of the administrative<br>
 order should be at any cost preserved and ensured. Unity, both of 
purpose and of means, is, indeed, indispensable to the safe and speedy 
working of every Assembly, whether local or national.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 2 January 1934 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma, published
 in "Dawn of a New Day" pp. 47-48)</p>
<p>	1441. With regard to your question concerning the right of a member 
of the National Spiritual Assembly to disclose to that body any facts 
which he possesses as a member of a Local Spiritual Assembly, the 
Guardian thinks that the adequate presentation of all such facts is not 
only the right but the duty of every member of the National Spiritual 
Assembly. It is, indeed, the responsibility of every conscientious and 
loyal believer who has the privilege of being a member of the National 
Spiritual Assembly to provide for the general information of his 
co-workers in that body, all the facts which the latter requires for the
 study and settlement of the cases under its consideration.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 January 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1442. The formation of every new National Assembly must, indeed, be 
viewed as a step forward in the evolution of the Administration of the 
Faith. And not until a sufficient number of such National Assemblies has
 been duly constituted can there be any hope for the future expansion of
 the Cause.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 March 1934 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 91 (April 
1935), p. 15)</p>
<p>	1443. With regard to your question as to the advisability of 
disclosing to an individual believer the contents of the National 
Spiritual Assembly's correspondence: The Guardian thinks that although 
this cannot be considered as constituting an obligation which a believer
 can impose upon the national body, yet it would seem highly advisable 
that the National Spiritual Assembly should give a sympathetic 
consideration to any such request made to it by a believer. This, he 
feels, would avoid giving the impression that the Assembly is working in
 an atmosphere of complete secrecy, and that it is motivated by 
dictatorial motives. The final<br>
 decision in such matters, however, is entirely left to the discretion 
of the National Spiritual Assembly. The basic principle that should 
always be remembered is that the National Spiritual Assembly cannot be 
required to reveal to any outsider all the details concerning its work. 
It may choose to do so if it wishes, but nobody has the right to enforce
 upon it any such action. This is, of course, the purely legal side of 
the question. But a purely legalistic attitude in matters affecting the 
Cause, particularly now that the Faith is still in a state of infancy, 
is not only inadequate but fraught with unforeseen dangers and 
difficulties. The individuals and Assemblies must learn to co-operate 
and to co-operate intelligently, if they desire to adequately discharge 
their duties and obligations towards the Faith. And no such co-operation
 is possible without mutual confidence and trust.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 June 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand,
 published in "Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand, 
1923-1957" (Sydney: National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of 
Australia, 1970), p. 9)</p>
<p>	1444. ...Shoghi Effendi wishes to urge once more your Assembly to 
give careful and sympathetic consideration to this case, which has 
already engaged their attention for several months. The situation must 
be carefully studied, and all its aspects thoroughly investigated, and a
 decision should be reached and fearlessly and immediately carried out. 
Too much delay does not only harm the interests of the petitioner but 
will, in addition, have the effect of detracting from the authority and 
prestige of your Assembly.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 August 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1445. The evolution of the Plan imposes a threefold obligation, 
which all individual believers, all Local Assemblies, as well as the 
National Assembly itself, must respectively recognize and 
conscientiously fulfil. Each and every believer, undaunted by the 
uncertainties, the perils and the financial stringency afflicting the 
nation, must arise and ensure, to the full measure of his or her 
capacity, that continuous and abundant flow of funds into the national 
Treasury, on which the successful prosecution of the Plan must chiefly 
depend. Upon the Local Assemblies, whose special function and high 
privilege is to facilitate the admission of new believers<br>
 into the community, and thereby stimulate the infusion of fresh blood 
into its organic institutions, a duty no less binding in character 
devolves. To them I wish particularly to appeal, at this present hour, 
when the call of God is being raised throughout the length and breadth 
of both continents in the New World, to desist from insisting too 
rigidly on the minor observances and beliefs, which might prove a 
stumbling-block in the way of any sincere applicant, whose eager desire 
is to enlist under the banner of Baha'u'llah. While conscientiously 
adhering to the fundamental qualifications already laid down, the 
members of each and every Assembly should endeavour, by their patience, 
their love, their tact and wisdom, to nurse, subsequent to his 
admission, the newcomer into Baha'i maturity, and win him over gradually
 to the unreserved acceptance of whatever has been ordained in the 
teachings. As to the National Assembly, whose inescapable responsibility
 is to guard the integrity, co-ordinate the activities, and stimulate 
the life, of the entire community, its chief concern, at the present 
moment, should be to anxiously deliberate as how best to enable both 
individual believers and Local Assemblies to fulfil their respective 
tasks. Through their repeated appeals, through their readiness to dispel
 all misunderstandings and remove all obstacles, through the example of 
their lives, their unrelaxing vigilance, their high sense of justice, 
their humility, consecration and courage, they must demonstrate to those
 whom they represent their capacity to play their part in the progress 
of the Plan in which they, no less than the rest of the community, are 
involved. May the all-conquering Spirit of Baha'u'llah be so infused 
into each component part of this harmoniously functioning System as to 
enable it to contribute its proper share to the consummation of the 
Plan.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 30
 January 1938 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the United States and Canada, published in "Messages to America: 
Selected Letters and Cablegrams Addressed to the Baha'is of North 
America 1932-1946" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1947), pp. 
11-12)</p>
<p>	1446. Such a rectitude of conduct[1] must manifest itself, with 
ever-increasing potency, in every verdict which the elected 
representatives of the Baha'i<br>
 community, in whatever capacity they may find themselves, may be called
 upon to pronounce....It must be exemplified in the conduct of all 
Baha'i electors, when exercising their sacred rights and functions.... 
It must constitute the brightest ornament of the life, the pursuits, the
 exertions, and the utterances of every Baha'i teacher, whether laboring
 at home or abroad, whether in the front ranks of the teaching force, or
 occupying a less active and responsible position. It must be made the 
hallmark of that numerically small, yet intensely dynamic and highly 
responsible body of the elected national representatives of every Baha'i
 community, which constitutes the sustaining pillar, and the sole 
instrument for the election, in every community, of that Universal House
 whose very name and title, as ordained by Baha'u'llah, symbolizes that 
rectitude of conduct which is its highest mission to safeguard and 
enforce.<br>
 [1 ...with its implications of justice, equity, truthfulness, honesty, 
fair-mindedness, reliability and trustworthiness... (see "The Advent of 
Divine Justice", p. 23)]</p>
<p>	So great and transcendental is this principle of Divine justice, a 
principle that must be regarded as the crowning distinction of all Local
 and National Assemblies, in their capacity as forerunners of the 
Universal House of Justice, that Baha'u'llah Himself subordinates His 
personal inclination and wish to the all-compelling force of its demands
 and implications. "God is My witness!" He thus explains, "were it not 
contrary to the Law of God, I would have kissed the hand of My would-be 
murderer, and would cause him to inherit My earthly goods. I am 
restrained, however, by the binding Law laid down in the Book, and am 
Myself bereft of all worldly possessions.""Know thou, of a truth," He 
significantly affirms, "these great oppressions that have befallen the 
world are preparing it for the advent of the Most Great Justice." "Say,"
 He again asserts, "he hath appeared with that Justice wherewith mankind
 hath been adorned, and yet the people are, for the most part, asleep." 
"The light of men is Justice, "He moreover states, "(Quench it not with 
the contrary winds of oppression and tyranny. The purpose of justice is 
the appearance of unity among men." "No radiance," He declares, "can 
compare with that of justice. The organization of the world and the 
tranquility of mankind depend upon it." "O people of God!" He exclaims, 
"That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is upheld by two 
pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are the sources of 
life to the world.... Small wonder, therefore, that the Author of the 
Baha'i Revelation should have chosen to associate the name and title of 
that House, which is to be the crowning glory of His administrative 
institutions, not with<br>
 forgiveness but with justice, to have made justice the only basis and 
the permanent foundation of His Most Great Peace, and to have proclaimed
 it in His Hidden Words as "the (best beloved of all things" in His 
sight.</p>
<p>	("The Advent of Divine Justice" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), pp. 26-29)</p>
<p>	1447. In countries where the local Baha'i communities had 
sufficiently advanced in number and in influence measures were taken for
 the initiation of National Assemblies, the pivots round which all 
national undertakings must revolve. Designated by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His 
Will as the "(Secondary Houses of Justice," they constitute the 
electoral bodies in the formation of the International House of Justice,
 and are empowered to direct, unify, coordinate and stimulate the 
activities of individuals as well as local Assemblies within their 
jurisdiction. Resting on the broad base of organized local communities, 
themselves pillars sustaining the institution which must be regarded as 
the apex of the Baha'i Administrative Order, these Assemblies are 
elected, according to the principle of proportional representation, by 
delegates representative of Baha'i local communities assembled at 
Convention during the period of the Ridvan Festival; are possessed of 
the necessary authority to enable them to insure the harmonious and 
efficient development of Baha'i activity within their respective 
spheres; are freed from all direct responsibility for their policies and
 decisions to their electorates; are charged with the sacred duty of 
consulting the views, of inviting the recommendations and of securing 
the confidence and cooperation of the delegates and of acquainting them 
with their plans, problems and actions; and are supported by the 
resources of national funds to which all ranks of the faithful are urged
 to contribute....</p>

<p>	1448. Now that you have been elected to the National Spiritual 
Assembly he feels that this offers you your greatest field of service at
 the present time. Every other work for the Cause should be subordinated
 to this, and you should conserve your strength for this work -- if you 
feel you have not enough to go around to all the other tasks as well! 
Your long and devoted services to the Cause have all been a training and
 preparation<br>
 for wider activities, and this election to the N.S.A. itself is a preparation, he hopes, for still greater work in the future.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 July 1944 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1449. He was very happy to see that changes had been made in the 
membership of the National Spiritual Assembly this year, not from any 
reasons of personality, but because change itself is good and brings a 
fresh outlook into the discussions of any Assembly. He was also pleased 
to see that these changes involved more younger people being on the 
National Spiritual Assembly; with the tremendous amount of work which 
this second Seven Year Plan is going to involve, this will be a great 
help to the older members of that body.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 May 1946 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1450. We should respect the National Spiritual Assembly and the 
Local Spiritual Assembly because they are institutions founded by 
Baha'u'llah. It has nothing to do with personality, but is far above it.
 It will be a great day when the friends, on and off the Assemblies, 
come to fully grasp the fact that it is not the individuals on an 
Assembly which is important, but the Assembly as an institution.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 7 July 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1451. The Guardian regrets that, in the light of the Master's 
statement that the deliberations of Assemblies must be secret and 
confidential, it is not possible to have a non-Assembly member in the 
National Spiritual Assembly meeting. You must always remember that, in 
matters of principle, there can be no deviation; in America it may be 
possible for you to find a wholly trustworthy believer; but if your 
Assembly is permitted to have non-Assembly secretaries present, then the
 same privilege must be accorded oriental and Latin American Assemblies;
 and can these other countries be assured of finding people of the 
calibre you have found? Highly personal subjects, damaging to the honour
 and happiness of others, are often taken up by National Assemblies, and
 the danger that confidence will be betrayed is already great enough 
with the 9 chosen<br>
 representatives of the whole Community, let alone introducing 
non-Assembly members. You will just have to make your minutes a little 
more compact and sacrifice, if necessary, a certain amount of efficiency
 in order to follow this very important principle.</p>

</p><p>	II. Relation to Convention</p>
<p>	1453. Hitherto the National Convention has been primarily called 
together for the consideration of the various circumstances attending 
the election of the National Spiritual Assembly. I feel, however, that 
in view of the expansion and the growing importance of the 
administrative sphere of the Cause, the general sentiments and 
tendencies prevailing among the friends, and the signs of increasing 
interdependence among the National Spiritual Assemblies throughout the 
world, the assembled accredited representatives of the American 
believers should exercise not only the vital and responsible right of 
electing the National Assembly, but should also fulfil the functions of 
an enlightened, consultative and co-operative body that will enrich the 
experience, enhance the prestige, support the authority, and assist the 
deliberations of the National Spiritual Assembly. It is my firm 
conviction that it is the bounden duty, in the interests of the Cause we
 all love and serve, of the members of the incoming National Assembly, 
once elected by the delegates at Convention time, to seek and have the 
utmost regard, individually as well as collectively, for the advice, the
 considered opinion and the true sentiments of the assembled delegates. 
Banishing every vestige of secrecy, of undue reticence, of dictatorial 
aloofness, from their midst, they should radiantly and abundantly unfold
 to the eyes of the delegates, by whom they are elected, their plans, 
their hopes, and their cares. They should familiarize the delegates with
 the various matters that will have to be considered in the current 
year, and calmly and conscientiously study and weigh the opinions and 
judgments of the delegates. The newly elected National Assembly, during 
the few days when the Convention is in session and after the dispersal 
of the delegates, should seek ways and means to cultivate understanding,
 facilitate and maintain the exchange of views, deepen confidence, and 
vindicate by every tangible evidence their one desire to serve and 
advance the common weal. Not infrequently, nay oftentimes, the most 
lowly, untutored, and inexperienced among the friends will, by the sheer
 inspiring force of selfless and ardent devotion, contribute a distinct 
and be the regard paid by those whom the delegates call upon to serve in
 high position to this all-important though inconspicuous manifestation 
of the revealing power of sincere and earnest devotion.<br>

</p><p>	The National Spiritual Assembly, however, in view of the 
unavoidable limitations imposed upon the convening of frequent and 
long-standing sessions of the Convention, will have to retain in its 
hands the final decision on all matters that affect the interests of the
 Cause in America, such as the right to decide whether any Local 
Assembly is functioning in accordance with the principles laid down for 
the conduct and the advancement of the Cause. It is my earnest prayer 
that they will utilize their highly responsible position, not only for 
the wise and efficient conduct of the affairs of the Cause, but also for
 the extension and deepening of the spirit of cordiality and 
whole-hearted and mutual support in their co-operation with the body of 
their co-workers throughout the land. The seating of delegates to the 
Convention, i.e. the right to decide upon the validity of the 
credentials of the delegates at a given Convention is vested in the 
outgoing National Assembly, and the right to decide who has the voting 
privilege is also ultimately placed in the hands of the National 
Spiritual Assembly, either when a Local Spiritual Assembly is for the 
first time being formed in a given locality or when differences arise 
between a new applicant and an already established Local Assembly. While
 the Convention is in session and the accredited delegates have already 
elected from among the believers throughout the country the members of 
the National Spiritual Assembly for the current year, it is of infinite 
value and a supreme necessity that as far as possible all matters 
requiring immediate decision should be fully and publicly considered, 
and an endeavour be made to obtain after mature deliberation unanimity 
in vital decisions. Indeed it has ever been the cherished desire of our 
Master 'Abdu'l-Baha that the friends in their councils, local as well as
 national, should by their candour, their honesty of purpose, their 
singleness of mind, and the thoroughness of their discussions achieve 
unanimity in all things. Should this in certain cases prove 
impracticable the verdict of the majority should prevail, to which 
decision the minority must under all circumstances gladly, spontaneously
 and continually submit. </p>
<p>	Nothing short of the all-encompassing, all-pervading power of His 
Guidance and Love can enable this newly-enfolded order to gather 
strength and flourish amid the storm and stress of a turbulent age, and 
in the fullness of time vindicate its high claim to be universally 
recognized as the one Haven of abiding felicity and peace.<br>

</p><p>	(From a letter dated 29 January 1925 written by Shoghi Effendi 
to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, 
published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", pp. 
78-80)</p>
<p>	1454. In connection with the annual holding of the Baha'i Convention
 and Congress, I feel that although such a representative body need not 
be convened necessarily every year, yet it is highly desirable, in view 
of the unique functions it fulfils in promoting harmony and goodwill, in
 removing misunderstandings and in enhancing the prestige of the Cause, 
that the National Spiritual Assembly should exert itself to gather 
together annually the elected representatives of the American believers.
 It would in some ways be obviously convenient and eminently desirable, 
though not absolutely essential, if the National Spiritual Assembly 
could arrange that the holding of such a Congress should synchronize 
with the time at which the national elections are renewed, and that both
 events should take place, if not on the first of Ridvan, at least 
during the twelve joyous days of what may be justly regarded as the 
foremost Baha'i Festival. Apart from the local elections, which 
universally are to be renewed on the 21st of April, it is entirely left 
to the discretion of the National Spiritual Assembly to decide, after 
having given due consideration to the above-mentioned observations, on 
whatever time and place the Baha'i Convention as well as the annual 
elections are to be held. Were the National Spiritual Assembly to decide
 after mature deliberation to omit the holding of the Baha'i Convention 
and Congress in a given year, then they could, only in such a case, 
devise ways and means to ensure that the annual election of the National
 Spiritual Assembly should be held by mail, provided it can be conducted
 with sufficient thoroughness, efficiency and dispatch. It would also 
appear to me unobjectionable to enable and even to require in the last 
resort such delegates as cannot possibly undertake the journey to the 
seat of the Baha'i Convention to send their votes, for the election of 
the National Spiritual Assembly only, by mail to the National Secretary,
 as in my view the advantages of such a procedure outweigh the 
considerations referred to in your letter. It should however be made 
clear to every elected delegate -- who should be continually reminded --
 that it is a sacred responsibility and admittedly preferable to attend 
if possible in person the sessions of the Convention, to take an active 
part in all its proceedings, and to acquaint his fellow-workers on his<br>
 return with the accomplishments, the decisions, and the aspirations of the assembled representatives of the American believers.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 24 October 1925 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, 
published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", pp. 
91-92)</p>
<p>	1455. The Guardian wishes the National Spiritual Assembly to remind,
 and make it quite clear to, the believers in that land that the supreme
 body in the United States and Canada, whose privilege and function is 
to lay down, amend and abrogate the administrative principles of the 
Faith with the approval of the Guardian, is not the Convention, however 
representative it may be, but the National Spiritual Assembly. On the 
other hand, it is the sacred obligation and the primary function of the 
National Assembly not to restrict, under any circumstances, the freedom 
of the assembled delegates, whose twofold function is to elect their 
national representatives and to submit to them any recommendations they 
may feel inclined to make. The function of the Convention is purely 
advisory and though the advice it gives is not binding in its effects on
 those on whom rests the final decision in purely administrative 
matters, yet, the utmost caution and care should be exercised lest 
anything should hamper the delegates in the full and free exercise of 
their functions. In discharging this sacred function no influence 
whatever, no pressure from any quarter, even though it be from the 
National Assembly, should under any circumstances affect their views or 
restrict their freedom. The delegates must be wholly independent of any 
administrative agency, must approach their task with absolute detachment
 and must concentrate their attention on the most important and pressing
 issues.</p>
<p>	The Guardian believes that the right to elect the Chairman and the 
Secretary of the Convention should be vested in the assembled delegates,
 lest any objection be raised that the members of the outgoing National 
Assembly are seeking to direct the course of the discussions in a manner
 that would be conducive to their own personal interests. The National 
Assembly, however, must at all times vigilantly uphold, defend, justify 
and enforce the provisions of the Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, 
which are binding on the Convention no less than on themselves. The 
National Spiritual Assembly has the right to lay down, enforce and 
interpret the National Constitution of the Baha'is in that land. It 
cannot, if it wishes to<br>
 remain faithful to that Constitution, lay down any regulations, however
 secondary in character, that would in the least hamper the unrestricted
 liberty of the delegates to advise and elect those whom they feel best 
combine the necessary qualifications for membership of so exalted a 
body.</p>
<p>	Non-delegates, however, according to the Guardian's considered 
opinion, should not be given the right to intervene directly during the 
sessions of the Convention. Only through an accredited delegate should 
they be given indirectly the chance to voice their sentiments and to 
participate in the deliberations of the Convention. Much confusion and 
complications must inevitably result, in the days to come, if such a 
restriction be not imposed on a gathering which is primarily intended 
for the accredited delegates of the Baha'i communities. Bearing this 
restriction in mind, it is the duty of the National Spiritual Assembly 
to devise ways and means which would enable them to obtain valuable 
suggestions, not only from the total number of the elected delegates, 
but from as large a body of their fellow-workers as is humanly possible.
 </p>
<p>	Shoghi Effendi has not departed from any established administrative 
principle. He feels he has neither curtailed the legitimate authority of
 the National Spiritual Assembly, nor invested the Convention with undue
 powers enabling it to rival or supersede those whom it has to elect. 
What the Guardian is aiming at is to remind the friends, more fully than
 before, of the two cardinal principles of Baha'i Administration, 
namely, the supreme and unchallengeable authority of the National 
Spiritual Assembly in national affairs and working within the limits 
imposed by the Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, and the untrammelled 
freedom of the Convention delegates to advise, deliberate on the 
actions, and appoint the successors of their National Assembly. The 
Guardian is confident that you will elucidate and give the widest 
publicity to these already established principles, upon which the 
progress, the unity and welfare of Baha'i administrative institutions 
must ultimately depend.</p>
<p>	[Postscript in the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi:]</p>
<p>	The utmost care and vigilance should be exercised lest any fresh 
misunderstandings arise regarding these fundamental issues. The root 
principle of Baha'i Administration is unreservedly maintained. No 
departure from its established tenets is contemplated. The undisputed 
authority of America's supreme Baha'i Administrative Body has been<br>
 reaffirmed, while, on the other hand, the untrammelled freedom of 
individual believers and delegates to exercise their functions has been 
once again reaffirmed and strengthened. On the continuous and harmonious
 co-operation of the two leading Baha'i institutions in America the 
growth and success of the Administration bequeathed by 'Abdu'l-Baha must
 ultimately depend. May next year's Convention witness the triumph of 
these basic principles.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 August 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada)</p>
<p>	1456. Concerning the status, rights and prerogatives of the Annual 
Baha'i Convention, the Guardian wishes to make it quite clear to all the
 believers that this annual meeting of the delegates is by no means a 
continuous consultative body all through the year; that its twofold 
function of electing the body of the National Spiritual Assembly, and of
 offering any constructive suggestions in regard to the general 
administration of the Cause is limited to a definite period; and that 
consequently the opinion current among some of the believers that the 
delegates are to serve as a consultative body throughout the year is at 
variance with the fundamental, though as yet unspecified, principles 
underlying the Administration. Shoghi Effendi firmly believes that 
consultation must be maintained between the National Spiritual Assembly 
and the entire body of the believers, and that such a consultation, when
 the Convention is not in session, can best be maintained through the 
agency of the Local Assemblies, one of whose essential functions is to 
act as intermediaries between the local communities and their national 
representatives. The main purpose of the Nineteen Day Feasts is to 
enable individual believers to offer any suggestion to the Local 
Assembly, which in its turn will pass it to the National Spiritual 
Assembly. The Local Assembly is, therefore, the proper medium through 
which local Baha'i communities can communicate with the body of the 
national representatives. The Convention should be regarded as a 
temporary gathering, having certain specific functions to perform during
 a limited period of time. Its status is thus limited in time to the 
Convention sessions, the function of consultation at all other times 
being vested in the entire body of the believers through the Local 
Spiritual Assemblies.</p>
<p>	[Postscript in the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi:]<br>

</p><p>	I wish to affirm, without the least hesitation or ambiguity, 
that the annual Convention is not to be regarded as a body entitled to 
exercise functions similar to those which an ordinary parliament 
possesses under a democratic form of government. The Administrative 
Order which lies embedded in the teachings of Baha'u'llah, and which the
 American believers have championed and are now establishing, should, 
under no circumstances, be identified with the principles underlying 
present-day democracies. Nor is it identical with any purely 
aristocratic or autocratic form of government, the objectionable 
features inherent in each of these political systems are entirely 
avoided. It blends, as no system of human polity has as yet achieved, 
those salutary truths and beneficial elements which constitute the 
valuable contributions which each of these forms of government have made
 to society in the past. Consultation, frank and unfettered, is the 
bedrock of this unique Order. Authority is concentrated in the hands of 
the elected members of the National Assembly. Power and initiative are 
primarily vested in the entire body of the believers acting through 
their local representatives. To generate those forces which must give 
birth to the body of their national administrators, and to confer, 
freely and fully and at fixed intervals, with both the incoming and 
outgoing National Assemblies, are the twofold functions, the supreme 
responsibility and sole prerogative of the delegates assembled in 
Convention. Nothing short of close and constant interaction between 
these various organs of Baha'i administration can enable it to fulfil 
its high destiny.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 November 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada)</p>
<p>	1457. Concerning the status of members of the National Spiritual 
Assembly at Convention sessions the Guardian feels that the members of 
both the incoming and the outgoing Assemblies should be given the full 
right to participate in the Convention discussions. Those members of the
 National Spiritual Assembly who have been elected delegates will, in 
addition to the right of participation, be entitled to vote. The 
Guardian wishes thereby to render more effective the deliberations and 
the recommendations of the national representatives. He feels that the 
exercise of such a right by the members of the National Spiritual 
Assembly will enable them to consult more fully with the assembled 
delegates, to<br>
 exchange fully and frankly with them their views, and to consider 
collectively the interests, needs and requirements of the Cause. This, 
he believes, is one of the primary functions of the Convention.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 December 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada, published in "Baha'i News" 81 (February 1934), p. 3)</p>
<p>	1458. In connection with the circular letter you have sent the Local
 Assemblies in order to define the specific rights and functions of the 
Annual Baha'i Convention, and to explain once more the relationships 
binding that body to the National Spiritual Assembly, the Guardian 
wishes me to again affirm his view that the authority of the National 
Spiritual Assembly is undivided and unchallengeable in all matters 
pertaining to the administration of the Faith throughout the United 
States and Canada, and that, therefore, the obedience of individual 
Baha'is, delegates, groups, and Assemblies to that authority is 
imperative, and should be whole-hearted and unqualified. He is convinced
 that the unreserved acceptance and complete application of this vital 
provision of the Administration is essential to the maintenance of the 
highest degree of unity among the believers, and is indispensable to the
 effective working of the administrative machinery of the Faith in every
 country.</p>
<p>	Hoping that through your efforts the friends will co-operate in 
carrying out the Guardian's instructions on this point, and with the 
renewed assurance of his prayers and supplications on your behalf, and 
on behalf of your collaborators in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 June 1934 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada)</p>
<p>	III. Relation to the Community</p>
<p>	1459. What has given me still greater pleasure is to learn that the 
members of this Central Body, which has assumed so grave a 
responsibility and is facing such delicate and difficult tasks, command 
individually and collectively not only the sympathy of their spiritual 
brethren and sisters but also can confidently rely on their active and 
whole-hearted support in the campaign of service to the Cause of 
Baha'u'llah. It is indeed as it should be, for if genuine and sustained 
co-operation and mutual confidence cease to exist between individual 
friends and their Local and<br>
 National Assemblies, the all-beneficent work of the Cause must cease 
and nothing else can enable it to function harmoniously and effectively 
in future.</p>
<p>	True, the Cause as every other movement has its own obstacles, 
complications and unforeseen difficulties, but unlike any other human 
organization it inspires a spirit of Faith and Devotion which can never 
fail to induce us to make sincere and renewed efforts to face these 
difficulties and smooth any differences that may and must arise.</p>
<p>	I look forward with fervent hope to hear of these renewed efforts on
 your part and of the strong determination which you will never suffer 
to slacken, to maintain at any cost the unity, the effectiveness and the
 dignity of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 December 1922 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, 
published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 
28)</p>
<p>	1460. The need for the centralization of authority in the National 
Spiritual Assembly, and the concentration of power in the various local 
Assemblies, is made manifest when we reflect that the Cause of 
Baha'u'llah is still in its age of tender growth and in a stage of 
transition; when we remember that the full implications and the exact 
significance of the Master's world-wide Instructions, as laid down in 
His Will are as yet not fully grasped, and the whole Movement has not 
sufficiently crystallized in the eyes of the world.</p>
<p>	It is our primary task to keep the most vigilant eye on the manner 
and character of its growth, to combat effectively the forces of 
separatism and of sectarian tendencies, lest the Spirit of the Cause be 
obscured, its unity be threatened, its Teachings suffer corruption, lest
 extreme orthodoxy on one hand, and irresponsible freedom on the other, 
cause it to deviate from that Straight Path which alone can lead it to 
success.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 March 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of America, Australasia, 
France, Germany, British Isles, Italy, Japan and Switzerland, published 
in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 42)<br>

</p><p>	1461. Let us .. . remember that at the very root of the Cause 
lies the principle of the undoubted right of the individual to 
self-expression, his freedom to declare his conscience and set forth his
 views....</p>
<p>	Let us also bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God is not
 dictatorial authority, but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but 
the spirit of frank and loving consultation. Nothing short of the spirit
 of a true Baha'i can hope to reconcile the principles of mercy and 
justice, of freedom and submission, of the sanctity of the right of the 
individual and of self-surrender, of vigilance, discretion and prudence 
on the one hand and fellowship, candour and courage on the other. The 
duties of those whom the friends have freely and conscientiously elected
 as their representatives are no less vital and binding than the 
obligations of those who have chosen them. Their function is not to 
dictate, but to consult, and consult not only among themselves, but as 
much as possible with the friends whom they represent. They must regard 
themselves in no other light but that of chosen instruments for a more 
efficient and dignified presentation of the Cause of God. They should 
never be led to suppose that they are the central ornaments of the body 
of the Cause, intrinsically superior to others in capacity or merit, and
 sole promoters of its teachings and principles. They should approach 
their task with extreme humility, and endeavour by their 
open-mindedness, their high sense of justice and duty, their candour, 
their modesty, their entire devotion to the welfare and interests of the
 friends, the Cause, and humanity, to win not only the confidence and 
the genuine support and respect of those whom they should serve, but 
also their esteem and real affection.</p>
<p>	They must at all times avoid the spirit of exclusiveness, the 
atmosphere of secrecy, free themselves from a domineering attitude, and 
banish all forms of prejudice and passion from their deliberations. They
 should, within the limits of wise discretion, take the friends into 
their confidence, acquaint them with their plans, share with them their 
problems and anxieties, and seek their advice and counsel. And when they
 are called upon to arrive at a certain decision, they should, after 
dispassionate, anxious, and cordial consultation, turn to God in prayer,
 and with earnestness and conviction and courage record their vote and 
abide by the voice of the majority, which we are told by our Master to 
be the voice of truth, never to be challenged, and always to be 
whole-heartedly enforced. To this voice the friends must heartily 
respond,<br>
 and regard it as the only means that can ensure the protection and advancement of the Cause.</p>

<p>	1462. The News-Letter which you have lately initiated fulfils a very
 vital function and has been started admirably well. I would urge you to
 enlarge its scope, as much as your resources permit, that in time it 
may devote a special section to every phase of your activities, 
administrative, devotional, humanitarian, financial, educational and 
otherwise. That it may attain its object it must combine the essential 
qualities of accuracy, reliability, thoroughness, dignity and wisdom. It
 should become a great factor in promoting understanding, providing 
information on Baha'i activity both local and foreign, in stimulating 
interest, in combating evil influences, and in upholding and 
safeguarding the institutions of the Cause. It should be made as 
representative as possible, should be replete with news, up-to-date in 
its information, and should arouse the keenest interest among believers 
and admirers alike in every corner of the globe. I cherish great hopes 
for its immediate future, and I trust you will devote your special 
attention to its development, and by devising well-conceived and 
world-wide measures transform this News-Letter into what I hope will 
become the foremost Baha'i Journal of the world.</p>

<p>	1463. Let it be made clear to every inquiring reader that among the 
most outstanding and sacred duties incumbent upon those who have been 
called upon to initiate, direct and co-ordinate the affairs of the Cause
 are those that require them to win by every means in their power the 
confidence and affection of those whom it is their privilege to serve. 
Theirs is the duty to investigate and acquaint themselves with the 
considered views, the prevailing sentiments, the personal convictions of
 those whose welfare it is their solemn obligation to promote. Theirs is
 the duty to purge once for all their deliberations and the general 
conduct of their affairs from that air of self-contained aloofness, from
 the suspicion<br>
 of secrecy, the stifling atmosphere of dictatorial assertiveness, in 
short from every word and deed that might savour of partiality, 
self-centeredness and prejudice. Theirs is the duty, while retaining the
 sacred and exclusive right of final decision in their hands, to invite 
discussion, provide information, ventilate grievances, welcome advice 
from even the most humble and insignificant member of the Baha'i Family,
 expose their motives, set forth their plans, justify their actions, 
revise if necessary their verdict, foster the spirit of individual 
initiative and enterprise, and fortify the sense of interdependence and 
co-partnership, of understanding and mutual confidence between them on 
one hand and all Local Assemblies and individual believers on the other.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 October 1927 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	1464. Regarding the proposed News-Letter ... this, the Guardian 
feels, is a splendid idea and can render a unique and much-needed help 
to your Assembly in its efforts for the establishment of the 
Administration, and the more effective functioning of its institutions 
throughout Australia and New Zealand. It has not only the great 
advantage of keeping the friends well informed about the events and 
developments in the Cause, but in addition can help in consolidating the
 organic unity of the believers by bringing them within the full orbit 
of the National Spiritual Assembly's jurisdiction. It is hoped that this
 body will do its utmost to maintain the publication of this bulletin, 
and will make full use of this splendid medium for the further widening 
and consolidation of the foundations of the Local as well as National 
Assemblies.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 September 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand)</p>
<p>	1465. This contact between the members of the National Assembly and 
the individual believers is certainly of immense value to the Cause, as 
it serves to promote, more than any other means, intelligent 
co-operation, fellowship and understanding among the friends. It is the 
National Spiritual Assembly's responsibility, therefore, to foster by 
every means in its power this growth, and thus help in further 
consolidating its authority and prestige in the community. There is 
nothing that can inflict upon it<br>
 a greater harm than the attitude of aloofness, of isolation from the general body of the believers.</p>
<p>	It is Shoghi Effendi's hope that the success that has attended this 
last session of the National Spiritual Assembly at San Francisco will 
stimulate the members to hold their meetings in as many different 
centres as possible. He is fervently praying for their guidance in this 
matter.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 4 December 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1466. Before closing there is one suggestion in your letter which 
the Guardian wishes me to confirm, namely that it is one of the vital 
functions of the National Spiritual Assembly to be always in touch with 
local conditions in every community and to endeavour, through personal 
contacts and by means of regular correspondence, to guide the friends, 
individually and collectively, in all their activities.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 June 1938 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1467. Let every participator in the continent-wide campaign 
initiated by the American believers, and particularly those engaged in 
pioneer work in virgin territories, bear in mind the necessity of 
keeping in close and constant touch with those responsible agencies 
designed to direct, coordinate, and facilitate the teaching activities 
of the entire community. Whether it be the body of their elected 
national representatives, or its chief auxiliary institution, the 
National Teaching Committee, or its subsidiary organs, the regional 
teaching committees, or the local Spiritual Assemblies and their 
respective teaching committees, they who labor for the spread of the 
Cause of Baha'u'llah should, through constant interchange of ideas, 
through letters, circulars, reports, bulletins and other means of 
communication with these established instruments designed for the 
propagation of the Faith, insure the smooth and speedy functioning of 
the teaching machinery of their Administrative Order. Confusion, delay, 
duplication of efforts, dissipation of energy will, thereby, be 
completely avoided, and the mighty flood of the grace of Baha'u'llah, 
flowing abundantly and without the least obstruction through these 
essential channels will so inundate the hearts and souls of<br>
 men as to enable them to bring forth the harvest repeatedly predicted by 'Abdu'l-Baha.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", pp. 52-53)</p>
<p>	1468. The Guardian is, doubtless, well aware of the existing 
imperfections in the administrative machinery of the Cause, but these, 
he strongly feels, should be attributed not to the administrative system
 itself, but to the administrators of the Faith, who by reason of their 
human limitations and imperfections can never hope to entirely fulfil 
those ideal conditions set forth in the Teachings. Many of the existing 
defects in the present-day activities of the believers, however, will as
 the Community develops and gains in experience be gradually removed, 
and healthier and more progressive conditions prevail. And it is towards
 the realization of this high aim that the friends should earnestly and 
unitedly strive.</p>
<p>	The Guardian feels certain that no matter how much your heart may be
 afflicted at the sight of the difficulties now confronting the American
 Community, and however revolting may appear to you the attitude and the
 shortcomings of certain of its members, you will far from being 
discouraged be stimulated to exert every effort in your power to remedy 
such unhealthy conditions, confident that in your earnest and sincere 
attempt to do so, you will be assisted and guided by the unfailing 
confirmations of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 May 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1469. The Guardian believes that a great deal of the difficulties 
from which the believers ... feel themselves to be suffering are caused 
by their neither correctly understanding nor putting into practice the 
administration. They seem -- many of them -- to be prone to continually 
challenging and criticizing the decisions of their Assemblies. If the 
Baha'is undermine the very bodies which are, however immaturely, seeking
 to co-ordinate Baha'i activities and administer Baha'i affairs, if they
 continually criticize their acts and challenge or belittle their 
decisions, they not only prevent any real rapid progress in the Faith's 
development from taking place, but they repel outsiders who quite 
rightly may ask how we ever expect to unite the whole world when we are 
so disunited among ourselves!<br>

</p><p>	There is only one remedy for this: to study the administration, 
to obey the Assemblies, and each believer seek to perfect his own 
character as a Baha'i. We can never exert the influence over others 
which we can exert over ourselves. If we are better, if we show love, 
patience, and understanding of the weaknesses of others; if we seek to 
never criticize but rather encourage, others will do likewise, and we 
can really help the Cause through our example and spiritual strength. 
The Baha'is everywhere, when the administration is first established, 
find it very difficult to adjust themselves. They have to learn to obey,
 even when the Assembly may be wrong, for the sake of unity. They have 
to sacrifice their personalities, to a certain extent, in order that the
 community life may grow and develop as a whole. These things are 
difficult -- but we must realize that they will lead us to a very much 
greater, more perfect, way of life when the Faith is properly 
established according to the administration.</p>
<p>	The Guardian would advise you to abide by the decisions of the 
National Spiritual Assembly in all matters. If they, knowing the 
requirements of the Faith all over India, do not feel it the time or 
advisable to publish your writings, you should accept their decision. 
Also you should not seek to publish any books or pamphlets without their
 sanction. Concentrate on teaching the Holy Faith, and put your trust in
 Baha'u'llah. The Guardian will pray for you and all the dear friends 
there.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 October 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1470. The Baha'is are fully entitled to address criticisms to their 
Assemblies; they can freely air their views about policies or individual
 members of elected bodies to the Assembly, Local or National, but then 
they must whole-heartedly accept the advice or decision of the Assembly,
 according to the principles already laid down for such matters in 
Baha'i administration.</p>
<p>	He always has the right to step in and countermand the decisions of a
 National Assembly; if he did not possess this right he would be 
absolutely impotent to protect the Faith, just as the National Spiritual
 Assembly, if it were divested of the right to countermand the decisions
 of a Local<br>
 Assembly, would be incapable of watching over and guiding the national welfare of the Baha'i Community.</p>
<p>	It is the duty of the National Spiritual Assembly to exercise the 
greatest wisdom, forbearance and tact in handling the affairs of the 
Cause. Many of the differences which arise between the believers are due
 to their immaturity, their extreme zeal and sincerity.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 13 May 1945 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand, 
published in "Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand, 
1923-1957", pp.55-57)</p>
<p>	1471. The N.S.A.s the world over, owing to the spiritual immaturity 
of the believers, must at the present time exert the greatest patience 
in dealing with the friends; otherwise, as seems to be rapidly becoming 
the case in Australia, the friends will take sides, bitterness will 
increase and what started out as a small thing (however unjustified and 
regrettable a departure from the Baha'i spirit) will become a menace to 
the progress of the Faith and definitely retard its progress.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 August 1945 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand,
 published in "Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand, 
1923-1957", p.58)</p>
<p>	1472. Over and over, in going through the correspondence he received
 from your Assembly, he was struck by the fact that the friends acted so
 unadministratively. Instead of taking up their accusations and problems
 and unhappy feelings with their Local Assembly, or the National 
Assembly, they referred to individuals or individual members of the 
Assembly, or they refused to meet with the Assembly. The first thing a 
believer should do is to turn to an Assembly -- that is why we have 
Assemblies! He feels this trouble would never have arisen if the Baha'is
 utilized their Assemblies as they should....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 June 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria)</p>
<p>	1473. The question of your budget, which you have raised in your 
letter, is one of great importance. In spite of the numbers which you 
represent<br>
 and the enthusiasm of the Baha'is, your Assembly must face the fact 
that it represents a very poor community, financially. Any 
over-ambitious budget, which would place an oppressive financial burden 
on the friends, would be highly unwise, because, unless it is met, it 
will give them a feeling at the end of the year of intense frustration.</p>
<p>	He thinks that what you have outlined is too much. Your Assembly 
will have to, particularly during this first year of its existence, be 
less ambitious as regards projects involving money, and devote itself 
particularly to encouraging the friends, reinforcing the foundations of 
the Local Assemblies, assisting the groups to attain Assembly status, 
and deepening in every way it can the education of the African friends 
in the Faith. The other National Spiritual Assemblies, as you know, are 
having their own problems financially; and, although there is no 
objection to appealing to them to give you some help, the Guardian 
doubts very much whether they will be in a position to add very 
substantially to your funds at this time.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 July 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Central and East Africa)</p>
<p>	1474. He appreciates your spirit of devotion to the Faith, but he 
feels that you, your husband and ... should comply with the instructions
 of the National Spiritual Assembly. There can be no protection for the 
Faith unless the friends are willing to submit to their administrative 
bodies, especially when these are acting in good faith; and the 
individual believers are not in a position to judge their National Body.
 If any wrong has been done, we must leave it in the hands of God, 
knowing, as 'Abdu'l-Baha said, that He will right it, and in the mean 
time not disrupt the Cause of God by constantly harping on these 
matters.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 3 February 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1475. He feels that your Assembly must keep before its eyes the 
balance specified by Baha'u'llah, Himself, in other words, justice, 
reward and retribution. Although the Cause is still young and tender, 
and many of the believers inexperienced, and therefore loving 
forbearance is often called for in the place of harsh measures, this 
does not mean that a<br>
 National Spiritual Assembly can under any circumstances tolerate 
disgraceful conduct, flagrantly contrary to our Teachings, on the part 
of any of its members, whoever they may be and from wherever they may 
come. You should vigilantly watch over and protect the interests of the 
Baha'i Community, and the moment you see that any of the Persian 
residents in Germany, or, for that matter, German Baha'is themselves, 
are acting in a way to bring disgrace upon the name of the Faith, warn 
them, and, if necessary, deprive them immediately of their voting rights
 if they refuse to change their ways. Only in this way can the purity of
 the Faith be preserved. Compromise and weak measures will obscure the 
vision of its followers, sap its strength, lower it in the eyes of the 
public and prevent it from making any progress.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 August 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria)</p>
<p>	IV. Relation to the Outside World:</p>
<p>	1476. ...as the Movement grows in strength and power the National 
Spiritual Assemblies should be encouraged, if circumstances permit and 
the means at their disposal justify, to resort to the twofold method of 
directly and indirectly winning the enlightened public to the 
unqualified acceptance of the Baha'i Faith. The one method would assume 
an open, decisive and challenging tone. The other, without implying in 
any manner the slightest departure from strict loyalty to the Cause of 
God, would be progressive and cautious. Experience will reveal the fact 
that each of the methods in its own special way might suit a particular 
temperament and class of people, and that each, in the present state of a
 constantly fluctuating society, should be judiciously attempted and 
utilized.</p>
<p>	It is I feel for the national representatives of the believers in 
every land to utilize and combine both methods, the outspoken as well as
 the gradual, in such a manner as to secure the greatest benefit and the
 fullest advantage for this steadily-growing Cause....</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	 As the Movement extends the bounds of its influence and its 
opportunities for fuller recognition multiply, the twofold character of 
the obligations imposed on its national elected representatives should, I
 feel, be increasingly emphasized. Whilst chiefly engaged in the pursuit
 of their<br>
 major task, consisting chiefly in the formation and the consolidation 
of Baha'i administrative institutions, they should endeavour to 
participate, within recognized limits, in the work of institutions 
which, though unaware of the claim of the Baha'i Cause, are prompted by a
 sincere desire to promote the spirit that animates the Faith. In the 
pursuit of their major task their function is to preserve the identity 
of the Cause and the purity of the mission of Baha'u'llah. In their 
minor undertaking their purpose should be to imbue with the spirit of 
power and strength such movements as in their restricted scope are 
endeavouring to achieve what is near and dear to the heart of every true
 Baha'i. It would even appear at times to be advisable and helpful as a 
supplement to their work for the Baha'is to initiate any undertaking not
 specifically designated as Baha'i, provided that they have ascertained 
that such an undertaking would constitute the best way of approach to 
those whose minds and hearts are as yet unprepared for a full acceptance
 of the claim of Baha'u'llah. These twofold obligations devolving upon 
organized Baha'i communities, far from neutralizing the effects of one 
another or of appearing antagonistic in their aims, should be regarded 
as complementary and fulfilling, each in its way, a vital and necessary 
function.</p>
<p>	It is for the national representatives of the Baha'i Cause to 
observe the conditions under which they labour, to estimate the forces 
that are at work in their own surroundings, to weigh carefully and 
prayerfully the merits of either procedure, and to form a correct 
judgement as to the degree of emphasis that should be placed upon these 
twofold methods. Then and only then will they be enabled to protect and 
stimulate on one hand the independent growth of the Baha'i Faith, and on
 the other vindicate the claim of its universal Principles to the 
doubtful and unbelieving.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 February 1927 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, 
published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932" pp. 
124-127)</p>
<p>	1477. The Guardian feels that it is a pity that, through the 
over-enthusiasm of the official concerned, a school building was placed 
at the disposal of the Baha'is before any official decision had been 
made as to whether it was possible for them to send a teacher there.<br>

</p><p>	We must be very careful in our dealings with the public, 
particularly officials, lest we create situations which cause us 
embarrassment, and may belittle our prestige in non-Baha'i eyes.</p>
<p>	The Guardian attaches the greatest importance to your work; and is 
delighted to see that you are carrying on your various projects with so 
much enthusiasm and devotion. It would be ideal if an offer, such as 
that made, could be accepted; but as the Cause has so many burdens to 
bear at this time, we are forced to do as 'Abdu'l-Baha said -- give up 
the important for the most important.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 29 December 1951 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the Comite Nacional de Ensenanza Baha'i para los indigenas)</p>
<p>	V. Function of Officer:</p>
<p>	1478. All donations and contributions should be offered to the 
Treasurer of the Assembly, for the express purpose of promoting the 
interests of the Cause, throughout that locality or country. It is the 
sacred obligation of every conscientious and faithful servant of 
Baha'u'llah, who desires to see His Cause advance, to contribute freely 
and generously for the increase of that Fund. The members of the 
Spiritual Assembly will at their own discretion expend it to promote the
 Teaching Campaign, to help the needy, to establish educational Baha'i 
institutions, to extend in every way possible their sphere of 
service....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 March 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of America, Australasia, 
France, Germany, British Isles, Italy, Japan and Switzerland, published 
in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932" pp. 41-42)</p>
<p>	1479. By now the election of the new National Spiritual Assembly and
 of its office-bearers will probably be completed. The office of 
Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly is most important and the 
smooth and efficient working of the Baha'i organization in India and 
Burma will depend to a large extent on him....</p>
<p>	It is obvious that to carry out these manifold duties efficiently, 
thoroughly and tactfully is no easy task and Shoghi Effendi greatly 
hopes<br>
 that someone may be found who will be able to devote the necessary ability, time and energy to carry them out satisfactorily.</p>
<p>(From a letter dated 12 May 1925 written by Shoghi Effendi to<br>
the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma) </p>
<p>	1480. As regards your question whether the president of the National
 Spiritual Assembly is entitled to give any ruling during the period of 
his tenure, the Guardian wishes me to state that no such ruling can be 
valid unless approved by the other members of the National Assembly. The
 president has no special legislative capacity, except as a member of 
the Assembly.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 February 1937 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1481. In connection with resolution No. 15 recorded in the minutes 
of your National Spiritual Assembly: the Guardian wishes you to make 
clear to all the believers that membership in a Baha'i Assembly or 
Committee is a sacred obligation which should be gladly and confidently 
accepted by every loyal and conscientious member of the Community, no 
matter how humble and inexperienced. Once elected to serve in a given 
Assembly a believer's duty is to do his utmost to attend all Assembly 
meetings, and co-operate with his fellow-members, unless, however, he is
 prevented from doing so by some major reason such as illness, and even 
then he should notify the Assembly to this effect. The National 
Spiritual Assembly's duty is to urge, and also facilitate attendance at 
Assembly meetings. If a member has no valid reason to justify his 
repeated absence from Assembly meetings, he should be advised, and even 
warned, and if such warning is deliberately ignored by him, the Assembly
 will then have the right to suspend his rights as a voting member of 
the Community. Such administrative sanction would seem to be absolutely 
imperative and necessary, and while not tantamount to a complete 
expulsion of such [a] member from the Cause, deprives him of any real 
participation in its administrative functions and affairs, and is thus a
 most effective corrective measure which the Assembly can use against 
all such half-hearted and irresponsible individuals in the Community.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 2 July 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)<br>

</p><p>	1482. As regards the question of what procedure the Baha'i 
Assemblies should adopt when dissatisfied with the services of any of 
their officers: Should such dissatisfaction involve the loyalty of an 
Assembly officer to the Faith, he should, following a majority vote, be 
dismissed. But in case the dissatisfaction is due to the incompetence of
 a member, or simply to a neglect on his part to discharge his duties, 
this does not constitute sufficient justification to force his 
resignation or dismissal from the Assembly. He should be kept in office 
until new elections are held.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 November 1940 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles)</p>
<p>	1483. Regarding your question concerning the secretary of the 
National Spiritual Assembly: There cannot be any permanently elected 
secretary who would year after year hold office, as this would be 
contrary to the principles of the administration; however, the Guardian 
feels that the National Spiritual Assembly should supply the secretary 
with a paid helper in order to enable him to carry on his duties 
properly and at the same time pursue his own profession, if that is 
necessary for him. In other words the secretary of the National 
Spiritual Assembly can have a full-time secretary under him if the work 
requires it.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 June 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1484. Generally speaking the secretary of an Assembly must be 
careful to convey exactly what the majority decision or advice of the 
body was. There can surely be no objection to his putting it in proper 
terms and clarifying the matter according to the decision or instruction
 of the Assembly. But he should of course not introduce his personal 
views unless endorsed by the Assembly.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 October 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1485. He was sorry that he felt it necessary to insist that the 
secretary of your Assembly must be located in Buenos Aires, so that the 
Secretariat can be located in the Headquarters of this region; this is a
 general principle which he has insisted the friends adhere to 
everywhere. A situation similar to yours arose in Scandinavia, where the
 secretary was in Oslo instead of<br>
 Stockholm, and a change was necessary there also. As the Ten Year 
Crusade unfolds it is increasingly important for the work to go forward 
in a uniform manner and according to general principles applicable to 
all.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 29 July 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Argentina, Chile, Uruguay,
 Paraguay and Bolivia)</p>
<p>	VI. Assembly Meetings:</p>
<p>	1486. I always eagerly await detailed and frequent reports from the 
National Assembly and desire strongly its members to meet as often as 
possible and actively, efficiently and constantly direct, co-ordinate 
and reinforce the activities of the individuals and Local Assemblies 
throughout India and Burma. I thirst for more specific information and 
urge its secretary to ensure that every communication from the Holy Land
 or from any other Baha'i centre is promptly and widely distributed. I 
assure you of my loving prayers.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 March 1925 written by Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1487. Another factor which, in the Guardian's opinion, is essential 
to the development of your National Spiritual Assembly is the holding of
 frequent meetings. Although the members are stationed at great 
distances from one another yet they can communicate through 
correspondence. It is not necessary that all the members should be 
present in all the sessions. Those who, for some reason or another, are 
unable to attend in person the meetings of the National Spiritual 
Assembly can express their views in a written form and send them to the 
Assembly. The main point is that your national activities should not be 
let to suffer in any way, and its work be retarded and postponed because
 of such necessarily unimportant and secondary considerations.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 2 January 1934 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1488. The Guardian welcomes the step taken by your Assembly to 
increasingly devote its meetings to the consideration of major policies 
and plans, and to dwell less on matters of detail and of mere secondary 
administrative character. He would, however, urge that all decisions,<br>
 unless of a trivial and insignificant nature dealing purely with 
routine work, should be reached after careful and conscientious 
deliberation by all the nine members. Any tendencies towards 
decentralization, or the delegation of authority to any person or body 
to make decisions on matters which directly and solely concern the 
National Spiritual Assembly itself, would be harmful and should be 
checked at the very outset. It is for this very reason, namely to enable
 the National Spiritual Assembly to properly and fully discharge its 
functions of consultation and deliberation on issues that concern the 
national community under its jurisdiction, that its membership has been 
limited to nine, so that it may not be too unwieldy for making decisions
 that would often require quick action and mature deliberation by all 
the members. In order to safeguard the distinctive character of such a 
central and authoritative institution more frequent gatherings would 
seem imperative, particularly as the problems which it will be called 
upon to deal with are destined to increase in number and importance with
 the steady expansion of the Faith in North America.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 January 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada)</p>
<p>	1489. Likewise, he feels that the National Spiritual Assembly should
 meet more often, even if all members cannot always be present. 
Decisions by correspondence lack the vitality of those that arise out of
 active consultation, and now the Faith is progressing so well there, 
and has a sound administrative foundation, more vigorous and systematic 
action is required.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 16 July 1946 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand)</p>
<p>	VII. National Committees:</p>
<p>	1490. Large issues in such spiritual activities that affect the 
Cause in general in that land,... far from being under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of any Local Assembly or group of friends, must each be 
minutely and fully directed by a special board, elected by the National 
Body, constituted as a committee thereof, responsible to it and upon 
which the National Body shall exercise constant and general supervision.<br>

</p><p>	(From a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and 
Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 
1922-1932, p. 24)</p>
<p>	1491. I very highly approve of the arrangements you have made for 
centralizing the work in your hands and of distributing it to the 
various committees, who, each in its own sphere, have so efficiently and
 thoroughly undertaken the management of their own affairs.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 December 1922 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, 
published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 
28)</p>
<p>	1492. Vital issues, affecting the interests of the Cause in that 
country, such as the matter of translation and publication, the 
Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, the Teaching Work, and other similar matters that 
stand distinct from strictly local affairs, must be under the full 
jurisdiction of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>	It will have to refer each of these questions, even as the local 
Assemblies, to a special Committee, to be elected by the members of the 
National Spiritual Assembly from among all the friends in that country, 
which will bear to it the same relation as the local committees bear to 
their respective local Assemblies.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 March 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of America, Australasia, 
France, Germany, British Isles, Italy, Japan and Switzerland, published 
in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 40)</p>
<p>	1493. Touching the recent decision of the National Spiritual 
Assembly to place as much as possible of the current details of the work
 in the hands of its national Committees, I feel I should point out that
 this raises a fundamental issue of paramount importance, as it involves
 a unique principle in the administration of the Cause, governing the 
relations that should be maintained between the central administrative 
Body and its assisting organs of executive and legislative action. As it
 has been observed already, the role of these committees set up by the 
National Spiritual Assembly, the renewal, the membership and functions 
of which should be reconsidered separately each year by the incoming 
National Assembly, is chiefly to make thorough and expert study of the 
issue entrusted to<br>
 their charge, advise by their reports, and assist in the execution of 
the decisions which in vital matters are to be exclusively and directly 
rendered by the National Assembly. The utmost vigilance, the most 
strenuous exertion is required by them if they wish to fulfil, as befits
 their high and responsible calling, the functions which it is theirs to
 discharge. They should, within the limits imposed upon them by 
present-day circumstances, endeavour to maintain the balance in such a 
manner that the evils of over-centralization which clog, confuse and in 
the long run depreciate the value of Baha'i services rendered shall on 
one hand be entirely avoided, and on the other the perils of utter 
decentralization with the consequent lapse of governing authority from 
the hands of the national representatives of the believers definitely 
averted. The absorption of the petty details of Baha'i administration by
 the personnel of the National Spiritual Assembly is manifestly 
injurious to efficiency and an expert discharge of Baha'i duties, whilst
 the granting of undue discretion to bodies that should be regarded in 
no other light than that of expert advisers and executive assistants 
would jeopardize the very vital and pervading powers that are the sacred
 prerogatives of bodies that in time will evolve into Baha'i National 
Houses of Justice. I am fully aware of the strain and sacrifice which a 
loyal adherence to such an essential principle of Baha'i administration 
-- a principle that will at once ennoble and distinguish the Baha'i 
method of administration from the prevailing systems of the world -- 
demands from the national representatives of the believers at this early
 stage of our evolution. Yet I feel I cannot refrain from stressing the 
broad lines along which the affairs of the Cause should be increasingly 
conducted, the knowledge of which is so essential at this formative 
period of Baha'i administrative institutions.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 October 1927 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, 
published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", pp. 
141-142)</p>
<p>	1494. Aided by national committees responsible to and chosen by 
them, without discrimination, from among the entire body of the 
believers within their jurisdiction, and to each of which a particular 
sphere of Baha'i service is allocated, these Baha'i National Assemblies 
have, as the scope of their activities steadily enlarged, proved 
themselves, through the spirit of discipline which they have inculcated 
and through their<br>
 uncompromising adherence to principles which have enabled them to rise 
above all prejudices of race, nation, class and color, capable of 
administering, in a remarkable fashion, the multiplying activities of a 
newly-consolidated Faith.</p>
<p>	Nor have the national committees themselves been less energetic and 
devoted in the discharge of their respective functions. In the defense 
of the Faith's vital interests, in the exposition of its doctrine; in 
the dissemination of its literature; in the consolidation of its 
finances; in the organization of its teaching force; in the furtherance 
of the solidarity of its component parts; in the purchase of its 
historic sites; in the preservation of its sacred records, treasures and
 relics; in its contacts with the various institutions of the society of
 which it forms a part; in the education of its youth; in the training 
of its children; in the improvement of the status of its women adherents
 in the East; the members of these diversified agencies, operating under
 the aegis of the elected national representatives of the Baha'i 
community, have amply demonstrated their capacity to promote effectively
 its vital and manifold interests....</p>
<p>	("God Passes By", p. 333)</p>
<p>	1495. He feels that the Local Assemblies should be encouraged to 
realize that National Committees are constituted to serve their needs, 
not to dictate arbitrarily to them, and to unify the work of the Cause 
which is now spreading so rapidly in the British Isles. The Committees 
in question should be very tactful in dealing with a young Assembly 
which is beginning to "feel its oats", as this spirit of independence, 
if properly handled, can lead it to be strong and independent rather 
than weak and always relying on other bodies to carry it forward! 
Assemblies, however, should certainly co-operate with National 
Committees and not refuse their assistance.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 November 1948 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles)</p>
<p>	VIII. Flexibility in Secondary Matters:</p>
<p>	1496. In regard to your criticism of the Article VIII of the By-Laws
 of the N.S.A., the Guardian wishes you to know that since this is a 
secondary matter arising out of the general principles he has already 
laid down in one of his latest communications addressed to you and to 
the N.S.A. concerning the power of the delegates and the relation of 
these to the<br>
 National Assembly, he does not think it is necessary for him to enter 
into these details which by their very nature fall within the 
jurisdiction of the N.S.A. It is to that body which you should submit 
any criticism, whether in regard to the provisions of the Constitution, 
or in connection with any other phase of the administrative work of the 
Cause. It is not for the Guardian to enter into matters of detail. His 
overwhelming and pressing duties, and the very nature of his position as
 the supreme Guardian of the Faith, make it impossible for him to 
interfere in affairs of a local character, and of a relatively secondary
 importance. It is for you, as one of the distinguished members of the 
highest administrative body of the Cause in the States, to remind your 
fellow-members of what is their duty to consider and to act upon. The 
Guardian lays down the general principle, and it is for the National 
Assembly to direct all local assemblies and groups as to the best way 
they can apply it to their local conditions.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 November 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1497. In connection with his cablegram sent in July urging your 
Assembly to cease issuing any more statements on various administrative 
matters, the Guardian wishes me again to reiterate and confirm the 
directions and explanations already conveyed in one of his recent 
communications to the National Spiritual Assembly to the effect that the
 publication of such statements no longer fills an urgent need, and that
 their multiplication would only result in making the administration of 
the Cause too rigid. The various rulings and regulations recorded in the
 "Baha'i Administration" and the supplementary statements already issued
 by the National Assembly, he feels, are for the present sufficiently 
detailed to guide the friends in their present-day activities. He 
himself has in recent years deliberately refrained from adding any more 
administrative regulations, or from even elucidating and elaborating 
those already enforced. All the more reason that your Assembly should, 
likewise, desist from multiplying the administrative regulations which, 
as their number increases, must necessarily fetter and confuse those who
 are called upon to carry them out. It is not necessary for your 
Assembly to anticipate situations which have not arisen, and to lay down
 general rules and regulations to meet them. It would be wiser to 
consider every case individually as it arises, and then to resolve the 
problem connected with<br>
 it in the most suitable and practical manner. The American believers, 
as well as their national representatives, must henceforth direct their 
attention to the greater and vital issues which an already established 
Administration is called upon to face and handle, rather than allow 
their energies to be expended in the consideration of purely secondary 
administrative matters. The Guardian wishes your Assembly to refer again
 to the communication already referred to bearing on this subject.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 November 1937 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada)</p>
<p>	1498. In reading your annual Convention report the Guardian has 
noted the request made that the National Spiritual Assembly should lay 
down certain rules of procedure. He has already informed the American 
N.S.A. that they should henceforth refrain from laying down any further 
rules and regulations, as these would tend to rigidity the affairs of 
the Cause and ultimately obscure its spirit and retard its growth. He 
feels that your Assembly should exercise the same care, and avoid 
introducing any rules of procedure not already in existence. Every case 
coming before the Assembly should be judged on its own merits, and be 
decided individually without any recourse to new rulings.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 29 June 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1499. Now that your Assembly is formed, and is embarking on its 
independent existence as a National Body, he wishes to emphasize a point
 which he is constantly stressing to other National Bodies: you must 
avoid issuing rules and regulations. The fundamentals laid down in the 
Baha'i Administration must, of course, be adhered to, but there is a 
tendency for Assemblies to constantly issue detailed procedures and 
rules to the friends, and he considers this hampers the work of the 
Cause, and is entirely premature. As far as is possible cases which come
 up should be dealt with and settled as they arise, and not a blanket 
ruling be laid down to cover all possible similar cases. This preserves 
the elasticity of the Administrative Order and prevents red tape from 
developing and hampering the work of the Cause. You must likewise bear 
in mind that you are now a wholly independent National Body, and must 
consider the administration of the affairs of the Faith within your 
jurisdiction as your<br>
 separate problem. There is no more need for you to follow every single 
rule laid down by the American N.S.A., than there is for the British or 
the Australian and New Zealand N.S.A.s to do this. Uniformity in 
fundamentals is essential, but not in every detail. On the contrary, 
diversity, the solving of the local situation in the right way, is 
important.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 4 November 1948 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)</p>
<p>	1500. He was particularly pleased to see that members of your 
Assembly have been out travelling and contacting the friends in an 
effort to deepen their understanding of the workings of the 
administration and also their knowledge of the Faith in general. He 
feels that particularly at present in Latin America this intimate, 
loving and friendly approach will do more to further the work than 
anything else. Indeed, he would go so far as to advise your Assembly to 
avoid deluging the friends with circulars and unnecessary bulletins. You
 must always bear in mind the genuine difference between the peoples of 
the south and the peoples of the north; to use the same techniques as 
those adopted in the United States would be disastrous because the 
mentality and background of life are quite different. Much as the 
friends need administration, it must be brought to them in a palatable 
form, otherwise they will not be able to assimilate it and instead of 
consolidating the work you will find some of the believers become 
estranged from it.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 June 1952 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Central America)</p>
<p>	1501. As regards the "Administrative Manual": he urges you to not 
add to the rules and regulations, but try to cut down on these and 
decide cases as they arise; there is a natural tendency to codify the 
teachings and produce handbooks of procedure, there are not enough 
Baha'is in the whole world to justify this, and he continuously urges 
the various National Spiritual Assemblies to beware of this tendency. He
 has no time, at all, to go over such things himself; indeed, your 
Assembly, and all the others, will have to assume increasing 
responsibility for your work in order to relieve him. He is worn out 
with all his work and added material to read. (From a letter dated 19 
June 1953 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual 
Assembly of Central America)<br>

</p><p>	1502. He hopes your Assembly will devote special, constant 
attention to encouraging the friends in their teaching work, and 
facilitate their tasks. As the new National Assemblies are being formed,
 he feels it incumbent upon him to issue a word of warning to avoid 
rules and regulations and tying the believers' work up in red tape. 
Over-administration can be even worse for the Faith at this time than 
under-administration. The believers are, for the most part, young in the
 Cause, and if they make mistakes it is not half as important as if 
their spirit is crushed by being told all the time -- do this and don't 
do that! The new National Body should be like a loving parent, watching 
over and helping its children, and not like a stern judge, waiting for 
an opportunity to display his judicial powers. The reason he points this
 out to you is that constantly, for the past twenty years and more, he 
has been pointing this out to the old and tried National Assemblies, and
 he does not want the younger bodies to make the same mistakes. 
Individual cases should be dealt with as they arise, according to the 
Teachings, of which the believers have quite sufficient available to 
handle all of their problems at this time, and no more additional rules 
and regulations need be introduced.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 June 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska)</p>
<p>	1503. The whole purpose of the Baha'i administrative bodies at this 
time is to teach, to increase the membership, to increase the Assemblies
 and to increase the groups, not to create rules and regulations and 
impede the work through unnecessary red tape, but to ensure that a great
 breath of spiritual vitality and inspiration goes out to the friends 
from their new National Body. Your Assembly should constantly bear this 
in mind, encourage and stimulate the friends in the teaching field, 
smooth out difficulties and misunderstandings and hurt feelings through 
love, understanding and wisdom, refrain from harsh measures, and, above 
all, from over-organization of the affairs of the Communities. There is a
 definite tendency of people everywhere to try and over-administer, so 
to speak, and the beloved Guardian points this out to your Assembly 
during the very first year of its existence in order to put it on its 
guard against this danger, which will stifle the spiritual life of the 
Community. You may<br>
 be sure that many, many times he has issued this same warning to such 
old and tried National Bodies as that of America, Germany, England, etc.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 July 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Benelux countries)</p>
<p>	1504. Your Assembly must be very careful not to overload the Baha'is
 with rules and regulations, circulars and directions. The purpose of 
the administration at this time is to blow on the fire newly kindled in 
the hearts of these people who have accepted the Faith, to create in 
them the desire and capacity to teach, to facilitate the pioneer and 
teaching work, and help deepen the knowledge and understanding of the 
friends. The beloved Guardian issues this word of warning, as long 
experience has shown that it is a tendency on the part of all N.S.A.s to
 over-administer. In their enthusiasm they forget that they only have a 
handful of inexperienced souls to guide, and attempt to deal with their 
work as if they had a large population to regulate! This then stifles 
the spirit of the friends and the teaching work suffers.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 15 July 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia)</p>
<p>	1505. To facilitate matters and avoid misunderstandings he prefers 
to refer you and the individual friends to them. He is sure that you 
will obtain full satisfaction by putting the question to them. The 
purpose of the Guardian in this is not to avoid the issue but only to 
facilitate matters and eliminate misunderstandings. In all such matters 
the friends should first approach the Local, then the National Assembly 
and only in case they can obtain no satisfaction should they approach 
the Guardian on these matters. This way many difficulties will be 
avoided.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 November 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 71 
(February 1933), p. 2)</p>
<p>	1506. Anything whatsoever affecting the interests of the Cause and 
in which the National Assembly as a body is involved should, if regarded
 as unsatisfactory by Local Assemblies or individual believers, be 
immediately referred to the National Assembly itself. Neither the 
general body of the believers, nor any Local Assembly, nor even the 
delegates to the Annual<br>
 Convention should be regarded as having any authority to entertain 
appeals against the decision of the National Assembly. Should the matter
 be referred to the Guardian it will be his duty to consider it with the
 utmost care and to decide whether the issues involved justify him to 
consider it in person, or to leave it entirely to the discretion of the 
National Assembly.</p>
<p>	This administrative principle which the Guardian is now restating 
and emphasizing is so clear, so comprehensive and simple that no 
misunderstanding as to its application, he feels, can possibly arise. 
There are no exceptions whatever to this rule, and the Guardian would 
deprecate any attempt to elaborate or dwell any further upon this 
fundamental and clearly-enunciated principle. The problems with which 
the Faith is now grappling, whether national or international, are so 
pressing and momentous that no one among its loyal adherents can afford 
to dissipate his precious energies on details arising from the 
application of administrative principles, or even on the perfecting of 
the machinery of the administration itself. Purely secondary matters can
 be postponed until the primary tasks are performed.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 10 September 1934 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada)</p>
<p>	1507. As to your second question relative to the right of a 
committee to appeal to the National Spiritual Assembly against the Local
 Assembly by which it has been elected, the Guardian wishes me to inform
 you that this matter, being of a rather secondary character involving 
as it does the application of a minor administrative regulation, is one 
for your National Spiritual Assembly to consider and to decide upon. It 
is a matter that should be left to the discretion of your Assembly.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 January 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1508. When the Local Assembly has given its decision in the matter, 
you then have the right to appeal, if you wish, to the National 
Spiritual Assembly for further consideration of your case. But before 
taking such an action it is your duty as a loyal and steadfast believer 
to whole-heartedly and unreservedly accept the National Spiritual 
Assembly's request to enter into joint conference with your Local 
Assembly. You should have<br>
 confidence that in obeying the orders of your National Assembly you 
will not only succeed in solving your own personal problems with the 
friends, but will in addition set a noble example before them.</p>
<p>	Shoghi Effendi hopes, therefore, that you will follow the advice and
 guidance of the National Spiritual Assembly, confident that the final 
outcome of all these questions will be full justice to you and to 
everybody concerned.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 2 October 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1509. Regarding the matter you mentioned concerning the Chicago 
Spiritual Assembly and one of its members: Whenever there is any 
infringement of Baha'i rights, or lapse in the proper procedure, the 
friends should take the matter up with the Assembly concerned, and, if 
not satisfied, then with the National Spiritual Assembly. This is both 
their privilege and their duty.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 10 July 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1510. Committees should first take up their problems with the 
National Spiritual Assembly and seek to solve them satisfactorily; if 
they are dissatisfied they have the right to appeal to the Guardian 
himself. The Guardian will then decide whether it is a matter for him to
 pronounce upon, or if he will refer it back to the National body.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 March 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1511. Appeal can be made from the Local Assembly's decision to the 
National Assembly, and from the National Assembly's decision to the 
Guardian. But the principle of authority invested in our elected bodies 
must be upheld. This is not something which can be learned without trial
 and test....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 June 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria)</p>
<p>	1512. He suggests you let the entire matter of your appeal drop. 
Unless a very serious major issue is involved (which he does not feel is
 the case this<br>
 time) to drive these subjects home is far more likely to do the Cause 
harm than good. There are many mistakes made, but they are, for the most
 part, not serious enough to warrant creating inharmony and raising 
issues which lead to endless argument and discussion, wasting time and 
energy better spent on creative action.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 December 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1513. The friends have every right to appeal to the Australian 
National Assembly and express their views that ... be allowed to teach 
people of all races as she has been doing; but in the mean time she 
should comply with the wishes of the National Assembly, because all 
Baha'is must learn to live according to the administrative principles of
 our Faith. If they don't, they only undermine the very institutions 
they are trying to create, and which we know, carry the solution to the 
world's problems. It is often difficult to follow this course, but it is
 the one 'Abdu'l-Baha always asked the friends to follow; and obedience,
 even when we believe the instruction is not wise, brings in itself 
blessings from on high.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 29 November 1952 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	X. The Spirit and Form of Baha'i Administration:</p>
<p>	1514. The time is indeed ripe for the manifold activities, wherein 
the servants and handmaids of Baha'u'llah are so devoutly and earnestly 
engaged, to be harmonized and conducted with unity, cooperation and 
efficiency, that the effect of such a combined and systematized effort, 
through which an All-powerful Spirit is steadily pouring, may transcend 
every other achievement of the past, however glorious it has been...</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 24)</p>
<p>	1515. He is constantly yearning for happy news concerning the spread
 of the Message and this, he is firmly convinced, depends mainly on the 
united and combined efforts of the friends and the Assemblies. Without 
unity, co-operation and selfless service the friends will surely be 
unable to attain their goal. How can we possibly increase in number and 
in strength if we do not present a united front to those forces, both 
from without and within, which threaten to undermine the very edifice of
 the Cause? Unity<br>
 is, therefore, the main key to success. And the best way to ensure and 
consolidate the organic unity of the Faith is to strengthen the 
authority of the Local Assemblies and to bring them within the full 
orbit of the National Assembly's jurisdiction. The National Assembly is 
the head, and the Local Assemblies are the various organs of the body of
 the Cause. To ensure full co-operation between these various parts is 
to safeguard the best interests of the Faith by enabling it to 
counteract those forces which threaten to create a breach within the 
ranks of the faithful....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 September 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1516. Administrative efficiency and order should always be 
accompanied by an equal degree of love, of devotion and of spiritual 
development. Both of them are essential and to attempt to dissociate one
 from the other is to deaden the body of the Cause. In these days, when 
the Faith is still in its infancy, great care must be taken lest mere 
administrative routine stifles the spirit which must feed the body of 
the Administration itself. That spirit is its propelling force and the 
motivating power of its very life.</p>
<p>	But as already emphasized, both the spirit and the form are 
essential to the safe and speedy development of the Administration. To 
maintain full balance between them is the main and unique responsibility
 of the administrators of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 10 December 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada)</p>
<p>	1517. He fully appreciates the spirit which has prompted you to 
abide whole-heartedly and without any hesitation by the instructions of 
the National Assembly, and he strongly feels that your attitude in the 
whole matter constitutes an example which the friends will gladly learn 
to follow. You have [sacrificed], and must indeed continue to sacrifice,
 some of your personal opinions and views regarding the teaching work 
for the sake of upholding the authority of the National Spiritual 
Assembly. For such a sacrifice on your part does not involve submission 
to any individual, but has the effect of strengthening the authority of 
the community as a whole as expressed through the medium of its duly 
recognized representatives. We should, indeed, learn to curb our 
individualism when we are confronted with problems and issues affecting 
the general welfare of the<br>
 Cause. For Baha'i community life implies a consciousness of group 
solidarity strong enough to enable every individual believer to give up 
what is essentially personal for the sake of the common weal.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 31 May 1934 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)</p>
<p>	1518. It is indeed thrilling to note the rapidity and soundness with
 which the flourishing Baha'i community in that far-off land is 
establishing the Faith of Baha'u'llah, is fearlessly proclaiming its 
truths, upholding its verities and standards, multiplying its 
institutions, defending its interests, disseminating its literature, and
 exemplifying its invincible power and spirit. I rejoice, feel proud, 
and am eternally grateful. I cannot but pray, with redoubled fervour, to
 Him Who so manifestly guides and sustains you, to increase your 
numbers, to remove every barrier that obstructs your path, to safeguard 
your unity, to bless your undertakings and to enable you to demonstrate,
 afresh and with still greater force, the reality of the faith that 
animates you in the discharge of your sacred duties. Be assured and 
persevere.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 30
 July 1941 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of 
Australia and New Zealand)</p>
<p>	1519. Excommunication is a spiritual thing and up until now the 
Guardian has always been the one who exerted this power, and he feels 
for the present he must continue to be. Only actual enemies of the Cause
 are excommunicated. On the other hand, those who conspicuously disgrace
 the Faith or refuse to abide by its laws can be deprived, as a 
punishment, of their voting rights; this in itself is a severe action, 
and he therefore always urges all National Assemblies (who can take such
 action) to first warn and repeatedly warn the evil-doer before taking 
the step of depriving him of his voting rights. He feels your Assembly 
must act with the greatest wisdom in such matters, and only impose this 
sanction if a believer is seriously injuring the Faith in the eyes of 
the public through his conduct or flagrantly breaking the laws of God. 
If such a sanction were lightly used the friends would come to attach no
 importance to it, or to feel the N.S.A. used it every time they got 
angry with some individual's disobedience to them. We must always 
remember that, sad and often childish as it seems,<br>
 some of those who make the worst nuisances of themselves to their 
National Bodies are often very loyal believers, who think they are 
protecting the true interests of their Faith by attacking N.S.A. 
decisions!</p>
<p>	The Guardian feels very strongly that everywhere, throughout the 
entire Baha'i world, the believers have got to master and follow the 
principles of their divinely laid down Administrative Order. They will 
never solve their problems by departing from the correct procedure.... 
The Baha'is have got to learn to live up to the laws of Baha'u'llah, 
which are infinitely higher, more exacting and more perfect than those 
the world is at present familiar with. Running away, fighting with each 
other, fostering dissension, is not going to advance the Indian or any 
other Community; all it is going to do is to bring Baha'u'llah's plans 
and work to a standstill until such time as the believers unite to serve
 Him, or new and more dedicated souls arise to take their place.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 May 1948 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi 
to the National Spiritual Assembly of India, Pakistan and Burma)</p>
<p>	1520. It is very unfortunate that some of the believers do not seem 
to grasp the fact that the administrative order, the Local and National 
Assemblies, are the pattern for the future, however inadequate they may 
sometimes seem. We must obey and support these bodies, for this is the 
Baha'i law. Until we learn to do this we cannot make real progress. 
Those friends who believe that the N.S.A. is doing wrong in some matters
 are, unconsciously, implying the Guardian does not know what is going 
on, which is not true. He watches very carefully over the various 
National Assemblies, and never hesitates to intervene when he considers 
it necessary. To undermine confidence in the National Body disrupts the 
Faith, confuses and alienates the friends, and prevents the thing the 
Master desired above all else, that the Baha'is be as one spirit in many
 bodies, united and loving.</p>
<p>	The Baha'is are far from perfect, as individuals or when they serve 
on elected bodies, but the system of Baha'u'llah is perfect and 
gradually the believers will mature and the system will work better. The
 watchful eye of the Guardian prevents any serious errors, and the 
believers should know this and co-operate with their Assemblies fully.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 1 November 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1521. The friends should be helped to overcome their problems, 
deepen in the Faith, and increase their unity and their love for each 
other. In this way you will find that your work goes ahead speedily, and
 that the National Body is like the beating of a healthy heart in the 
midst of the Community, pumping spiritual love, energy and encouragement
 out to all the members.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 June 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska)</p>
<p>	1522. The National Assembly is the guardian of the welfare of the 
Faith, a most sacred and heavy responsibility and one which is 
inescapable. They must be ever vigilant, ever on the look-out, ever 
ready to take action, and, on all matters of fundamental principle, 
refuse to compromise for an instant. Only in this way can the body of 
the Faith be free of disease.</p>

</p><p>	I. From the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	1523. Behold how in this Dispensation the worthless and foolish have
 fondly imagined that by such instruments as massacre, plunder and 
banishment they can extinguish the Lamp which the Hand of Divine power 
hath lit, or eclipse the Day Star of everlasting splendor. How utterly 
unaware they seem to be of the truth that such adversity is the oil that
 feedeth the flame of this Lamp! Such is God's transforming power. He 
changeth whatsoever He willeth; He verily hath power over all things....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah" rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), sec. 29, p. 72)</p>
<p>	1524. Pay thou no heed to the humiliation to which the loved ones of
 God have in this Day been subjected. This humiliation is the pride and 
glory of all temporal honor and worldly elevation. What greater honor 
can be imagined than the honor conferred by the Tongue of the Ancient of
 Days when He calleth to remembrance His loved ones in His Most Great 
Prison? The day is approaching when the intervening clouds will have 
been completely dissipated, when the light of the words, "All honor 
belongeth unto God and unto them that love Him," will have appeared, as 
manifest as the sun, above the horizon of the Will of the Almighty.</p>
<p>	Ere long the world and all that is therein shall be as a thing 
forgotten, and all honor shall belong to the loved ones of thy Lord, the
 All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 140, pp. 305-6)</p>
<p>	1525. Say: O people of God! Beware lest the powers of the earth 
alarm you, or the might of the nations weaken you, or the tumult of the 
people of discord deter you, or the exponents of earthly glory sadden 
you. Be ye as a mountain in the Cause of your Lord, the Almighty, the 
All-Glorious, the Unconstrained. (Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent 
of Divine Justice"</p>
<p>	(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 82)<br>

</p><p>	1526. Say: Beware, O people of Baha, lest the strong ones of the
 earth rob you of your strength, or they who rule the world fill you 
with fear. Put your trust in God, and commit your affairs to His 
keeping. He, verily, will, through the power of truth, render you 
victorious, and He, verily, is powerful to do what He willeth, and in 
His grasp are the reins of omnipotent might.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice" p. 82)</p>
<p>	1527. It is incumbent upon all men, each according to his ability, 
to refute the arguments of those that have attacked the Faith of God. 
Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. 
He that wisheth to promote the Cause of the one true God, let him 
promote it through his pen and tongue, rather than have recourse to 
sword or violence. We have, on a previous occasion, revealed this 
injunction, and We now confirm it, if ye be of them that comprehend. By 
the righteousness of Him Who, in this Day, crieth within the inmost 
heart of all created things: "God, there is none other God besides Me!" 
If any man were to arise to defend, in his writings, the Cause of God 
against its assailants, such a man, however inconsiderable his share, 
shall be so honored in the world to come that the Concourse on high 
would envy his glory. No pen can depict the loftiness of his station, 
neither can any tongue describe its splendour. For whosoever standeth 
firm and steadfast in this holy, this glorious, and exalted Revelation, 
such power shall be given him as to enable him to face and withstand all
 that is in heaven and on earth. Of this God is Himself a witness.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 154, pp. 329-30)</p>
<p>	1528. When the victory arriveth, every man shall profess himself as 
believer and shall hasten to the shelter of God's Faith. Happy are they 
who in the days of world-encompassing trials have stood fast in the 
Cause and refused to swerve from its truth.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 150, p. 319)</p>
<p>	II. From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	1529. ...The darkness of error that has enveloped the East and West 
is, in this most great cycle, battling with the light of Divine 
Guidance. Its swords and its spears are very sharp and pointed; its army
 keenly bloodthirsty.<br>

</p><p>	Extracts on Opposition</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 6)</p>
<p>	1530. This day the powers of all the leaders of religion are 
directed towards the dispersion of the congregation of the All-Merciful,
 and the shattering of the Divine Edifice. The hosts of the world, 
whether material, cultural or political are from every side launching 
their assault, for the Cause is great, very great. Its greatness is, in 
this day, clear and manifest to men's eyes.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 6)</p>
<p>	1531. ...How great, how very great is the Cause! How very fierce the
 onslaught of all the peoples and kindreds of the earth. Ere long shall 
the clamor of the multitude throughout Africa, throughout America, the 
cry of the European and of the Turk, the groaning of India and China, be
 heard from far and near. One and all, they shall arise with all their 
power to resist His Cause. Then shall the knights of the Lord, assisted 
by His grace from on high, strengthened by faith, aided by the power of 
understanding, and reinforced by the legions of the Covenant, arise and 
make manifest the truth of the verse: "Behold the confusion that hath 
befallen the tribes of the defeated!"</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected 
Letters", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 17)</p>
<p>	1532. The prestige of the Faith of God has immensely increased. Its 
greatness is now manifest. The day is approaching when it will have cast
 a tremendous tumult in men's hearts. Rejoice, therefore, O denizens of 
America, rejoice with exceeding gladness!</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi,'The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", p. 79)</p>
<p>	1533. O ye beloved of God! When the winds blow severely, rains fall 
fiercely, the lightning flashes, the thunder roars, the bolt descends 
and storms of trial become severe, grieve not; for after this storm, 
verily, the divine spring will arrive, the hills and fields will become 
verdant, the expanses of grain will joyfully wave, the earth will become
 covered with blossoms, the trees will be clothed with green garments 
and adorned with blossoms and fruits. Thus blessings become manifest in 
all countries. These favours are results of those storms and hurricanes.<br>

</p><p>	Therefore, O ye beloved of God, be not grieved when people stand
 against you, persecute you, afflict and trouble you and say all manner 
of evil against you. The darkness will pass away and the light of the 
manifest signs will appear, the veil will be withdrawn and the Light of 
Reality will shine forth from the unseen [Kingdom] of El-Abha. This we 
inform you before it occurs, so that when the hosts of people arise 
against you for my love, be not disturbed or troubled; nay rather, be 
firm as a mountain, for this persecution and reviling of the people upon
 you is a pre-ordained matter. Blessed is the should who is firm in the 
path!</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, "Tablets of Abdul Baha Abbas", voL I (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1930), pp. 12-14)</p>
<p>	1534. ...a large multitude of people will arise against you, showing
 oppression, expressing contumely and derision, shunning your society, 
and heaping upon you ridicule. However, the Heavenly Father will 
illumine you to such an extent that, like unto the rays of the sun, you 
shall scatter the dark clouds of superstition, shine gloriously in the 
midst of Heaven and illumine the face of the earth. You must make firm 
the feet at the time when these trials transpire, and demonstrate 
forbearance and patience. You must withstand them with the utmost love 
and kindness; consider their oppression and persecution as the caprice 
of children, and do not give any importance to whatever they do. For at 
the end the illumination of the Kingdom will overwhelm the darkness of 
the world and the exaltation and grandeur of your station will become 
apparent and manifest...</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 10 (September 1910), pp. 1-2)</p>
<p>	III. From the Writings of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	1535. I am however assured and sustained by the conviction, never 
dimmed in my mind, that whatsoever comes to pass in the Cause of God, 
however disquieting in its immediate effects, is fraught with infinite 
Wisdom and tends ultimately to promote its interests in the world. 
Indeed, our experiences of the distant past, as well as of recent 
events, are too numerous and varied too permit of any misgiving or doubt
 as to the truth<br>
 of this basic principle -- a principle which throughout the 
vicissitudes of our sacred mission in this world we must never disregard
 or forget.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 December 1922 to the National Spiritual 
Assembly of the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i 
Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932" [rev. ed.], (Wilmette: 
Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), p.27)</p>
<p>	1536. That the Cause of God should in the days to come witness many a
 challenging hour and pass through critical stages in preparation for 
the glories of its promised ascendancy in the New World has been time 
and again undeniably affirmed by our departed Master, and is abundantly 
proved to us all by its heroic past and turbulent history....</p>
<p>	(From America, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", pp. 60-61)</p>
<p>	1537. We cannot believe that as the Movement grows in strength, in 
authority and in influence, the perplexities and the sufferings it has 
had to contend with in the past will correspondingly decrease and 
vanish. Nay, as it grows from strength to strength, the fanatical 
defendants of the strongholds of Orthodoxy, whatever be their 
denomination, realizing the penetrating influence of this growing Faith,
 will arise and strain every nerve to extinguish its light and discredit
 its name. For has not our beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha sent forth His glowing 
prophecy from behind the prison walls of the citadel of 'Akka -- words 
so significant in their forecast of the coming world turmoil, yet so 
rich in their promise of eventual victory...</p>
<p>	Dearly-beloved friends, upon us devolves the supreme obligation to 
stand by His side, to fight His battles and to win His victory. May we 
prove ourselves worthy of this trust.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 February 1927 to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932"), p. 
123)</p>
<p>	1538. Viewed in the light of past experience, the inevitable result 
of such futile attempts, however persistent and malicious they may be, 
is to contribute to a wider and deeper recognition by believers and 
unbelievers alike of the distinguishing features of the Faith proclaimed
 by<br>
 Baha'u'llah. These challenging criticisms, whether or not dictated by 
malice, cannot but serve to galvanize the souls of its ardent 
supporters, and to consolidate the ranks of its faithful promoters. They
 will purge the Faith from those pernicious elements whose continued 
association with the believers tends to discredit the fair name of the 
Cause, and to tarnish the purity of its spirit. We should welcome, 
therefore, not only the open attacks which its avowed enemies 
persistently launch against it, but should also view as a blessing in 
disguise every storm of mischief with which they who apostatize their 
faith or claim to be its faithful exponents assail it from time to time.
 Instead of undermining the Faith, such assaults, both from within and 
from without, reinforce its foundations, and excite the intensity of its
 flame. Designed to becloud its radiance, they proclaim to all the world
 the exalted character of its precepts, the completeness of its unity, 
the uniqueness of its position, and the pervasiveness of its influence.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 March 1930 to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", pp. 
15-16)</p>
<p>	1539. For let every earnest upholder of the Cause of Baha'u'llah 
realize that the storms which this struggling Faith of God must needs 
encounter, as the process of the disintegration of society advances, 
shall be fiercer than any which it has already experienced. Let him be 
aware that so soon as the full measure of the stupendous claim of the 
Faith of Baha'u'llah becomes to be recognized by those time-honoured and
 powerful strongholds of orthodoxy, whose deliberate aim is to maintain 
their stranglehold over the thoughts and consciences of men, that this 
infant Faith will have to contend with enemies more powerful and more 
insidious than the cruellest torture-mongers and the most fanatical 
clerics who have afflicted it in the past. What foes may not in the 
course of the convulsions that shall seize a dying civilization be 
brought into existence, who will reinforce the indignities which have 
already been heaped upon it!</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 March 1930 to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", p. 17)</p>
<p>	1540. We have only to refer to the warnings uttered by 'Abdu'l-Baha 
in order to realize the extent and character of the forces that are 
destined to contest with God's holy Faith....<br>

</p><p>	Stupendous as is the struggle which His words foreshadow, they 
also testify to the complete victory which the upholders of the Greatest
 Name are destined eventually to achieve. Peoples, nations, adherents of
 divers faiths, will jointly and successively arise to shatter its 
unity, to sap its force, and to degrade its holy name. They will assail 
not only the spirit which it inculcates, but the administration which is
 the channel, the instrument, the embodiment of that spirit. For as the 
authority with which Baha'u'llah has invested the future Baha'i 
Commonwealth becomes more and more apparent, the fiercer shall be the 
challenge which from every quarter will be thrown at the verities it 
enshrines.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 March 1930 to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", pp. 
17-18)</p>
<p>	1541. Fierce as may seem the onslaught of the forces of darkness 
that may still afflict this Cause, desperate and prolonged as may be 
that struggle, severe as may be the disappointments it may still 
experience, the ascendancy it will eventually obtain will be such as no 
other Faith has ever in its history achieved....</p>
<p>	Who knows but that triumphs, unsurpassed in splendour, are not in 
store for the mass of Baha'u'llah's toiling followers? Surely, we stand 
too near the colossal edifice His hand has reared to be able, at the 
present stage of the evolution of His Revelation, to claim to be able 
even to conceive the full measure of its promised glory. Its past 
history, stained by the blood of countless martyrs, may well inspire us 
with the thought that, whatever may yet befall this Cause, however 
formidable the forces that may still assail it, however numerous the 
reverses it will inevitably suffer, its onward march can never be 
stayed, and that it will continue to advance until the very last 
promise, enshrined within the words of Baha'u'llah, shall have been 
completely redeemed.</p>
<p>	(From the Epilogue to "The Dawn-Breakers: Nabil's Narrative of the 
Early Days of the Baha'i Revelation", trans. and ed. Shoghi Effendi. 
(London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1975), pp. 667-668)</p>
<p>	1542. The separation that has set in between the institutions of the
 Baha'i Faith and the Islamic ecclesiastical organizations that oppose 
it -- a movement that has originated in Egypt and is now spreading 
steadily throughout the Middle East, and will in time communicate its 
influence<br>
 to the West -- imposes upon every loyal upholder of the Cause the 
obligation of refraining from any word or action that might prejudice 
the position which our enemies have, in recent years and of their own 
accord, proclaimed and established.... Our adversaries in the East have 
initiated the struggle. Our future opponents in the West will, in their 
turn, arise and carry it a stage further. Ours is the duty, in 
anticipation of this inevitable contest, to uphold unequivocally and 
with undivided loyalty the integrity of our Faith and demonstrate the 
distinguishing features of its divinely appointed institutions.</p>
<p>	(In the hand writing of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 
15 June 1935 written on his behalf of the National Spiritual Assembly of
 the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i News" 95 (October 
1935), p. 2)</p>
<p>	1543. That the forces of irreligion, of a purely materialistic 
philosophy, of unconcealed paganism have been unloosed, are now 
spreading, and, by consolidating themselves, are beginning to invade 
some of the most powerful Christian institutions of the western world, 
no unbiased observer can fail to admit. That these institutions are 
becoming increasingly restive, that a few among them are already dimly 
aware of the pervasive influence of the Cause of Baha'u'llah, that they 
will, as their inherent strength deteriorates and their discipline 
relaxes, regard with deepening dismay the rise of His New World Order, 
and will gradually determine to assail it, that such an opposition will 
in turn accelerate their decline, few, if any, among those who are 
attentively watching the progress of His Faith would be inclined to 
question.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 March 1936 to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", pp. 
180-81)</p>
<p>	1544. Fierce and manifold will be the assaults with which 
governments, races, classes and religions, jealous of its rising 
prestige and fearful of its consolidating strength, will seek to silence
 its voice and sap its foundations. Unmoved by the relative obscurity 
that surrounds it at the present time, and undaunted by the forces that 
will be arrayed against it in the future, this community, I cannot but 
feel confident, will, no matter how afflictive the agonies of a 
travailing age, pursue its destiny, undeflected in its course, undimmed 
in its serenity, unyielding in its resolve, unshaken in its convictions.<br>

</p><p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter 
dated 5 July 1938 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual 
Assembly of the United States and Canada, published in "Messages to

North America 1932-1946" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1947) 
p. 14)</p>
<p>	1545. The resistless march of the Faith of Baha'u'llah ... propelled
 by the stimulating influences which the unwisdom of its enemies and the
 force latent within itself both engender, resolves itself into a series
 of rhythmic pulsations, precipitated, on the one hand. through the 
explosive outbursts of its foes, and the vibrations of Divine Power, on 
the other, which speed it, with ever-increasing momentum, along that 
predestined course traced for it by the Hand of the Almighty.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 12
 August 1941 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of
 the United States and Canada, published in "Messages to America: 
Selected Letters and Cablegrams Addressed to the Baha'is of North 
America 1932-1946", p. 51)</p>
<p>	1546. How can the beginnings of a world upheaval, unleashing forces 
that are so gravely deranging the social, the religious, the political, 
and the economic equilibrium of organized society, throwing into chaos 
and confusion political systems, racial doctrines, social conceptions, 
cultural standards, religious associations, and trade relationships -- 
how can such agitations, on a scale so vast, so unprecedented, fail to 
produce any repercussions on the institutions of a Faith of such tender 
age whose teachings have a direct and vital bearing on each of these 
spheres of human life and conduct?</p>
<p>	Little wonder, therefore, if they who are holding aloft the banner 
of so pervasive a Faith, so challenging a Cause, find themselves 
affected by the impact of these world-shaking forces. Little wonder if 
they find that in the midst of this whirlpool of contending passions 
their freedom has been curtailed, their tenets contemned, their 
institutions assaulted, their motives maligned, their authority 
jeopardized, their claim rejected.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 December 1938 to the Baha'is of the United 
States and Canada, published in "The Advent of Divine Justice", pp. 2-3)<br>

</p><p>	1547. Let not, however, the invincible army of Baha'u'llah, who 
in the West, and at one of its potential storm-centres is to fight, in 
His name and for His sake, one of its fiercest and most glorious 
battles, be afraid of any criticism that might be directed against it. 
Let it not be deterred by any condemnation with which the tongue of the 
slanderer may seek to debase its motives. Let it not recoil before the 
threatening advance of the forces of fanaticism, of orthodoxy, of 
corruption, and of prejudice that may be leagued against it. The voice 
of criticism is a voice that indirectly reinforces the proclamation of 
its Cause. Unpopularity but serves to throw into greater relief the 
contrast between it and its adversaries, while ostracism is itself the 
magnetic power that must eventually win over to its camp the most 
vociferous and inveterate amongst its foes....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 December 1938 to the Baha'is of the United 
States and Canada, published in "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 42)</p>
<p>	1548. We can discover a no less distinct gradation in the character 
of the opposition it has had to encounter -- ... an opposition which, 
now, through the rise of a divinely appointed Order in the Christian 
West, and its initial impact on civil and ecclesiastical institutions, 
bids fair to include among its supporters established governments and 
systems associated with the most ancient, the most deeply entrenched 
sacerdotal hierarchies in Christendom. We can, at the same time, 
recognize, through the haze of an ever-widening hostility, the progress,
 painful yet persistent, of certain communities within its pale through 
the stages of obscurity, of proscription, of emancipation, and of 
recognition -- stages that must needs culminate in the course of 
succeeding centuries, in the establishment of the Faith, and the 
founding, in the plenitude of its power and authority, of the 
world-embracing Baha'i Commonwealth....</p>
<p>	("God Passes By", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), Foreword p. xvii)</p>
<p>	1549. Nor should a survey of the outstanding features of so blessed 
and fruitful a ministry omit mention of the prophecies which the 
unerring pen of the appointed Center of Baha'u'llah's Covenant has 
recorded. These foreshadow the fierceness of the onslaught that the 
resistless march of the Faith must provoke in the West, in India and in 
the Far East when it meets the time-honored sacerdotal orders of the 
Christian, the<br>
 Buddhist and Hindu religions. They foreshadow the turmoil which its 
emancipation from the fetters of religious orthodoxy will cast in the 
American, the European, the Asiatic and African continents....</p>
<p>	("God Passes By", p. 315)</p>
<p>	1550. Despite the blows leveled at its nascent strength, whether by 
the wielders of temporal and spiritual authority from without, or by 
black-hearted foes from within, the Faith of Baha'u'llah had, far from 
breaking or bending, gone from strength to strength, from victory to 
victory. Indeed its history, if read aright, may be said to resolve 
itself into a series of pulsations, of alternating crisis and triumphs, 
leading it ever nearer to its divinely appointed destiny....</p>
<p>	("God Passes By", p. 409)</p>
<p>	1551. The tribulations attending the progressive unfoldment of the 
Faith of Baha'u'llah have indeed been such as to exceed in gravity those
 from which the religions of the past have suffered. Unlike those 
religions, however, these tribulations have failed utterly to impair its
 unity, or to create, even temporarily, a breach in the ranks of its 
adherents. It has not only survived these ordeals, but has emerged, 
purified and inviolate, endowed with greater capacity to face and 
surmount any crisis which its resistless march may engender in the 
future.</p>
<p>	("God Passes By", p. 410)</p>
<p>	1552. Whatever may befall this infant Faith of God in future decades
 or in succeeding centuries, whatever the sorrows, dangers and 
tribulations which the next stage in its world-wide development may 
engender, from whatever quarter the assaults to be launched by its 
present or future adversaries may be unleashed against it, however great
 the reverses and setbacks it may suffer, we, who have been privileged 
to apprehend, to the degree our finite minds can fathom, the 
significance of these marvelous phenomena associated with its rise and 
establishment, can harbor no doubt that what it has already achieved in 
the first hundred years of its life provides sufficient guarantee that 
it will continue to forge ahead, capturing loftier heights, tearing down
 every obstacle, opening up new horizons and winning still mightier 
victories until its glorious mission, stretching into the dim ranges of 
time that lie ahead, is totally fulfilled.<br>

</p><p>	("God Passes By", p. 412)</p>
<p>	1553. No opportunity, in view of the necessity of ensuring the 
harmonious development of the Faith, should be ignored, which its 
potential enemies, whether ecclesiastical or otherwise, may offer, to 
set forth, in a restrained and unprovocative language, its aims and 
tenets, to defend its interests, to proclaim its universality, to assert
 the supernatural, the supranational and non-political character of its 
institutions, and its acceptance of the Divine origin of the Faiths 
which have preceded it....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 June 1947 to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "Citadel of Faith: Messages to America 1947-1957" 
(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), p. 23)</p>
<p>	1554. Indeed this fresh ordeal that has, in pursuance of the 
mysterious dispensations of Providence, afflicted the Faith at this 
unexpected hour, far from dealing a fatal blow to its institutions or 
existence, should be regarded as a blessing in disguise, not a 
"calamity" but a "providence" of God, not a devastating flood but a 
"gentle rain" on a "green pasture", a "wick" and "oil" unto the "lamp" 
of His Faith, a "nurture" for His Cause, "water for that which has been 
planted in the hearts of men", a "crown set on the head" of His 
Messenger for this Day.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 20
 August 1955 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of

<p>	IV. From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	1555. ...when the very progress of the Cause on the one hand, and 
the corresponding decline in ecclesiastical organizations on the other 
will inevitably incite Christian ecclesiastical leaders to vehemently 
oppose and undermine the Faith, the believers will then have a real 
chance to defend and vindicate the Cause....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 May 1938 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	1556. The matter of refuting attacks and criticisms directed against
 the Cause through the press is, he feels, one which devolves on the 
National Spiritual Assembly to consider. This body, whether directly or 
through<br>
 the agency of its committees, should decide as to the advisability of 
answering any such attacks, and also should carefully examine and pass 
upon any statements which the friends wish to send to the press to this 
effect. Only through such supervision and control of all Baha'i press 
activities can the friends hope to avoid confusion and misunderstanding 
in their own minds and in the mind of the general public whom they can 
reach through the press.</p>
<p>	The Guardian would advise, therefore, that henceforth you seek the 
guidance and approval of the National Spiritual Assembly in all your 
attempts to refute the criticisms of the enemies of the Cause, as there 
are certain cases when it is an absolute loss of time and energy, and 
even perhaps positively harmful, to counteract such attacks, which often
 lead to interminable and fruitless controversies. The National 
Spiritual Assembly can best advise you as to what action to take in such
 matters.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 September 1938 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1557. The friends . . . should not feel bewildered, for they have 
the assurance of Baha'u'llah that whatever the nature and character of 
the forces of opposition facing His Cause, its eventual triumph is 
indubitably certain.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 August 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1558. We have every reason to hope and believe that in the future 
many of the truly enlightened clergy may seek the shelter of 
Baha'u'llah, just as we feel certain that we may also expect at some 
future date a keen antagonism to our Faith on the part of those who do 
not see in it the salvation of the world, but rather challenge to their 
own fame and position.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 July 1942 to a group of believers)</p>
<p>	1559. It seems both strange and pitiful that the Church and clergy 
should always, in every age, be the most bitter opponents of the very 
Truth they are continually admonishing their followers to be prepared to
 receive! They have become so violently attached to the form that the 
substance itself eludes them!</p>
<p>	However, such denunciations as those your minister made publicly 
against you and the Baha'i Faith can do no harm to the Cause at all; on<br>
 the contrary they only serve to spread its name abroad and mark it as an independent religion.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 7 February 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1560. Although this may temporarily prove an embarrassment to your 
work, and a set-back, there is no doubt that it signalizes a step 
forward in the advance of the Faith; for we know that our beloved Faith 
must eventually clash with the entrenched orthodoxies of the past; and 
that this conflict cannot but lead to greater victories, and to ultimate
 emancipation, recognition and ascendancy.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 April 1951 to two believers)</p>
<p>	1561. We are bound to meet with increasing opposition from 
Church-dominated countries, but our counter-moves must be carefully 
undertaken. He would like you to always consult him in matters which 
bring the Faith before government or Church bodies in cases of this 
kind.</p>

<p>	August 1985</p>
<p>	Compiled by: The Research Department of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	Extracts from the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	1562. This is the Day in which God's most excellent favours have 
been poured out upon men, the Day in which His most mighty grace hath 
been infused into all created things. It is incumbent upon all the 
peoples of the world to reconcile their differences, and, with perfect 
unity and peace, abide beneath the shadow of the Tree of His care and 
loving-kindness. It behoveth them to cleave to whatsoever will, in this 
Day, be conducive to the exaltation of their stations, and to the 
promotion of their best interests....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), p. 6)</p>
<p>	1563. God's purpose in sending His Prophets unto men is twofold. The
 first is to liberate the children of men from the darkness of 
ignorance, and guide them to the light of true understanding. The second
 is to ensure the peace and tranquillity of mankind, and provide all the
 means by which they can be established.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah" pp. 79-80)</p>
<p>	1564. O ye that dwell on earth! The distinguishing feature that 
marketh the preeminent character of this Supreme Revelation consisteth 
in that We have ... laid down the essential prerequisites of concord, of
 understanding, of complete and enduring unity. Well is it with them 
that keep My statutes.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", p. 97)</p>
<p>	1565. The Great Being, wishing to reveal the prerequisites of the 
peace and tranquillity of the world and the advancement of its peoples, 
hath written: The time must come when the imperative necessity for the 
holding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will be 
universally realized. The<br>
 rulers and kings of the earth must needs attend it, and, participating 
in its deliberations, must consider such ways and means as will lay the 
foundations of the world's Great Peace amongst men. Such a peace 
demandeth that the Great Powers should resolve, for the sake of the 
tranquillity of the peoples of the earth, to be fully reconciled among 
themselves. Should any king take up arms against another, all should 
unitedly arise and prevent him. If this be done, the nations of the 
world will no longer require any armaments, except for the purpose of 
preserving the security of their realms and of maintaining internal 
order within their territories. This will ensure the peace and composure
 of every people, government and nation. We fain would hope that the 
kings and rulers of the earth, the mirrors of the gracious and almighty 
name of God, may attain unto this station, and shield mankind from the 
onslaught of tyranny....The day is approaching when all the peoples of 
the world will have adopted one universal language and one common 
script. When this is achieved, to whatsoever city a man may journey, it 
shall be as if he were entering his own home. These things are 
obligatory and absolutely essential. It is incumbent upon every man of 
insight and understanding to strive to translate that which hath been 
written into reality and action.... That one indeed is a man who, today,
 dedicateth himself to the service of the entire human race. The Great 
Being saith: Blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best 
interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth. In another passage 
He hath proclaimed: It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his 
own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is
 but one country, and mankind its citizens.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", pp. 249-250)</p>
<p>	1566. O ye rulers of the earth! Wherefore have ye clouded the 
radiance of the Sun, and caused it to cease from shining? Hearken unto 
the counsel given you by the Pen of the Most High, that haply both ye 
and the poor may attain unto tranquillity and peace. We beseech God to 
assist the kings of the earth to establish peace on earth. He, verily, 
doth what He willeth. O kings of the earth! We see you increasing every 
year your expenditures, and laying the burden thereof on your subjects. 
This, verily, is wholly and grossly unjust. Fear the sighs and tears of 
this Wronged One, and lay not excessive burdens on your peoples. Do not 
rob them to rear palaces for yourselves; nay rather choose for them that
 which ye choose<br>
 for yourselves. Thus We unfold to your eyes that which profiteth you, 
if ye but perceive. Your people are your treasures. Beware lest your 
rule violate the commandments of God, and ye deliver your wards to the 
hands of the robber. By them ye rule, by their means ye subsist, by 
their aid ye conquer. Yet, how disdainfully ye look upon them! How 
strange, how very strange!</p>
<p>	Now that ye have refused the Most Great Peace, hold ye fast unto 
this, the Lesser Peace, that haply ye may in some degree better your own
 condition and that of your dependents. O rulers of the earth! Be 
reconciled among yourselves, that ye may need no more armaments save in a
 measure to safeguard your territories and dominions. Beware lest ye 
disregard the counsel of the All-Knowing, the Faithful. Be united, O 
kings of the earth, for thereby will the tempest of discord be stilled 
amongst you, and your peoples find rest, if ye be of them that 
comprehend. Should any one among you take up arms against another, rise 
ye all against him, for this is naught but manifest justice.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah" pp. 253-254)</p>
<p>	1567. The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are 
unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established. This 
unity can never be achieved so long as the counsels which the Pen of the
 Most High hath revealed are suffered to pass unheeded.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", p. 286)</p>
<p>	1568. We pray God -- exalted be His glory -- and cherish the hope 
that He may graciously assist the manifestations of affluence and power 
and the daysprings of sovereignty and glory, the kings of the earth -- 
may God aid them through His strengthening grace -- to establish the 
Lesser Peace. This, indeed, is the greatest means for ensuring the 
tranquillity of the nations. It is incumbent upon the Sovereigns of the 
world -- may God assist them -- unitedly to hold fast unto this Peace, 
which is the chief instrument for the protection of all mankind. It is 
Our hope that they will arise to achieve what will be conducive to the 
well-being of man. It is their duty to convene an all-inclusive 
assembly, which either they themselves or their ministers will attend, 
and to enforce whatever measures are required to establish unity and 
concord amongst men. They must put<br>
 away the weapons of war, and turn to the instruments of universal 
reconstruction. Should one king rise up against another, all the other 
kings must arise to deter him. Arms and armaments will, then, be no more
 needed beyond that which is necessary to ensure the internal security 
of their respective countries. If they attain unto this all-surpassing 
blessing, the people of each nation will pursue, with tranquillity and 
contentment, their own occupations, and the groanings and lamentations 
of most men would be silenced. We beseech God to aid them to do His will
 and pleasure. He, verily, is the Lord of the throne on high and of 
earth below, and the Lord of this world and of the world to come. It 
would be preferable and more fitting that the highly-honoured kings 
themselves should attend such an assembly, and proclaim their edicts. 
Any king who will arise and carry out this task, he, verily will, in the
 sight of God, become the cynosure of all kings. Happy is he, and great 
is his blessedness!</p>
<p>	("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988), pp. 30-31)</p>
<p>	1569. The sixth Glad-Tidings is the establishment of the Lesser 
Peace, details of which have formerly been revealed from Our Most 
Exalted Pen. Great is the blessedness of him who upholdeth it and 
observeth whatsoever hath been ordained by God, the All-Knowing, the 
All-Wise.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988), p.23)</p>
<p>	1570. ... In all matters moderation is desirable. If a thing is 
carried to excess, it will prove a source of evil. Consider the 
civilization of the West, how it hath agitated and alarmed the peoples 
of the world. An infernal engine hath been devised, and hath proved so 
cruel a weapon of destruction that its like none hath ever witnessed or 
heard. The purging of such deeply-rooted and overwhelming corruptions 
cannot be effected unless the peoples of the world unite in pursuit of 
one common aim and embrace one universal faith. Incline your ears unto 
the Call of this Wronged One and adhere firmly to the Lesser Peace.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 69)</p>
<p>	1571. First: It is incumbent upon the ministers of the House of 
Justice to promote the Lesser Peace so that the people of the earth may 
be relieved<br>
 from the burden of exorbitant expenditures. This matter is imperative 
and absolutely essential, inasmuch as hostilities and conflict lie at 
the root of affliction and calamity.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 89)</p>
<p>	1572. In the abundance of Our grace and loving-kindness We have 
revealed specially for the rulers and ministers of the world that which 
is conducive to safety and protection, tranquillity and peace; haply the
 children of men may rest secure from the evils of oppression. He, 
verily, is the Protector, the Helper, the Giver of victory. It is 
incumbent upon the men of God's House of Justice to fix their gaze by 
day and by night upon that which hath shone forth from the Pen of Glory 
for the training of peoples, the upbuilding of nations, the protection 
of man and the safeguarding of his honour.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 125)</p>
<p>	1573. ... They that are possessed of wealth and invested with 
authority and power must show the profoundest regard for religion. In 
truth, religion is a radiant light and an impregnable stronghold for the
 protection and welfare of the peoples of the world, for the fear of God
 impelleth man to hold fast to that which is good, and shun all evil. 
Should the lamp of religion be obscured, chaos and confusion will ensue,
 and the lights of fairness and justice, of tranquillity and peace cease
 to shine. Unto this will bear witness every man of true understanding.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 125)</p>
<p>	1574. We have enjoined upon all mankind to establish the Most Great 
Peace -- the surest of all means for the protection of humanity. The 
sovereigns of the world should, with one accord, hold fast thereunto, 
for this is the supreme instrument that can ensure the security and 
welfare of all peoples and nations. They, verily, are the manifestations
 of the power of God and the daysprings of His authority. We beseech the
 Almighty that He may graciously assist them in that which is conducive 
to the well-being of their subjects. A full explanation regarding this 
matter hath been previously set forth by the Pen of Glory; well is it 
with them that act accordingly.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 126)<br>

</p><p>	1575. The purpose of religion as revealed from the heaven of 
God's holy Will is to establish unity and concord amongst the peoples of
 the world; make it not the cause of dissension and strife. The religion
 of God and His divine law are the most potent instruments and the 
surest of all means for the dawning of the light of unity amongst men. 
The progress of the world, the development of nations, the tranquillity 
of peoples, and the peace of all who dwell on earth are among the 
principles and ordinances of God. Religion bestoweth upon man the most 
precious of all gifts, offereth the cup of prosperity, imparteth eternal
 life, and showereth imperishable benefits upon mankind. It behoveth the
 chiefs and rulers of the world, and in particular the Trustees of God's
 House of Justice, to endeavour to the utmost of their power to 
safeguard its position, promote its interests and exalt its station in 
the eyes of the world. In like manner it is incumbent upon them to 
enquire into the conditions of their subjects and to acquaint themselves
 with the affairs and activities of the divers communities in their 
dominions. We call upon the manifestations of the power of God -- the 
sovereigns and rulers on earth -- to bestir themselves and do all in 
their power that haply they may banish discord from this world and 
illumine it with the light of concord.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, pp. 129-130)</p>
<p>	1576. Our hope is that the world's religious leaders and the rulers 
thereof will unitedly arise for the reformation of this age and the 
rehabilitation of its fortunes. Let them, after meditating on its needs,
 take counsel together and, through anxious and full deliberation, 
administer to a diseased and sorely-afflicted world the remedy it 
requireth.</p>
<p>	The Great Being saith: The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with
 the two luminaries of consultation and compassion. Take ye counsel 
together in all matters, inasmuch as consultation is the lamp of 
guidance which leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 168)</p>
<p>	1577. Take ye counsel together, and let your concern be only for 
that which profiteth mankind and bettereth the condition thereof ... 
Regard the world as the human body which, though created whole and 
perfect, has been afflicted, through divers causes, with grave ills and 
maladies. Not for one day did it rest, nay its sicknesses waxed more 
severe, as it fell under the treatment of unskilled physicians who have<br>
 spurred on the steed of their worldly desires and have erred 
grievously. And if at one time, through the care of an able physician, a
 member of that body was healed, the rest remained afflicted as before. 
Thus informeth you the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.... That which the Lord
 hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the 
healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one 
universal Cause, one common Faith. This can in no wise be achieved 
except through the power of a skilled, an all powerful and inspired 
Physician. This verily is the truth, and all else naught but error.</p>
<p>	Consider these days in which the Ancient Beauty, He Who is the Most 
Great Name, hath been sent down to regenerate and unify mankind. Behold 
how with drawn swords they rose against Him, and committed that which 
caused the Faithful Spirit to tremble. And whenever We said unto them: 
'Lo, the World Reformer is come,' they made reply: 'He, in truth, is one
 of the stirrers of mischief' ...</p>

Effendi, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", rev. ed.

<p>	Extracts from the Utterances of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	1578. ... Praise be to God that thou hast attained!... Thou hast 
come to see a prisoner and an exile.... We desire but the good of the 
world and happiness of the nations; yet they deem us a stirrer up of 
strife and sedition worthy of bondage and banishment.... That all 
nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the 
bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should be 
strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease, and differences 
of race be annulled -- what harm is there in this?... Yet so it shall 
be; these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the
 "Most Great Peace" shall come.... Do not you in Europe need this also? 
Is not this that which Christ foretold?... Yet do we see your kings and 
rulers lavishing their treasures more freely on means for the 
destruction of the human race than on that which would conduce to the 
happiness of mankind.... These strifes and this bloodshed and discord 
must cease, and all men be as one kindred and one family.... Let not a 
man glory in this, that he loves his country; let him rather glory in 
this, that he loves his kind....</p>
<p>	(Words spoken. to E. G. Browne, from his pen portrait of 
Baha'u'llah, J. E. Esslemont, "Baha'u'llah and the New Era", 5th rev. 
ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), pp. 39-40)<br>

</p><p>	Extracts from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	1579. Know thou that all the powers combined have not the power to 
establish universal peace, nor to withstand the overmastering dominion, 
at every time and season, of these endless wars. Ere long, however, 
shall the power of heaven, the dominion of the Holy Spirit, hoist on the
 high summits the banners of love and peace, and there above the castles
 of majesty and might shall those banners wave in the rushing winds that
 blow out of the tender mercy of God.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 174)</p>
<p>	1580. Rest thou assured that in this era of the spirit, the Kingdom 
of Peace will raise up its tabernacle on the summits of the world, and 
the commandments of the Prince of Peace will so dominate the arteries 
and nerves of every people as to draw into His sheltering shade all the 
nations on earth. From springs of love and truth and unity will the true
 Shepherd give His sheep to drink.</p>
<p>	O handmaid of God, peace must first be established among 
individuals, until it leadeth in the end to peace among nations. 
Wherefore, O ye Baha'is, strive ye with all your might to create, 
through the power of the Word of God, genuine love, spiritual communion 
and durable bonds among individuals. This is your task.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 246)</p>
<p>	1581. So long as these prejudices [religious, racial, national, political] survive, there will be continuous and fearsome wars.</p>
<p>	To remedy this condition there must be universal peace. To bring 
this about, a Supreme Tribunal must be established, representative of 
all governments and peoples; questions both national and international 
must be referred thereto, and all must carry out the decrees of this 
Tribunal. Should any government or people disobey, let the whole world 
arise against that government or people.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 249)</p>
<p>	1582. At present universal peace is a matter of great importance, 
but unity of conscience is essential, so that the foundation of this 
matter may become secure, its establishment firm and its edifice strong.<br>

</p><p>	Therefore Baha'u'llah, fifty years ago, expounded this question 
of universal peace at a time when He was confined in the fortress of 
'Akka and was wronged and imprisoned.... </p>
<p>	Among His teachings was the declaration of universal peace....the 
teachings of Baha'u'llah were not limited to the establishment of 
universal peace. They embraced many teachings which supplemented and 
supported that of universal peace.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	In fine, such teachings are numerous. These manifold principles, 
which constitute the greatest basis for the felicity of mankind and are 
of the bounties of the Merciful, must be added to the matter of 
universal peace and combined with it, so that results may accrue. 
Otherwise the realization of universal peace by itself in the world of 
mankind is difficult. As the teachings of Baha'u'llah are combined with 
universal peace, they are like a table provided with every kind of fresh
 and delicious food. Every soul can find, at that table of infinite 
bounty, that which he desires. If the question is restricted to 
universal peace alone, the remarkable results which are expected and 
desired will not be attained. The scope of universal peace must be such 
that all the communities and religions may find their highest wish 
realized in it. The teachings of Baha'u'llah are such that all the 
communities of the world, whether religious, political or ethical, 
ancient or modern, find in them the expression of their highest wish.</p>
<p>	For example, the question of universal peace, about which 
Baha'u'llah says that the Supreme Tribunal must be established: although
 the League of Nations has been brought into existence, yet it is 
incapable of establishing universal peace. But the Supreme Tribunal 
which Baha'u'llah has described will fulfil this sacred task with the 
utmost might and power. And His plan is this: that the national 
assemblies of each country and nation -- that is to say parliaments -- 
should elect two or three persons who are the choicest of that nation, 
and are well informed concerning international laws and the relations 
between governments and aware of the essential needs of the world of 
humanity in this day. The number of these representatives should be in 
proportion to the number of inhabitants of that country. The election of
 these souls who are chosen by the national assembly, that is, the 
parliament, must be confirmed by the upper house, the congress and the 
cabinet and also by the president<br>
 or monarch so these persons may be the elected ones of all the nation 
and the government. The Supreme Tribunal will be composed of these 
people, and all mankind will thus have a share therein, for every one of
 these delegates is fully representative of his nation.[1] When the 
Supreme Tribunal gives a ruling on any international question, either 
unanimously or by majority rule, there will no longer be any pretext for
 the plaintiff or ground of objection for the defendant. In case any of 
the governments or nations, in the execution of the irrefutable decision
 of the Supreme Tribunal, be negligent or dilatory, the rest of the 
nations will rise up against it, because all the governments and nations
 of the world are the supporters of this Supreme Tribunal. Consider what
 a firm foundation this is! But by a limited and restricted League the 
purpose will not be realized as it ought and should. This is the truth 
about the situation, which has been stated....<br>
 [1 The translation of this sentence has been revised since the publication of "Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha"]</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", pp. 297-298, p. 304, pp. 306-307)</p>
<p>	1583. True civilization will unfurl its banner in the midmost heart 
of the world whenever a certain number of its distinguished and 
high-minded sovereigns -- the shining exemplars of devotion and 
determination -- shall, for the good and happiness of all mankind, 
arise, with firm resolve and clear vision, to establish the Cause of 
Universal Peace. They must make the Cause of Peace the object of general
 consultation, and seek by every means in their power to establish a 
Union of the nations of the world. They must conclude a binding treaty 
and establish a covenant, the provisions of which shall be sound, 
inviolable and definite. They must proclaim it to all the world and 
obtain for it the sanction of all the human race. This supreme and noble
 undertaking -- the real source of the peace and well-being of all the 
world -- should be regarded as sacred by all that dwell on earth. All 
the forces of humanity must be mobilized to ensure the stability and 
permanence of this Most Great Covenant. In this all-embracing Pact the 
limits and frontiers of each and every nation should be clearly fixed, 
the principles underlying the relations of governments towards one 
another definitely laid down, and all international agreements and 
obligations ascertained. In like manner,<br>
 the size of the armaments of every government should be strictly 
limited, for if the preparations for war and the military forces of any 
nation should be allowed to increase, they will arouse the suspicion of 
others. The fundamental principle underlying this solemn Pact should be 
so fixed that if any government later violate any one of its provisions,
 all the governments on earth should arise to reduce it to utter 
submission, nay the human race as a whole should resolve, with every 
power at its disposal, to destroy that government. Should this greatest 
of all remedies be applied to the sick body of the world, it will 
assuredly recover from its ills and will remain eternally safe and 
secure.</p>
<p>	Observe that if such a happy situation be forthcoming, no government
 would need continually to pile up the weapons of war, nor feel itself 
obliged to produce ever new military weapons with which to conquer the 
human race. A small force for the purposes of internal security, the 
correction of criminal and disorderly elements and the prevention of 
local disturbances, would be required -- no more. In this way the entire
 population would, first of all, be relieved of the crushing burden of 
expenditure currently imposed for military purposes, and secondly, great
 numbers of people would cease to devote their time to the continual 
devising of new weapons of destruction -- those testimonials of greed 
and bloodthirstiness, so inconsistent with the gift of life -- and would
 instead bend their efforts to the production of whatever will foster 
human existence and peace and well-being, and would become the cause of 
universal development and prosperity. Then every nation on earth will 
reign in honour, and every people will be cradled in tranquillity and 
content.</p>
<p>	A few, unaware of the power latent in human endeavour, consider this
 matter as highly impracticable, nay even beyond the scope of man's 
utmost efforts. Such is not the case, however. On the contrary, thanks 
to the unfailing grace of God, the loving-kindness of His favoured ones,
 the unrivaled endeavours of wise and capable souls, and the thoughts 
and ideas of the peerless leaders of this age, nothing whatsoever can be
 regarded as unattainable. Endeavour, ceaseless endeavour, is required. 
Nothing short of an indomitable determination can possibly achieve it. 
Many a cause which past ages have regarded as purely visionary, yet in 
this day has become most easy and practicable. Why should this most 
great and lofty Cause -- the day-star of the firmament of true 
civilization and<br>
 the cause of the glory, the advancement, the well-being and the success
 of all humanity -- be regarded as impossible of achievement? Surely the
 day will come when its beauteous light shall shed illumination upon the
 assemblage of man.</p>
<p>	The apparatus of conflict will, as preparations go on at their 
present rate, reach the point where war will become something 
intolerable to mankind.</p>
<p>	It is clear from what has already been said that man's glory and 
greatness do not consist in his being avid for blood and sharp of claw, 
in tearing down cities and spreading havoc, in butchering armed forces 
and civilians. What would mean a bright future for him would be his 
reputation for justice, his kindness to the entire population whether 
high or low, his building up countries and cities, villages and 
districts, his making life easy, peaceful and happy for his fellow 
beings, his laying down fundamental principles for progress, his raising
 the standards and increasing the wealth of the entire population.</p>
<p>	No power on earth can prevail against the armies of justice, and 
every citadel must fall before them; for men willingly go down under the
 triumphant strokes of this decisive blade, and desolate places bloom 
and flourish under the tramplings of this host. There are two mighty 
banners which, when they cast their shadow across the crown of any king,
 will cause the influence of his government quickly and easily to 
penetrate the whole earth, even as if it were the light of the sun: the 
first of these two banners is wisdom; the second is justice. Against 
these two most potent forces, the iron hills cannot prevail, and 
Alexander's wall will break before them. It is clear that life in this 
fast-fading world is as fleeting and inconstant as the morning wind, and
 this being so, how fortunate are the great who leave a good name behind
 them, and the memory of a lifetime spent in the pathway of the good 
pleasure of God.</p>
<p>	A conquest can be a praiseworthy thing, and there are times when war
 becomes the powerful basis of peace, and ruin the very means of 
reconstruction. If, for example, a high-minded sovereign marshals his 
troops to block the onset of the insurgent and the aggressor, or again, 
if he takes the field and distinguishes himself in a struggle to unify a
 divided state and people, if, in brief, he is waging war for a 
righteous purpose, then this seeming wrath is mercy itself, and this 
apparent tyranny the very substance of justice and this warfare the 
cornerstone of peace. Today, the<br>
 task befitting great rulers is to establish universal peace, for in this lies the freedom of all peoples.</p>
<p>	("The Secret of Divine Civilization" 2nd ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), pp. 64-67, 70-71)</p>
<p>	1584. In cycles gone by, though harmony was established, yet, owing 
to the absence of means, the unity of all mankind could not have been 
achieved. Continents remained widely divided, nay even among the peoples
 of one and the same continent association and interchange of thought 
were well nigh impossible. Consequently intercourse, understanding and 
unity amongst all the peoples and kindreds of the earth were 
unattainable. In this day, however, means of communication have 
multiplied, and the five continents of the earth have virtually merged 
into one.... In like manner all the members of the human family, whether
 peoples or governments, cities or villages, have become increasingly 
interdependent. For none is self-sufficiency any longer possible, 
inasmuch as political ties unite all peoples and nations, and the bonds 
of trade and industry, of agriculture and education, are being 
strengthened every day. Hence the unity of all mankind can in this day 
be achieved. Verily this is none other but one of the wonders of this 
wondrous age, this glorious century. Of this past ages have been 
deprived, for this century -- the century of light -- has been endowed 
with unique and unprecedented glory, power and illumination. Hence the 
miraculous unfolding of a fresh marvel every day. Eventually it will be 
seen how bright its candles will burn in the assemblage of man.</p>
<p>	Behold how its light is now dawning upon the world's darkened 
horizon. The first candle is unity in the political realm, the early 
glimmerings of which can now be discerned. The second candle is unity of
 thought in world undertakings, the consummation of which will ere long 
be witnessed. The third candle is unity in freedom which will surely 
come to pass. The fourth candle is unity in religion which is the 
corner-stone of the foundation itself and which, by the power of God, 
will be revealed in all its splendour. The fifth candle is the unity of 
nations -- a unity which in this century will be securely established, 
causing all the peoples of the world to regard themselves as citizens of
 one common fatherland. The sixth candle is unity of races, making of 
all that dwell on earth peoples and kindreds of one race. The seventh 
candle is unity of language, i.e., the choice of a universal tongue in 
which all peoples will be instructed and converse. Each and every one of
 these will inevitably come to pass, inasmuch as the power of the 
Kingdom of God will aid and assist in their realization.<br>

<p>	1585. ...every great Cause in this world of existence findeth 
visible expression through three means: first, intention; second, 
confirmation; third, action. Today on this earth there are many souls 
who are promoters of peace and reconciliation and are longing for the 
realization of the oneness and unity of the world of humanity; but this 
intention needeth a dynamic power, so that it may become manifest in the
 world of being. In this day the divine instructions and lordly 
exhortations promulgate this most great aim, and the confirmations of 
the Kingdom also support and aid the realization of this intention. 
Therefore, although the combined forces and thoughts of the nations of 
the world cannot by themselves achieve this exalted purpose, the power 
of the Word of God penetrateth all things and the assistance of the 
divine Kingdom is continuous. Erelong it will become evident and clear 
that the ensign of the Most Great Peace is the teachings of Baha'u'llah,
 and the tent of union and harmony among nations is the Tabernacle of 
the divine Kingdom, for therein the intention, the power and the action,
 all three, are brought together. The realization of everything in the 
world of being dependeth upon these three elements.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from Persian)</p>
<p>	1586. As far as possible, rest thou not for a moment, travel to the 
North and South of the country and summon all men to the oneness of the 
world of humanity and to universal peace, saying:</p>
<p>	O people! Baha'u'llah laid the foundation of universal peace fifty 
years ago. He even addressed Epistles to the kings wherein He declared 
that war could destroy the foundation of the world of humanity, that 
peace is conducive to everlasting life and that dire peril awaited 
mankind. Also three years before the outbreak of the world war 
'Abdu'l-Baha travelled to America and most of Europe, where he raised 
His voice before all gatherings, societies and churches, appealing: O ye
 assemblage of men! The continent of Europe hath virtually become an 
arsenal filled with explosives. There are vast stores of destructive 
material hidden underground, liable to burst forth at a single spark, 
causing the whole earth to quake. O ye men of understanding!<br>

</p><p>	Bestir yourselves that perchance this accumulation of volatile 
material may not explode. But the appeal went unheeded and consequently 
this murderous war broke out.</p>
<p>	The bulk of humanity now realiseth what a great calamity war is and 
how war turneth man into a ferocious animal, causing prosperous cities 
and villages to be reduced to ruins and the foundations of the human 
edifice to crumble. Now, since all men have been awakened and their ears
 are attentive, it is time for the promulgation of universal peace -- a 
peace based on righteousness and justice -- that mankind may not be 
exposed to further dangers in the future. Now is the dawn of universal 
peace, and the first streaks of its light are beginning to appear. We 
earnestly hope that its effulgent orb may shine forth and flood the East
 and the West with its radiance. The establishment of universal peace is
 not possible save through the power of the Word of God...</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1587. Chaos and confusion are daily increasing in the world. They 
will attain such intensity as to render the frame of mankind unable to 
bear them. Then will men be awakened and become aware that religion is 
the impregnable stronghold and the manifest light of the world, and its 
laws, exhortations and teachings the source of life on earth.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	Extracts from the Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	1588. Today the world of humanity is in need of international unity 
and conciliation. To establish these great fundamental principles a 
propelling power is needed. It is self-evident that the unity of the 
human world and the Most Great Peace cannot be accomplished through 
material means. They cannot be established through political power, for 
the political interests of nations are various and the policies of 
peoples are divergent and conflicting. They cannot be founded through 
racial or patriotic power, for these are human powers, selfish and weak.
 The very nature of racial differences and patriotic prejudices prevents
 the realization of this unity and agreement. Therefore, it is evidenced
 that the promotion of the oneness of the kingdom of humanity, which is 
the essence of the teachings of all the Manifestations of God, is 
impossible except through<br>
 the divine power and breaths of the Holy Spirit. Other powers are too weak and are incapable of accomplishing this.</p>

<p>	1589. We will pray that the ensign of international peace may be 
uplifted and that the oneness of the world of humanity may be realized 
and accomplished. All this is made possible and practicable through your
 efforts. May this American democracy be the first nation to establish 
the foundation of international agreement. May it be the first nation to
 proclaim the universality of mankind. May it be the first to upraise 
the standard of the Most Great Peace, and through this nation of 
democracy may these philanthropic intentions and institutions be spread 
broadcast throughout the world. Truly, this is a great and revered 
nation. Here liberty has reached its highest degree. The intentions of 
its people are most praiseworthy. They are, indeed, worthy of being the 
first to build the Tabernacle of the Most Great Peace and proclaim the 
oneness of mankind. I will supplicate God for assistance and 
confirmation in your behalf.</p>

<p>	1590. Today the greatest need of the world of humanity is 
discontinuance of the existing misunderstandings among nations. This can
 be accomplished through the unity of language. Unless the unity of 
languages is realized, the Most Great Peace and the oneness of the human
 world cannot be effectively organized and established because the 
function of language is to portray the mysteries and secrets of human 
hearts. The heart is like a box, and language is the key. Only by using 
the key can we open the box and observe the gems it contains. Therefore,
 the question of an auxiliary international tongue has the utmost 
importance.... It is my hope that it may be perfected through the 
bounties of God and that intelligent men may be selected from the 
various countries of the world to organize an international congress 
whose chief aim will be the promotion of this universal medium of 
speech.<br>

<p>	1591. ...because I find the American nation so capable of 
achievement and this government the fairest of western governments, its 
institutions superior to others, my wish and hope is that the banner of 
international reconciliation may first be raised on this continent and 
the standard of the Most Great Peace be unfurled here. May the American 
people and their government unite in their efforts in order that this 
light may dawn from this point and spread to all regions, for this is 
one of the greatest bestowals of God. In order that America may avail 
herself of this opportunity, I beg that you strive and pray with heart 
and soul, devoting all your energies to this end: that the banner of 
international peace may be upraised here and that this democracy may be 
the cause of the cessation of warfare in all other countries.</p>

<p>	1592. In past ages humanity has been defective and inefficient 
because it has been incomplete. War and its ravages have blighted the 
world; the education of woman will be a mighty step toward its abolition
 and ending, for she will use her whole influence against war. Woman 
rears the child and educates the youth to maturity. She will refuse to 
give her sons for sacrifice upon the field of battle. In truth, she will
 be the greatest factor in establishing universal peace and 
international arbitration. Assuredly, woman will abolish warfare among 
mankind....</p>

<p>	1593. All of us know that international peace is good, that it is 
conducive to human welfare and the glory of man, but volition and action
 are necessary before it can be established. Action is essential. 
Inasmuch as this century is a century of light, capacity for action is 
assured to mankind. Necessarily the divine principles will be spread 
among men until the time of action arrives. Surely this has been so, and
 truly the time and conditions are ripe for action now....<br>

<p>	1594. This has come to pass. The powers of earth cannot withstand 
the privileges and bestowals which God has ordained for this great and 
glorious century. It is a need and exigency of the time.... Let this 
century be the sun of previous centuries, the effulgences of which shall
 last forever, so that in times to come they shall glorify the twentieth
 century, saying the twentieth century was the century of lights, the 
twentieth century was the century of life, the twentieth century was the
 century of international peace, the twentieth century was the century 
of divine bestowals, and the twentieth century has left traces which 
shall last forever.</p>

<p>	1595. The most momentous question of this day is international peace
 and arbitration, and universal peace is impossible without universal 
suffrage. Children are educated by the women. The mother bears the 
troubles and anxieties of rearing the child, undergoes the ordeal of its
 birth and training. Therefore, it is most difficult for mothers to send
 to the battlefield those upon whom they have lavished such love and 
care. Consider a son reared and trained twenty years by a devoted 
mother. What sleepless nights and restless, anxious days she has spent! 
Having brought him through dangers and difficulties to the age of 
maturity, how agonizing then to sacrifice him upon the battlefield! 
Therefore, the mothers will not sanction war nor be satisfied with it. 
So it will come to pass that when women participate fully and equally in
 the affairs of the world, when they enter confidently and capably the 
great arena of laws and politics, war will cease; for woman will be the 
obstacle and hindrance to it. This is true and without doubt.</p>

<p>	1596. Now the glorious and brilliant twentieth century has dawned, and the divine bounty is radiating universally....<br>
 Truly, this can be called the miracle of centuries, for it is replete 
with manifestations of the miraculous. The time has come when all 
mankind shall be united, when all races shall be loyal to one 
fatherland, all religions become one religion, and racial and religious 
bias pass away. It is a day in which the oneness of humankind shall 
uplift its standard and international peace, like the true morning, 
flood the world with its light....</p>

'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912",

<p>	1597. He promulgated the adoption of the same course of education 
for man and woman. Daughters and sons must follow the same curriculum of
 study, thereby promoting unity of the sexes. When all mankind shall 
receive the same opportunity of education and the equality of men and 
women be realized, the foundations of war will be utterly destroyed. 
Without equality this will be impossible because all differences and 
distinction are conducive to discord and strife. Equality between men 
and women is conducive to the abolition of warfare for the reason that 
women will never be willing to sanction it. Mothers will not give their 
sons as sacrifices upon the battlefield after twenty years of anxiety 
and loving devotion in rearing them from infancy, no matter what cause 
they are called upon to defend. There is no doubt that when women obtain
 equality of rights, war will entirely cease among mankind.</p>

'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912",

<p>	1598. The world is in greatest need of international peace. Until it
 is established, mankind will not attain composure and tranquillity. It 
is necessary that the nations and governments organize an international 
tribunal to which all their disputes and differences shall be referred. 
The decision of that tribunal shall be final. Individual controversy 
will be adjudged by a local tribunal. International questions will come 
before the universal tribunal, and so the cause of warfare will be taken
 away.</p>

'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912" 
p. 301)</p>
<p>	1599. I find these two great American nations [the United States and
 Canada] highly capable and advanced ... it is my hope that these 
revered<br>
 nations may become prominent factors in the establishment of international peace and the oneness of the world of humanity...</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 318)</p>
<p>	1600. The world of humanity is possessed of two wings: the male and 
the female. So long as these two wings are not equivalent in strength, 
the bird will not fly. Until womankind reaches the same degree as man, 
until she enjoys the same arena of activity, extraordinary attainment 
for humanity will not be realized; humanity cannot wing its way to 
heights of real attainment. When the two wings or parts become 
equivalent in strength, enjoying the same prerogatives, the flight of 
man will be exceedingly lofty and extraordinary. Therefore, woman must 
receive the same education as man and all inequality be adjusted. Thus, 
imbued with the same virtues as man, rising through all the degrees of 
human attainment, women will become the peers of men, and until this 
equality is established, true progress and attainment for the human race
 will not be facilitated.</p>
<p>	The evident reasons underlying this are as follows: Woman by nature 
is opposed to war; she is an advocate of peace. Children are reared and 
brought up by the mothers who give them the first principles of 
education and labour assiduously in their behalf. Consider, for 
instance, a mother who has tenderly reared a son for twenty years to the
 age of maturity. Surely she will not consent to having that son torn 
asunder and killed in the field of battle. Therefore, as woman advances 
toward the degree of man in power and privilege, with the right of vote 
and control in human government, most assuredly war will cease; for 
woman is naturally the most devoted and staunch advocate of 
international peace.</p>

<p>	1601. A Supreme Tribunal shall be elected by the peoples and 
governments of every nation, where members from each country and 
government shall assemble in unity. All disputes shall be brought before
 this Court, its mission being to prevent war.</p>

1911-1912", 11th ed. (London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1979), p. 132)<br>

</p><p>	1602. A Supreme Tribunal shall be established by the peoples and
 Governments of every nation, composed of members elected from each 
country and Government. The members of this Great Council shall assemble
 in unity. All disputes of an international character shall be submitted
 to this Court, its work being to arrange by arbitration everything 
which otherwise would be a cause of war. The mission of this Tribunal 
would be to prevent war.</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912", p. 155)</p>
<p>	1603. As to the question of disarmament, all nations must disarm at 
the same time. It will not do at all, and it is not proposed, that some 
nations shall lay down their arms while others, their neighbours, remain
 armed. The peace of the world must be brought about by international 
agreement. All nations must agree to disarm simultaneously...</p>
<p>	No nation can follow a peace policy while its neighbour remains 
warlike. There is no justice in that. Nobody would dream of suggesting 
that the peace of the world could be brought about by any such line of 
action. It is to be brought about by a general and comprehensive 
international agreement, and in no other way...</p>
<p>	Simultaneous action, he went on, is necessary in any scheme of 
disarmament. All the governments of the world must transform their 
battleships and warcraft into merchant vessels. But no one nation can by
 itself start in upon such a policy and it would be folly should one 
power attempt to do so ... it would simply invite destruction....</p>
<p>	Are there any signs that the permanent peace of the world will be 
established in anything like a reasonable period? 'Abdu'l-Baha was 
asked.</p>
<p>	It will be established in this century, he answered. It will be 
universal in the twentieth century. All nations will be forced into it.</p>
<p>	Economic pressure will tell?</p>
<p>	Yes: the nations will be forced to come to peace and to agree to the
 abolition of war. The awful burdens of taxation for war purposes will 
get beyond human endurance...</p>
<p>	No, said 'Abdu'l-Baha in conclusion, I repeat, no nation can disarm 
under these circumstances. Disarmament is surely coming, but it must<br>
 come, and it will come, by the universal consent of the civilized 
nations of the earth. By international agreement they will lay down 
their arms and the great era of peace will be ushered in. In this and no
 other way can peace be established upon the earth.</p>
<p>	(Extracts from interview with newspaper reporter, quoted in 
"'Abdu'l-Baha in Canada" (Thornhill: Baha'i Canada Publications, 1987), 
pp. 34-35)</p>
<p>	1604. Once the Parliament of Man is established and its constituent 
parts organized, the governments of the world having entered into a 
covenant of eternal friendship will have no need of keeping large 
standing armies and navies. A few battalions to preserve internal order,
 and an International Police to keep the highways of the seas clear, are
 all that will be necessary. Then these huge sums will be diverted to 
other more useful channels, pauperism will disappear, knowledge will 
increase, the victories of Peace will be sung by poets and bards, 
knowledge will improve the conditions and mankind will be rocked in the 
cradle of felicity and bliss. Then, whether a government is 
constitutional or republican, hereditary monarchy or democratic, the 
rulers will devote their time to the prosperity of their nations, the 
legislation of just and sane laws and the fostering of closer and more 
amicable relations with their neighbours -- thus will the world of 
humanity become a mirror reflecting the virtues and attributes of the 
Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>	By a general agreement all the governments of the world must disarm 
simultaneously... It will not do if one lays down the arms and the other
 refuses to do so. The nations of the world must concur with each other 
concerning this supremely important subject, thus they may abandon 
together the deadly weapons of human slaughter. As long as one nation 
increases her military and naval budget, another nation will be forced 
into this crazed competition through her natural and supposed 
interests....</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	Now the question of disarmament must be put into practice by all the
 nations and not only by one or two. Consequently the advocates of Peace
 must strive day and night, so that the individuals of every country may
 become peace-loving, public opinion may gain a strong and permanent 
footing, and day by day the army of International Peace be increased,<br>
 complete disarmament be realized and the Flag of Universal Conciliation be waving on the summit of the mountains of the earth.</p>
<p>	The ideals of Peace must be nurtured and spread among the 
inhabitants of the world; they must be instructed in the school of Peace
 and the evils of war. First: The financiers and bankers must desist 
from lending money to any government contemplating to wage an unjust war
 upon an innocent nation. Second: The presidents and managers of the 
railroads and steamship companies must refrain from transporting war 
ammunition, infernal engines, guns, cannons and powder from one country 
into another. Third: The soldiers must petition, through their 
representatives, the Ministers of War, the politicians, the Congressmen 
and the generals to put forth in a clear, intelligible language the 
reasons and the causes which have brought them to the brink of such a 
national calamity. The soldiers must (demand this as one of the 
prerogatives. "Demonstrate to us", they must say, "that this is a just 
war, and we will then enter into the battlefield otherwise we will not 
take one step.... Come forth from your hiding-places, enter into the 
battlefield if you like to attack each other and tear each other to 
pieces if you desire to air your so-called contentions. The discord and 
feud are between you; why do you make us, innocent people, a party to 
it? If fighting and bloodshed are good things, then lead us into the 
fray by your presence!"</p>
<p>	In short, every means that produces war must be checked and the 
causes that prevent the occurrence of war be advanced; -so that physical
 conflict may become an impossibility. On the other hand, every country 
must be properly delimited, its exact frontiers marked, its national 
integrity secured, its permanent independence protected, and its vital 
interests honoured by the family of nations. These services ought to be 
rendered by an impartial, international Commission. In this manner all 
causes of friction and differences will be removed. And in case there 
should arise some disputes between them, they could arbitrate before the
 Parliament of Man, the representatives of which should be chosen from 
among the wisest and most judicious men of all the nations of the world.</p>
<p>	("Star of the West", vol. 5, no. 8 (August 1914), pp. 115-117)</p>
<p>	1605. Every century holds the solution of one predominating problem.
 Although there may be many problems, yet one of the innumerable<br>
 problems will loom large and become the most important of all....in 
this luminous century the greatest bestowal of the world of humanity is 
Universal Peace, which must be founded, so that the realm of creation 
may obtain composure, the East and the West, which include in their arms
 the five continents of the globe, may embrace each other, mankind may 
rest beneath the tent of oneness of the world of humanity, and the flag 
of universal peace may wave over all the regions.... . . .</p>
<p>	Today the true duty of a powerful king is to establish a universal 
peace; for verily it signifies the freedom of all the people of the 
world. Some persons who are ignorant of the world of true humanity and 
its high ambitions for the general good, reckon such a glorious 
condition of life to be very difficult, nay rather impossible to 
compass. But it is not so, far from it.</p>

<p>	1606. O ye individuals of humanity, find ye means for the stoppage 
of this wholesale murder and bloodshed. Now is the appointed time! Now 
is the opportune time! Arise ye, show ye an effort, put ye forward an 
extraordinary force, and unfurl ye the Flag of Universal Peace and dam 
the irresistible fury of this raging torrent which is wreaking havoc and
 ruin everywhere.</p>
<p>	("Star of the West" vol. 18, no. 11 (February 1928), p. 345)</p>
<p>	1607. By what process, continued the questioner, will this peace on 
earth be established? Will it come at once after a universal declaration
 of the Truth?</p>
<p>	No, it will come about gradually, said 'Abdu'l-Baha. A plant that 
grows too quickly lasts but a short time. You are my family, and he 
looked about with a smile, my new children! if a family lives in unison,
 great results are obtained. Widen the circle; when a city lives in 
intimate accord greater results will follow, and a continent that is 
fully united will likewise unite all other continents. Then will be the 
time of the greatest results, for all the inhabitants of the earth 
belong to one native land.</p>

</p><p>Extracts from the Writings of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	1608. Dearly-beloved friends! Humanity, whether viewed in the light 
of man's individual conduct or in the existing relationships between 
organized communities and nations, has, alas, strayed too far and 
suffered too great a decline to be redeemed through the unaided efforts 
of the best among its recognized rulers and statesmen -- however 
disinterested their motives, however concerted their action, however 
unsparing in their zeal and devotion to its cause. No scheme which the 
calculations of the highest statesmanship may yet devise, no doctrine 
which the most distinguished exponents of economic theory may hope to 
advance, no principle which the most ardent of moralists may strive to 
inculcate, can provide, in the last resort, adequate foundations upon 
which the future of a distracted world can be built. No appeal for 
mutual tolerance which the worldly-wise might raise, however compelling 
and insistent, can calm its passions or help restore its vigour. Nor 
would any general scheme of mere organized international co-operation, 
in whatever sphere of human activity, however ingenious in conception or
 extensive in scope, succeed in removing the root cause of the evil that
 has so rudely upset the equilibrium of present day society. Not even, I
 venture to assert, would the very act of devising the machinery 
required for the political and economic unification of the world -- a 
principle that has been increasingly advocated in recent times -- 
provide in itself the antidote against the poison that is steadily 
undermining the vigour of organized peoples and nations. What else, 
might we not confidently affirm, but the unreserved acceptance of the 
Divine Programme enunciated, with such simplicity and force as far back 
as sixty years ago, by Baha'u'llah, embodying in its essentials God's 
divinely-appointed scheme for the unification of mankind in this age, 
coupled with an indomitable conviction in the unfailing efficacy of each
 and all of its provisions, is eventually capable of withstanding the 
forces of internal disintegration which, if unchecked, must needs 
continue to eat into the vitals of a despairing society. It is towards 
this goal -- the goal of a new World Order, Divine in origin, 
all-embracing in scope, equitable in principle, challenging in its 
features -- that a harassed humanity must strive.</p>
<p>	To claim to have grasped all the implications of Baha'u'llah's 
prodigious scheme for world-wide human solidarity, or to have fathomed 
its import, would be presumptuous on the part of even the declared<br>
 supporters of His Faith. To attempt to visualize it in all its 
possibilities, to estimate its future benefits, to picture its glory, 
would be premature at even so advanced a stage in the evolution of 
mankind.</p>
<p>	All we can reasonably venture to attempt is to strive to obtain a 
glimpse of the first streaks of the promised Dawn that must, in the 
fullness of time, chase away the gloom that has encircled humanity. All 
we can do is to point out, in their broadest outline, to what appear to 
us to be the guiding principles underlying the World Order of 
Baha'u'llah, as amplified and enunciated by 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Centre of 
His Covenant with all mankind and the appointed Interpreter and 
Expounder of His Word.</p>
<p>	That the unrest and suffering afflicting the mass of mankind are in 
no small measure the direct consequences of the World War and are 
attributable to the unwisdom and short-sightedness of the Framers of the
 Peace Treaties only a biased mind can refuse to admit....</p>
<p>	It would be idle however to contend that the war, with all the 
losses it involved, the passions it aroused and the grievances it left 
behind, has solely been responsible for the unprecedented confusion into
 which almost every section of the civilized world is plunged at 
present. Is it not a fact -- and this is the central idea I desire to 
emphasize -- that the fundamental cause of this world unrest is 
attributable, not so much to the consequences of what must sooner or 
later come to be regarded as a transitory dislocation in the affairs of a
 continually changing world, but rather to the failure of those into 
whose hands the immediate destinies of peoples and nations have been 
committed, to adjust their systems of economic and political 
institutions to the imperative needs of a fast evolving age? Are not 
these intermittent crises that convulse present-day society due 
primarily to the lamentable inability of the world's recognized leaders 
to read aright the signs of the times, to rid themselves once for all of
 their preconceived ideas and fettering creeds, and to reshape the 
machinery of their respective governments according to those standards 
that are implicit in Baha'u'llah's supreme declaration of the Oneness of
 Mankind -- the chief and distinguishing feature of the Faith He 
proclaimed?....</p>
<p>	How pathetic indeed are the efforts of those leaders of human 
institutions who, in utter disregard of the spirit of the age, are 
striving to adjust national processes, suited to the ancient days of 
self-contained<br>
 nations to an age which must either achieve the unity of the world, as 
adumbrated by Baha'u'llah, or perish. At so critical an hour in the 
history of civilization it behoves the leaders of all the nations of the
 world, great and small, whether in the East or in the West, whether 
victors or vanquished, to give heed to the clarion call of Baha'u'llah 
and, thoroughly imbued with a sense of world solidarity, the sine qua 
non of loyalty to His Cause, arise manfully to carry out in its entirety
 the one remedial scheme He, the Divine Physician, has prescribed for an
 ailing humanity. Let them discard, once for all, every preconceived 
idea, every national prejudice, and give heed to the sublime counsel of 
'Abdu'l-Baha, the authorized Expounder of His teachings. You can best 
serve your country, was 'Abdu'l-Baha's rejoinder to a high official in 
the service of the federal government of the United States of America, 
who had questioned Him as to the best manner in which he could promote 
the interests of his government and people, if you strive, in your 
capacity as a citizen of the world, to assist in the eventual 
application of the principle of federalism underlying the government of 
your own country to the relationships now existing between the peoples 
and nations of the world.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	Some form of a world super-state must needs be evolved, in whose 
favour all the nations of the world will have willingly ceded every 
claim to make war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights to 
maintain armaments, except for purposes of maintaining internal order 
within their respective dominions. Such a state will have to include 
within its orbit an international executive adequate to enforce supreme 
and unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the 
commonwealth; a world parliament whose members shall be elected by the 
people in their respective countries and whose election shall be 
confirmed by their respective governments; and a supreme tribunal whose 
judgement will have a binding effect even in such cases where the 
parties concerned did not voluntarily agree to submit their case to its 
consideration. A world community in which all economic barriers will 
have been permanently demolished and the interdependence of Capital and 
Labour definitely recognized; in which the clamour of religious 
fanaticism and strife will have been for ever stilled; in which the 
flame of racial animosity will have been finally extinguished; in which a
 single code of international law -- the product of the considered 
judgement of the<br>
 world's federated representatives -- shall have as its sanction the 
instant and coercive intervention of the combined forces of the 
federated units; and finally a world community in which the fury of a 
capricious and militant nationalism will have been transmuted into an 
abiding consciousness of world citizenship- such indeed, appears, in its
 broadest outline, the Order anticipated by Baha'u'llah, an Order that 
shall come to be regarded as the fairest fruit of a slowly maturing age.</p>
<p>	Let there be no misgivings as to the animating purpose of the 
world-wide Law of Baha'u'llah. Far from aiming at the subversion of the 
existing foundations of society, it seeks to broaden its basis, to 
remould its institutions in a manner consonant with the needs of an 
ever-changing world. It can conflict with no legitimate allegiances, nor
 can it undermine essential loyalties. Its purpose is neither to stifle 
the flame of a sane and intelligent patriotism in men's hearts, nor to 
abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the evils of 
excessive centralization are to be avoided. It does not ignore, nor does
 it attempt to suppress the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, 
of history, of language and tradition, of thought and habit, that 
differentiate the peoples and nations of the world. It calls for a wider
 loyalty, for a larger aspiration than any that has animated the human 
race. It insists upon the subordination of national impulses and 
interests to the imperative claims of a unified world. It repudiates 
excessive centralization on one hand, and disclaims all attempts at 
uniformity on the other. Its watchword is unity in diversity such as 
'Abdu'l-Baha Himself has explained.</p>
<p>	Its [the principle of the Oneness of Mankind] implications are 
deeper, its claims greater than any which the Prophets of old were 
allowed to advance. Its message is applicable not only to the 
individual, but concerns itself primarily with the nature of those 
essential relationships that must bind all the states and nations as 
members of one human family. It does not constitute merely the 
enunciation of an ideal, but stands inseparably associated with an 
institution adequate to embody its truth, demonstrate its validity, and 
perpetuate its influence. It implies an organic change in the structure 
of present-day society, a change such as the world has not yet 
experienced. It constitutes a challenge, at once bold and universal, to 
outworn shibboleths of national creeds -- creeds that<br>
 have had their day and which must, in the ordinary course of events as 
shaped and controlled by Providence, give way to a new gospel, 
fundamentally different from, and infinitely superior to, what the world
 has already conceived. It calls for no less that the reconstruction and
 the demilitarization of the whole civilized world -- a world 
organically unified in all the essential aspects of its life, its 
political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade and finance, 
its script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of the 
national characteristics of its federated units.</p>
<p>	It represents the consummation of human evolution -- an evolution 
that has had its earliest beginnings in the birth of family life, its 
subsequent development in the achievement of tribal solidarity, leading 
in turn to the constitution of the city-state, and expanding later into 
the institution of independent and sovereign nations.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	To take but one instance. How confident were the assertions made in 
the days preceding the unification of the states of the North American 
continent regarding the insuperable barriers that stood in the way of 
their ultimate federation! Was it not widely and emphatically declared 
that the conflicting interests, the mutual distrust, the differences of 
government and habit that divided the states were such as no force, 
whether spiritual or temporal, could ever hope to harmonize or control? 
And yet how different were the conditions prevailing a hundred and fifty
 years ago from those that characterize present-day society! It would 
indeed be no exaggeration to say that the absence of those facilities 
which modern scientific progress has placed at the service of humanity 
in our time made of the problem of welding the American states into a 
single federation, similar though they were in certain traditions, a 
task infinitely more complex than that which confronts a divided 
humanity in its efforts to achieve the unification of all mankind.</p>
<p>	Who knows that for so exalted a conception to take shape a suffering
 more intense that any it has yet experienced will have to be inflicted 
upon humanity? Could anything less than the fire of a civil war with all
 its violence and vicissitudes -- a war that nearly rent the great 
American Republic -- have welded the states, not only into a Union of 
independent units, but into a Nation, in spite of all the ethnic 
differences that characterized its component parts? That so fundamental a
 revolution, involving such far-reaching changes in the structure of 
society, can be<br>
 achieved through the ordinary processes of diplomacy and education 
seems highly improbable. We have but to turn our gaze to humanity's 
blood-stained history to realize that nothing short of intense mental as
 well as physical agony has been able to precipitate those epoch-making 
changes that constitute the greatest landmarks in the history of human 
civilization.</p>
<p>	Great and far-reaching as have been those changes in the past, they 
cannot but appear, when viewed in their proper perspective, except as 
subsidiary adjustments precluding that transformation of unparalleled 
majesty and scope which humanity is in this age bound to undergo. That 
the forces of a world catastrophe can alone precipitate such a new phase
 of human thought is, alas, becoming increasingly apparent. That nothing
 short of the fire of a severe ordeal, unparalleled in its intensity, 
can fuse and weld the discordant entities, that constitute the elements 
of present-day civilization, into the integral components of the world 
Commonwealth of the future is a truth which future events will 
increasingly demonstrate.</p>
<p>	The prophetic voice of Baha'u'llah warning, in the concluding 
passages of the "Hidden Words", "the peoples of the world" that "an 
unforeseen calamity is following them and that grievous retribution 
awaiteth them" throws indeed a lurid light upon the immediate fortunes 
of sorrowing humanity. Nothing but a fiery ordeal, out of which humanity
 will emerge, chastened and prepared, can succeed in implanting that 
sense of responsibility which the leaders of a new-born age must arise 
to shoulder.</p>
<p>	I would again direct your attention to those ominous words of 
Baha'u'llah which I have already quoted: "And when the appointed hour is
 come, there shall suddenly appear that which shall cause the limbs of 
mankind to quake."</p>
<p>	Has not 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself asserted in unequivocal language that 
"another war, fiercer than the last, will assuredly break out"?</p>
<p>	Upon the consummation of this colossal, this unspeakably glorious 
enterprise -- an enterprise that baffled the resources of Roman 
statesmanship and which Napoleon's desperate efforts failed to achieve 
-- will depend the ultimate realization of that millennium of which 
poets of all ages have sung and seers have long dreamed. Upon it will 
depend the fulfilment of the prophecies uttered by the Prophets of old 
when<br>
 swords shall be beaten into ploughshares and the lion and the lamb lie 
down together. It alone can usher in the Kingdom of the Heavenly Father 
as anticipated by the Faith of Jesus Christ. It alone can lay the 
foundation for the New World Order visualized by Baha'u'llah -- a World 
Order that shall reflect, however dimly, upon this earthly plane, the 
ineffable splendours of the Abha Kingdom.</p>
<p>	One word more in conclusion. The proclamation of the Oneness of 
Mankind -- the head corner-stone of Baha'u'llah's all-embracing dominion
 -- can under no circumstances be compared with such expressions of 
pious hope as have been uttered in the past. His is not merely a call 
which He raised, alone and unaided, in the face of the relentless and 
combined opposition of two of the most powerful Oriental potentates of 
His day- while Himself an exile and prisoner in their hands. It implies 
at once a warning and a promise -- a warning that in it lies the sole 
means for the salvation of a greatly suffering world, a promise that its
 realization is at hand.</p>
<p>	Uttered at a time when its possibility had not yet been seriously 
envisaged in any part of the world, it has, by virtue of that celestial 
potency which the Spirit of Baha'u'llah has breathed into it, come at 
last to be regarded, by an increasing number of thoughtful men, not only
 as an approaching possibility, but as the necessary outcome of the 
forces now operating in the world.</p>
<p>	Surely the world, contracted and transformed into a single highly 
complex organism by the marvellous progress achieved in the realm of 
physical science, by the world-wide expansion of commerce and industry, 
and struggling, under the pressure of world economic forces, amidst the 
pitfalls of a materialistic civilization, stands in dire need of a 
restatement of the Truth underlying all the Revelation, of the past in a
 language suited to its essential requirements. And what voice other 
than that of Baha'u'llah- the Mouthpiece of God for this age -- is 
capable of effecting a transformation of society as radical as that 
which He has already accomplished in the hearts of those men and women, 
so diversified and seemingly irreconcilable, who constitute the body of 
His declared followers throughout the world?</p>
<p>	That such a mighty conception is fast budding out in the minds of 
men, that voices are being raised in its support, that its salient 
features must fast crystallize in the consciousness of those who are in 
authority,<br>
 few indeed can doubt. That its modest beginnings have already taken 
shape in the world-wide Administration with which the adherents of the 
Faith of Baha'u'llah stand associated only those whose hearts are 
tainted by prejudice can fail to perceive.</p>
<p>	(28 November 1931 to the Baha'is of the West, published in "The 
World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", pp. 33-37, 40 43, 45-48)</p>
<p>	1609. No machinery falling short of the standard inculcated by the 
Baha'i Revelation, and at variance with the sublime pattern ordained in 
His teachings, which the collective efforts of mankind may yet devise 
can ever hope to achieve anything above or beyond that "Lesser Peace" to
 which the Author of our Faith has Himself alluded in His writings. "Now
 that ye have refused the Most Great Peace," He, admonishing the kings 
and rulers of the earth, has written, "hold ye fast unto this the Lesser
 Peace, that haply ye may in some degree better your own condition and 
that of your dependents." Expatiating on this Lesser Peace, He thus 
addresses in that same Tablet the rulers of the earth: "Be reconciled 
among yourselves, that ye may need no more armaments save in a measure 
to safeguard your territories and dominions... Be united, O kings of the
 earth, for thereby will the tempest of discord be stilled amongst you, 
and your peoples find rest, if ye be of them that comprehend. Should any
 one among you take up arms against another, rise ye all against him, 
for this is naught but manifest justice."</p>
<p>	The Most Great Peace, on the other hand, as conceived by Baha'u'llah
 -- a peace that must inevitably follow as the practical consequence of 
the spiritualization of the world and the fusion of all its races, 
creeds, classes and nations -- can rest on no other basis, and can be 
preserved through no other agency, except the divinely appointed 
ordinances that are implicit in the World Order that stands associated 
with His Holy Name....</p>
<p>	The Revelation of Baha'u'llah, whose supreme mission is none other 
but the achievement of this organic and spiritual unity of the whole 
body of nations, should, if we be faithful to its implications, be 
regarded as signalizing through its advent the (coming of age of the 
entire human race. It should be viewed not merely as yet another 
spiritual revival in the ever-changing fortunes of mankind, not only as a
 further stage in a chain<br>
 of progressive Revelations, nor even as the culmination of one of a 
series of recurrent prophetic cycles, but rather as marking the last and
 highest stage in the stupendous evolution of man's collective life on 
this planet. The emergence of a world community, the consciousness of 
world citizenship, the founding of a world civilization and culture -- 
all of which must synchronize with the initial stages in the unfoldment 
of the Golden Age of the Baha'i Era -- should, by their very nature, be 
regarded, as far as this planetary life is concerned, as the furthermost
 limits in the organization of human society, though man, as an 
individual, will, nay must indeed as a result of such a consummation, 
continue indefinitely to progress and develop.</p>
<p>	The whole of mankind is groaning, is dying to be led to unity, and 
to terminate its age-long martyrdom. And yet it stubbornly refuses to 
embrace the light and acknowledge the sovereign authority of the one 
Power that can extricate it from its entanglements, and avert the woeful
 calamity that threatens to engulf it.</p>
<p>	Ominous indeed is the voice of Baha'u'llah that rings through these 
prophetic words: "O ye peoples of the world! Know, verily, that an 
unforeseen calamity followeth you, and grievous retribution awaiteth 
you. Think not that which ye have committed hath been effaced in My 
sight." And again: "We have a fixed time for you, O peoples. If ye fail,
 at the appointed hour, to turn towards God, He, verily, will lay 
violent hold on you, and will cause grievous afflictions to assail you 
from every direction. How severe, indeed, is the chastisement with which
 your Lord will then chastise you!"</p>
<p>	Must humanity, tormented as she now is, be afflicted with still 
severer tribulations ere their purifying influence can prepare her to 
enter the heavenly Kingdom destined to be established upon earth? Must 
the inauguration of so vast, so unique, so illumined an era in human 
history be ushered in by so great a catastrophe in human affairs as to 
recall, nay surpass, the appalling collapse of Roman civilization in the
 first centuries of the Christian Era? Must a series of profound 
convulsions stir and rock the human race ere Baha'u'llah can be 
enthroned in the hearts and consciences of the masses, ere His 
undisputed ascendancy is universally recognized, and the noble edifice 
of His World Order is reared and established?<br>

</p><p>	The long ages of infancy and childhood, through which the human 
race had to pass, have receded into the background. Humanity is now 
experiencing the commotions invariably associated with the most 
turbulent stage of its evolution, the stage of adolescence, when the 
impetuosity of youth and its vehemence reach their climax, and must 
gradually be superseded by the calmness, the wisdom, and the maturity 
that characterize the stage of manhood. Then will the human race reach 
that stature of ripeness which will enable it to acquire all the powers 
and capacities upon which its ultimate development must depend.</p>
<p>	Unification of the whole of mankind is the hall mark of the stage 
which human society is now approaching. Unity of family, of tribe, of 
city-state, and nation have been successively attempted and fully 
established. World unity is the goal towards which a harassed humanity 
is striving. Nation-building has come to an end. The anarchy inherent in
 state sovereignty is moving towards a climax. A world, growing to 
maturity, must abandon this fetish, recognize the oneness and wholeness 
of human relationships, and establish once for all the machinery that 
can best incarnate this fundamental principle of its life.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Baha'u'llah, implies 
the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races, 
creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the 
autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of
 the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely 
safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, 
consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of 
the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the
 component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to 
regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all
 races and peoples. A world executive, backed by an international Force,
 will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by,
 this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the 
whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its 
compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise 
between the various elements constituting this universal system. A 
mechanism of world inter-communication will be devised, embracing the 
whole planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and<br>
 functioning with marvellous swiftness and perfect regularity. A world 
metropolis will act as the nerve centre of a world civilization, the 
focus towards which the unifying forces of life will converge and from 
which its energizing influences will radiate. A world language will 
either be invented or chosen from among the existing languages and will 
be taught in the schools of all the federated nations as an auxiliary to
 their mother tongue. A world script, a world literature, a uniform and 
universal system of currency, of weights and measures, will simplify and
 facilitate intercourse and understanding among the nations and races of
 mankind. In such a world society, science and religion, the two most 
potent forces in human life, will be reconciled, will co-operate, and 
will harmoniously develop. The press will, under such a system, while 
giving full scope to the expression of the diversified views and 
convictions of mankind, cease to be mischievously manipulated by vested 
interests, whether private or public, and will be liberated from the 
influence of contending governments and peoples. The economic resources 
of the world will be organized, its sources of raw materials will be 
tapped and fully utilized, its markets will be co-ordinated and 
developed, and the distribution of its products will be equitably 
regulated.</p>
<p>	National rivalries, hatreds, and intrigues will cease, and racial 
animosity and prejudice will be replaced by racial amity, understanding 
and co-operation. The causes of religious strife will be permanently 
removed, economic barriers and restrictions will be completely 
abolished, and the inordinate distinction between classes will be 
obliterated. Destitution on the one hand, and gross accumulation of 
ownership on the other, will disappear.</p>
<p>	The enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war, whether economic 
or political, will be consecrated to such ends as will extend the range 
of human inventions and technical development, to the increase of the 
productivity of mankind, to the extermination of disease, to the 
extension of scientific research, to the raising of the standard of 
physical health, to the sharpening and refinement of the human brain, to
 the exploitation of the unused and unsuspected resources of the planet,
 to the prolongation of human life, and to the furtherance of any other 
agency that can stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spiritual 
life of the entire human race.<br>

</p><p>	A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising 
unchallengeable authority over its unimaginably vast resources, blending
 and embodying the ideals of both the East and the West, liberated from 
the curse of war and its miseries, and bent on the exploitation of all 
the available sources of energy on the surface of the planet, a system 
in which Force is made the servant of Justice, whose life is sustained 
by its universal recognition of one God and by its allegiance to one 
common Revelation -- such is the goal towards which humanity, impelled 
by the unifying forces of life, is moving.</p>
<p>	(11 March 1936, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", pp. 162-63, 201-4)</p>
<p>	1610. The world-shaking ordeal which Baha'u'llah, as quoted in the 
foregoing pages, has so graphically prophesied, may find it [the 
American nation] swept, to an unprecedented degree, into its vortex. Out
 of it will probably emerge, unlike its reactions to the last world 
conflict, consciously determined to seize its opportunity, to bring the 
full weight of its influence to bear upon the gigantic problems that 
such an ordeal must leave in its wake, and to exorcise forever, in 
conjunction with its sister nations of both the East and the West, the 
greatest curse which, from time immemorial, has afflicted and degraded 
the human race.</p>
<p>	Then, and only then, will the American nation, moulded and purified 
in the crucible of a common war, inured to its rigours, and disciplined 
by its lessons, be in a position to raise its voice in the councils of 
the nations, itself lay the corner-stone of a universal and enduring 
peace, proclaim the solidarity, the unity, and maturity of mankind, and 
assist in the establishment of the promised reign of righteousness on 
earth. Then, and only then, will the American nation, while the 
community of the American believers within its heart is consummating its
 divinely appointed mission, be able to fulfill the unspeakably glorious
 destiny ordained for it by the Almighty, and immortally enshrined in 
the writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Then, and only then, will the American 
nation accomplish "that which will adorn the pages of history," "become 
the envy of the world and be blest in both the East and the West."</p>
<p>	(25 December 1938, published in "The Advent of Divine Justice" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), pp. 90-91)<br>

</p><p>	1611. The world is, in truth, moving on towards its destiny. The
 interdependence of the peoples and nations of the earth, whatever the 
leaders of the divisive forces of the world may say or do, is already an
 accomplished fact. Its unity in the economic sphere is now understood 
and recognized. The welfare of the part means the welfare of the whole, 
and the distress of the part brings distress to the whole. The 
Revelation of Baha'u'llah has, in His own words, "lent a fresh impulse 
and set a new direction" to this vast process now operating in the 
world. The fires lit by this great ordeal are the consequences of men's 
failure to recognize it. They are, moreover, hastening its consummation.
 Adversity, prolonged, world wide, afflictive, allied to chaos and 
universal destruction, must needs convulse the nations, stir the 
conscience of the world, disillusion the masses, precipitate a radical 
change in the very conception of society, and coalesce ultimately the 
disjointed, the bleeding limbs of mankind into one body, single, 
organically united, and indivisible.</p>
<p>	To the general character, the implications and features of this 
world commonwealth, destined to emerge, sooner or later, out of the 
carnage, agony, and havoc of this great world convulsion, I have already
 referred in my previous communications. Suffice it to say that this 
consummation will, by its very nature, be a gradual process, and must, 
as Baha'u'llah has Himself anticipated, lead at first to the 
establishment of that Lesser Peace which the nations of the earth, as 
yet unconscious of His Revelation and yet unwittingly enforcing the 
general principles which He has enunciated, will themselves establish. 
This momentous and historic step, involving the reconstruction of 
mankind, as the result of the universal recognition of its oneness and 
wholeness, will bring in its wake the spiritualization of the masses, 
consequent to the recognition of the character, and the acknowledgement 
of the claims, of the Faith of Baha'u'llah -- the essential condition to
 that ultimate fusion of all races, creeds, classes, and nations which 
must signalize the emergence of His New World Order.</p>
<p>	Then will the coming of age of the entire human race be proclaimed 
and celebrated by all the peoples and nations of the earth. Then will 
the banner of the Most Great Peace be hoisted. Then will the world wide 
sovereignty of Baha'u'llah -- the Establisher of the Kingdom of the 
Father foretold by the Son, and anticipated by the Prophets of God 
before Him and after Him -- be recognized, acclaimed, and firmly 
established. Then<br>
 will a world civilization be born, flourish, and perpetuate itself, a 
civilization with a fullness of life such as the world has never seen 
nor can as yet conceive. Then will the Everlasting Covenant be fulfilled
 in its completeness. Then will the promise enshrined in all the Books 
of God be redeemed, and all the prophecies uttered by the Prophets of 
old come to pass, and the vision of seers and poets be realized. Then 
will the planet, galvanized through the universal belief of its dwellers
 in one God, and their allegiance to one common Revelation, mirror, 
within the limitations imposed upon it, the effulgent glories of the 
sovereignty of Baha'u'llah, shining in the plenitude of its splendour in
 the Abha Paradise, and be made the footstool of His Throne on high, and
 acclaimed as the earthly heaven, capable of fulfilling that ineffable 
destiny fixed for it, from time immemorial, by the love and wisdom of 
its Creator.</p>
<p>	(28 March 1941, published in "The Promised Day Is Come" pp. 122-124)</p>
<p>	1612. The principle of collective security He [Baha'u'llah] 
unreservedly urges; recommends the reduction in national armaments; and 
proclaims as necessary and inevitable the convening of a world gathering
 at which the kings and rulers of the world will deliberate for the 
establishment of peace among the nations.</p>

<p>	1613. During this Formative Age of the Faith, and in the course of 
the present and succeeding epochs, the last and crowning stage in the 
erection of the framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith of 
Baha'u'llah -- the election of the Universal House of Justice -- will 
have been completed, the "Kitab-i-Aqdas", the Mother-Book of His 
Revelation, will have been codified and its laws promulgated, the Lesser
 Peace will have been established, the unity of mankind will have been 
achieved and its maturity attained, the Plan conceived by 'Abdu'l-Baha 
will have been executed, the emancipation of the Faith from the fetters 
of religious orthodoxy will have been effected, and its independent 
religious status will have been universally recognized..."</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	...we cannot fail to perceive the workings of two simultaneous 
processes, generated as far back as the concluding years of the Heroic<br>
 Age of our Faith, each clearly defined, each distinctly separate, yet 
closely related and destined to culminate, in the fullness of time, in a
 single glorious consummation.</p>
<p>	One of these processes is associated with the mission of the 
American Baha'i community, the other with the destiny of the American 
nation. The one serves directly the interests of the Administrative 
Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah...</p>
<p>	The other process dates back to the outbreak of the First World War 
that threw the Great Republic of the West into the vortex of the first 
stage of a world upheaval. It received its initial impetus through the 
formulation of President Wilson's Fourteen Points, closely associating 
for the first time that Republic with the fortunes of the Old World. It 
suffered its first set-back through the dissociation of that Republic 
from the newly-born League of Nations which that President had laboured 
to create. It acquired added momentum through the outbreak of the Second
 World War, inflicting unprecedented suffering on that Republic, and 
involving it still further in the affairs of all the continents of the 
globe. It was further reinforced through the declaration embodied in the
 Atlantic Charter, as voiced by one of its chief progenitors, Franklin 
D. Roosevelt. It assumed a definite outline through the birth of the 
United Nations at the San Francisco Conference. It acquired added 
significance through the choice of the City of the Covenant itself as 
the seat of the newly-born organization, through the declaration 
recently made by the American President related to his country's 
commitments in Greece and Turkey, as well as through the submission to 
the General Assembly of the United Nations of the thorny and challenging
 problem of the Holy Land, the spiritual as well as the administrative 
centre of the World Faith of Baha'u'llah. It must, however long and 
tortuous the way, lead, through a series of victories and reverses, to 
the political unification of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, to the
 emergence of a world government, and the establishment of the Lesser 
Peace, as foretold by Baha'u'llah and foreshadowed by the Prophet 
Isaiah. It must, in the end, culminate in the unfurling of the banner of
 the Most Great Peace, in the Golden Age of the Dispensation of 
Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(5 June 1947 to the Baha'is of West, published in "Citadel of Faith:
 Messages to America 1947-1957" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 
1980), p. 6, pp. 32-33)<br>

</p><p>	1614. The raising of this Edifice will in turn herald the 
construction, in the course of successive epochs of the Formative Age of
 the Faith, of several other structures, which will serve as the 
administrative seats of such divinely appointed institutions as the 
Guardianship, the Hands of the Cause, and the Universal House of 
Justice. These Edifices will, in the shape of a far-flung arc, and 
following a harmonizing style of architecture, surround the 
resting-places of the Greatest Holy Leaf, ranking as foremost among the 
members of her sex in the Baha'i Dispensation, of her Brother, offered 
up as a ransom by Baha'u'llah for the quickening of the world and its 
unification, and of their Mother, proclaimed by Him to be His chosen 
"consort in all the worlds of God". The ultimate completion of this 
stupendous undertaking will mark the culmination of the development of a
 world-wide divinely-appointed Administrative Order whose beginnings may
 be traced as far back as the concluding years of the Heroic Age of the 
Faith.</p>
<p>	This vast and irresistible process, unexampled in the spiritual 
history of mankind, and which will synchronize with two no less 
significant developments -- the establishment of the Lesser Peace and 
the evolution of Baha'i national and local institutions -- the one 
outside and the other within the Baha'i world -- will attain its final 
consummation, in the Golden Age of the Faith, through the raising of the
 standard of the Most Great Peace, and the emergence, in the plenitude 
of its power and glory, of the focal Centre of the agencies constituting
 the World Order of Baha'u'llah. The final establishment of this seat of
 the future Baha'i World Commonwealth will signalize at once the 
proclamation of the sovereignty of the Founder of our Faith and the 
advent of the Kingdom of the Father repeatedly lauded and promised by 
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>	This World Order will, in turn, in the course of successive 
Dispensations of the Baha'i Cycle, yield its fairest fruit through the 
birth and flowering of a civilization, divinely inspired, unique in its 
features, world-embracing in its scope, and fundamentally spiritual in 
its character -- a civilization destined as it unfolds to derive its 
initial impulse from the spirit animating the very institutions which, 
in their embryonic state, are now stirring in the womb of the present 
Formative Age of the Faith.</p>
<p>	(27 November 1954 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States, published in "Messages to the Baha'i World, 1950-1957" 
(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1971), pp. 7475)<br>

</p><p>	Extracts from Letters Written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	1615. The world is in great turmoil, and what is most pathetic is 
that it has learned to keep away from God, Who alone can save it and 
alleviate its sufferings. It is our duty, we who have been trusted with 
the task of applying the divine remedy given by Baha'u'llah, to 
concentrate our attention upon the consummation of this task, and not 
rest until the peace foretold by the Prophets of God is permanently 
established....</p>
<p>	(9 December 1931 to the Baha'is of Tokyo)</p>
<p>	1616. Shoghi Effendi wrote his last general letter to the western 
friends because he felt that the public should be made to understand the
 attitude the Baha'i Faith maintains towards the prevailing economic and
 political problems. We should let the world know what the real aim of 
Baha'u'llah was. Up to the present Unity of Mankind was only of an 
academic importance. Now it is becoming more and more a subject for 
international statesmen to think of. It is coming to the field of 
practical politics. It is therefore a wonderful chance for us to come to
 the front and expound the teaching which is the goal and aim of the 
social precepts of Baha'u'llah. Shoghi Effendi hopes that the friends 
will re-echo this call to an organic unity of mankind until it forms 
part of the conscious faith of every living man in the world. Great 
judgement should be however practised lest we be misunderstood and our 
Faith be classed among radical movements.</p>
<p>	(28 January 1932 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	1617. Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your 
letter dated January 26th 1932 which accompanied a printed copy of his 
last general letter. He thanks you both for this as well as for the one 
hundred copies you are shipping to him. He is deeply gratified to learn 
that the friends find it interesting and worthwhile enough as to make 
its subject-matter the topic of their teaching campaign. He sincerely 
hopes that this will also awaken some of the friends to the importance 
of this teaching of the Cause and stimulate them to make a thorough and 
deep study of it. For it undoubtedly forms the goal of the social 
precepts of the Faith. There is no reason why the Baha'is should not 
take the lead in<br>
 advocating such a federation of the world, towards which the world is driven by forces it cannot control....</p>
<p>	(16 February 1932 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	1618. The different nations of the world will never attain peace 
except after recognizing the significance of the teachings and 
whole-heartedly upholding them for through those precepts all 
international problems will be solved and every man will secure the 
spiritual environment in which his soul can evolve and produce its 
highest fruits.</p>
<p>	(15 January 1933 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1619. The Guardian has also read with deep interest all the enclosed
 papers. He is firmly convinced that through perseverance and concerted 
action the cause of Peace will eventually triumph over all the dark 
forces which threaten the welfare and progress of the world today. But 
such purely human attempts are undoubtedly ineffective unless inspired 
and guided by the power of faith. Without the assistance of God, as 
given through the message of Baha'u'llah, peace can never be safely and 
adequately established. To disregard the Baha'i solution for world peace
 is to build on foundations of sand. To accept and apply it is to make 
peace not a mere dream, or an ideal, but a living reality. This is the 
point which the Guardian wishes you to develop, to emphasize again and 
again, and to support by convincing arguments. The Baha'i peace 
programme is, indeed, not only one way of attaining that goal. It is not
 even relatively the best. It is, in the last resort, the sole effective
 instrument for the establishment of the reign of peace in this world. 
This attitude does not involve any total repudiation of other solutions 
offered by various philanthropists. It merely shows their inadequacy 
compared to the Divine Plan for the unification of the world. We cannot 
escape the truth that nothing mundane can in the last resort be 
enduring, unless supported and sustained through the power of God.</p>
<p>	(25 September 1933 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1620. Whatever our shortcomings may be, and however formidable the 
forces of darkness which besiege us today, the unification of mankind as
 outlined and ensured by the World Order of Baha'u'llah will in the<br>
 fullness of time be firmly and permanently established. This is 
Baha'u'llah's promise, and no power on earth can in the long run prevent
 or even retard its adequate realization. The friends should, therefore,
 not lose hope, but fully conscious of their power and their role they 
should persevere in their mighty efforts for the extension and the 
consolidation of Baha'u'llah's universal dominion on earth.</p>
<p>	(6 November 1933 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1621. As regards the International Executive referred to by the 
Guardian in his "Goal of a New World Order", it should be noted that 
this statement refers by no means to the Baha'i Commonwealth of the 
future, but simply to that world government which will herald the advent
 and lead to the final establishment of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. 
The formation of this International Executive, which corresponds to the 
executive head or board in present-day national governments, is but a 
step leading to the Baha'i world government of the future, and hence 
should not be identified with either the institution of the Guardianship
 or that of the International House of Justice.</p>
<p>	(17 March 1934 to two believers)</p>
<p>	1622. In connection with your teaching work: what the Guardian 
wishes you to particularly emphasize in all your talks is the supreme 
necessity for all individuals and nations in this day to adopt in its 
entirety the social programme given by Baha'u'llah for the 
reconstruction of the religious, economic and political life of mankind.
 He wishes you to explain and analyze the elements that help in raising 
this Divine World Order in the light of the present-day events and 
conditions in the world. Special stress, he feels, should be laid on the
 impending necessity of establishing a supranational and sovereign world
 state, as the one described by Baha'u'llah. With the world becoming 
increasingly subject to tumults and convulsions never experienced 
before, the realization of such a necessity is entering into the 
consciousness of not only the wise and learned, but of the common people
 as well. The believers should, therefore, seize this opportunity and 
make a supreme effort to present, in a convincing and eloquent language,
 those social and humanitarian teachings of the Faith which we believe 
to constitute the sole panacea for the innumerable ills afflicting our 
present-day world.<br>

</p><p>	(15 November 1935 to two believers)</p>
<p>	1623. With reference to your question concerning 'Abdu'l-Baha's 
reference to "unity in the political realm": this unity should be 
clearly distinguished from the "unity of nations". The first is a unity 
which politically independent and sovereign states achieve among 
themselves; while the second is one which is brought about between 
nations, the difference between a state and a nation being that the 
former, as you know, is a political entity without necessarily being 
homogeneous in race, whereas the second implies national as well as 
political homogeneity.</p>
<p>	(26 July 1936 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1624. As regards your teaching work: the Guardian has already 
advised you to stress in your talks the idea of a world superstate, and 
the concept of the Oneness of Mankind underlying it. In addition, he 
wishes you also to emphasize the fact that humanity, taken as a whole, 
has entered the most critical and momentous stage of its evolution, the 
stage of maturity. This idea of the coming of age of mankind constitutes
 the central core of the Baha'i Teachings, and is the most 
distinguishing feature of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. A proper 
understanding of this concept gives the key to an adequate appreciation 
of the tremendous claim made by the Author of the Faith, both with 
regard to His own station, and to the incomparable greatness of His 
Dispensation.</p>
<p>	(12 October 1936 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1625. With reference to the question you have asked concerning the 
time and means through which the Lesser and Most Great Peace, referred 
to by Baha'u'llah, will be established, following the coming World War: 
Your view that the Lesser Peace will come about through the political 
efforts of the states and nations of the world, and independently of any
 direct Baha'i plan or effort, and the Most Great Peace be established 
through the instrumentality of the believers, and by the direct 
operation of the laws and principles revealed by Baha'u'llah and the 
functioning of the Universal House of Justice as the supreme organ of 
the Baha'i superstate -- your view on this subject is quite correct and 
in full accord with the pronouncements of the Guardian as embodied in 
"The Unfoldment of World Civilization".<br>

</p><p>	(14 March 1939 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, and to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1626. Though it is premature to try and endeavour to foresee on what
 basis various nations would be represented on any international 
council, or in any international form of government, it is clear that 
from the Baha'i standpoint it could only be carried out on a basis of 
true justice; and justice does not imply one race having a 
preponderating vote over some other race's representatives, and thus 
being in a position to dominate them.</p>
<p>	(12 April 1942 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1627. What 'Abdu'l-Baha meant about the women arising for peace is 
that this is a matter which vitally affects women, and when they form a 
conscious and overwhelming mass of public opinion against war there can 
be no war. The Baha'i women are already organized through being members 
of the Faith and the Administrative Order. No further organization is 
needed. But they should, through teaching and through the active moral 
support they give to every movement directed towards peace, seek to 
exert a strong influence on other women's minds in regard to this 
essential matter.</p>
<p>	(24 March 1945 to two believers)</p>
<p>	1628. The Seven Lights of Unity will not necessarily appear in the 
order given. A product of the second may well be universal culture.</p>
<p>	(19 November 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1629. The teachings of Baha'u'llah will establish a new way of life 
for humanity. Those who are Baha'is must endeavour to establish this way
 of life just as rapidly as possible. Now that the hour has arrived when
 the Baha'i Faith is gaining prominence, and is being reviewed by so 
many peoples, it is necessary that the adherents of the Faith should 
live up to the high ideals of the Faith in every way. In this way they 
can demonstrate that the Baha'i Faith does create a new way of life, 
which brings to the individual a complete association with the Will of 
God, and thus the establishment of a peaceful and universal society. 
Divisional attachments are of men, while universal service is of God.<br>

</p><p>	The Guardian is now anxious that all the friends achieve a universal consciousness and universal way of life.</p>
<p>	(20 November 1955 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1630. World government will come, but we do not know the date.</p>
<p>	(15 August 1957 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Extracts from Letters of the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	1631. When Baha'u'llah proclaimed His Message to the world in the 
nineteenth century He made it abundantly clear that the first step 
essential for the peace and progress of mankind was its unification. As 
He says, "The well-being of mankind, its peace and security are 
unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established."</p>
<p>	("The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 203)</p>
<p>	To this day, however, you will find most people take the opposite 
point of view: they look upon unity as an ultimate, almost unattainable 
goal and concentrate first on remedying all the other ills of mankind. 
If they did but know it, these other ills are but various symptoms and 
side effects of the basic disease -- disunity.</p>
<p>	Baha'u'llah has, furthermore, stated that the revivification of 
mankind and the curing of all its ills can be achieved only through the 
instrumentality of His Faith....</p>
<p>	We are told by Shoghi Effendi that two great processes are at work 
in the world: the great Plan of God, tumultuous in its progress, working
 through mankind as a whole, tearing down barriers to world unity and 
forging humankind into a unified body in the fires of suffering and 
experience. This process will produce, in God's due time, the Lesser 
Peace, the political unification of the world. Mankind at that time can 
be likened to a body that is unified but without life. The second 
process, the task of breathing life into this unified body -- of 
creating true unity and spirituality culminating in the Most Great Peace
 -- is that of the Baha'is, who are labouring consciously, with detailed
 instructions and continuing Divine guidance, to erect the fabric of the
 Kingdom of God on earth, into which they call their fellow men, thus 
conferring upon them eternal life.<br>

</p><p>	(8 December 1967, published in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages
 1963-1968", 1st rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1976), pp.
 131-34)</p>
<p>	1632. It is true that 'Abdu'l-Baha made statements linking the 
establishment of the unity of nations to the twentieth century. For 
example: 'The fifth candle is the unity of nations -- a unity which, in 
this century, will be securely established, causing all the peoples of 
the world to regard themselves as citizens of one common fatherland." 
And, in The "Promised Day Is Come", following a similar statement quoted
 from "Some Answered Questions", Shoghi Effendi makes this comment: 
"This is the stage which the world is now approaching, the stage of 
world unity, which, as 'Abdu'l-Baha assures us, will, in this century, 
be securely established."</p>
<p>	There is also this statement from a letter written in 1946 to an 
individual believer on behalf of the beloved Guardian by his secretary:</p>
<p>	All we know is that the Lesser and the Most Great Peace will come --
 their exact dates we do not know. The same is true as regards the 
possibility of a future war; we cannot state dogmatically it will or 
will not take place -- all we know is that mankind must suffer and be 
punished sufficiently to make it turn to God.</p>
<p>	(29 July 1974)</p>
<p>	Extracts from Letters Written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	1633. ...the Baha'i Faith aims to eliminate all war, including 
nuclear. The fundamental purpose of our Faith is unity and the 
establishment of peace. This goal, which is the longing of people 
throughout an increasingly insecure world, can only be achieved through 
the Teachings of Baha'u'llah. Since it is only the Baha'is who can give 
these Teachings to mankind, the friends must weigh carefully how they 
will spend their time and energy and guard against associating with 
activities which unduly distract them from their primary responsibility 
of sharing the Message of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(4 July 1982 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1634. At the present time, the subject of nuclear disarmament 
has become very much a political issue, with demonstrations taking place
 not only in the United States but also in England and some western 
European countries. To single out nuclear disarmament falls short of the
 Baha'i position and would involve the Faith in the current disputes 
between nations. It is very clear that Baha'is believe disarmament, not 
only of nuclear weapons but of biological, chemical and all other forms,
 is essential...</p>
<p>	(12 January 1983 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1635. Concerning the transition from the present system of national 
sovereignty to a system of world government, the House of Justice fully 
agrees with your view that the Baha'is must now do all in their power to
 promote this transition. This requires several related activities, all 
of which are goals of the present Seven Year Plan. One is the 
establishment as rapidly as possible of firmly grounded efficiently 
functioning Local Spiritual Assemblies in every part of the world, so 
that seekers everywhere will have a point of reference to which they can
 turn for guidance and for the Teachings of the Faith. A second is the 
deepening of the believers, of all ages, in their understanding of and 
obedience to the Teachings. A third is the proclamation of the Faith to 
all strata of society, and in particular to those in authority and to 
leaders of thought so that those who hold the direction of peoples in 
their hands will learn accurately about the nature and tenets of the 
Faith and will grow to respect it and implement its principles. A fourth
 is the promotion of Baha'i scholarship, so that an increasing number of
 believers will be able to analyse the problems of mankind in every 
field and to show how the Teachings solve them. A fifth is the 
development of relations between the Baha'i International Community and 
the United Nations both directly with the highest UN institutions and at
 a grass-roots level in areas of rural development, education, etc.</p>
<p>	As you are no doubt aware, the Guardian indicated that the 
development of mankind from its present chaotic condition to the stage 
of the Baha'i World Commonwealth would be a long and gradual one. The 
coming into existence of a World Authority and the initiation of the 
Lesser Peace, is one major transformation in this process, and will be 
followed by other stages of the development of the Faith as outlined by<br>
 Shoghi Effendi in his writings. Undoubtedly, as these developments are 
taking place, the counsel the institutions of the Faith can give to 
governments, the pattern of world administration offered by the Baha'i 
community and the great humanitarian projects which will be launched 
under the aegis of the Universal House of Justice, will exercise a great
 influence on the course of progress.</p>
<p>	(19 January 1983 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1636. It is true that Baha'is are not pacifists since we uphold the 
use of force in the service of justice and upholding law. But we do not 
believe that war is ever necessary and its abolition is one of the 
essential purposes and brightest promises of Baha'u'llah's revelation. 
His specific command to the kings of the earth is: "Should any one among
 you take up arms against another, rise ye all against him, for this is 
naught but manifest justice." (Tablet to Queen Victoria, "The 
Proclamation of Baha'u'llah", p. 13) The beloved Guardian has explained 
that the unity of mankind implies the establishment of a world 
commonwealth, a world federal system,".. .liberated from the curse of 
war and its miseries in which Force is made the servant of Justice..." 
whose world executive "backed by an international Force,...will 
safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth." This is 
obviously not war but the maintenance of law and order on a world scale.
 Warfare is the ultimate tragedy of disunity among nations where no 
international authority exists powerful enough to restrain them from 
pursuing their own limited interests. Baha'is therefore ask to serve 
their countries in non-combatant ways during such fighting; they will 
doubtless serve in such an international Force as Baha'u'llah envisions,
 whenever it comes into being.</p>
<p>	(11 September 1984 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1637. Baha'u'llah's principal mission in appearing at this time in 
human history is the realization of the oneness of mankind and the 
establishment of peace among the nations; therefore, all the forces 
which are focused on accomplishing these ends are influenced by His 
Revelation. We know, however, that peace will come in stages. First, 
there will come the Lesser Peace, when the unity of nations will be 
achieved, then gradually the Most Great Peace -- the spiritual as well 
as social and political unity of mankind, when the Baha'i World 
Commonwealth, operating in strict accordance<br>
 with the laws and ordinances of the Most Holy Book of the Baha'i 
Revelation, will have been established through the efforts of the 
Baha'is.</p>
<p>	As to the Lesser Peace, Shoghi Effendi has explained that this will 
initially be a political unity arrived at by decision of the governments
 of various nations; it will not be established by direct action of the 
Baha'i community. This does not mean, however, that the Baha'is are 
standing aside and waiting for the Lesser Peace to come before they do 
something about the peace of mankind. Indeed, by promoting the 
principles of the Faith, which are indispensable to the maintenance of 
peace, and by fashioning the instruments of the Baha'i Administrative 
Order, which we are told by the beloved Guardian is the pattern for 
future society, the Baha'is are constantly engaged in laying the 
groundwork for a permanent peace, the Most Great Peace being their 
ultimate goal. The Lesser Peace itself will pass through stages; at the 
initial stage the governments will act entirely on their own without the
 conscious involvement of the Faith; later on, in God's good time, the 
Faith will have a direct influence on it in ways indicated by Shoghi 
Effendi in his "The Goal of a New World Order". In connection with the 
steps that will lead to this latter stage, the Universal House of 
Justice will certainly determine what has to be done, in accordance with
 the guidance in the Writings, such as the passage you quoted from 
"Tablets of Baha'u'llah", page 89. In the meantime, the Baha'is will 
undoubtedly continue to do all in their power to promote the 
establishment of peace.</p>

<p>	1638. Be not dismayed, O peoples of the world, when the day star of 
My beauty is set, and the heaven of My tabernacle is concealed from your
 eyes. Arise to further My Cause, and to exalt My Word amongst men. We

<p>	1641. By the righteousness of God! Whoso openeth his lips in this 
Day and maketh mention of the name of his Lord, the hosts of Divine 
inspiration shall descend upon him from the heaven of My name, the 
All-Knowing, the All-Wise. On him shall also descend the Concourse on 
high, each bearing aloft a chalice of pure light. Thus hath it been 
foreordained in the realm of God's Revelation, by the behest of Him Who 
is the All-Glorious, the Most Powerful.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 129, p. 280)</p>
<p>	1642. They that have forsaken their country for the purpose of 
teaching Our Cause -- these shall the Faithful Spirit strengthen through
 its power. A company of Our chosen angels shall go forth with them, as 
bidden by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Wise. How great the 
blessedness that awaiteth him that hath attained the honor of serving 
the Almighty!...</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 157, p. 334)</p>
<p>	1643. Great is the blessedness of him who hath in this Day cast away
 the things current amongst men and hath clung unto that which is 
ordained by God, the Lord of Names and the Fashioner of all created 
things, He Who is come from the heaven of eternity through the power of 
the Most Great Name, invested with so invincible an authority that all 
the powers of the earth are unable to withstand Him. Unto this beareth 
witness the Mother Book, calling from the Most Sublime Station.</p>
<p>	(Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 48)</p>
<p>	1644. This is the most great, the most joyful tidings imparted by 
the Pen of this Wronged One to mankind. Wherefore fear ye, O My 
well-beloved ones? Who is it that can dismay you? A touch of moisture 
sufficeth to dissolve the hardened clay out of which this perverse 
generation is<br>
 moulded. The mere act of your gathering together is enough to scatter 
the forces of these vain and worthless people. ("Tablets of Baha'u'llah 
Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", pp. 8485) 1645. The source of courage
 and power is the promotion of the Word of God, and steadfastness in His
 Love.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 156)</p>
<p>	1646. He, verily, will aid everyone that aideth Him, and will 
remember everyone that remembereth Him. To this beareth witness this 
Tablet that hath shed the splendor of the loving-kindness of your Lord, 
the All-Glorious, the All Compelling....</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 76)</p>
<p>	1647. Every single letter proceeding from Our mouth is endowed with 
such regenerative power as to enable it to bring into existence a new 
creation -- a creation the magnitude of which is inscrutable to all save
 God. He verily hath knowledge of all things....</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 80)</p>
<p>	1648. It is in Our power, should We wish it, to enable a speck of 
floating dust to generate, in less than the twinkling of an eye, suns of
 infinite, of unimaginable splendour, to cause a dewdrop to develop into
 vast and numberless oceans, to infuse into every letter such a force as
 to empower it to unfold all the knowledge of past and future ages....</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", pp. 80-81)</p>
<p>	1649. We are possessed of such power which, if brought to light, 
will transmute the most deadly of poisons into a panacea of unfailing 
efficacy.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 81)</p>
<p>	1650. Say: Beware, O people of Baha, lest the strong ones of the 
earth rob you of your strength, or they who rule the world fill you with
 fear. Put your trust in God, and commit your affairs to His keeping. 
He, verily, will, through the power of truth, render you victorious, and
 He, verily, is<br>
 powerful to do what He willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of omnipotent might....</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 82)</p>
<p>	1651. By the righteousness of God, should a man, all alone, arise in
 the name of Baha and put on the armor of His love, him will the 
Almighty cause to be victorious, though the forces of earth and heaven 
be arrayed against him....</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected 
Letters", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 106)</p>
<p>	1652. By God besides Whom is none other God! Should any one arise 
for the triumph of our Cause, him will God render victorious though tens
 of thousands of enemies be leagued against him. And if his love for Me 
wax stronger, God will establish his ascendancy over all the powers of 
earth and heaven. Thus have We breathed the spirit of power into, all 
regions.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters" p.106)</p>
<p>	From the Writings and Utterances of the Bab:</p>
<p>	1653. Rid thou thyself of all attachments to aught except God, 
enrich thyself in God by dispensing with all else besides Him, and 
recite this prayer:</p>
<p>   Say: God sufficeth all things above all things, and nothing<br>
in the heavens or in the earth or in whatever lieth between<br>
them but God, thy Lord, sufficeth. Verily, He is in Himself the<br>
Knower, the Sustainer, the Omnipotent. </p>
<p>	Regard not the all-sufficing power of God as an idle fancy. It is 
that genuine faith which thou cherishest for the Manifestation of God in
 every Dispensation. It is such faith which sufficeth above all the 
things that exist on the earth, whereas no created thing on earth 
besides faith would suffice thee. If thou art not a believer, the Tree 
of divine Truth would condemn thee to extinction. If thou art a 
believer, thy faith shall be sufficient for thee above all things that 
exist on earth, even though thou possess nothing.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 123)<br>

</p><p>	1654. Say, verily any one follower of this Faith can, by the 
leave of God, prevail over all who dwell in heaven and earth and in 
whatever lieth between them; for indeed this is, beyond the shadow of a 
doubt, the one true Faith. Therefore fear ye not, neither be ye grieved.</p>
<p>	Say, God hath, according to that which is revealed in the Book, 
taken upon Himself the task of ensuring the ascendancy of any one of the
 followers of the Truth, over and above one hundred other souls, and the
 supremacy of one hundred believers over one thousand non-believers and 
the domination of one thousand of the faithful over all the peoples and 
kindreds of the earth; inasmuch as God calleth into being whatsoever He 
willeth by virtue of His behest. Verily He is potent over all things. 
Say, the power of God is in the hearts of those who believe in the unity
 of God and bear witness that no God is there but Him, while the hearts 
of them that associate partners with God are impotent, devoid of life on
 this earth, for assuredly they are dead.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab" p. 153)</p>
<p>	1655. When the Day-Star of Baha will shine resplendent above the 
horizon of eternity it is incumbent upon you to present yourselves 
before His Throne....</p>
<p>	Ye have, one and all, been called into being to seek His presence 
and to attain that exalted and glorious station. Indeed, He will send 
down from the heaven of His mercy that which will benefit you, and 
whatever is graciously vouchsafed by Him shall enable you to dispense 
with all mankind.... Indeed if it be His Will He can assuredly bring 
about the resurrection of all created things through a word from 
Himself. He is, in truth, over and above all this, the All-Powerful, the
 Almighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab", pp. 16466)</p>
<p>	1656. Hallowed be the Lord in Whose hand is the source of dominion. 
He createth whatsoever He willeth by His Word of command Be", and it is.
 His hath been the power of authority heretofore and it shall remain His
 hereafter. He maketh victorious whomsoever He pleaseth, through the 
potency of His behest. He is in truth the Powerful, the Almighty. Unto 
Him pertaineth all glory and majesty in the kingdoms of Revelation and<br>
 Creation and whatever lieth between them. Verily He is the Potent, the 
All Glorious. From everlasting He hath been the Source of indomitable 
strength and shall remain so unto everlasting. He is indeed the Lord of 
might and power. All the kingdoms of heaven and earth and whatever is 
between them are God's, and His power is supreme over all things. All 
the treasures of earth and heaven and everything between them are His, 
and His protection extendeth over all things. He is the Creator of the 
heavens and the earth and whatever lieth between them and He truly is a 
witness over all things. He is the Lord of Reckoning for all that dwell 
in the heavens and on earth and whatever lieth between them, and truly 
God is swift to reckon. He setteth the measure assigned to all who are 
in the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. Verily He is 
the Supreme Protector. He holdeth in His grasp the keys of heaven and 
earth and of everything between them. At His Own pleasure doth He bestow
 gifts, through the power of His command. Indeed His grace encompasseth 
all and He is the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab", p. 171)</p>
<p>	1657. Glorified art Thou, O God, Thou art the Creator of the heavens
 and the earth and that which lieth between them. Thou art the sovereign
 Lord, the Most Holy, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Magnified be Thy Name,
 O God, send down upon them who have believed in God and in His signs a 
mighty succour from Thy presence such as to enable them to prevail over 
the generality of mankind.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab, p. 176)</p>
<p>	1658. Praised art Thou, O Lord! At Thy behest Thou dost render 
victorious whomsoever Thou willest, through the hosts of heaven and 
earth and whatsoever existeth between them. Thou art the Sovereign, the 
Eternal Truth, the Lord of invincible might.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab", p. 177)</p>
<p>	1659. O Lord! Assist those who have renounced all else but Thee, and
 grant them a mighty victory. Send down upon them, O Lord, the concourse
 of the angels in heaven and earth and all that is between, to aid Thy 
servants, to succour and strengthen them, to enable them to achieve 
success, to sustain them, to invest them with glory, to confer upon them
 honour and<br>
 exaltation, to enrich them and to make them triumphant with a wondrous triumph.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab", p. 192)</p>
<p>	1660. Send forth, O God, such hosts as would render Thy faithful 
servants victorious. Thou dost fashion the created things through the 
power of Thy decree as Thou pleasest. Thou art in truth the Sovereign, 
the Creator, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab", p. 211)</p>
<p>	1661. Heed not your weaknesses and frailty; fix your gaze upon the 
invincible power of the Lord, your God, the Almighty. Has He not, in 
past days, caused Abraham, in spite of His seeming helplessness, to 
triumph over the forces of Nimrod? Has He not enabled Moses, whose staff
 was His only companion, to vanquish Pharaoh and his hosts? Has He not 
established the ascendancy of Jesus, poor and lowly as He was in the 
eyes of men, over the combined forces of the Jewish people? Has He not 
subjected the barbarous and militant tribes of Arabia to the holy and 
transforming discipline of Muhammad, His Prophet? Arise in His name, put
 your trust wholly in Him, and be assured of ultimate victory.</p>
<p>	(Addressed to the Letters of the Living cited in "The Dawn-Breakers:
 Nabil's Narrative of the Early Days of the Baha'i Revelation" trans. 
and ed. Shoghi Effendi (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1974), p. 94)</p>
<p>	From the Writings and Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	1662. These souls are the armies of God and the conquerors of the 
East and the West. Should one of them turn his face toward some 
direction and summon the people to the Kingdom of God, all the ideal 
forces and lordly confirmations will rush to his support and 
reinforcement. He will behold all the doors open and all the strong 
fortifications and impregnable castles razed to the ground. Singly and 
alone he will attack the armies of the world, defeat the right and left 
wings of the hosts of all the countries, break through the lines of the 
legions of all the nations and carry his attack to the very center of 
the powers of the earth. This is the meaning of the Hosts of God.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of the Divine Plan Revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the North 
American Baha'is" rev. ed. (Wilmette:Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), pp.
 47-48)<br>

</p><p>	1663. If in this day a soul shall act according to the precepts 
and the counsels of God, he will serve as a divine physician to mankind,
 and like the trump of Israfil,[1] he will call the dead of this 
contingent world to life; for the confirmations of the Abha Realm are 
never interrupted, and such a virtuous soul hath, to befriend him, the 
unfailing help of the Company on high. Thus shall a sorry gnat become an
 eagle in the fullness of his strength, and a feeble sparrow change to a
 royal falcon in the heights of ancient glory.<br>
 [1 Believed to be the angel appointed to sound the trumpet on the Day 
of Resurrection to raise the dead at the bidding of the Lord.]</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.I, (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 8, p. 23)</p>
<p>	1664. Know thou of a certainty that thy Lord will come to thine aid 
with a company of the Concourse on high and hosts of the Abha Kingdom. 
These will mount the attack, and will furiously assail the forces of the
 ignorant, the blind....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 19, p. 43)</p>
<p>	1665. If a small number of people gather lovingly together, with 
absolute purity and sanctity, with their hearts free of the world, 
experiencing the emotions of the Kingdom and the powerful magnetic 
forces of the Divine, and being at one in their happy fellowship, that 
gathering will exert its influence over all the earth. The nature of 
that band of people, the words they speak, the deeds they do, will 
unleash the bestowals of Heaven, and provide a foretaste of eternal 
bliss. The hosts of the Company on high will defend them, and the angels
 of the Abha Paradise, in continuous succession, will come down to their
 aid.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 39, p. 81)</p>
<p>	1666. He will come to your aid with invisible hosts, and support you
 with armies of inspiration from the Concourse above; He will send unto 
you sweet perfumes from the highest Paradise, and waft over you the pure
 breathings that blow from the rose gardens of the Company on high. He 
will breathe into your hearts the spirit of life, cause you to enter the
 Ark of salvation, and reveal unto you His clear tokens and signs. 
Verily is this abounding grace. Verily is this the victory that none can
 deny.<br>

</p><p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 157, pp. 186-87)</p>
<p>	1667. Rest ye assured that if a soul ariseth in the utmost 
perseverance and raiseth the Call of the Kingdom and resolutely 
promulgateth the Covenant, be he an insignificant ant he shall be 
enabled to drive away the formidable elephant from the arena, and if he 
be a feeble moth he shall cut to pieces the plumage of the rapacious 
vulture.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 184, p. 209)</p>
<p>	1668. The confirmations of Him Who is the Ever-Forgiving have 
wrapped every clime in light, the armies of the Company on high are 
rushing forward to do battle at the side of the friends of the Lord and 
carry the day...</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 193, p. 229)</p>
<p>1669. All praise and thanksgiving be unto the Blessed Beauty,<br>
for calling into action the armies of His Abha Kingdom, and<br>
sending forth to us His never-interrupted aid, dependable as<br>
the rising stars....<br>
("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 195, p.<br>
237)</p>
<p>	1670. Whensoever holy souls, drawing on the powers of heaven, shall 
arise with such qualities of the spirit, and march in unison, rank on 
rank, every one of those souls will be even as one thousand, and the 
surging waves of that mighty ocean will be even as the battalions of the
 Concourse on high....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha, sec. 207, p. 260)</p>
<p>	1671. It is clear that in this day, confirmations from the unseen 
world are encompassing all those who deliver the divine Message. Should 
the work of teaching lapse, these confirmations would be entirely cut 
off, since it is impossible for the loved ones of God to receive 
assistance unless they teach.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha, sec. 209, pp. 26465)</p>
<p>	1672. O ye servants of the Sacred Threshold! The triumphant hosts of
 the Celestial Concourse, arrayed and marshalled in the Realms above, 
stand ready and expectant to assist and assure victory to that valiant 
horseman<br>
 who with confidence spurs on his charger into the arena of service. 
Well is it with that fearless warrior, who armed with the power of true 
Knowledge, hastens unto the field, disperses the armies of ignorance, 
and scatters the hosts of error, who holds aloft the Standard of Divine 
Guidance, and sounds the Clarion of Victory. By the righteousness of the
 Lord! He hath achieved a glorious triumph and obtained the true 
victory.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 208, p. 264)</p>
<p>	1673. Be not grieved at the smallness of your number and thank God 
for the power of your spirits. He shall assist you with such a 
confirmation whereat minds will be astonished and souls will be amazed.</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, "Tablets of Abdul Baha Abbas, vol. 1 (Chicago: Bahai Publishing Committee 1930), p. 80)</p>
<p>	1674. Be ye assured with the greatest assurance that, verily, God 
will help those who are firm in His Covenant in every matter, through 
His confirmation and favor, the lights of which will shine forth unto 
the east of the earth, as well as the west thereof. He will make them 
the signs of guidance among the creation and as shining and glittering 
stars from all horizons.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. 1, p. 83)</p>
<p>	1675. Arise with every power to assist the Covenant of God and serve
 in His vineyard. Be confident that a confirmation will be granted unto 
you and a success on His part is given unto you. Verily, He shall 
support you by the angels of His holiness and reinforce you with the 
breaths of the Spirit that ye may mount the Ark of Safety, set forth the
 evident signs, impart the spirit of life, declare the essence of His 
commands and precepts, guide the sheep who are straying from the fold in
 all directions, and give the blessings. Ye have to use every effort in 
your power and strive earnestly and wisely in this new century. By God, 
verily the Lord of Hosts is your support, the angels of heaven your 
assistance, the Holy Spirit your companion and the Center of the 
Covenant your helper. Be not idle, but active and fear not....</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul Baha Abbas", vol. 1, p. 162; "Baha'i World Faith:
 Selected Writings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, [rev. ed.] 
(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1976), p. 362)<br>

</p><p>	1676. By the Lord of the Kingdom! If one arise to promote the 
Word of God with a pure heart, overflowing with the love of God and 
severed from the world, the Lord of Hosts will assist him with such a 
power as will penetrate the core of the existent beings.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas" vol 2 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Society, 1915) p. 348)</p>
<p>	1677. Your Lord hath assuredly promised His servants who are firm 
and steadfast to render them victorious at all times, to exalt their 
word, propagate their power, diffuse their lights, strengthen their 
hearts, elevate their banners, assist their hosts, brighten their stars,
 increase the abundance of the showers of mercy upon them, and enable 
the brave lions (or teachers) to conquer.</p>
<p>	Hasten, hasten, O ye firm believers! Hasten, hasten, O ye steadfast!
 Abandon the heedless, set aside every ignorant, take hold of the strong
 rope, be firm in this Great Cause, draw light from this Evident Light, 
be patient and be steadfast in this wise Religion! Ye shall see the 
hosts of inspiration descending successively from the Supreme World, the
 procession of attraction falling incessantly from the heights of 
heaven, the abundance of the Kingdom of El-ABHA outpouring continually 
and the teachings of God penetrating with the utmost power, while the 
heedless are indeed in evident loss.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas" vol. 2, pp. 442-43)</p>
<p>	1678. Today, any soul who looseneth his tongue in the delivery of 
Truth and is engaged in the diffusion of the fragrances of God, he shall
 undoubtedly be assisted and confirmed by the Holy Spirit and can resist
 the attacks of all the people of the world, [for the] power of the 
Realm of Might shall prevail. That is why thou seest that, although the 
disciples of Christ were physically weak and apparently vanquished by 
the persecution of every king, yet in the end were victorious over all 
and brought them under their protection.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas, vol. 3 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Society, 1916), p. 508)</p>
<p>	1679. Should anyone in this day attach his heart to the Kingdom, 
release himself from all else save God and become attracted to the 
fragrances of<br>
 holiness, the army of the Kingdom of ABHA will help him and the angels of the Supreme Concourse will assist him.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. 3, p. 591)</p>
<p>	1680. Remember not your own limitations; the help of God will come to you. Forget yourself. God's help will surely come!</p>
<p>	When you call on the Mercy of God waiting to reinforce you, your 
strength will be tenfold. Look at me: I am so feeble, yet I have had the
 strength given me to come amongst you: a poor servant of God, who has 
been enabled to give you this message! I shall not be with you long! One
 must never consider one's own feebleness, it is the strength of the 
Holy Spirit of Love, which gives the power to teach. The thought of our 
own weakness could only bring despair. We must look higher than all 
earthly thoughts; detach ourselves from every material idea, crave for 
the things of the spirit; fix our eyes on the everlasting bountiful 
Mercy of the Almighty, who will fill our souls with the gladness of 
joyful service to His command 'Love One Another'.</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 
1911-1912", 10th ed. (London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1979), pp. 38-39)</p>
<p>	1681. How great, how very great is the Cause; how very fierce the 
onslaught of all the peoples and kindreds of the earth! Erelong shall 
the clamor of the multitude throughout Africa, throughout America, the 
cry of the European and of the Turk, the groaning of India and China be 
heard from far and near. One and all they shall arise with all their 
power to resist His Cause. Then shall the Knights of the Lord, assisted 
by grace from on high, strengthened by faith, aided by the power of 
understanding and reinforced by the legions of the Covenant, arise and 
make manifest the truth of the verse: 'Behold the confusion that hath 
befallen the tribes of the defeated!'[1]<br>
 [1 Qur'an 38: 11]</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 
1922-1932" [rev. ed.], (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), p. 
123)<br>

</p><p>	1682. The Bab hath said: "Should a tiny ant desire, in this day,
 to be possessed of such power as to be able to unravel the abstrusest 
and most bewildering passages of the Qur'an, its wish will no doubt be 
fulfilled, inasmuch as the mystery of eternal might vibrates within the 
innermost being of all created things." If so helpless a creature can be
 endowed with so subtle a capacity, how much more efficacious must be 
the power released through the liberal effusions of the grace of 
Baha'u'llah!</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice" p. 46)</p>
<p>	1683. The Kingdom of God is possessed of limitless potency. 
Audacious must be the army of life if the confirming aid of that Kingdom
 is to be repeatedly vouchsafed unto it.... Vast is the arena, and the 
time ripe to spur on the charger within it. Now is the time to reveal 
the force of one's strength, the stoutness of one's heart and the might 
of one's soul.</p>
<p>	(Cited in a letter dated 28 January 1939 to the National Spiritual 
Assembly of the United States and Canada, published in Shoghi Effendi 
"Messages to America: Selected Letters and Cablegrams Addressed to the 
Baha'is of North America 1932-1946" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing 
Committee, 1947), p. 17)</p>
<p>	1684. And now you, if you act in accordance with the teachings of 
Baha'u'llah, may rest assured that you will be aided and confirmed. In 
all affairs which you undertake, you shall be rendered victorious, and 
all the inhabitants of the earth cannot withstand you. You are the 
conquerors, because the power of the Holy Spirit is your assistant. 
Above and over physical forces, phenomenal forces, the Holy Spirit 
itself shall aid you</p>
<p>	(Published in "Star of the West, voL 8, no. 8 (1 August 1917), p. 103)</p>
<p>	1685. Be ye valiant and fearless! Day by day add to your spiritual 
victories. Be ye not disturbed by the constant assaults of the enemies. 
Attack ye like unto the roaring lions. Have no thought of yourselves, 
for the invisible armies of the Kingdom are fighting on your side. Enter
 ye the battlefield with the Confirmations of the Holy Spirit. Know ye 
of a certainty that the powers of the Kingdom of Abha are with you. The 
hosts of the heaven of Truth are with you. The cool breezes of the 
Paradise of Abha are wafting over your heated brows. Not for a moment 
are ye alone. Not for a second are ye left to yourselves. The Beauty of 
Abha is with you. The Glorious God is with you. The King of Kings is 
with you.<br>

</p><p>	(Published in "Star of the West" vol. 13, no. 5 (August 1922), p. 113)</p>
<p>	From Letters and Cables Written by Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	1686. Difficult and delicate though be our task, the sustaining 
power of Baha'u'llah and of His Divine guidance will assuredly assist us
 if we follow steadfastly in His way, and strive to uphold the integrity
 of His laws. The light of His redeeming grace, which no earthly power 
can obscure, will if we persevere, illuminate our path, as we steer our 
course amid the snares and pitfalls of a troubled age, and will enable 
us to discharge our duties in a manner that would redound to the glory 
and the honour of His blessed Name.</p>

of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", p. 67)</p>
<p>	1687. "Peter,"'Abdu'l-Baha has testified, "according to the history 
of the Church, was also incapable of keeping count of the days of the 
week. Whenever he decided to go fishing, he would tie up his weekly food
 into seven parcels, and every day he would eat one of them, and when he
 had reached the seventh, he would know that the Sabbath had arrived, 
and thereupon would observe it." If the Son of Man was capable of 
infusing into apparently so crude and helpless an instrument such 
potency as to cause, in the words of Baha'u'llah, "the mysteries of 
wisdom and of utterance to flow out of his mouth," and to exalt him 
above the rest of His disciples, and render him fit to become His 
successor and the founder of His Church, how much more can the Father, 
Who is Baha'u'llah, empower the most puny and insignificant among His 
followers to achieve, for the execution of His purpose, such wonders as 
would dwarf the mightiest achievements of even the first apostle of 
Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>	("The Advent of Divine Justice, p. 46)</p>
<p>	1688. The field is indeed so immense, the period so critical, the 
Cause so great, the workers so few, the time so short, the privilege so 
priceless, that no follower of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, worthy to bear 
His name, can afford a moment's hesitation. That God-born Force, 
irresistible in its sweeping power, incalculable in its potency, 
unpredictable in its course, mysterious in its workings, and 
awe-inspiring in its manifestations -- a<br>
 Force which, as the Bab has written, "vibrates within the innermost 
being of all created things," and which, according to Baha'u'llah, has 
through its "vibrating influence," "upset the equilibrium of the world 
and revolutionized its ordered life" -- such a Force, acting even as a 
two-edged sword, is, under our very eyes, sundering, on the one hand, 
the age-old ties which for centuries have held together the fabric of 
civilized society, and is unloosing, on the other, the bonds that still 
fetter the infant and as yet unemancipated Faith of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	("The Advent of Divine Justice", pp. 46-47)</p>
<p>	1689. There is no time to lose. There is no room left for 
vacillation. Multitudes hunger for the Bread of Life. The stage is set. 
The firm and irrevocable Promise is given. God's own Plan has been set 
in motion. It is gathering momentum with every passing day. The powers 
of heaven and earth mysteriously assist in its execution. Such an 
opportunity is irreplaceable. Let the doubter arise, and himself verify 
the truth of such assertions. To try, to persevere, is to ensure 
ultimate and complete victory.</p>

<p>	1690. Faced with such a challenge, a community that has scaled thus 
far such peaks of enduring achievement can neither falter nor recoil. 
Confident in its destiny, reliant on its God-given power, fortified by 
the consciousness of its past victories, galvanized into action at the 
sight of a slowly disrupting civilization, it will -- I can have no 
doubt -- continue to fulfil unflinchingly the immediate requirements of 
its task, assured that with every step it takes and with each stage it 
traverses, a fresh revelation of Divine light and strength will guide 
and propel it forward until it consummates, in the fullness of time and 
in the plenitude of its power, the Plan inseparably bound up with its 
shining destiny.</p>

</p><p>	1691. The field, in all its vastness and fertility, is wide open
 and near at hand. The harvest is ripe. The hour is overdue. The signal 
has been given. The spiritual forces mysteriously released are already 
operating with increasing momentum, unchallenged and unchecked. Victory,
 speedy and unquestioned, is assured to whomsoever will arise and 
respond to this second, this urgent and vital call.</p>

<p>	1692. The vastness of the field, the smallness of your numbers, the 
indifference of the masses, must neither discourage nor appall you. You 
should at all times fix your gaze on the promise of Baha'u'llah, put 
your whole trust in His creative Word, recall the past and manifold 
evidences of His all-encompassing and resistless power, and arise to 
become worthy and exemplary recipients of His all-sustaining grace and 
blessings.</p>

passing hour, will not recur, some for yet another century, others never
 again. However severe the challenge, however multiple the tasks, 
however short the time, however sombre the world outlook, however 
limited the material resources of a hard-pressed adolescent community,

 and prolonged the effort required, whatsoever the nature of the perils 
and pitfalls that beset the path of whoever arises to revive the 
fortunes of a Faith struggling against the rising forces of materialism,
 nationalism, secularism, racialism and ecclesiastism, the

<p>	From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	1703. Perhaps the reason why you have not accomplished so much in 
the field of teaching is the extent you looked upon your own weaknesses 
and inabilities to spread the message. Baha'u'llah and the Master have 
both urged us repeatedly to disregard our own handicaps and lay our 
whole reliance upon God. He will come to our help if we only arise and 
become an active channel for God's grace. Do you think it is the 
teachers who make converts and change human hearts? No, surely not. They
 are only pure souls who take the first step, and then let the spirit of
 Baha'u'llah move them and make use of them. If any one of them should 
even for a second consider his achievements as due to his own 
capacities, his work is ended and his fall starts. This is in fact the 
reason why so many competent souls have after wonderful services 
suddenly found themselves absolutely impotent and perhaps thrown aside 
by the Spirit of the Cause as useless souls. The criterion is the extent
 to which we are ready to have the will of God operate through us.</p>
<p>	Stop being conscious of your frailties, therefore; have a perfect 
reliance upon God; let your heart burn with the desire to serve His 
mission<br>
 and proclaim His call; and you will observe how eloquence and the power to change human hearts will come as a matter of course.</p>
<p>	Shoghi Effendi will surely pray for your success if you should arise
 and start to teach. In fact the mere act of arising will win for you 
God's help and blessings.</p>
<p>	(Dated 31 March 1932 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1704. You should never look at your own limitations, much less allow
 them to deter you from promoting the Message. For the believers, 
whether capable or not, whether poor or rich, and whether influential or
 obscure, are after all but mere channels through which God carries His 
message to mankind. They are instruments, whereby He communicates His 
will to His people. The friends, therefore, must cease looking at their 
own deficiencies in a way that would kill in them the spirit of 
initiative and of service. They should have confidence in the divine 
assistance promised to them by Baha'u'llah, and kill in them the spirit 
of initiative and of service. They should have confidence in the divine 
assistance promised to them by Baha'u'llah, and strengthened and revived
 by such an assurance they should continue to toil till the very end of 
their life.</p>
<p>	(Dated 18 March 1934 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1705. The invisible hosts of the Kingdom are ready to extend to you 
all the assistance you need, and through them you will no doubt succeed 
in removing every obstacle in your way, and in fulfilling this most 
cherished desire of your heart. Baha'u'llah has given us [a] promise 
that should we persevere in our efforts and repose all our confidence in
 Him the doors of success will be widely open before us....</p>
<p>	(Dated 22 September 1936 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1706. The harder you strive to attain your goal, the greater will be
 the confirmations of Baha'u'llah, and the more certain you can feel to 
attain success. Be cheerful, therefore, and exert yourself with full 
faith and confidence. For Baha'u'llah has promised His Divine assistance
 to everyone who arises with a pure and detached heart to spread His 
holy Word, even though he may be bereft of every human knowledge and 
capacity, and notwithstanding the forces of darkness and of opposition 
which may be arrayed against him. The goal is clear, the path safe and<br>
 certain, and the assurances of Baha'u'llah as to the eventual success 
of our efforts quite emphatic. Let us keep firm, and whole-heartedly 
carry on the great work which He has entrusted into our hands.</p>
<p>	(Dated 3 February 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1707. The Baha'i teacher must be all confidence. Therein lies his 
strength and the secret of his success. Though single-handed, and no 
matter how great the apathy of the people around you may be, you should 
have faith that the hosts of the Kingdom are on your side, and that 
through their help you are bound to overcome the forces of darkness that
 are facing the Cause of God. Persevere, be happy and confident, 
therefore.</p>
<p>	(Dated 30 June 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1708. ...he would advise you to persevere in the task you have set 
your heart to accomplish, confident that through Divine assistance you 
will be able, sooner or later, to attain your goal. Reliance on God is 
indeed the strongest and safest weapon which the Baha'i teacher can 
carry. For by its means no earthly power can remain unconquered, and no 
obstacle become insuperable.</p>
<p>	(Dated 27 March 1938 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1709. Smallness of numbers, lack of skilled teachers, and modesty of
 means should not discourage or deter them. They must remember the 
glorious history of the Cause, which, both East and West, was 
established by dedicated souls who, for the most part, were neither 
rich, famous, nor well educated, but whose devotion, zeal and 
self-sacrifice overcame every obstacle and won miraculous victories for 
the Faith of God.... Let them dedicate themselves -- young and old, men 
and women alike -- and go forth and settle in new districts, travel, and
 teach in spite of lack of experience, and be assured that Baha'u'llah 
has promised to aid all those who arise in His Name. His strength will 
sustain them; their own weakness is unimportant.</p>
<p>	(Dated 29 June 1941 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the of the Baha'is of India, published in "Dawn of a New Day", p. 89)<br>

</p><p>	1710. Baha'u'llah has said that God will assist all those who 
arise in His service. The more you labour for His Faith, the more He 
will aid and bless you.</p>
<p>	(Dated 23 November 1941 to the Baha'is of Quito, Ecuador)</p>
<p>	1711. If the friends always waited until they were fully qualified 
to do any particular task, the work of the Cause would be almost at a 
standstill! But the very act of striving to serve, however unworthy one 
may feel, attracts the blessings of God and enables one to become more 
fitted for the task.</p>
<p>	(Dated 4 May 1942 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1712. When once a few bold, self-sacrificing individuals have arisen
 to serve, their example will no doubt encourage other timid, would-be 
pioneers to follow in their footsteps. The history of our Faith is full 
of records of the remarkable things achieved by really very simple, 
insignificant individuals, who became veritable beacons and towers of 
strength through having placed their trust in God, having arisen to 
proclaim His Message....</p>
<p>	(Dated 27 March 1945 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles)</p>
<p>	1713. Once the friends start out to win the goals set in their Plan,
 they will find the Divine confirmations sustaining them and hastening 
its consummation....</p>
<p>	(Dated 9 August 1945 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles)</p>
<p>	1714. It shows that wherever and whenever the friends arise to 
serve, the mysterious power latent in this Divine Cause rushes in to 
bless and reinforce their labours far beyond their fondest hopes.</p>
<p>	(Dated 18 February 1947 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1715. Each one of us, if we look into our failures, is sure to feel 
unworthy and despondent, and this feeling only frustrates our 
constructive efforts and wastes time. The thing for us to focus on is 
the glory of the Cause and the Power of Baha'u'llah which can make of a 
mere drop a surging sea!</p>
<p>	(Dated 13 October 1947 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1716. ...when we put our trust in Him, Baha'u'llah solves our problems and opens the way.</p>
<p>	(Dated 12 October 1949 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1717. Just one mature soul, with spiritual understanding and a 
profound knowledge of the Faith, can set a whole country ablaze -- so 
great is the power of the Cause to work through a pure and selfless 
channel.</p>
<p>	(Dated 6 November 1949 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1718. At all times we must look at the greatness of the Cause, and 
remember that Baha'u'llah will assist all who arise in His service. When
 we look at ourselves, we are sure to feel discouraged by our 
shortcomings and insignificance!</p>
<p>	(Dated 12 December 1950 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1719. Today, as never before, the magnet which attracts the 
blessings from on high is teaching the Faith of God. The Hosts of Heaven
 are poised between heaven and earth, just waiting, and patiently, for 
the Baha'i to step forth, with pure devotion and consecration, to teach 
the Cause of God, so they may rush to his aid and assistance. It is the 
Guardian's prayer that the Friends may treble their efforts, as the time
 is short -- alas, the workers too few. Let those who wish to achieve 
immortality step forth and raise the Divine Call. They will be 
astonished at the spiritual victories they will gain.</p>
<p>	(Dated 28 March 1953 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1720. The Hosts of the Supreme Concourse are in martial array, 
poised between Earth and Heaven ready to rush to the assistance of those
 who arise to Teach the Faith. If one seeks the confirmation of the Holy
 Spirit, one can find it in rich abundance in the Teaching Field. The 
world is seeking as never before, and if the Friends will arise with new
 determination, fully consecrated to the noble task ahead of them, 
victory after victory will be won for the Glorious Faith of God.</p>
<p>	(Dated 2 February 1956 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1721. The Friends must realize the Power of the Holy Spirit which is
 manifest and quickening them at this time through the appearance of<br>
 Baha'u'llah. There is no force of heaven or earth which can affect them
 if they place themselves wholly under the influence of the Holy Spirit 
and under its guidance....</p>

</p><p>	THE IMPORTANCE OF PRAYER, MEDITATION AND THE DEVOTIONAL ATTITUDE:</p>
<p>	A COMPILATION</p>
<p>	March 1980</p>
<p>	Extracts from the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	1722. Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words, that ye may 
unravel its secrets, and discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid 
in its depths. Take heed that ye do not vacillate in your determination 
to embrace the truth of this Cause -- a Cause through which the 
potentialities of the might of God have been revealed, and His 
sovereignty established. With faces beaming with joy, hasten ye unto 
Him. This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal 
in the future. Let him that seeketh, attain it; and as to him that hath 
refused to seek it -verily, God is Self-Sufficient, above any need of 
His creatures.</p>
<p>	("A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy 
Book of Baha'u'llah", 1st ed. (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1973), pp. 
27-28)</p>
<p>	1723. Recite ye the verses of God every morning and evening. Whoso 
reciteth them not hath truly failed to fulfil his pledge to the Covenant
 of God and His Testament, and whoso in this day turneth away therefrom 
hath indeed turned away from God since time immemorial. Fear ye God, O 
concourse of My servants!</p>
<p>	Take heed lest excessive reading and too many acts of piety in the 
daytime and in the night season make you vainglorious. Should a person 
recite but a single verse from the Holy Writings in a spirit of joy and 
radiance, this would be better for him than reciting wearily all the 
Scriptures of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Recite ye the
 verses of God in such measure that ye be not overtaken with fatigue or 
boredom. Burden not your souls so as to cause exhaustion and weigh them 
down, but rather endeavour to lighten them, that they may soar on the 
wings of revealed Verses unto the dawning-place of His signs. This is 
conducive to nearer access unto God, were ye to comprehend.</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Aqdas" provisional translation from the Arabic)<br>

</p><p>	1724. The wine of renunciation must needs be quaffed, the lofty 
heights of detachment must needs be attained, and the meditation 
referred to in the words "One hour's reflection is preferable to seventy
 years of pious worship" must needs be observed, so that the secret of 
the wretched behaviour of the people might be discovered, those people 
who, despite the love and yearning for truth which they profess, curse 
the followers of Truth when once He hath been made manifest....</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Iqan" [rev. ed.], (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1985), p. 238)</p>
<p>	1725. In like manner, those words that have streamed forth from the 
source of power and descended from the heaven of glory are innumerable 
and beyond the ordinary comprehension of man. To them that are possessed
 of true understanding and insight the Surah of Hud surely sufficeth. 
Ponder a while those holy words in your heart, and, with utter 
detachment, strive to grasp their meaning....</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Iqan" p. 5)</p>
<p>	1726. O brother, we should open our eyes, meditate upon His Word, 
and seek the sheltering shadow of the Manifestations of God, that 
perchance we may be warned by the unmistakable counsels of the Book, and
 give heed to the admonitions recorded in the holy Tablets; that we may 
not cavil at the Revealer of the verses, that we may resign ourselves 
wholly to His Cause, and embrace wholeheartedly His law, that haply we 
may enter the court of His mercy, and dwell upon the shore of His grace.
 He, verily, is merciful, and forgiving towards His servants.</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Iqan" p. 217)</p>
<p>	O SON OF GLORY!</p>
<p>	1727. Be swift in the path of holiness, and enter the heaven of 
communion with Me. Cleanse thy heart with the burnish of the spirit, and
 hasten to the court of the Most High.</p>
<p>	("The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah", Persian no. 8, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1985), p. 24)</p>
<p>	1728. Say: Deliver your souls, O people, from the bondage of self, 
and purify them from all attachment to anything besides Me. Remembrance 
of Me cleanseth all things from defilement, could ye but perceive it. 
Say: Were<br>
 all created things to be entirely divested of the veil of worldly 
vanity and desire, the Hand of God would in this Day clothe them, one 
and all, with the robe "He doeth whatsoever He willeth in the kingdom of
 creation," that thereby the sign of His sovereignty might be manifested
 in all things. Exalted then be He, the Sovereign Lord of all, the 
Almighty, the Supreme Protector, the All-Glorious, the Most Powerful.</p>
<p>	Intone, O My servant, the verses of God that have been received by 
thee, as intoned by them who have drawn nigh unto Him, that the 
sweetness of thy melody may kindle thine own soul, and attract the 
hearts of all men. Whoso reciteth, in the privacy of his chamber, the 
verses revealed by God, the scattering angels of the Almighty shall 
scatter abroad the fragrance of the words uttered by his mouth, and 
shall cause the heart of every righteous man to throb. Though he may, at
 first, remain unaware of its effect, yet the virtue of the grace 
vouchsafed unto him must needs sooner or later exercise its influence 
upon his soul. Thus have the mysteries of the Revelation of God been 
decreed by virtue of the Will of Him Who is the Source of power and 
wisdom.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), sec. 136, pp. 29495)</p>
<p>	1729. O Salman! All that the sages and mystics have said or written 
have never exceeded, nor can they ever hope to exceed, the limitations 
to which man's finite mind hath been strictly subjected. To whatever 
heights the mind of the most exalted of men may soar, however great the 
depths which the detached and understanding heart can penetrate, such 
mind and heart can never transcend that which is the creature of their 
own conceptions and the product of their own thoughts. The meditations 
of the profoundest thinker, the devotions of the holiest of saints, the 
highest expressions of praise from either human pen or tongue, are but a
 reflection of that which hath been created within themselves, through 
the revelation of the Lord, their God. Whoever pondereth this truth in 
his heart will readily admit that there are certain limits which no 
human being can possibly transgress. Every attempt which, from the 
beginning that hath no beginning, hath been made to visualize and know 
God is limited by the exigencies of His own creation- a creation which 
He, through the operation of His own Will and for the purposes of none 
other but His own Self, hath called into being. Immeasurably exalted is 
He<br>
 above the strivings of human mind to grasp His Essence, or of human tongue to describe His mystery....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 148, pp. 317-18)</p>
<p>1730. Do thou meditate on that which We have revealed unto<br>
thee, that thou mayest discover the purpose of God, thy Lord,<br>
and the Lord of all worlds. In these words the mysteries of<br>
Divine Wisdom have been treasured....<br>
("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 79, p. 153)</p>
<p>	1731. Were any man to ponder in his heart that which the Pen of the 
Most High hath revealed and to taste of its sweetness, he would, of a 
certainty, find himself emptied and delivered from his own desires, and 
utterly subservient to the Will of the Almighty. Happy is the man that 
hath attained so high a station, and hath not deprived himself of so 
bountiful a grace.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 163, p. 343)</p>
<p>	1732. Occupy thyself in remembrance of the Beauty of Him Who is the 
Unconstrained at early morn, and seek communion with Him at the hour of 
dawn. O 'Ali! Remembrance of Me is a healing medicine to the souls and a
 light to the hearts of men.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	Extracts from the Writings of the Bab</p>
<p>	1733. It is seemly that the servant should, after each prayer, 
supplicate God to bestow mercy and forgiveness upon his parents. 
Thereupon God's call will be raised:'Thousand upon thousand of what thou
 hast asked for thy parents shall be thy recompense!' Blessed is he who 
remembereth his parents when communing with God. There is, verily, no 
God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 94)</p>
<p>	1734. The reason why privacy hath been enjoined in moments of 
devotion is this, that thou mayest give thy best attention to the 
remembrance of God, that thy heart may at all times be animated with His
 Spirit, and not<br>
 be shut out as by a veil from thy Best Beloved. Let not thy tongue pay 
lip service in praise of God while thy heart be not attuned to the 
exalted Summit of Glory, and the Focal Point of communion. Thus if haply
 thou dost live in the Day of Resurrection, the mirror of thy heart will
 be set towards Him Who is the Day-Star of Truth; and no sooner will His
 light shine forth than the splendour thereof shall forthwith be 
reflected in thy heart. For He is the Source of all goodness, and unto 
Him revert all things. But if He appeareth while thou hast turned unto 
thyself in meditation, this shall not profit thee, unless thou shalt 
mention His Name by words He hath revealed. For in the forthcoming 
Revelation it is He Who is the Remembrance of God, whereas the devotions
 which thou art offering at present have been prescribed by the Point of
 the Bayan, while He Who will shine resplendent in the Day of 
Resurrection is the Revelation of the inner reality enshrined in the 
Point of the Bayan -- a Revelation more potent, immeasurably more 
potent, than the one which hath preceded it.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab, pp. 93-94)</p>
<p>	1735. Worship thou God in such wise that if thy worship lead thee to
 the fire, no alteration in thine adoration would be produced, and so 
likewise if thy recompense should be paradise. Thus and thus alone 
should be the worship which befitteth the one True God. Shouldst thou 
worship Him because of fear, this would be unseemly in the sanctified 
Court of His presence, and could not be regarded as an act by thee 
dedicated to the Oneness of His Being. Or if thy gaze should be on 
paradise, and thou shouldst worship Him while cherishing such a hope, 
thou wouldst make God's creation a partner with Him, notwithstanding the
 fact that paradise is desired by men.</p>
<p>	Fire and paradise both bow down and prostrate themselves before God.
 That which is worthy of His Essence is to worship Him for His sake, 
without fear of fire, or hope of paradise. Although when true worship is
 offered, the worshipper is delivered from the fire, and entereth the 
paradise of God's good-pleasure, yet such should not be the motive of 
his act. However, God's favour and grace ever flow in accordance with 
the exigencies of His inscrutable wisdom. The most acceptable prayer is 
the one offered with the utmost spirituality and radiance; its 
prolongation hath not been and is not<br>
 beloved by God. The more detached and the purer the prayer, the more acceptable is it in the presence of God.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab" pp. 77-78)</p>
<p>	Extracts from the Writings and Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	1736. O thou who hast bowed thyself down in prayer before the 
Kingdom of God! Blessed art thou, for the beauty of the divine 
Countenance hath enraptured thy heart, and the light of inner wisdom 
hath filled it full, and within it shineth the brightness of the 
Kingdom. Know thou that God is with thee under all conditions, and that 
He guardeth thee from the changes and chances of this world and hath 
made thee a handmaid in His mighty vineyard....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed ], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 91, p. 122)</p>
<p>	1737. Praise be to God, thy heart is engaged in the commemoration of
 God, thy soul is gladdened by the glad tidings of God and thou art 
absorbed in prayer. The state of prayer is the best of conditions, for 
man is then associating with God. Prayer verily bestoweth life, 
particularly when offered in private and at times, such as midnight, 
when freed from daily cares.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 172, p. 202)</p>
<p>	1738. Thou hast asked about places of worship and the underlying 
reason therefor. The wisdom in raising up such buildings is that at a 
given hour, the people should know it is time to meet, and all should 
gather together, and, harmoniously attuned one to another, engage in 
prayer; with the result that out of this coming together, unity and 
affection shall grow and flourish in the human heart.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 58, pp. 94-95)</p>
<p>	1739. Praised be God, ye two have demonstrated the truth of your 
words by your deeds, and have won the confirmations of the Lord God. 
Every day at first light, ye gather the Baha'i children together and 
teach them the communes and prayers. This is a most praiseworthy act, 
and bringeth joy to the children's hearts: that they should, at every 
morn, turn their faces<br>
 toward the Kingdom and make mention of the Lord and praise His Name, and in the sweetest of voices, chant and recite.</p>
<p>	These children are even as young plants, and teaching them the 
prayers is as letting the rain pour down upon them, that they may wax 
tender and fresh, and the soft breezes of the love of God may blow over 
them, making them to tremble with joy.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 115, p. 139)</p>
<p>	1740. O handmaid of God! Prayers are granted through the universal 
Manifestations of God. Nevertheless, where the wish is to obtain 
material things, even where the heedless are concerned, if they 
supplicate, humbly imploring God's help- even their prayer hath an 
effect.</p>
<p>	O handmaid of God! The prayers which were revealed to ask for 
healing apply both to physical and spiritual healing. Recite them, then,
 to heal both the soul and the body. If healing is right for the 
patient, it will certainly be granted; but for some ailing persons, 
healing would only be the cause of other ills, and therefore wisdom doth
 not permit an affirmative answer to the prayer.</p>
<p>	O handmaid of God! The power of the Holy Spirit healeth both physical and spiritual ailments.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 139, pp. 161-62)</p>
<p>	1741. Beseech thou from God's infinite grace whatsoever thou 
desirest. But wert thou to heed my advice thou wouldst desire naught 
save entrance into the Abha Kingdom, and seek naught save the bounties 
of the Beauty of the All-Glorious, may my life be sacrificed for His 
loved ones. This is my exhortation to thee.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	1742. Thou hast asked about material means and prayer. Prayer is 
like the spirit and material means are like the human hand. The spirit 
operateth through the instrumentality of the hand. Although the one true
 God is the All-Provider, it is the earth which is the means to supply 
sustenance. "The heaven hath sustenance for you"[1] but when sustenance 
is decreed it becometh available, whatever the means may be. When man 
refuseth to<br>
 use material means, he is like a thirsty one who seeketh to quench his 
thirst through means other than water or other liquids. The Almighty 
Lord is the provider of water, and its maker, and hath decreed that it 
be used to quench man's thirst, but its use is dependent upon His Will. 
If it should not be in conformity with His Will, man is afflicted with a
 thirst which the oceans cannot quench.<br>
 [1 Qur'an 51:22]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1743. The state of prayer is the best of conditions, for man is then
 associating with God. Prayer verily bestoweth life, particularly when 
offered in private and at times, such as midnight, when freed from daily
 cares.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 172, p. 202)</p>
<p>	1744. The obligatory prayers are binding inasmuch as they are 
conducive to humility and submissiveness, to setting one's face towards 
God and expressing devotion to Him. Through such prayer man holdeth 
communion with God, seeketh to draw near unto Him, converseth with the 
true Beloved of one's heart, and attaineth spiritual stations.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1745. Remembrance of God is like the rain and dew which bestow 
freshness and grace on flowers and hyacinths, revive them and cause them
 to acquire fragrance, redolence and renewed charm. "And thou hast seen 
the earth dried up and barren: but when We send down the rain upon it, 
it stirreth and swelleth, and groweth every kind of luxuriant herb."[1] 
Strive thou, then, to praise and glorify God by night and by day, that 
thou mayest attain infinite freshness and beauty.<br>
 [1 Qur'an 107:5]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1746. It behoveth the servant to pray to and seek assistance from 
God, and to supplicate and implore His aid. Such becometh the rank of 
servitude, and the Lord will decree whatsoever He desireth, in 
accordance with His consummate wisdom.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)<br>

</p><p>	1747. O Lord! In this Most Great Dispensation Thou dost accept 
the intercession of children in behalf of their parents. This is one of 
the special infinite bestowals of this Dispensation. Therefore, O Thou 
kind Lord, accept the request of this Thy servant at the threshold of 
Thy singleness and submerge his father in the ocean of Thy grace, 
because this son hath arisen to render Thee service and is exerting 
effort at all times in the pathway of Thy love. Verily, Thou art the 
Giver, the Forgiver and the Kind!</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1748. Know thou that in every word and movement of the obligatory 
prayer there are allusions, mysteries and a wisdom that man is unable to
 comprehend, and letters and scrolls cannot contain.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	1749. O maid-servant of God! Chant the Words of God and, pondering 
over their meaning, transform them into actions! I ask God to cause thee
 to attain a high station in the Kingdom of Life forever and ever.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha 'Abbas", vol. I (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Society, 1909), p. 85)</p>
<p>	1750. Therefore, know thou that the True One possesseth invisible 
worlds which human meditation is unable to comprehend and the intellect 
of man hath no power to imagine. When thou wilt purify and clarify thy 
spiritual nostrils from every worldly moisture, then thou wilt inhale 
the holy fragrances diffusing from the merciful gardens of these worlds.</p>
<p>	("Baha'i World Faith: Selected Writings of Baha'u'llah and 
'Abdu'l-Baha", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1976), p. 
393)</p>
<p>	1751. When man allows the spirit, through his soul, to enlighten his understanding, then does he contain all Creation...</p>
<p>	But on the other hand, when man does not open his mind and heart to 
the blessing of the spirit, but turns his soul towards the material 
side, towards the bodily part of his nature, then is he fallen from his 
high place and he becomes inferior to the inhabitants of the lower 
animal kingdom....<br>

</p><p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 
1911-1912, 10th ed. (London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1979), pp. 96-97)</p>
<p>	1752. Baha'u'llah says there is a sign (from God) in every 
phenomenon: the sign of the intellect is contemplation and the sign of 
contemplation is silence, because it is impossible for a man to do two 
things at one time -- he cannot both speak and meditate.</p>
<p>	It is an axiomatic fact that while you meditate you are speaking 
with your own spirit. In that state of mind you put certain questions to
 your spirit and the spirit answers: the light breaks forth and the 
reality is revealed. You cannot apply the name 'man' to any being void 
of this faculty of meditation; without it he would be a mere animal, 
lower than the beasts. Through the faculty of meditation man attains to 
eternal life; through it he receives the breath of the Holy Spirit -- 
the bestowal of the Spirit is given in reflection and meditation. The 
spirit of man is itself informed and strengthened during meditation; 
through it affairs of which man knew nothing are unfolded before his 
view. Through it he receives Divine inspiration, through it he receives 
heavenly food. Meditation is the key for opening the doors of mysteries.
 In that state man abstracts himself: in that state man withdraws 
himself from all outside objects; in that subjective mood he is immersed
 in the ocean of spiritual life and can unfold the secrets of 
things-in-themselves. To illustrate this, think of man as endowed with 
two kinds of sight; when the power of insight is being used the outward 
power of vision does not see. This faculty of meditation frees man from 
the animal nature, discerns the reality of things, puts man in touch 
with God. This faculty brings forth from the invisible plane the 
sciences and arts. Through the meditative faculty inventions are made 
possible, colossal undertakings are carried out; through it governments 
can run smoothly. Through this faculty man enters into the very Kingdom 
of God.</p>
<p>	Nevertheless some thoughts are useless to man; they are like waves 
moving in the sea without result. But if the faculty of meditation is 
bathed in the inner light and characterized with divine attributes, the 
results will be confirmed.<br>
 The meditative faculty is akin to the mirror; if you put it before 
earthly objects it will reflect them. Therefore if the spirit of man is 
contemplating earthly subjects he will be informed of these. But if you 
turn the mirror of your spirits heavenwards, the heavenly constellations
 and the rays of the Sun of Reality will be reflected in your hearts, 
and the virtues of the Kingdom will be obtained. Therefore let us keep 
this faculty rightly directed -- turning it to the heavenly Sun and not 
to earthly objects -- so that we may discover the secrets of the 
Kingdom, and comprehend the allegories of the Bible and the mysteries of
 the spirit. May we indeed become mirrors reflecting the heavenly 
realities, and may we become so pure as to reflect the stars of heaven.</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912", pp. 174-76)</p>
<p>	1753. Know thou, verily, it is becoming in a weak one to supplicate 
to the Strong One, and it behooveth a seeker of bounty to beseech the 
Glorious Bountiful One. When one supplicates to his Lord, turns to Him 
and seeks bounty from His Ocean, this supplication brings light to his 
heart, illumination to his sight, life to his soul and exaltation to his
 being.</p>
<p>	During thy supplications to God and thy reciting,'Thy Name is my 
healing," consider how thine heart is cheered, thy soul delighted by the
 spirit of the love of God, and thy mind attracted to the Kingdom of 
God! By these attractions one's ability and capacity increase. When the 
vessel is enlarged the water increases, and when the thirst grows the 
bounty of the cloud becomes agreeable to the taste of man. This is the 
mystery of supplication and the wisdom of stating one's wants.</p>
<p>	("J.E. Esslemont, "Baha'u'llah and the New Era", 5th rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), p. 93)</p>
<p>	1754. We must strive to attain to that condition by being separated 
from all things and from the people of the world and by turning to God 
alone. It will take some effort on the part of man to attain to that 
condition, but he must work for it, strive for it. We can attain to it 
by thinking and caring less for material things and more for the 
spiritual. The further we go from the one, the nearer we are to the 
other. The choice is ours.<br>

</p><p>	Our spiritual perception, our inward sight must be opened, so 
that we can see the signs and traces of God's spirit in everything. 
Everything can reflect to us the light of the Spirit.</p>
<p>	(Report of 'Abdu'l-Baha's words as quoted in J. E. Esslemont, "Baha'u'llah and the New Era", p. 89)</p>
<p>	1755. If one friend feels love for another, he will wish to say so. 
Though he knows that the friend is aware that he loves him, he will 
still wish to say so.... God knows the wishes of all hearts. But the 
impulse to prayer is a natural one, springing from man's love to God.</p>
<p>	Prayer need not be in words, but rather in thought and attitude. But
 if this love and this desire are lacking, it is useless to try to force
 them. Words without love mean nothing. If a person talks to you as an 
unpleasant duty, with no love or pleasure in his meeting with you, do 
you wish to converse with him?</p>
<p>	(Report of 'Abdu'l-Baha's words as quoted in J. E. Esslemont, "Baha'u'llah and the New Era", p. 94)</p>
<p>	1756. In the highest prayer, men pray only for the love of God, not 
because they fear Him or hell, or hope for bounty or heaven.... When a 
man falls in love with a human being, it is impossible for him to keep 
from mentioning the name of his beloved. How much more difficult is it 
to keep from mentioning the Name of God when one has come to love 
Him.... The spiritual man finds no delight in anything save in 
commemoration of God.</p>
<p>	(Report of 'Abdu'l-Baha's words as quoted in J. E. Esslemont, "Baha'u'llah and the New Era", p. 95)</p>
<p>	Extract from a Letter Written by Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	1757. The simplicity characterizing the offering of Baha'i prayers, 
whether obligatory or otherwise, should be maintained. Rigidity and 
rituals should be strictly avoided.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 30
 October 1936 written on his behalf to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	Extracts from Letters Written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	1758. The Guardian wishes you, therefore, to pray, and to supplicate
 the Almighty that He may give you a fuller measure of His grace; that 
through it your spiritual energies may be quickened and that you may 
become more imbued with that spirit which must needs animate, sustain 
and strengthen every sincere and true follower of the Faith.</p>
<p>	(13 March 1934 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1759. Concerning the directions given by Baha'u'llah for the recital
 of certain prayers, Shoghi Effendi wishes me to inform you that these 
regulations -- which by the way are very few and simple -- are of a 
great spiritual help to the individual believer, in that they help him 
to fully concentrate when praying and meditating. Their significance is 
thus purely spiritual.</p>
<p>	(5 November 1934 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1760. In prayer the believers can turn their consciousness toward 
the Shrine of Baha'u'llah, provided that in doing so they have a clear 
and correct understanding of His station as a Manifestation of God.</p>
<p>	(15 November 1935 to two believers)</p>
<p>	1761. With regard to your spiritual experiences, the Guardian has 
been very interested to share them. He would, however, urge you to 
always use and read, during your hours of meditation and prayer, the 
words revealed by Baha'u'llah and the Master.</p>
<p>	(6 December 1935 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1762. The problem with which you are faced is one which concerns and
 seriously puzzles many of our present-day youth. How to attain 
spirituality is, indeed, a question to which every young man and woman 
must sooner or later try to find a satisfactory answer. It is precisely 
because no such satisfactory reply has been given or found, that modern 
youth finds itself bewildered, and is being consequently carried away by
 the materialistic forces that are so powerfully undermining the 
foundation of man's moral and spiritual life.<br>

</p><p>	Indeed, the chief reason for the evils now rampant in society is
 a lack of spirituality. The materialistic civilization of our age has 
so much absorbed the energy and interest of mankind, that people in 
general no longer feel the necessity of raising themselves above the 
forces and conditions of their daily material existence. There is not 
sufficient demand for things that we should call spiritual to 
differentiate them from the needs and requirements of our physical 
existence. The universal crisis affecting mankind is, therefore, 
essentially spiritual in its causes. The spirit of the age, taken on the
 whole, is irreligious. Man's outlook upon life is too crude and 
materialistic to enable him to elevate himself into the higher realms of
 the spirit.</p>
<p>	It is this condition, so sadly morbid, into which society has 
fallen, that religion seeks to improve and transform. For the core of 
religious faith is that mystic feeling that unites man with God. This 
state of spiritual communion can be brought about and maintained by 
means of meditation and prayer. And this is the reason why Baha'u'llah 
has so much stressed the importance of worship. It is not sufficient for
 a believer to merely accept and observe the teachings. He should, in 
addition, cultivate the sense of spirituality, which he can acquire 
chiefly by the means of prayer. The Baha'i Faith, like all other Divine 
religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character. Its chief goal is 
the development of the individual and society, through the acquisition 
of spiritual virtues and powers. It is the soul of man that has first to
 be fed. And this spiritual nourishment prayer can best provide. Laws 
and institutions, as viewed by Baha'u'llah, can become really effective 
only when our inner spiritual life has been perfected and transformed. 
Otherwise religion will degenerate into a mere organization, and become a
 dead thing.</p>
<p>	The believers, particularly the young ones, should therefore fully 
realize the necessity of praying. For prayer is absolutely indispensable
 to their inner spiritual development, and this, already stated, is the 
very foundation and purpose of the Religion of God.</p>
<p>	(8 December 1935 to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 102 (August 1936), p. 3)</p>
<p>	1763. ...the obligatory prayers are by their very nature of greater 
effectiveness and are endowed with a greater power than the 
non-obligatory ones, and as such are essential.<br>

</p><p>	(4 January 1936 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1764. While praying it would be better to turn one's thoughts to the
 Manifestation as He continues, in the other world, to be our means of 
contact with the Almighty. We can, however, pray directly to God 
Himself.</p>
<p>	(27 April 1937 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1765. You have asked whether our prayers go beyond Baha'u'llah: it 
all depends whether we pray to Him directly or through Him to God. We 
may do both, and also can pray directly to God, but our prayers would 
certainly be more effective and illuminating if they are addressed to 
Him through His Manifestation, Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(14 October 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1766. The Guardian wishes me to assure you that he sees no objection
 to the friends coming together for meditation and prayer. Such a 
communion helps in fostering fellowship among the believers, and as such
 is highly commendable.</p>
<p>	(20 November 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1767. [...] was a matter of deepest [...] to the Guardian to hear of
 the news of the formation in Honolulu of a Morning Class of prayer and 
meditation conducted by dear Mrs.... in her home, inasmuch as he feels 
the absolute necessity for the friends to make now a special effort to 
cultivate the devotional side of their Baha'i life in preparation for a 
more intensified and successful service, particularly in the teaching 
field.</p>
<p>	(1 May 1938 to an individual believer and a Local Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1768. Although you seem to feel that your prayers have not so far 
been answered, and do no longer have any hope that your material 
conditions will ameliorate, the Guardian wishes you nevertheless not to 
allow such disappointments to undermine your faith in the power of 
prayer, but rather to continue entreating the Almighty to enable you to 
discover the great wisdom which may be hidden behind all these 
sufferings. For are not our sufferings often blessings in disguise, 
through which God wishes to test the sincerity and depth of our faith, 
and thereby make us firmer in His Cause?<br>

</p><p>	...</p>
<p>	The true worshipper, while praying, should endeavour not so much to 
ask God to fulfil his wishes and desires, but rather to adjust these and
 make them conform to the Divine Will. Only through such an attitude can
 one derive that feeling of inner peace and contentment which the power 
of prayer alone can confer.</p>
<p>	(26 October 1938 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1769. You should rest assured that your strict adherence to the laws
 and observances enjoined by Baha'u'llah is the one power that can 
effectively guide and enable you to overcome the tests and trials of 
your life, and help you to continually grow and develop spiritually.</p>
<p>	The Guardian particularly appreciates the fact that you have been 
faithfully observing Baha'u'llah's injunction regarding the recital of 
the daily obligatory prayers, and have thereby set such a high example 
before your Baha'i fellow-youth. These daily prayers have been endowed 
with a special potency which only those who regularly recite them can 
adequately appreciate. The friends should therefore endeavour to make 
daily use of these prayers, whatever the peculiar circumstances and 
conditions of their life.</p>
<p>	(23 February 1939 to two believers)</p>
<p>	1770. He wishes again to assure you he will pray for your spiritual 
advancement in the Holy Shrines. The power of God can entirely transmute
 our characters and make of us beings entirely unlike our previous 
selves. Through prayer and supplication, obedience to the divine laws 
Baha'u'llah has revealed, and ever-increasing service to His Faith, we 
can change ourselves.</p>
<p>	(22 November 1941 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1771. There are no set forms of meditation prescribed in the 
teachings, no plan, as such, for inner development. The friends are 
urged -- nay enjoined -- to pray, and they also should meditate, but the
 manner of doing the latter is left entirely to the individual.<br>
 The inspiration received through meditation is of a nature that one 
cannot measure or determine. God can inspire into our minds things that 
we had no previous knowledge of, if He desires to do so.</p>
<p>	(25 January 1943 to the believers)</p>
<p>	1772. Prayer and meditation are very important factors in deepening 
the spiritual life of the individual, but with them must go also action 
and example, as these are the tangible results of the former. Both are 
essential.</p>
<p>	(15 May 1944 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1773. The believers, as we all know, should endeavour to set such an
 example in their personal lives and conduct that others will feel 
impelled to embrace a Faith which reforms human character. However, 
unfortunately, not everyone achieves easily and rapidly the victory over
 self. What every believer, new or old, should realize is that the Cause
 has the spiritual power to re-create us if we make the effort to let 
that power influence us, and the greatest help in this respect is 
prayer. We must supplicate Baha'u'llah to assist us to overcome the 
failings in our own characters, and also exert our own will-power in 
mastering ourselves.</p>
<p>	(27 January 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1774. Through meditation the doors of deeper knowledge and 
inspiration may be opened. Naturally, if one meditates as a Baha'i he is
 connected with the Source; if a man believing in God meditates he is 
tuning in to the power and mercy of God; but we cannot say that any 
inspiration which a person, not knowing Baha'u'llah, or not believing in
 God, receives is merely from his own ego. Meditation is very important,
 and the Guardian sees no reason why the friends should not be taught to
 meditate, but they should guard against superstitious or foolish ideas 
creeping into it.</p>
<p>	(19 November 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1775. He feels more emphasis should be laid on the importance and 
power of prayer, including the use of The Greatest Name, but not 
over-emphasizing it. It is the spirit behind the words which is really 
important.</p>
<p>	(16 March 1946 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1776. In regard to your question: we must not be rigid about 
praying; there is not a set of rules governing it; the main thing is we 
must start out with the right concept of God, the Manifestation, the 
Master, the Guardian -- we can turn, in thought, to any one of them when
 we pray. For instance you can ask Baha'u'llah for something, or, 
thinking of Him, ask God for it. The same is true of the Master or the 
Guardian. You can turn in thought to either of them and then ask their 
intercession, or pray direct to God. As long as you don't confuse their 
stations, and make them all equal, it does not matter much how you 
orient your thoughts.</p>
<p>	(24 July 1946 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1777. He is delighted to hear you are now fully recovered and again 
active in your important work for the Cause. However, you should not 
neglect your health, but consider it the means which enables you to 
serve. It -- the body -- is like a horse which carries the personality 
and spirit, and as such should be well cared for so it can do its work! 
You should certainly safeguard your nerves, and force yourself to take 
time, and not only for prayer and meditation, but for real rest and 
relaxation. We don't have to pray and meditate for hours in order to be 
spiritual.</p>
<p>	(23 November 1947 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1778. I might add that he does not believe any radiations of thought
 or healing, from any group, are going to bring peace. Prayer, no doubt,
 will help the world, but what it needs is to accept Baha'u'llah's 
system so as to build up the World Order on a new foundation, a divine 
foundation!</p>
<p>	(8 June 1948 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1779. If you find you need to visualize someone when you pray, think
 of the Master. Through Him you can address Baha'u'llah. Gradually try 
to think of the qualities of the Manifestation, and in that way a mental
 form will fade out, for after all the body is not the thing, His Spirit
 is there and is the essential, everlasting element.</p>
<p>	(31 January 1949 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1780. He would advise you to only use the short midday Obligatory 
Prayer. This has no genuflections and only requires that when saying it 
the believer turn his face towards 'Akka where Baha'u'llah is buried. 
This is<br>
 a physical symbol of an inner reality, just as the plant stretches out 
to the sunlight -- from which it receives life and growth -- so we turn 
our hearts to the Manifestation of God, Baha'u'llah, when we pray; and 
we turn our faces, during this short prayer, to where His dust lies on 
this earth as a symbol of the inner act.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	Baha'u'llah has reduced all ritual and form to an absolute minimum 
in His Faith. The few forms that there are -- like those associated with
 the two longer obligatory daily prayers -- are only symbols of the 
inner attitude. There is a wisdom in them, and a great blessing, but we 
cannot force ourselves to understand or feel these things, that is why 
He gave us also the very short and simple prayer, for those who did not 
feel the desire to perform the acts associated with the other two.</p>
<p>	(24 June 1949 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1781. He suggests that you daily pray to Baha'u'llah to let you meet
 a soul receptive to His Message. The power of prayer is very great, and
 attracts the Divine confirmations. He, also, will pray for your 
teaching work there.</p>
<p>	(30 September 1951 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1782. He thinks it would be wiser for the Baha'is to use the 
Meditations given by Baha'u'llah, and not any set form of meditation 
recommended by someone else; but the believers must be left free in 
these details and allowed to have personal latitude in finding their own
 level of communion with God.</p>

</p><p>	Extracts from the Writings of Baha'u'llah</p>
<p>	1783. It is forbidden for an intelligent person to drink that which 
depriveth him of his intelligence; it behoveth him to engage in that 
which is worthy of man, not in the act of every heedless doubter.</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Aqdas" - provisional translation from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	1784. 0 Son of Dust!</p>
<p>	Turn not away thine eyes from the matchless wine of the immortal 
Beloved, and open them not to foul and mortal dregs. Take from the hands
 of the divine Cupbearer the chalice of immortal life, that all wisdom 
may be thine, and that thou mayest hearken unto the mystic voice calling
 from the realm of the invisible. Cry aloud, ye that are of low aim! 
Wherefore have ye turned away from My holy and immortal wine unto 
evanescent water?</p>
<p>	("The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah, Persian no. 62, rev. ed. Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1985), pp. 43-44)</p>
<p>	1785. Fear ye God, O people of the earth, and think not that the 
wine We have mentioned in Our Tablet is the wine which men drink, and 
which causeth their intelligence to pass away, their human nature to be 
perverted, their light to be changed, and their purity to be soiled. Our
 intention is indeed that wine which intensifieth man's love for God, 
for His Chosen Ones and for His loved ones, and igniteth in the hearts 
the fire of God and love for Him, and glorification and praise of Him. 
So potent is this wine that a drop thereof will attract him who drinketh
 it to the court of His sanctity and nearness, and will enable him to 
attain the presence of God, the King, the Glorious, the Most Beauteous. 
It is a wine that blotteth out from the hearts of the true lovers all 
suggestions of limitation, establisheth the truth of the signs of His 
oneness and divine unity, and leadeth them to the Tabernacle of the 
Well-Beloved, in the presence of God, the Sovereign Lord, the 
Self-Subsisting, the All-Forgiving, the All-Generous. We meant by this 
Wine, the River of God, and His favour, the fountain of His living 
waters, and the Mystic Wine and its divine grace, even as it was 
revealed in the Qur'an, if ye are of those who understand. He said, and 
how true is His utterance: "A wine<br>
 delectable to those who drink it."[1] And He had no purpose in this but
 the wine We have mentioned to you, O people of certitude!<br>
 [1 Qur'an 47:15.] </p>
<p>	Beware lest ye exchange the Wine of God for your own wine, for it 
will stupefy your minds, and turn your faces away from the Countenance 
of God, the All-Glorious, the Peerless, the Inaccessible. Approach it 
not, for it hath been forbidden unto you by the behest of God, the 
Exalted, the Almighty.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	1786. The Mystic Wine of the one true God hath a different 
intoxication and imparteth another exhilaration. The one diminisheth the
 intelligence of man, the other increaseth it. The one leadeth to 
perdition, the other bestoweth life.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1787. Drink ye, O handmaidens of God, the Mystic Wine from the cup 
of My words. Cast away, then, from you that which your minds abhor, for 
it hath been forbidden unto you in His Tablets and His Scriptures. 
Beware lest ye barter away the River that is life indeed for that which 
the souls of the pure-hearted detest. Become ye intoxicated with the 
wine of the love of God, and not with that which deadeneth your minds, O
 ye that adore Him! Verily, it hath been forbidden unto every believer, 
whether man or woman. Thus hath the sun of My commandment shone forth 
above the horizon of My utterance, that the handmaidens who believe in 
Me may be illumined.</p>
<p>	(Quoted in "The Advent of Divine Justice" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 33)</p>
<p>	Extracts from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha</p>
<p>	1788. The drinking of wine is, according to the text of the Most 
Holy Book, forbidden; for it is the cause of chronic diseases, weakeneth
 the nerves, and consumeth the mind.</p>
<p>	(Quoted in "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 33)</p>
<p>	1789. Regarding the use of liquor: According to the text of the Book
 of Aqdas, both light and strong drinks are prohibited. The reason for 
this<br>
 prohibition is that alcohol leadeth the mind astray and causeth the 
weakening of the body. If alcohol were beneficial, it would have been 
brought into the world by the divine creation and not by the effort of 
man. Whatever is beneficial for man existeth in creation. Now it hath 
been proved and is established medically and scientifically that liquor 
is harmful.</p>
<p>	As to the meaning of that which is written in the Tablets:</p>
<p>	"I have chosen for thee whatsoever is in the heaven and the earth", 
this signifieth those things which are in accordance with the divine 
purpose and not the things which are harmful. For instance, one of the 
existing things is poison. Can we say that poison must be used as it 
hath been created by God? Nevertheless, intoxicating liquor, if 
prescribed by a physician for the patient and if its use is absolutely 
necessary, then it is permissible.</p>
<p>	In brief, I hope that thou mayest become inebriated with the wine of
 the love of God, find eternal bliss and receive inexhaustible joy and 
happiness. All wine hath depression as an after-effect, except the wine 
of the Love of God.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1790. Intellect and the faculty of comprehension are God's gifts 
whereby man is distinguished from other animals. Will a wise man want to
 lose this Light in the darkness of intoxication? No, by God! This will 
not satisfy him! He will, rather, do that which will develop his powers 
of intelligence and understanding, and not increase his negligence, 
heedlessness and decline. This is an explicit text in the perspicuous 
Book, wherein God hath set forth every goodly virtue, and exposed every 
reprehensible act.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	Extracts from Letters Written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	1791. With regard to your first question on alcohol and drinking, 
Baha'u'llah, fully aware of the great misery that it brings about, 
prohibits it as He expressly states that everything that takes away the 
mind, or in other words makes one drunk, is forbidden....</p>
<p>	(15 February 1926 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1792. The wine mentioned in the Tablets has undoubtedly a spiritual 
meaning for in the "Book of Aqdas" we are definitely forbidden to take<br>
 not only wine, but everything that deranges the mind. In poetry as a 
whole wine is taken to have a different connotation than the ordinary 
intoxicating liquid. We see it thus used by the Persian poets such as 
Saadi and Umar Khayyam and Hafiz to mean that element which nears man to
 his divine beloved, which makes him forget his material self so as 
better to seek his spiritual desires. It is very necessary to tell the 
children what this wine means so that they may not confuse it with the 
ordinary wine.</p>
<p>	(4 November 1926 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1793. With regard to the question you have raised in connection with
 the sale of alcoholic liquors by the friends: he wishes me to inform 
you that dealings with such liquors, in any form, are highly discouraged
 in the Cause. The believers should, therefore, consider it their 
spiritual obligation to refrain from undertaking any business enterprise
 that would involve them in the traffic of alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>	(6 November 1935 to a Local Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1794. Concerning the third question (sale of alcoholic drinks at 
Baha'i-owned premises and restaurants), the beloved Guardian has asked 
me to point out that this practice is highly improper and reprehensible 
and would be tantamount to encouraging acts that are forbidden in the 
Faith. It is indeed the conscientious duty of every true Baha'i to 
abandon such practices. However, should a Baha'i owner rent his property
 without himself taking any part whatever in the business, or giving aid
 to the tenant, then he would incur no responsibility. Nevertheless, the
 landlord should resort to every possible means to rid his premises of 
the defilement of this degrading business; how far more injurious if he 
himself were engaged in such repugnant affairs.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 November 1935 to a National Spiritual Assembly translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1795. Concerning your question with regard to the use of alcohol for
 rubbing: the believers can make any use of alcohol for any such 
treatments, provided they do not drink it, unless, of course, they are 
compelled to do so, under the advice of a competent and conscientious 
physician, who may have to prescribe it for the cure of some special 
ailment.<br>

</p><p>	(25 July 1938 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1796. With reference to your question whether those foods which have
 been favoured with alcoholic liquors such as brandy, rum, etc. should 
be classified under the same category as the intoxicating drinks, and 
consequently be avoided by the believers, the Guardian wishes all the 
friends to know that such foods, or beverages, are strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>	(9 January 1939 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1797. The reason Baha'u'llah forbade drinking alcoholic beverages is
 because it is bad for the health, more particularly for the mind. Of 
course you can point this out to Mr.... and Mr.... and you can also pray
 that they will themselves feel the urge to give it up; but these are 
habits each individual should seek to surmount for his own good.</p>
<p>	(17 February 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1798. The degree to which the use of alcohol has spread in the world
 today is truly alarming; it is a great evil, and we Baha'is can see 
clearly why Baha'u'llah prohibits its being taken at all.</p>
<p>	(23 February 1946 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1799. Any work that helps people to get over the terrible habit of 
drinking is excellent, and should be looked upon with sympathy and 
approval by the Baha'is. He thanks you for the Alcoholics Anonymous 
pamphlet you enclosed and was pleased to see it.</p>
<p>	(26 July 1946 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1800. He feels you should, in teaching, certainly not start with 
such a difficult point as abstinence from wine; but when the person 
wishes to join the Faith he must be told....</p>
<p>	(7 April 1947 to two believers)</p>
<p>	1801. Of course no Baha'i should drink, and if he persists in it and
 refuses to make an effort to overcome it, the Assembly must take 
action. But in these newly established centres one must be very patient 
lest the whole group go to pieces because of too strong or sudden 
action.</p>
<p>	(19 July 1947 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1802. When we realize that Baha'u'llah says ... that drinking 
destroys the mind, and not to so much as approach it, we see how clear 
are our teachings on these subjects.</p>
<p>	(30 September 1949 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1803. However, drinking is prohibited in the Book of Laws and, 
although the Guardian has not made this an immediate issue to be 
considered when people apply for membership, all Baha'is should not 
drink, and if they persist the Assembly should take action....</p>
<p>	(7 August 1950 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1804. From your letter it would be assumed that some of your 
believers feel that the law of the "Aqdas" regarding the use of 
intoxicating liquors is a personal one, and may be followed or not 
followed, as the individual desires. This is not correct. The law of the
 "Aqdas" regarding not using intoxicating liquors is binding on all 
Baha'is. The Guardian does feel, however, that with new Baha'is, coming 
into the Faith, leniency should be exercised; but he feels that when a 
person is a Baha'i for some time, his Baha'i association and the spirit 
of the Teachings which he studies and endeavours to exemplify will bring
 about a change in the character, and the individual will stop drinking.
 However, old and firm Baha'is must apply the law of the non-use of 
alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>	(19 August 1952 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1805. The Assemblies must be wise and gentle in dealing with such 
cases, but at the same time must not tolerate a prolonged and flagrant 
disregard of the Baha'i Teachings as regards alcohol.</p>
<p>	(26 June 1956 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1806. As regards the questions you asked: Under no circumstances 
should Baha'is drink. It is so unambiguously forbidden in the Tablets of
 Baha'u'llah that there is no excuse for them even touching it in the 
form of a toast, or in a burning plum pudding; in fact, in any way.</p>
<p>	There is no reason why Baha'is may not serve some alcoholic 
refreshment to their guests, if they feel sincerely that this will 
further their teaching work. If they can obtain their objectives without
 doing so, it<br>
 would be better; but we don't want to give people the impression that we are peculiar in every way.</p>
<p>	(3 March 1957 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Extracts from Letters written by the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	1807. As to those believers who continue to drink, they should be 
lovingly exhorted, then firmly warned and eventually deprived of their 
voting rights. The number of times a person is exhorted and warned is a 
matter left to the discretion of each Local Spiritual Assembly, in 
consultation with the National Spiritual Assembly. The policy you adopt 
should not be one of removing the administrative rights of the believers
 in a bureaucratic and automatic way, as this would be unwise and 
unjust. Your Assembly as well as all Local Spiritual Assemblies should 
courageously and continuously remind the friends of their obligation in 
this respect, handle firmly all flagrant cases, and use such cases, in a
 way that by force of example, they exert their influence upon the other
 believers. It must be made clear to the Local Assemblies that they 
should be willing to cooperate with the believers affected by such 
drinking habits, when any such believer promises gradually and 
systematically to reduce his drinking with the objective in mind of 
entirely abandoning this habit.</p>
<p>	We feel sure that your National Assembly will, with wisdom, loving 
kindness and determination succeed in uprooting this evil from your 
ranks and bring about the spiritual upliftment and advancement of the 
believers under your area of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>	(12 November 1965 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1808. There are certain scientific purposes for which alcohol may be
 used, but we believe that a Baha'i should not willingly submit himself 
to scientific experiments requiring him to drink alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>	(13 June 1966 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1809. Alcohol should not be served at any reception, either at home 
or in a public place, at which you are host... We believe you should not
 use the term "cocktail party". The designation of either "tea" or 
"reception" would be preferable. (31 December 1967 to an individual 
believer)<br>
 1810. ...it is clear that on all occasions officially sponsored by 
Baha'i Institutions or where the host is acting as a representative of 
the Cause alcohol should not be served. In private homes or in the 
course of business or professional activity it is left to the conscience
 of Baha'is themselves whether they serve alcoholic drinks to 
non-Baha'is but the obligation is very strong to observe the prohibition
 enjoined by Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(8 February 1968 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1811. ...no Baha'i institution should serve alcoholic drinks under 
any circumstances, and we also feel that it would be inappropriate for a
 Baha'i to serve such beverages at a function given by him.</p>
<p>	(19 December 1968 to two believers)</p>
<p>	1812. As to question number 6 concerning the sale of alcohol by a 
believer, as you state, obviously he should cease to deal in the sale of
 alcohol in his shop." However, as he is a new believer and was engaged 
in this business before becoming a Baha'i, he should be given a 
reasonable opportunity to find another means whereby he can earn a 
living and should be given every assistance by the National Spiritual 
Assembly to do so. He should be treated with patience and understanding,
 especially if he is making efforts to dispose of this business and to 
seek other employment. However, if after a reasonable time has elapsed 
and no effort has been made to comply with the Baha'i law, then, as a 
last resort, the Assembly would have no alternative but to suspend his 
administrative rights.</p>
<p>	(13 March 1974 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1813. We have found no texts prohibiting the friends from using 
favoured extracts in their food. This may be a matter for later 
legislation by the Universal House of Justice but for the time being the
 friends should be left free to do as they choose. The same principle 
applies to those who are employed in factories manufacturing such 
extracts.</p>
<p>	(7 April 1974 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1814. Flagrant violation by members of the National Spiritual 
Assembly of the Baha'i requirement to abstain from intoxicating drinks 
will certainly have a debilitating effect on the national community, and
 these violations<br>
 should be forcefully resisted through frank consultation of the matter 
by the Counsellors with the National Spiritual Assembly, so that in 
addition to admonishments, stern warnings be given to the member or 
members concerned, and sanctions imposed, if disregard of Baha'i laws is
 continued.</p>
<p>	(From a memorandum dated 10 February 1975 to the International Teaching Centre)</p>
<p>	1815. Such employments [Baha'is who are in the employment of 
non-Baha'is and whose employment involves the serving or selling of 
alcoholic beverages] cover a very wide range of degree of involvement, 
therefore it is left to the individual to decide whether or not he feels
 his employment violates the spirit of the Baha'i law. In cases of doubt
 he can, of course, consult his Spiritual Assembly for advice.</p>
<p>	We have found no explicit text or instruction of the beloved 
Guardian on such a situation [the sale of alcoholic beverages by a 
business in which a Baha'i is a partner with non-Baha'is] and feel that 
it is one in which no hard and fast rules should be drawn at the present
 time.... We feel that this is a matter which needs to be decided in 
each case in the light of the spirit of the teachings and the 
circumstances of the case, and unless the situation is one which is 
endangering the good name of the Faith or is obviously a ruse on the 
part of a believer to evade the Baha'i law, it should be left to the 
conscience of the believer concerned who should, of course, be informed 
of the Baha'i teachings concerning alcohol and should make every effort 
to dissociate himself from such an activity.</p>
<p>	The above [paragraph] concerns Baha'is who are already in 
partnerships dealing in such matters. It is, however, obvious that a 
Baha'i who is not in such a situation should not enter into it.</p>
<p>	(From a memorandum dated 15 January 1976 to the International 
Teaching Centre) Extract from Letter written on behalf of The Universal 
House of Justice)</p>
<p>	1816. The future christening of the ... child should present no 
problem, for the Baha'i parent should have no objection to the baptism 
of his child if the Catholic mother wishes it. Similarly, the use of 
champagne upon that<br>
 occasion is a matter which she is free to undertake, but of course the Baha'is would not partake of alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>	(7 December 1977 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1817. The House of Justice ... points out that, as far as 
advertising is concerned, the Baha'i must use wisdom in deciding what is
 allowable and what is not. For example, while the issuing of an 
advertisement specifically for wines would seem to be inadmissible, 
there would be no objection to a Baha'i advertising agent's issuing an 
advertisement listing the prices of goods on sale at a supermarket even 
if wines and spirits are included on it. It is, thus, a matter of 
emphasis and wisdom. Primarily the House of Justice wishes the decision 
in such matters to be left to the judgement of the individual concerned,
 but where there is any doubt, or where the National Spiritual Assembly 
feels that the good name of the Faith is being injured, the Assembly 
should, of course, be consulted and could decide in specific instances.</p>
<p>	In view of the requirements of his conscience in light of Baha'i 
law, a Baha'i advertising agent might be well advised to include a 
clause in any contract he signs in which difficulties of this nature 
might arise, protecting his right to demur.</p>
<p>	(20 December 1977 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1818. Concerning the questions you raise about [doing] illustrations
 for the wine company manual, the House of Justice feels this is for you
 to decide...</p>
<p>	(18 January 1978 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1819. As to your questions concerning the serving of alcohol by 
Baha'is to their non-Baha'i guests, the House of Justice feels that, 
because of the many differing circumstances relating to this subject, it
 does not wish to make any definite statements at the present time. It 
is obvious that Baha'is themselves must not drink alcohol and the rest, 
for the time being, must be left to their own consciences....</p>
<p>	Concerning your enquiry about a Baha'i keeping brandy in his home 
for emergency use on the advice of a doctor, the House of Justice feels 
there is no objection to this.</p>
<p>	(2 March 1978 to a National Spiritual Assembly)<br>

</p><p>	1820. In the case of a believer who continues to take alcoholic 
drinks the Assembly should decide whether the offence is flagrant, and, 
if it is, should try to help him to understand the importance of obeying
 the Baha'i law. If he does not respond he must be repeatedly warned 
and, if this is unsuccessful, he is subject to loss of his voting 
rights. In the case of an alcoholic who is trying to overcome his 
weakness the Assembly must show especial patience, and may have to 
suggest professional counselling and assistance. If the offence is not 
flagrant, the Assembly need take no action at all.</p>

<p>	I. The Importance of Guiding "Distinguished Souls to the Cause"</p>
<p>	From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha</p>
<p>	1821. I hope that thou wilt ... endeavour to teach some high-ranking
 and influential persons, for the hearts of the people have become 
attracted to the Cause of God and their minds bewildered and enthralled 
by its awesome grandeur. Those who occupy high positions, too, have 
become profoundly receptive to its message. The loved ones of God should
 therefore make a determined effort and guide these distinguished souls 
to the Cause.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1822. You should always seek to guide prominent people inasmuch as 
once such a person is regenerated he is likely to bring about the 
quickening of a thousand souls. Thus the spirit of truth would flow 
forth unimpeded into the veins and arteries of a multitude.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1823. Wherefore thou shouldst seek to impart the Message to 
influential person and become a cause of guidance to the learned and 
distinguished, that perchance there may be raised up in Iran wise, 
sagacious souls who shall be solicitous for both the good of the state 
and the welfare of the populace, who shall labour diligently night and 
day to the end that their great nation may retrieve its former glory and
 restore for all the world to see the splendour of the Kiyaniyan kings, 
and that its illustrious people may shine out amongst mankind with an 
extraordinary brilliance and attain to lasting happiness and 
contentment.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to a group of believers - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1824. You should give serious concern to the matter of teaching, and
 think of ways of imparting the Message to prominent people, for once 
such person have given their allegiance to the Faith they will cause the
 people to be led, troop after troop, to the wellspring of unfailing 
guidance.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	From letters written by or on behalf of Shoghi Effendi[1]<br>
 [1 To individual believers unless otherwise noted.]</p>
<p>	1825. It is incumbent upon the Baha'is to seize the opportunities of
 the present hour and, with wisdom, firm resolve and cheerfulness, 
impress the verities of their Faith upon the attention of every 
reasonable-minded person in whom they find a willingness to listen, 
explaining to them its noble principles, its universal teachings, its 
basic tenets, and the fundamental laws of the new era inaugurated by 
Baha'u'llah. In like manner, they must clearly and convincingly 
demonstrate to their fellow-citizens, whether high or low, the necessity
 of accepting and recognizing the resplendent teachings of the Universal
 Manifestation of God; must show to the leaders of their country that 
the unity, the strength and spiritual vitality of the Baha'i community 
are palpable and concrete realities; must eliminate and nullify the 
effects of prejudices, superstitions, misunderstandings and all fanciful
 and erroneous conceptions on the hearts of the pure and righteous 
people; and must attract to the community of the Greatest Name, through 
whatever channels and by whatever means, persons of capacity, experience
 and devotion who,joining the ranks of the believers, severing 
themselves from every extraneous attachment, identifying themselves 
whole-heartedly with the organized community of the Baha'is in the area,
 will labour heart and soul to consolidate the foundations of Baha'i 
belief and proclaim the tidings of the Promised Day.</p>
<p>	With regard to the Baha'i literacy classes, their continuation at 
the present time is a service beyond measure both profitable and 
desirable. Similarly, the establishment of contact and maintenance of 
friendly relations with government officials and other nationally 
distinguished figures is a matter that should be regarded by the friends
 as a binding obligation.</p>
<p>	(2 November 1928 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Iran Central Spiritual Assembly - translated from the Persian).</p>
<p>	1826. Shoghi Effendi was delighted to hear of your conversation with
 Sir.... How much he hopes to have such scholars obtain a true 
understanding of the spirit and teaching of the Cause and arise to 
dissipate that veil of misconceptions that is prejudicing the mind of 
the scholars in the western world. The Cause is in great need for such 
competent and spiritually<br>
 minded men who after a thorough study of the Movement would share with the world the fruit of their labours.</p>
<p>	(11 March 19297 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>	1827. ...he feels that the great point is to confirm people of true 
capacity and ability -- from whatever social stratum they may be -- 
because the Cause needs now, and will ever-increasingly need, souls of 
great ability who can bring it before the public at large, administer 
its ever-growing affairs, and contribute to its advancement in every 
field.</p>
<p>	(30 October 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>	1828. The more people of capacity who accept the Faith, the higher will become the standard of the entire group.</p>
<p>	(17 June 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>1829. The Cause of God has room for all. It would, indeed, not<br>
be the Cause of God if it did not take in and welcome everyone -- poor and<br>
rich, educated and ignorant, the unknown, and the<br>
prominent -- God surely wants them all, as He created them all.<br>
(10 December 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi) </p>
<p>	1830. He was very pleased to learn ... that your reception was such a
 success, and that you now feel that people in high places are beginning
 to waken from their sleep and see the Light of Baha'u'llah. The time 
must come when they do; it just seems a question of how soon.</p>
<p>	A lot, also, depends on our having inside the Faith enough people of
 real capacity to form a nucleus that will attract to it similar 
souls....</p>
<p>	(22 November 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>	1831. He hopes that your contract with Chief ... will prove 
fruitful, and that his heart may open to the Message you have carried 
him. It would be a great asset to the Faith if a prominent Chief of some
 tribe should accept it and arise to serve it.</p>
<p>	(31 May 1952 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)<br>

</p><p>	From letters written by the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	1832. ...one of the most important duties of each National Spiritual
 Assembly is to acquaint leaders of thought and prominent men and women 
in its country with the fundamental aims, the history and the present 
status and achievements of the Cause. Such an activity must be carried 
out with the utmost wisdom, discretion and dignity.</p>
<p>	(2 July 1967 to all National Spiritual Assemblies, published in 
"Wellspring of Guidance: Messages 1963-1968", 1st rev. ed. (Wilmette: 
Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1976), p. 117)</p>
<p>	1833. The paramount goal of the teaching work at the present time is
 to carry the message of Baha'u'llah to every stratum of human society 
and every walk of life. An eager response to the teachings will often be
 found in the most unexpected quarters, and any such response should be 
quickly followed up, for success in a fertile area awakens a response in
 those who were at first uninterested.</p>
<p>	The same presentation of the teachings will not appeal to everybody;
 the method of expression and the approach must be varied in accordance 
with the outlook and interests of the hearer. An approach which is 
designed to appeal to everybody will usually result in attracting the 
middle section, leaving both extremes untouched. No effort must be 
spared to ensure that the healing Word of God reaches the rich and the 
poor, the learned and the illiterate, the old and the young, the devout 
and the atheist, and the dweller in the remote hills and islands, the 
inhabitant of the teeming cities, the suburban businessman, the labourer
 in the slums, the nomadic tribesman, the farmer, the university 
student; all must be brought consciously with the teaching plans of the 
Baha'i Community.</p>
<p>	(31 October 1967 to all National Spiritual Assemblies, published in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages 1963-1968", p. 124)</p>
<p>	1834. There have been notable advances in the process of gaining 
wider recognition for the Cause of God and in fostering cordial 
relations with civil authorities, a matter of vital importance in these 
days when there is a growth of opposition to the Faith from those who, 
misconstruing its true nature and aims, take alarm at its progress.</p>
<p>	(Ridvan 1978 to the International Baha'i Convention)<br>

</p><p>	1835. Yet these disasters[1] have called forth fresh energies in
 the hearts of the friends, have fed the deep roots of the Cause and 
given rise to a great harvest of signal victories. Chief among these are
 the successful conclusion of the Five Year Plan; the launching of the 
Seven Year Plan, now in the final year of its second phase; and 
unprecedented proclamation of the Faith to Heads of States, parliaments 
and parliamentarians, government ministers and officials, leaders of 
thought and people prominent in the professions, resulting in a change 
of attitude on the part of the mass media, which now increasingly 
approach us for information about the Cause....<br>
 [1 The "loss of six Hands of the Cause" and the waves of bitter persecution" directed against the Baha'i community in Iran.]</p>
<p>	The growing maturity of a world-wide religious community which all 
these processes indicate is further evidenced in the reaching out, by a 
number of national communities, to the social and economic life of their
 countries, exemplified by the founding of tutorial schools, the 
inception of radio stations, the pursuit of rural development programmes
 and the operation of medical and agricultural schemes. To these early 
beginnings must be added the undoubted skills acquired, as a result of 
the Iranian crisis, in dealing with international organizations, 
national governments and the mass media -- the very elements of society 
with which it must increasingly collaborate toward the realization of 
peace on earth.</p>
<p>	(Ridvan 1983 to the Baha'is of the World)</p>
<p>	1836. The entrance of the Cause onto the world scene is apparent 
from a number of public statements in which we have been characterized 
as "model citizens", "gentle"' "law-abiding", "not guilty of any 
political offence or crime"; all excellent but utterly inadequate 
insofar as the reality of the Faith and its aims and purposes are 
concerned. Nevertheless people are willing to hear about the Faith, and 
the opportunity must be seized. Persistently greater and greater efforts
 must be made to acquaint the leaders of the world, in all departments 
of life, with the true nature of Baha'u'llah's revelation as the sole 
hope for the pacification and unification of the world. Simultaneous 
with such a programme must be unabated, vigorous pursuit of the teaching
 work, so that we may be seen to be a growing community, while universal
 observance by the friends of the Baha'i laws of personal living will 
assert the fullness of, and arouse a<br>
 desire to share in, the Baha'i way of life. By all these means the 
public image of the Faith will become, gradually but constantly, nearer 
to its true character....</p>
<p>	There can be no doubt that the progress of the Cause from this time 
onward will be characterized by an ever increasing relationship to the 
agencies, activities, institutions and leading individuals of the 
non-Baha'i world. We shall acquire greater stature at the United 
Nations, become better known in the deliberations of governments, a 
familiar figure to the media, a subject of interest to academics, and 
inevitably the envy of failing establishments. Our preparation for the 
response to this situation must be a continual deepening of our faith, 
an unwavering adherence to its principles of abstention from partisan 
politics and freedom from prejudices, and above all an increasing 
understanding of its fundamental verities and relevance to the modern 
world.</p>
<p>	(Ridvan 1984 to the Baha'is of the World)<br>

</p><p>	II. Some Guidelines for Reaching Prominent People</p>
<p>	2.1 "Establish Ties of Friendship"</p>
<p>	From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha</p>
<p>	1837. Some of the loved ones should establish ties of friendship 
with the notables of the region and manifest towards them the most 
affectionate regard. In this manner these men may become acquainted with
 the Baha'i way of life, learn of the teachings of the Merciful One, and
 be informed of the pervasive influence of the Word of God in every 
quarter of the globe. If but one of these souls were attracted to the 
Cause, others would quickly be similarly moved, since the people tend to
 follow in the footsteps of their leaders.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1838. Ye should strive to widen the circle of those with whom ye 
enjoy friendly relations, and to establish the closest contact with 
those benevolent souls whose only thought is to do good, who are 
labouring in the cause of universal peace, and who cherish no desire but
 to witness the unification of the world of humanity. Ye should seek out
 the company of such people as these, that ye may imbue them with an 
awareness of the heavenly Kingdom, for albeit their motives are of the 
finest, yet they do not realize that all the powers of the earth are 
impotent either to establish universal peace or to promote the oneness 
of the human world. Nothing short of the power of the Word of God and 
the breaths of the Holy Spirit can ever succeed.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to a Spiritual Assembly - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>   From letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi[1]<br>
 [1 To individual believers unless otherwise noted]</p>
<p>	1839. Our Guardian hopes and prays that you will be guided in your 
endeavour to bring together at the banquet various prominent citizens of
 various races and religions with the sole purpose of winning then 
ultimately to the recognition of God's sacred Faith. You must stress the
 universal aspect of the Cause and show utmost kindness and love to them
 all as a preparation to their eventual acceptance of the entire truth. </p>
<p>	(8 October 1927)<br>

</p><p>	1840. Some of the items were of great interest to him, 
especially that part which told of the contacts you have made with 
distinguished men and invited them to speak at your meetings. This is an
 effective way to make these take an active part in promoting the Faith 
and increasing their knowledge of its spirit and basic teachings.</p>
<p>	Shoghi Effendi hopes that some day they will come forward as devoted
 servants and consecrate their lives to it....there are distinguished 
men who are friends and admirers of the Cause, but due to their natural 
conservative and cautious attitude towards anything new, prefer to be 
onlookers than passionate advocates. They cannot however keep on that 
dispassionate state of mind, some day they will feel unwittingly drawn 
into it....</p>
<p>	He is sending you two copies of "The Dawn-Breakers" to be presented 
to two distinguished friends of the Cause. One of these he wants to be 
presented to sir ... in acknowledgement of the services he has rendered 
to us.... This is one form of keeping up the interest of such 
distinguished men in the progress of the Faith. Maybe one day they will 
take an active part.</p>
<p>	(6 May 1932)</p>
<p>	1841. He was also very pleased to see that the Cause is receiving 
newspaper publicity there, and you are winning the sympathetic interest 
of editors and people of importance. The Faith needs friends as well as 
adherents, and you should always endeavour to attract the hearts of 
enlightened leaders to its teachings.</p>
<p>	(5 October 1945 to a Local Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1842. There are, as you truly say, many important admirers of the 
Faith at present in the U.S.A. -- and, indeed, in other countries, but 
it is unlikely such people will actually embrace the Cause; they are not
 ready to identify themselves with an as yet struggling Movement with a 
relatively small following; moreover, many such people would be 
unwilling to make the effort required to live up to Baha'i standards of 
conduct! Still, it is excellent that we are winning more friends and 
admirers; this in itself helps the Cause and adds to its prestige, and 
gradually some of these people may actually make the sacrifice of 
entering its service.</p>
<p>	(25 February 1947)<br>

</p><p>	1843. He feels that the believers should make every effort, in 
the proper way and with discretion, to keep in contact with important 
people.... We should make every effort to ensure that leaders of thought
 in public life are not merely familiar with the name Baha'i, but if 
possible stand in a cordial relationship to some members of our 
Community, if not to the body of the Faith.</p>
<p>	(18 February 1951 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	From letters written by the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	1844. A very important activity which has been pursued effectively 
in all too few countries is the undertaking by the National Spiritual 
Assembly of a sustained, planned effort to foster cordial relations with
 prominent people and responsible government officials and to 
familiarize them personally with the basic tenets and the teachings of 
the Faith. Such an activity must be carried out with wisdom and 
discretion, and requires the constant attention of a responsible 
committee as well as periodic review by the National Spiritual Assembly 
itself. Where successful it can effectively forestall opposition to the 
Faith and smooth the way for many essential aspects of the development 
of the Baha'i community.</p>
<p>	(Naw-Ruz 1974 to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	1845. The House of Justice feels that your National Assembly must do
 more than distribute printed information about the Faith, as valuable 
as this is. A beginning should be made to identify the prominent persons
 in your country and ways be found to meet with them personally to 
acquaint them with the Faith. To this end, the House of Justice again 
urges you to appoint a committee to investigate the possibilities. If 
the few prominent Baha'is ... are too busy to assist, then you will have
 to either redirect their efforts or call others to this task.</p>
<p>	(22 August 1984 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	2.2 Attitudes and Approaches</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Baha'u'llah</p>
<p>	1846. Be righteous, O servants, in your actions! Turn not away from 
the helpless; make mention of Me amidst the great, and have no fear.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	1847. For we, the followers of the Blessed Beauty, should all be
 engaged in the service of the Cause of God, and become sources of 
guidance to humanity. Thou shouldst, if thou deemest it advisable and 
possible, proceed forthwith to organize a meeting of dignitaries. And 
when thy distinguished guests have assembled, speak to them about the 
Cause. Thou shouldst likewise advise the friends to arrange for another 
meeting with these same persons to be held one evening and to be 
addressed by them. This is a great service that I am entrusting to thee,
 and I pray to God that He may grant thee His assistance and 
confirmation, and bestow His blessings upon thy family.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	From letters written by or on behalf of Shoghi Effendi[1]<br>
 [1 To individual believers unless otherwise noted]</p>
<p>	1848. I do hope your passionate fervour, your mature experience and 
the ardour of your love will accomplish a great deal among the 
higher-class people with whom you associate. The Cause must capture the 
heights, and I look to you as the beloved and enthusiastic apostle of 
'Abdu'l-Baha to win to the Cause, cultured and capable souls. Be not 
disheartened and be assured of my constant loving prayers for the 
success of your much-valued efforts.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 2 April 1925 written on his behalf)</p>
<p>	1849. Ever since its[1] inception Shoghi Effendi has cherished the 
hope of making it a work that would prove interesting and illuminating 
to the reader. Destined mainly for the non-Baha'is, he has tried to 
attract through its pages the attention of educated and enlightened 
people and especially leaders in every country, with a view to 
acquainting them with the broad and fundamental principles of the Faith 
and to winning their consideration of the Movement as a growing force 
for good and for peace throughout the entire world. It is therefore with
 lively satisfaction that he has seen the publication grow yearly in 
importance and this feeling has been lately enhanced very much by the 
words of interest and appreciation which he has received from many 
quarters and leading men, among which was a remarkably encouraging 
letter from Sir Herbert Samuel.<br>
 Indeed Shoghi Effendi has made it a point to send copies to as many 
leading men as possible and copies of last year's issue were presented 
to the Emperor of Japan, the Shah of Persia and Queen Marie of Rumania.<br>
 [1 "The Baha'i World"]</p>
<p>	(12 December 1929 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>	1850. As to teaching work in colleges and universities, this is very
 important, for students as a whole are open-minded and little 
influenced by tradition. They would easily enter the Cause if the 
subject is properly presented and their intellect and sentiments 
properly satisfied. This, however, should be attempted only by persons 
who have had university training and are therefore acquainted with the 
mind of the intelligent and educated youth.</p>
<p>	(3 February 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, published in "Baha'i News" 64 (July 1932), p. 4)</p>
<p>	1851. The letter you addressed to the Secretary of State, he liked 
very much. He sincerely hopes that through such approaches and 
communications the authorities will come to take into consideration the 
importance of the Cause and gradually feel deep sympathy and admiration 
for its spirit. It is very important that they should know how we stand 
and what is our attitude towards some of the outstanding problems and 
issues that face the world in the present day. These are very difficult 
questions and most delicate, but the Master's spirit will surely guide 
you and inspire you to do what is proper and wise.</p>
<p>	(4 May 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	1852. It is really strange how much modern thinkers are, of their 
own accord, drawing nearer to the teachings of the Faith and voicing 
views very much like ours. It shows clearly the truth of the saying of 
the Master that the spirit of the Movement has permeated the hearts of 
all the people of the world. It is God's hands operating and guiding the
 nations and intellectual men and leaders of society to a gradual 
acceptance of His Message revealed through Baha'u'llah. The way we can 
hasten the development of this process is by doing our share in 
spreading the words of God far and wide. Even though we may not see any 
case of sudden conversion on the part of these<br>
 intellectuals, yet they are bound to be influenced in their view and 
look to the Faith with greater admiration and with a more willing desire
 to be led by its precepts. Shoghi Effendi, therefore, wishes me to 
encourage you in your work, in sending appropriate literature to such 
men of learning.</p>
<p>	(7 May 1933 Written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>	1853. Through the reading of such a challenging and scholarly 
work[1] many will, undoubtedly, be awakened and stimulated, while others
 will be infuriated to the extent of virulently attacking the Faith. The
 unprecedented publicity which the Cause will be thus receiving will in 
itself constitute an important step towards a wider and fuller 
recognition of the Movement by distinguished personalities, in both 
intellectual and social circles.<br>
 [1 George Townshend, "The Promise of All Ages"]</p>
<p>	(15 May 1934 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1854. Regarding your work with the upper classes, the Guardian quite
 agrees with you that the people of wealth and culture do sometimes have
 a great capacity for spiritual things. But they need the right type of 
people to approach them, and a method that can suit their mentality. Our
 teaching methods should allow a certain degree of elasticity in 
establishing contacts with various types of individual seekers. Every 
inquirer has to be approached from his own angle. Those who are 
essentially of the mystic type should first be given those teachings of 
the Cause which emphasize the nature and value of spiritual realities; 
while those who are practically minded and of a positive type are 
naturally more ready and inclined to accept the social aspect of the 
Teachings. But of course, gradually the entire Message, in all its 
aspects and with the full implications it entails, should be explained 
to the newcomer. For to be a believer means to accept the Cause in its 
wholeness, and not to adhere to some of its teachings. However, as 
already stated, this ought to be done gradually and tactfully. For 
conversation is after all a slow process.</p>
<p>	(28 December 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)<br>

</p><p>	1855. It is wonderful to see, at last, the intellectuals turning
 to the problems of the world and seeking to solve them. Side by side 
with this non-Baha'i work, so close to many of Baha'u'llah's teachings, 
we believers must carry on our purely Baha'i work, which only we can do,
 and which has such tremendous implications for the future of humanity 
in every sphere.</p>
<p>	(14 April 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>1856. They[1] must be neither provocative nor supine, neither<br>
fanatical nor excessively liberal, in their exposition of the<br>
fundamental and distinguishing features of their Faith. Thy<br>
must be either wary or bold, they must act swiftly or mark<br>
time, they must use the direct or indirect method, they must be<br>
challenging or conciliatory, in strict accordance with the<br>
spiritual receptivity of the soul with whom they come in<br>
contact, whether he be a nobleman or a commoner, a northerner<br>
or a southerner, a layman or a priest, a capitalist or a<br>
socialist, a statesman or a prince, an artisan or a beggar. In<br>
their presentation of the Message of the Baha'u'llah they must<br>
neither hesitate nor falter. They must be neither contemptuous<br>
of the poor nor timid before the great. In their exposition of<br>
its verities they must neither over stress nor whittle down the<br>
truth which they champion, whether their hearer belong to<br>
royalty, or be a prince of the Church, or a politician, or a<br>
tradesman, or a man of the street. To all alike, high or low,<br>
rich or poor, they must proffer, with open hands, with a<br>
radiant heart, with an eloquent tongue, with infinite patience,<br>
with uncompromising loyalty, with great wisdom, with<br>
unshakeable courage, the Cup of Salvation, at so critical an<br>
hour, to the confused, the hungry, the distraught and<br>
fear-stricken multitudes...<br>
 [1 American pioneers]</p>
<p>	(5 June 1947 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "Citadel of Faith: Messages to America 1947-1957" 
(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), pp. 25-26)</p>
<p>	1857. The lack of prejudice, (for the most part) the true altruism 
of the pure scientist, is pretty well demonstrated, and to such people 
the Faith, if properly presented, should have a great appeal; and 
moreover such people could do tremendous things for the Cause if they 
joined it in numbers.<br>

</p><p>	There is certainly a place in the Cause for outstanding people, 
and we need more of them. But the administration must function on a 
consultative basis, not leadership.</p>
<p>	(5 July 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>	1858. It seems what we need now is a more profound and co-ordinated 
Baha'i scholarship in order to attract such men as you are contacting. 
The world has -- at least the thinking world -- caught up by now with 
all the great and universal principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah over 70
 years ago, and so of course it does not sound "new" to them. But we 
know that the deeper teachings, the capacity of His projected World 
Order to re-create society, are new and dynamic. It is these we must 
learn to present intelligently and enticingly to such men!</p>
<p>	(3 July 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>	1859. ...the solution given to the world's problems by Baha'u'llah 
is the only solution -- being Divine in origin -- and most desperately 
needed; therefore we, the few who have caught the vision, should not 
waste our energies beating up and down the paths pursued by humanity, 
and which are not solving its ghastly present-day problems. We should 
concentrate on the Cause, because it is what is needed to cure the 
world. This is a sound attitude, for if we don't devote ourselves to the
 Baha'i work and teaching, who will?</p>
<p>	On the other hand there is a big difference between this and 
learning. If the Baha'is want to be really effective in teaching the 
Cause they need to discuss intelligently, intellectually, the present 
condition of the world and its problems. We need Baha'i scholars, not 
only people far, far more deeply aware of what our teachings really are,
 but also well-read and well-educated people, capable of correlating our
 teachings to the current thoughts of the leaders of society.</p>
<p>	We Baha'is should, in other words, arm our minds with knowledge in 
order to better demonstrate to, especially, the educated classes, the 
truths enshrined in our Faith. What the Guardian, however, does not 
advise the friends to do is to dissipate their time and energies in 
serving movements that are akin to our principles but not, we believe, 
capable of solving the present spiritual crisis the world finds itself 
in. We can co-operate with such movements and their promoters to good 
effect,<br>
 while at the same time openly standing forth as Baha'is with a specific programme to offer society.</p>
<p>	(5 July 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>	From letters written by or on behalf of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	1860. In view of the difficulty you have experienced in obtaining 
publicity about the Faith in the national press in ..., the House of 
Justice has instructed us to say that there are three courses of action 
which should assist you in achieving this in the future. First, it is 
important that there be certain believers, such as the members of a 
public information committee, who are given the task of cultivating 
personal contacts with influential figures in the national information 
media. This personal contact is a vital element in fostering the 
receptivity of the media to news about the Faith. Secondly, as an aid to
 promoting such links, your representatives could take with them 
examples of excellent material about the Faith that has been published 
in such important newspapers as "Le Monde", "The Times" of London, and 
"The New York Times".... Thirdly, repeated mention of the Faith in the 
local press will contribute to the willingness of the national press to 
regard the Baha'i Faith as newsworthy material.</p>
<p>	(5 January 1981 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1861. With the approach of the Year of Peace and the rapidly growing
 awareness among thinking people of the need for world-wide solutions to
 the problems threatening humankind, the House of Justice feels that 
there is a need for research and the writing of books and papers on 
subjects which are of immediate interest to the leaders of thought and 
the generality of mankind.</p>
<p>	(31 March 1985 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the Association for Baha'i Studies, Canada)</p>
<p>	1862. It was also mentioned that there was a need to reach leaders 
of thought and people in authority with the Teachings; that there is a 
tendency for the people to more readily accept new ideas if they have 
already been accepted by the upper echelons of society. If this is so, 
perhaps a viable programme could be developed of inviting prominent<br>
 Baha'is from other countries to visit ... in order to contact prominent [individuals] of similar station or profession.</p>
<p>	(16 February 1987 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1863. National Baha'i communities have organized and successfully 
conducted inter-religious conferences, peace seminars, symposiums on 
racism and other subjects on which we have a specific contribution to 
make, often achieving widespread publicity and the interest of highly 
placed leaders of society.</p>
<p>	(Ridvan 1987 written by the Universal House of Justice to the Baha'is of the World)</p>
<p>	2.3 The Role of the Spiritual Assemblies</p>
<p>	From letters written by or on behalf of Shoghi Effendi[1]<br>
[1 To individual believers unless otherwise noted]</p>
<p>	1864. To approach such well-known important persons is always an 
extremely delicate matter, since it requires a good deal of wisdom, 
courage and ability. But those friends who really feel the urge to do 
so, and possess the necessary qualifications, should cultivate such 
friends which, if properly done, can be of an immense benefit to the 
Cause. In any case, however, the assistance and help of either the Local
 or the National Assembly is not only useful but necessary, if important
 contacts of this sort are to be fruitful and promising....</p>
<p>	(30 August 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>	1865. ...a resolute attempt should be made by the national elected 
representatives of the entire community, aided by their Public 
Relations, Race Unity, Public Meetings, Visual Education, College 
Speakers Bureau and Radio Committees, to reinforce the measures already 
adopted for the proclamation, through the press and radio, of the 
verities of the Faith to the masses, and for the establishment of closer
 contact with the leaders of public thought, with colleges and 
universities and with newspaper and magazine editors.</p>
<p>	(5 June 1947 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "Citadel of Faith: Messages to America 1947-1957" pp. 
&amp;9)<br>

</p><p>	1866. The National Assembly should not be timid about trying to 
contact important visitors to.... The stature of the Faith is now such 
that its representatives can demand and receive attention. Whether they 
are always successful or not, is not the point, the point is to let 
people of importance realize we are active and on the world scene, so to
 speak.</p>
<p>	(23 November 1951 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1867. The Guardian was very happy to see your Assembly had had a 
successful meeting with both the Mayor of ... and the Minister for 
Foreign Affairs; such important contacts should be carried out on a high
 level, and only believers able to perhaps offer hospitality or having 
some point of contact with the officials in question or being themselves
 attractive to meet, should be used by your Assembly, and in conjunction
 with your members, to meet such personages.</p>
<p>	(30 June 1952 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1868. He feels that the time has now come when you should establish a
 national committee to make contacts with civil authorities on a 
national level, and with important public figures in State and large 
City administrations. The purpose of these contacts is to establish 
friendly relations with important public figures, so that they may be 
fully informed of the Faith and its principles, may gain confidence in 
the Baha'is and their activities, may understand the non-political 
aspect of the Faith, and in the future, be anxious to be of assistance 
to us as the Faith evolves.</p>
<p>	(29 December 1953 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	From letters written by or on behalf of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	1869. National Spiritual Assemblies must promote wise and dignified 
approaches to people prominent in all areas of human endeavour, 
acquainting them with the nature of the Baha'i community and the basic 
tenets of the Faith, and winning their esteem and friendship.</p>
<p>	(Naw Ruz 1979 written by the Universal House of Justice to the Baha'is of the World)<br>

</p><p>	1870. ... the House of Justice is extremely happy that your 
National Assembly is continuing its wise, effective and ongoing efforts 
to familiarize the officials in your country about the Faith. Such 
approaches should be planned whenever the occasion arises. In the 
meantime, through your various proclamation efforts, the Baha'i 
community should indirectly draw the attention of people of all strata 
of society to the Cause so that it will be easier for the Baha'is to 
have a positive access to the officials in the time of need.</p>
<p>	(26 July 1987 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1871. The spark which ignited the mounting interest in the Cause of 
Baha'u'llah was the heroic fortitude and patience of the beloved friends
 in Iran, which moved the Baha'i world community to conduct a 
persistent, carefully orchestrated programme of appeal to the conscience
 of the world. This vast undertaking, involving the entire community 
acting unitedly through its Administrative Order, was accompanied by 
equally vigorous and visible activities of that community in other 
spheres which have been detailed separately. Nonetheless, we are 
impelled to mention that an important outcome of this extensive exertion
 is our recognition of a new stage in the external affairs of the Cause,
 characterized by a marked maturation of National Spiritual Assemblies 
in their growing relations with governmental and non-governmental 
organizations and with the public in general.</p>
<p>	This recognition prompted a meeting in Germany last November of 
national Baha'i external affairs representatives from Europe and North 
America, together with senior representatives of the Offices of the 
Baha'i International Community, intent on effecting greater coordination
 of their work. This was a preliminary step towards the gathering of 
more and more National Spiritual Assemblies into a harmoniously 
functioning, international network capable of executing global 
undertakings in this rapidly expanding field. Related to these 
developments was the significant achievement of international 
recognition accorded the Faith through its formal acceptance last 
October into membership of the Network on Conservation and Religion of 
the renowned World Wide Fund for Nature.<br>

</p><p>	(Ridvan 1988 written by the Universal House of Justice to the Baha'is of the World)</p>
<p>	2.4 The "Course of Prudence"</p>
<p>	From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha</p>
<p>	1872. ...thou shouldst initially adopt that course of prudence that 
the Faith enjoins. In the early stages, thou shouldst seek out the 
company of the eminent members of the populace and, turning thyself in 
utter lowliness to the unseen realm of Glory, thou shouldst pray for 
succour and protection so that the Holy Spirit may, through the 
outpourings of its grace, grant thee its assistance. When, by thy godly 
conduct and demeanour, thy fervour, thy chaste and lucid utterance, thou
 shalt have succeeded in winning the affection of one and all, then 
shall the portals of heavenly guidance be opened wide; then shall the 
bounteous cup be borne around and all the souls that drink therefrom be 
inebriated with the wine of holy mysteries and truths.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	From letters written by or on behalf of Shoghi Effendi[1]<br>
[9 To individual believers unless otherwise noted] </p>
<p>	1873. You mentioned in your letter your intention to make contact 
with the representatives of movements which are akin to the Cause in the
 principles they advocate. Shoghi Effendi trusts that in all such 
communications and activities you would maintain the prestige and 
superiority of the Cause. We should never compromise our principles for 
some temporary benefits we are apt to reap. It is very important to 
bring the Cause to the attention of such leaders of thought and for this
 purpose we have to get in touch with them, but our aim should be to 
draw them to the Cause rather than follow their footsteps.</p>
<p>	(29 November 1926 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1874. I entirely agree with you that non-interference in politics 
does not imply non-association on the part of the friends with the 
outside world. I hope you will impress the friends with the necessity of
 maintaining close, but not too intimate, relationships with the 
authorities, the foreign representatives, and the leaders of public 
thought in the capital. They should be on their guard, however, lest too
 close an association should<br>
 lead, imperceptibly, to compromise on the principles which we cherish 
and uphold. They must mix with all classes of society without 
associating themselves with their policies and schemes.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 8 October 1927 written on his behalf)</p>
<p>	1875. It is our supreme obligation to endeavour to bring the 
knowledge of this Revelation to the highest authorities and the leading 
personalities among our countrymen, but to refrain from associating 
ourselves or identifying our Faith with their political pursuits, their 
conflicting ambitions and party programmes. May the Almighty guide and 
sustain your high endeavours, and enable you to win for His Cause the 
most capable, the most virtuous and the most enlightened leaders of 
public opinion in that land.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi appended to a letter dated 15 April 1932 written on his behalf)</p>
<p>	1876. Shoghi Effendi fully approves your meeting of important men 
who are in power and have the reins of government in their hands. In 
fact he would urge you to avail yourself of every such opportunity that 
presents itself. But you should be very careful not to discuss matters 
that are political and that are points of contention between the 
different parties. That would drag the Cause into political affairs, a 
thing which was strictly forbidden by the Master. Your concern in 
meeting such people should be to familiarize them with the teachings of 
the Cause and imbue them with the spirit of the Movement. Should such 
men embrace the Movement they would lead with themselves thousands of 
others into the Cause.</p>
<p>	(15 April 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>   From a letter written by the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	1877. It is perfectly in order for Baha'i institutions to present 
the Baha'i view or recommendations on any subject of vital interest to 
the Faith which is under the consideration of a government, if the 
governmental authority itself invites such a submission, or if it is 
open to receive recommendations. The Baha'i Assemblies should, however, 
refrain from bringing pressure to bear on the authorities in such 
matters, either<br>
 separately or in concert with others. The Baha'is will submit their 
views, if permissible, expressing them as cogently and forcefully as the
 occasion warrants, but will not go beyond this to the stage of pressing
 the authorities to adopt these views. Moreover, when considering 
whether or not it is wise to make such a submission on any particular 
matter, the Baha'i Assembly concerned must take care that it will not 
diffuse the energies of the Community or divert its resources by making 
submissions unless the interests of Faith demand it. Likewise the 
Assembly must ensure that it does not, by any minute and detailed 
analysis of a situation, "needlessly alienate or estrange any government
 or people", or involve the Faith in "the base clamourings and 
contentions of warring sects, factions and nations."</p>
<p>	(21 November 1971 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	From letters written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	1878. The House of Justice received your letter of 13 December 1986 
inquiring about permissible activities of the Baha'is in relation 
towards governments...</p>
<p>	The general policy already enunciated by Shoghi Effendi in "The 
World Order of Baha'u'llah", pages 63-67, should be scrupulously upheld 
by the friends. However, as the Faith emerges from obscurity, the 
application of certain aspects of this policy will require the 
clarification of the House of Justice. With the passage of time, 
practices in the political realm will definitely undergo the profound 
changes anticipated in the Baha'i writings. As a consequence, what we 
understand now of the policy of non-involvement in politics will also 
undergo a change; but as Shoghi Effendi has written, this instruction, 
"at the present stage of the evolution of our Faith, should be 
increasingly emphasized, irrespective of its application to the East or 
to the West".</p>
<p>	In view of the necessity of the Baha'i community to relate to 
governments, whether for reasons of defending its persecuted members or 
of responding to opportunities to be of service, a correct understanding
 of what is legitimate Baha'i action in the face of the policy of 
non-interference with government affairs is bound to be difficult to 
achieve on the part of individual friends. The force of circumstances, 
operating internally and externally, is pressing the Baha'i community 
into certain relationships with governments.<br>

</p><p>	Hence, it is important that decisions as to the conduct of such 
relationships be made by authorized institutions of the Faith and not by
 individuals. In matters of this kind, given the utter complexity of 
human affairs with which the Baha'i community must increasingly cope 
both spiritually and practically, individual judgement is not 
sufficient.</p>
<p>	(23 June 1987 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1879. This is a field of service in which much latitude for 
initiative must be given to individuals. For instance, in the aspect of 
the work which calls for reaching very important persons, it is 
necessary to rely on the personal relationships which individual Baha'is
 have developed or are capable of developing, to rely on their ability 
to engage the attention of such persons, because these Baha'is are 
themselves attractive in particular ways. While exercising careful 
judgement in selecting the individuals you can call on for such 
services, and providing them with any necessary guidance, you must also 
be sensitive to these points and avoid excessive control, or even the 
appearance of it, in your dealing with those who are engaged in these 
important services.</p>
<p>	(26 April 1988 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	1880. Your comments concerning the maintenance of contacts with 
officials in the lower level of your Government's hierarchy are well 
taken, and you should feel confident in pursuing this wise course of 
action.</p>
<p>	There is no objection to initiating contact with high officials of 
the Catholic Church. This would require your careful consideration as to
 the timeliness of such action and determination by you as to how to 
proceed without unduly arousing opposition to the Faith.</p>
<p>	Your Assembly is encouraged to establish contacts with national 
associations, bearing in mind the need to select such organizations 
wisely, so as not to stretch your human and financial resources beyond 
reasonable bounds or to distract the community from its primary teaching
 efforts. As this balance is sometimes difficult to achieve, you may 
wish to include this as an element of your consultation with the 
Counsellors on the role of ... in the process of the Faith's emergence 
from obscurity in Latin America and the world.</p>
<p>	(23 March 1989 to a National Spiritual Assembly)<br>

</p><p>	USE OF RADIO AND TELEVISION IN TEACHING</p>
<p>	(Extracts from letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi)</p>
<p>	1881. In regard to your wish of broadcasting the Message, Shoghi 
Effendi would advise you to consult with the Spiritual Assembly as to 
whether such an action meets their approval, and if so to ask their 
assistance and help for finding the best means through which to carry 
out your plan. The idea of a wireless station is rather ambitious and 
requires much financial expenditure. If, however, you find it feasible 
and within your financial capacity you should not hesitate to do so, in 
as much as this will enable you to spread the Cause in a much easier and
 more efficient manner.</p>
<p>	(13 August 1933 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1882. Your suggestion regarding the installation of a radio station 
in the Temple is truly splendid. But it remains to be seen whether the 
National Spiritual Assembly finds it financially feasible to undertake 
such a project, which is, beyond doubt, a very costly enterprise. 
Whatever the expenditure involved in this project, there is no reason 
why the believers should not start now considering seriously the 
possibility of such a plan, which, whe[n] carried out and perfected, can
 lend an unprecedented impetus to the expansion of the teaching work 
throughout America.</p>
<p>	It is for the National Spiritual Assembly, however, to take the 
final decision in this matter, and to determine whether the national 
fund of the Cause is at present sufficiently strong to permit them to 
install a radio station in the Temple.</p>
<p>	The Guardian feels, nevertheless, confident that this plan will 
receive the careful consideration of the National Spiritual Assembly 
members, and hopes that, if feasible, they will take some definite 
action in this matter.</p>
<p>	(31 January 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1883. He read with interest the various suggestions you made to the 
National Spiritual Assembly, and feels they are fundamentally sound, 
especially the wider use of the radio. Unfortunately at the present time
 anything that would make a fresh demand on the financial resources of 
the Cause in America -- such as a Baha'i-owned broadcasting station --<br>
 is out of the question, as the friends are finding it difficult to meet
 the great needs of the teaching and Temple Funds. However the idea 
should, he feels, be kept in mind for future realization.</p>
<p>	(14 October 1942 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1884. In connection with the radio work ... he would suggest that 
the main consideration is to bring to the attention of the public the 
fact that the Faith exists, and its teachings. Every kind of broadcast, 
whether of passages from the Writings, or on topical subjects, or 
lectures, should be used. The people need to hear the word "Baha'i" so 
that they can, if receptive, respond and seek the Cause out. The primary
 duty of the friends everywhere in the world is to let the people know 
such a Revelation is in existence; their next duty is to teach it.</p>
<p>	(24 July 1943 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1885. He feels it would be excellent if the Cause could be 
introduced more to the people through the medium of radio, as it reaches
 the masses, especially those who do not take an interest in lectures or
 attend any type of meeting.</p>
<p>	(7 March 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1886. The matter of obtaining free time on the radio is one which 
the Radio Committee and the National Spiritual Assembly must decide 
upon: but the principle is that every effort should be made to present 
the teachings over the air as often as possible as long as the manner in
 which it is done is compatible with the dignity of our beloved Faith.</p>
<p>	(15 August 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1887. He was sorry to learn through your cable that the project for a
 Baha'i radio station can not be carried out at present; he considers 
that such a station would be a very great asset to the Cause, not only 
as a teaching medium and a wonderful form of publicity, but also as an 
enhancement of its prestige. He feels your Assembly should not drop the 
matter, but go on investigating ways to make such a project materialize 
as soon as possible.</p>
<p>	(20 March 1946 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)<br>

</p><p>	1888. He hopes that a Baha'i radio station will prove feasible during the coming years, as he considers it of great importance.</p>
<p>	(4 May 1946 to the Radio Committee of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	1889. The Baha'is should not always be the last to take up new and 
obviously excellent methods, but rather the first, as this agrees with 
the dynamic nature of the Faith which is not only progressive, but holds
 within itself the seeds of an entirely new culture and civilization.</p>
<p>	(5 May 1946 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1890. The Guardian approves in principle of a radio station, and 
sees no objection to its being in the Temple; but he considers the cost 
you quote too much of a burden at the present time for the Fund to bear,
 in view of the multiple expenses of the new Seven Year Plan. If there 
is any way it can be done for a price you feel the Fund could pay, and 
which would be more reasonable, he approves of your doing it. In any 
case the National Spiritual Assembly should strongly press for 
recognition as a Religious Body, and claim full rights to be represented
 on the air on an equal footing with other established Churches.</p>
<p>	(20 July 1946 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	1891. He approves of your desire to teach the principles of the 
Faith through radio. But he urges you to do all you can to always, 
however small the reference you are able to make to it may be, clearly 
identify or associate what you are giving out with Baha'u'llah. The time
 is too short now for us Baha'i's to be able to first educate humanity 
and then tell it that the Source is this new World Faith. For their own 
spiritual protection people must hear of the name Baha'i -- then, if 
they turn blindly away, they cannot excuse themselves by saying they 
never even knew it existed! For dark days seem still ahead of the world,
 and outside of this Divine Refuge the people will not, we firmly 
believe, find inner conviction, peace and security. So they have a right
 to at least hear of the Cause as such!</p>
<p>	(24 April 1949 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF SHOGHI EFFENDI ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FORMATIVE AGE OF OUR FAITH</p>
<p>	1892. The passing of 'Abdu'l-Baha, so sudden in the circumstances 
which caused it, so dramatic in its consequences, could neither impede 
the operation of such a dynamic force[1] nor obscure its purpose. Those 
fervid appeals, embodied in the Will and Testament of a departed Master,
 could not but confirm its aim, define its character and reinforce the 
promise of its ultimate success.<br>
 [1 The Cause of Baha'u'llah]</p>
<p>	Out of the pangs of anguish which His bereaved followers have 
suffered, amid the heat and dust which the attacks launched by a 
sleepless enemy had precipitated, the Administration of Baha'u'llah's 
invincible Faith was born. The potent energies released through the 
ascension of the Center of His Covenant crystallized into this supreme, 
this infallible Organ for the accomplishment of a Divine Purpose. The 
Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha unveiled its character, reaffirmed 
its basis, supplemented its principles, asserted its indispensability, 
and enumerated its chief institutions....</p>
<p>	("America and the Most Great Peace, 21 April 1933, "The World Order 
of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", rev. ed (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing 
Trust, 1982), p. 89)</p>
<p>	1893. With 'Abdu'l-Baha's ascension, and more particularly with the 
passing of His well-beloved and illustrious sister the Most Exalted Leaf
 -- the last survivor of a glorious and heroic age -- there draws to a 
close the first and most moving chapter of Baha'i history, marking the 
conclusion of the Primitive, the Apostolic Age of the Faith of 
Baha'u'llah. It was 'Abdu'l-Baha Who, through the provisions of His 
weighty Will and Testament, has forged the vital link which must for 
ever connect the age that has just expired with the one we now live in 
-- the Transitional and Formative period of the Faith -- a stage that 
must in the fullness of time reach its blossom and yield its fruit in 
the exploits and triumphs that are to herald the Golden Age of the 
Revelation of Baha'u'llah.<br>

</p><p>	Dearly-beloved friends! The onrushing forces so miraculously 
released through the agency of two independent and swiftly successive 
Manifestations are now under our very eyes and through the care of the 
chosen stewards of a far-flung Faith being gradually mustered and 
disciplined. They are slowly crystallizing into institutions that will 
come to be regarded as the hall-mark and glory of the age we are called 
upon to establish and by our deeds immortalize. For upon our present-day
 efforts, and above all upon the extent to which we strive to remodel 
our lives after the pattern of sublime heroism associated with those 
gone before us, must depend the efficacy of the instruments we now 
fashion -- instruments that must erect the structure of that blissful 
Commonwealth which must signalize the Golden Age of our Faith.</p>
<p>	("The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah" 8 February 1934, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters" p. 98)</p>
<p>	1894. 'Abdu'l-Baha, Who incarnates an institution for which we can 
find no parallel whatsoever in any of the world's recognized religious 
systems, may be said to have closed the Age to which He Himself belonged
 and opened the one in which we are now laboring. His Will and Testament
 should thus be regarded as the perpetual, the indissoluble link which 
the mind of Him Who is the Mystery of God has conceived in order to 
insure the continuity of the three ages that constitute the component 
parts of the Baha'i Dispensation. The period in which the seed of the 
Faith had been slowly germinating is thus intertwined both with the one 
which must witness its efflorescence and the subsequent age in which 
that seed will have finally yielded its golden fruit.</p>
<p>	The creative energies released by the Law of Baha'u'llah, permeating
 and evolving within the mind of 'Abdu'l-Baha, have, by their very 
impact and close interaction, given birth to an Instrument which may be 
viewed as the Charter of the New World Order which is at once the glory 
and the promise of this most great Dispensation. The Will may thus be 
acclaimed as the inevitable offspring resulting from that mystic 
intercourse between Him Who communicated the generating influence of His
 divine Purpose and the One Who was its vehicle and chosen recipient. 
Being the Child of the Covenant -- the Heir of both the Originator and 
the Interpreter of the Law of God -- the Will and Testament of 
'Abdu'l-Baha can no more be divorced from Him Who supplied the original 
and motivating impulse<br>
 than from the One Who ultimately conceived it. Baha'u'llah 's 
inscrutable purpose, we must ever bear in mind, has been so thoroughly 
infused into the conduct of 'Abdu'l-Baha, and their motives have been so
 closely wedded together, that the mere attempt to dissociate the 
teachings of the former from any system which the ideal Exemplar of 
those same teachings has established would amount to a repudiation of 
one of the most sacred and basic truths of the Faith.</p>
<p>	The Administrative Order, which ever since 'Abdu'l-Baha's ascension 
has evolved and is taking shape under our very eyes in no fewer than 
forty countries of the world, may be considered as the framework of the 
Will itself, the inviolable stronghold wherein this new-born child is 
being nurtured and developed. This Administrative Order, as it expands 
and consolidates itself, will no doubt manifest the potentialities and 
reveal the full implications of this momentous Document -- this most 
remarkable expression of the Will of One of the most remarkable Figures 
of the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah. It will, as its component parts, its
 organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigor, 
assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity to be regarded not only as
 the nucleus but the very pattern of the New World Order destined to 
embrace in the fullness of time the whole of mankind.</p>
<p>	("The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah", 8 February 1934, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", pp. 143-44)</p>
<p>	1895. Dearly-beloved friends: Though the Revelation of Baha'u'llah 
has been delivered, the World Order which such a Revelation must needs 
beget is as yet unborn. Though the Heroic Age of His Faith is passed, 
the creative energies which that Age has released have not as yet 
crystallized into that world society which, in the fullness of time, is 
to mirror forth the brightness of His glory. Though the framework of His
 Administrative Order has been erected, and the Formative Period of the 
Baha'i Era has begun, yet the promised Kingdom into which the seed of 
His institutions must ripen remains as yet uninaugurated....</p>
<p>	"The heights," Baha'u'llah Himself testifies, "which, through the 
most gracious favor of God, mortal man can attain in this Day are as yet
 unrevealed to his sight. The world of being hath never had, nor doth it
 yet possess, the capacity for such a revelation. The day, however, is<br>
 approaching when the potentialities of so great a favor will, by virtue of His behest, be manifested unto men."</p>
<p>	For the revelation of so great a favor a period of intense turmoil 
and wide-spread suffering would seem to be indispensable. Resplendent as
 has been the Age that has witnessed the inception of the Mission with 
which Baha'u'llah has been entrusted, the interval which must elapse ere
 that Age yields its choicest fruit must, it is becoming increasingly 
apparent, be overshadowed by such moral and social gloom as can alone 
prepare an unrepentant humanity for the prize she is destined to 
inherit....</p>
<p>	As we view the world around us, we are compelled to observe the 
manifold evidences of that universal fermentation which, in every 
continent of the globe and in every department of human life, be it 
religious, social, economic or political, is purging and reshaping 
humanity in anticipation of the Day when the wholeness of the human race
 will have been recognized and its unity established. A twofold process,
 however, can be distinguished, each tending, in its own way and with an
 accelerated momentum, to bring to a climax the forces that are 
transforming the face of our planet. The first is essentially an 
integrating process, while the second is fundamentally disruptive. The 
former, as it steadily evolves, unfolds a System which may well serve as
 a pattern for that world polity towards which a strangely-disordered 
world is continually advancing; while the latter, as its disintegrating 
influence deepens, tends to tear down, with increasing violence, the 
antiquated barriers that seek to block humanity's progress towards its 
destined goal. The constructive process stands associated with the 
nascent Faith of Baha'u'llah, and is the harbinger of the New World 
Order that Faith must erelong establish. The destructive forces that 
characterize the other should be identified with a civilization that has
 refused to answer to the expectation of a new age, and is consequently 
falling into chaos and decline.</p>
<p>	A titanic, a spiritual struggle, unparalleled in its magnitude yet 
unspeakably glorious in its ultimate consequences, is being waged as a 
result of these opposing tendencies, in this age of transition through 
which the organized community of the followers of Baha'u'llah and 
mankind as a whole are passing....</p>
<p>	It is not my purpose to call to mind, much less to attempt a 
detailed analysis of, the spiritual struggles that have ensued, or to 
note the victories<br>
 that have redounded to the glory of the Faith of Baha'u'llah since the 
day of its foundation. My chief concern is not with the happenings that 
have distinguished the First, the Apostolic Age of the Baha'i 
Dispensation, but rather with the outstanding events that are 
transpiring in, and the tendencies which characterize, the formative 
period of its development, this Age of Transition, whose tribulations 
are the precursors of that Era of blissful felicity which is to 
incarnate God's ultimate purpose for all mankind.</p>
<p>	("The Unfoldment of World Civilization", 11 March 1936, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", pp. 168-71)</p>
<p>	1896. The moment had now arrived for that undying, that 
world-vitalizing Spirit that was born in Shiraz, that had been rekindled
 in Tihran, that had been fanned into flame in Baghdad and Adrianople, 
that had been carried to the West, and was now illuminating the fringes 
of five continents, to incarnate itself in institutions designed to 
canalize its outspreading energies and stimulate its growth. The Age 
that had witnessed the birth and rise of the Faith had now closed. The 
Heroic, the Apostolic Age of the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah, that 
primitive period in which its Founders had lived, in which its life had 
been generated, in which its greatest heroes had struggled and quaffed 
the cup of martyrdom, and its pristine foundations been established -- a
 period whose splendors no victories in this or any future age, however 
brilliant, can rival -- had now terminated with the passing of One Whose
 mission may be regarded as the link binding the Age in which the seed 
of the newborn Message had been incubating and those which are destined 
to witness its efflorescence and ultimate fruition.</p>
<p>	The Formative Period, the Iron Age, of that Dispensation was now 
beginning, the Age in which the institutions, local, national and 
international, of the Faith of Baha'u'llah were to take shape, develop 
and become fully consolidated, in anticipation of the third, the last, 
the Golden Age destined to witness the emergence of a world-embracing 
Order enshrining the ultimate fruit of God's latest Revelation to 
mankind, a fruit whose maturity must signalize the establishment of a 
world civilization and the formal inauguration of the Kingdom of the 
Father upon earth as promised by Jesus Christ Himself....<br>

</p><p>	The last twenty-three years of the first Baha'i century may thus
 be regarded as the initial stage of the Formative Period of the Faith, 
an Age of Transition to be identified with the rise and establishment of
 the Administrative Order, upon which the institutions of the future 
Baha'i World Commonwealth must needs be ultimately erected in the Golden
 Age that must witness the consummation of the Baha'i Dispensation. The 
Charter which called into being, outlined the features and set in motion
 the processes of, this Administrative Order is none other than the Will
 and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, His greatest legacy to posterity, the 
brightest emanation of His mind and the mightiest instrument forged to 
insure the continuity of the three ages which constitute the component 
parts of His Father's Dispensation....</p>
<p>	The Administrative Order which this historic Document has 
established, it should be noted, is, by virtue of its origin and 
character, unique in the annals of the world's religious systems....</p>
<p>	The Document establishing that Order, the Charter of a future world 
civilization, which may be regarded in some of its features as 
supplementary to no less weighty a Book than the Kitab-i-Aqdas;...</p>
<p>	("God Passes By", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), pp. 324-28)</p>
<p>	1897. The first seventy-seven years of the preceding century, 
constituting the Apostolic and Heroic Age of our Faith, fell into three 
distinct epochs, of nine, of thirty-nine and of twenty-nine years' 
duration, associated respectively with the Babi Dispensation and the 
ministries of Baha'u'llah and of 'Abdu'l-Baha. This Primitive Age of the
 Baha'i Era, unapproached in spiritual fecundity by any period 
associated with the mission of the Founder of any previous Dispensation,
 was impregnated, from its inception to its termination, with the 
creative energies generated through the advent of two independent 
Manifestations and the establishment of a Covenant unique in the 
spiritual annals of mankind.</p>
<p>	The last twenty-three years of that same century coincided with the 
first epoch of the second, the Iron and Formative, Age of the 
Dispensation of Baha'u'llah -- the first of a series of epochs which 
must precede the inception of the last and Golden Age of that 
Dispensation -- a Dispensation which, as the Author of the Faith has 
Himself categorically asserted, must extend over a period of no less 
than one thousand years,<br>
 and which will constitute the first stage in a series of Dispensations,
 to be established by future Manifestations, all deriving their 
inspiration from the Author of the Baha'i Revelation, and destined to 
last, in their aggregate, no less than five thousand centuries....</p>
<p>	During this Formative Age of the Faith, and in the course of present
 and succeeding epochs, the last and crowning stage in the erection of 
the framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah --
 the election of the Universal House of Justice -- will have been 
completed, the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Mother-Book of His Revelation, will 
have been codified and its laws promulgated, the Lesser Peace will have 
been established, the unity of mankind will have been achieved and its 
maturity attained, the Plan conceived by 'Abdu'l-Baha will have been 
executed, the emancipation of the Faith from the fetters of religious 
orthodoxy will have been effected, and its independent religious status 
will have been universally recognized, whilst in the course of the 
Golden Age, destined to consummate the Dispensation itself, the banner 
of the Most Great Peace, promised by its Author, will have been 
unfurled, the World Baha'i Commonwealth will have emerged in the 
plenitude of its power and splendor, and the birth and efflorescence of a
 world civilization, the child of that Peace, will have conferred its 
inestimable blessings upon all mankind.</p>

</p><p>	GUIDELINES FOR TEACHING FROM THE WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH:</p>
<p>	1898. O Friends! You must all be so ablaze in this day with the fire
 of the love of God that the heat thereof may be manifest in all your 
veins, your limbs and members of your body, and the peoples of the world
 may be ignited by this heat and turn to the horizon of the Beloved.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1899. Teach thou the Cause of God with an utterance which will cause
 the bushes to be enkindled, and the call 'Verily, there is no God but 
Me, the Almighty, the Unconstrained' to be raised therefrom. Say: Human 
utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence and 
needeth moderation. As to its influence, this is conditional upon 
refinement which in turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached and
 pure. As to its moderation, this hath to be combined with tact and 
wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures and Tablets....</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", 1st 
pocket-sized ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988), p. 143)</p>
<p>	1900. Moderation is indeed highly desirable. Every person who in 
some degree turneth towards the truth can himself later comprehend most 
of what he seeketh. However, if at the outset a word is uttered beyond 
his capacity, he will refuse to hear it and will arise in opposition.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1901. ... Piety and detachment are even as two most great luminaries
 of the heaven of teaching. Blessed the one who hath attained unto this 
supreme station...</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 253)</p>
<p>	1902. Should any one among you be incapable of grasping a certain 
truth, or be striving to comprehend it, show forth, when conversing with
 him, a spirit of extreme kindliness and good-will. Help him to see and<br>
 recognize the truth, without esteeming yourself to be, in the least, superior to him, or to be possessed of greater endowments.</p>
<p>	The whole duty of man in this Day is to attain that share of the 
flood of grace which God poureth forth for him. Let none, therefore, 
consider the largeness or smallness of the receptacle. The portion of 
some might lie in the palm of a man's hand, the portion of others might 
fill a cup, and of others even a gallon-measure.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), p. 8)</p>
<p>	1903. Consort with all men, O people of Baha, in a spirit of 
friendliness and fellowship. If ye be aware of a certain truth, if ye 
possess a jewel, of which others are deprived, share it with them in a 
language of utmost kindliness and good-will. If it be accepted, if it 
fulfil its purpose, your object is attained. If any one should refuse 
it, leave him unto himself, and beseech God to guide him. Beware lest ye
 deal unkindly with him. A kindly tongue is the lodestone of the hearts 
of men. It is the bread of the spirit, it clotheth the words with 
meaning, it is the fountain of the light of wisdom and understanding....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", p. 289)</p>
<p>	1904. If he be kindled with the fire of His love, if he forgoeth all
 created things, the words he uttereth shall set on fire them that hear 
him.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 51)</p>
<p>	1905. Say: O people of God! That which can insure the victory of Him
 Who is the Eternal Truth, His hosts and helpers on earth, have been set
 down in the sacred Books and Scriptures, and are as clear and manifest 
as the sun. These hosts are such righteous deeds, such conduct and 
character, as are acceptable in His sight. Whoso ariseth, in this Day, 
to aid Our Cause, and summoneth to his assistance the hosts of a 
praiseworthy character and upright conduct, the influence from such an 
action will, most certainly, be diffused throughout the whole world.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 24)<br>

</p><p>	From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	1906. Now is the time for you to divest yourselves of the garment of
 attachment to this world that perisheth, to be wholly severed from the 
physical world, become heavenly angels, and travel to these 
countries....</p>
<p>	("Tablets of the Divine Plan Revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the North 
American Baha'is, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), p.
 34)</p>
<p>	1907. With hearts overflowing with the love of God, with tongues 
commemorating the mention of God, with eyes turned to the Kingdom of 
God, they must deliver the Glad Tidings of the manifestation of the Lord
 of Hosts to all the people. Know ye of a certainty that whatever 
gathering ye enter, the waves of the Holy Spirit are surging over it, 
and the heavenly grace of the Blessed Beauty encompasseth that 
gathering.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of the Divine Plan Revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the North American Baha'is", pp. 38-39)</p>
<p>	1908. The aim is this: The intention of the teacher must be pure, 
his heart independent, his spirit attracted, his thought at peace, his 
resolution firm, his magnanimity exalted and in the love of God a 
shining torch. Should he become as such, his sanctified breath will even
 affect the rock; otherwise there will be no result whatsoever. As long 
as a soul is not perfected, how can he efface the defects of others. 
Unless he is detached from aught else save God, how can he teach 
severance to others!</p>
<p>	("Tablets of the Divine Plan Revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the North American Baha'is", p. 51)</p>
<p>	1909. ...rest ye assured in the confirmations of the Merciful and 
the assistances of the Most High; become ye sanctified above and 
purified from this world and the inhabitants thereof; suffer your 
intention to become for the good of all; cut your attachment to the 
earth and like unto the essence of the spirit become ye light and 
delicate. Then with a firm resolution, a pure heart, a rejoiced spirit, 
and an eloquent tongue, engage your time in the promulgation of the 
divine principles...</p>
<p>	("Tablets of the Divine Plan Revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the North American Baha'is", p. 67)<br>

</p><p>	1910. ...the believers of God must become self-sacrificing and 
like unto the candles of guidance become ignited... Should they show 
forth such a magnanimity, it is assured that they will obtain universal 
divine confirmations, the heavenly cohorts will reinforce them 
uninterruptedly, and a most great victory will be obtained....</p>
<p>	("Tablets of the Divine Plan Revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the North American Baha'is", p. 27)</p>
<p>	1911. 0 ye believers of God! Be not concerned with the smallness of 
your numbers, neither be oppressed by the multitude of an unbelieving 
world. Five grains of wheat will be endued with heavenly blessing, 
whereas a thousand tons of tares will yield no results or effect. One 
fruitful tree will be conducive to the life of society, whereas a 
thousand forests of wild trees offer no fruits. The plain is covered 
with pebbles, but precious stones are rare. One pearl is better than a 
thousand wildernesses of sand, especially this pearl of great price, 
which is endowed with divine blessing. Ere long thousands of other 
pearls will be born from it. When that pearl associates and becomes the 
intimate of the pebbles, they also all change into pearls.</p>
<p>	...rest ye not, seek ye no composure, attach not yourselves to the 
luxuries of this ephemeral world, free yourselves from every attachment,
 and strive with heart and soul to become fully established in the 
Kingdom of God. Gain ye the heavenly treasures. Day by day become ye 
more illumined. Draw ye nearer and nearer unto the threshold of oneness.
 Become ye the manifestors of spiritual favours and the dawning-places 
of infinite lights!...</p>
<p>	As regards the teachers, they must completely divest themselves from
 the old garments and be invested with a new garment. According to the 
statement of Christ, they must attain to the station of rebirth -- that 
is, whereas in the first instance they were born from the womb of the 
mother, this time they must be born from the womb of the world of 
nature. Just as they are now totally unaware of the experiences of the 
fetal world, they must also forget entirely the defects of the world of 
nature. They must be baptized with the water of life, the fire of the 
love of God and the breaths of the Holy Spirit; be satisfied with little
 food, but take a large portion from the heavenly table. They must 
disengage themselves from temptation and covetousness, and be filled 
with the spirit. Through the effect of their pure breath, they must 
change the stone into the brilliant<br>
 ruby and the shell into pearl. Like unto the cloud of vernal shower, 
they must transform the black soil into the rose-garden and orchard. 
They must make the blind seeing, the deaf hearing, the extinguished one 
enkindled and set aglow, and the dead quickened.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of the Divine Plan Revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the North American Baha'is" pp. 86-88)</p>
<p>	1912. O thou maid-servant of God! Whenever thou art intending to 
deliver a speech, turn thy face toward the Kingdom of ABHA and, with a 
heart detached, begin to talk. The breaths of the Holy Spirit will 
assist thee.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas, vol. 2 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1930 printing), p. 246)</p>
<p>	1913. By the Lord of the Kingdom! If one arise to promote the Word 
of God with a pure heart, overflowing with the love of God and severed 
from the world, the Lord of Hosts will assist him with such a power as 
will penetrate the core of the existent beings.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. 2, p. 348)</p>
<p>	1914. Under all conditions the Message must be delivered, but with 
wisdom. If it be not possible openly, it must be done quietly. The 
friends should be engaged in educating the souls and should become 
instruments in aiding the world of humanity to acquire spiritual joy and
 fragrance. For example: If every one of the friends (believers) were to
 establish relations of friendship and right dealings with one of the 
negligent souls, associate and live with him with perfect kindliness, 
and meanwhile through good conduct and moral behaviour lead him to 
divine instruction, to heavenly advice and teachings, surely he would 
gradually arouse that negligent person and would change his ignorance 
into knowledge.</p>
<p>	Souls are liable to estrangement. Such methods should be adopted 
that the estrangement should be first removed, then the Word will have 
effect. If one of the believers be kind to one of the negligent ones and
 with perfect love should gradually make him understand the reality of 
the Cause of God in such a way that the latter should know in what 
manner the Religion of God hath been founded and what its object is, 
doubtless<br>
 he will become changed; excepting abnormal souls who are reduced to the
 state of ashes and whose hearts are like stones, yea, even harder.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. 2, p. 391)</p>
<p>	1915. If thou wishest to guide the souls, it is incumbent on thee to
 be firm, to be good and to be imbued with praiseworthy attributes and 
divine qualities under all circumstances. Be a sign of love, a 
manifestation of mercy, a fountain of tenderness, kind-hearted, good to 
all and gentle to the servants of God, and especially to those who bear 
relation to thee, both men and women. Bear every ordeal that befalleth 
thee from the people and confront them not save with kindness, with 
great love and good wishes.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas, vol. 3 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1930 printing), pp. 619-20)</p>
<p>	1916. The teacher, when teaching, must be himself fully enkindled, 
so that his utterance, like unto a flame of fire, may exert influence 
and consume the veil of self and passion. He must also be utterly humble
 and lowly so that others may be edified, and be totally self-effaced 
and evanescent so that he may teach with the melody of the Concourse on 
high -- otherwise his teaching will have no effect.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha, [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), Sec. 217, p. 270)</p>
<p>	1917. When the friends do not endeavour to spread the message, they 
fail to remember God befittingly, and will not witness the tokens of 
assistance and confirmation from the Abha Kingdom nor comprehend the 
divine mysteries. However, when the tongue of the teacher is engaged in 
teaching, he will naturally himself be stimulated, will become a magnet 
attracting the divine aid and bounty of the Kingdom, and will be like 
unto the bird at the hour of dawn, which itself becometh exhilarated by 
its own singing, its warbling and its melody.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 211, pp. 267-68)</p>
<p>	1918. In accordance with the divine teachings in this glorious 
dispensation we should not belittle anyone and call him ignorant, 
saying: "You know not, but I know". Rather, we should look upon others 
with respect, and<br>
 when attempting to explain and demonstrate, we should speak as if we 
are investigating the truth, saying: "Here these things are before us. 
Let us investigate to determine where and in what form the truth can be 
found." The teacher should not consider himself as learned and others 
ignorant. Such a thought breedeth pride, and pride is not conducive to 
influence. The teacher should not see in himself any superiority; he 
should speak with the utmost kindliness, lowliness and humility, for 
such speech exerteth influence and educateth the souls.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha, Sec 15, p. 30)</p>
<p>	1919. It is at such times that the friends of God avail themselves 
of the occasion, seize the opportunity, rush forth and win the prize. If
 their task is to be confined to good conduct and advice, nothing will 
be accomplished. They must speak out, expound the proofs, set forth 
clear arguments, draw irrefutable conclusions establishing the truth of 
the manifestation of the Sun of Reality.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 212, p. 268)</p>
<p>	1920. When a speaker's brow shineth with the radiance of the love of
 God, at the time of his exposition of a subject, and he is exhilarated 
with the wine of true understanding, he becometh the centre of a potent 
force which like unto a magnet will attract the hearts. This is why the 
expounder must be in the utmost enkindlement.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1921. Speak, therefore; speak out with great courage at every 
meeting. When you are about to begin your address, turn first to 
Baha'u'llah and ask for the confirmations of the Holy Spirit, then open 
your lips and say whatever is suggested to your heart; this, however, 
with the utmost courage, dignity and conviction....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 216 p. 269)</p>
<p>	1922. As to his question about the permissibility of promulgating 
the divine teachings without relating them to the Most Great Name, you 
should answer: "This blessed Name hath an effect on the reality of 
things. If these teachings are spread without identifying them with this
 holy Name, they will fail to exert an abiding influence in the world. 
The teachings are like<br>
 the body, and this holy Name is like the spirit. It imparteth life to 
the body. It causeth the people of the world to be aroused from their 
slumber."</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1923. The teaching work should under all conditions be actively 
pursued by the believers because divine confirmations are dependent upon
 it. Should a Baha'i refrain from being fully, vigorously and 
wholeheartedly involved in the teaching work he will undoubtedly be 
deprived of the blessings of the Abha Kingdom. Even so, this activity 
should be tempered with wisdom - not that wisdom which requireth one to 
be silent and forgetful of such an obligation, but rather that which 
requireth one to display divine tolerance, love, kindness, patience, a 
goodly character, and holy deeds. In brief, encourage the friends 
individually to teach the Cause of God and draw their attention to this 
meaning of wisdom mentioned in the Writings, which is itself the essence
 of teaching the Faith -- but all this to be done with the greatest 
tolerance, so that heavenly assistance and divine confirmation may aid 
the friends.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 213, p. 268)</p>
<p>	1924. The friends of God should weave bonds of fellowship with 
others and show absolute love and affection towards them. These links 
have a deep influence on people and they will listen. When the friends 
sense receptivity to the Word of God, they should deliver the Message 
with wisdom. They must first try and remove any apprehensions in the 
people they teach. In fact, every one of the believers should choose one
 person every year and try to establish ties of friendship with him, so 
that all his fear would disappear. Only then, and gradually, must he 
teach that person. This is the best method.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1925. Follow thou the way of thy Lord, and say not that which the 
ears cannot bear to hear, for such speech is like luscious food given to
 small children. However palatable, rare and rich the food may be, it 
cannot be assimilated by the digestive organs of a suckling child. 
Therefore unto every one who hath a right, let his settled measure be 
given.</p>
<p>	"Not everything that a man knoweth can be disclosed, nor can 
everything that he can disclose be regarded as timely, nor can every 
timely<br>
 utterance be considered as suited to the capacity of those who hear 
it." Such is the consummate wisdom to be observed in thy pursuits. Be 
not oblivious thereof, if thou wishest to be a man of action under all 
conditions. First diagnose the disease and identify the malady, then 
prescribe the remedy, for such is the perfect method of the skilful 
physician.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 214, pp. 268-69)</p>
<p>	1926. Do not argue with anyone, and be wary of disputation. Speak 
out the truth. If your hearer accepteth, the aim is achieved. If he is 
obdurate, you should leave him to himself, and place your trust in God. 
Such is the quality of those who are firm in the Covenant.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1927. In this day every believer must concentrate his thoughts on 
teaching the Faith... O loved ones of God! Each one of the friends must 
teach at least one soul each year. This is everlasting glory. This is 
eternal grace.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Shoghi Effendi and Letters Written on His Behalf:</p>
<p>	1928. First and foremost, one should use every possible means to 
purge one's heart and motives, otherwise, engaging in any form of 
enterprise would be futile. It is also essential to abstain from 
hypocrisy and blind imitation, inasmuch as their foul odour is soon 
detected by every man of understanding and wisdom. Moreover, the friends
 must observe the specific times for the remembrance of God, meditation,
 devotion and prayer, as it is highly unlikely, nay impossible, for any 
enterprise to prosper and develop when deprived of divine bestowals and 
confirmation. One can hardly imagine what a great influence genuine 
love, truthfulness and purity of motives exert on the souls of men. But 
these traits cannot be acquired by any believer unless he makes a daily 
effort to gain them....</p>
<p>	It is primarily through the potency of noble deeds and character, 
rather than by the power of exposition and proofs, that the friends of 
God should demonstrate to the world that what has been promised by God 
is<br>
 bound to happen, that it is already taking place and that the divine glad-tidings are clear, evident and complete....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 December 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of the East- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1929. Having . .. obtained a clear understanding of the true 
character of our mission, the methods to adopt, the course to pursue, 
and having attained sufficiently the individual regeneration -- the 
essential requisite of teaching -- let us arise to teach His Cause with 
righteousness, conviction, understanding and vigor. Let this be the 
paramount and most urgent duty of every Baha'i. Let us make it the 
dominating passion of our life. Let us scatter to the uttermost corners 
of the earth; sacrifice our personal interests, comforts, tastes and 
pleasures; mingle with the divers kindreds and peoples of the world; 
familiarize ourselves with their manners, traditions, thoughts and 
customs; arouse, stimulate and maintain universal interest in the 
Movement, and at the same time endeavor by all the means in our power, 
by concentrated and persistent attention, to enlist the unreserved 
allegiance and the active support of the more hopeful and receptive 
among our hearers. Let us too bear in mind the example which our beloved
 Master has clearly set before us. Wise and tactful in His approach, 
wakeful and attentive in His early intercourse, broad and liberal in all
 His public utterances, cautious and gradual in the unfolding of the 
essential verities of the Cause, passionate in His appeal yet sober in 
argument, confident in tone, unswerving in conviction, dignified in His 
manners -- such were the distinguishing features of our Beloved's noble 
presentation of the Cause of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	("Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932" [rev. ed.], (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), pp. 69-70)</p>
<p>	1930. Having on his own initiative, and undaunted by any hinderances
 with which either friend or foe may, unwittingly or deliberately, 
obstruct his path, resolved to arise and respond to the call of 
teaching, let him carefully consider every avenue of approach which he 
might utilize in his personal attempts to capture the attention, 
maintain the interest, and deepen the faith, of those whom he seeks to 
bring into the fold of his Faith. Let him survey the possibilities which
 the particular circumstances<br>
 in which he lives offer him, evaluate their advantages, and proceed 
intelligently and systematically to utilize them for the achievement of 
the object he has in mind. Let him also attempt to devise such methods 
as association with clubs, exhibitions, and societies, lectures on 
subjects akin to the teachings and ideals of his Cause such as 
temperance, morality, social welfare, religious and racial tolerance, 
economic cooperation, Islam, and Comparative Religion, or participation 
in social, cultural, humanitarian, charitable, and educational 
organizations and enterprises which, while safeguarding the integrity of
 his Faith, will open up to him a multitude of ways and means whereby he
 can enlist successively the sympathy, the support, and ultimately the 
allegiance of those with whom he comes in contact. Let him, while such 
contacts are being made, bear in mind the claims which his Faith is 
constantly making upon him to preserve its dignity, and station, to 
safeguard the integrity of its laws and principles, to demonstrate its 
comprehensiveness and universality, and to defend fearlessly its 
manifold and vital interests. Let him consider the degree of his 
hearer's receptivity, and decide for himself the suitability of either 
the direct or indirect method of teaching, whereby he can impress upon 
the seeker the vital importance of the Divine Message, and persuade him 
to throw in his lot with those who have already embraced it. Let him 
remember the example set by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and His constant admonition to
 shower such kindness upon the seeker, and exemplify to such a degree 
the spirit of the teachings he hopes to instill into him, that the 
recipient will be spontaneously impelled to identify himself with the 
Cause embodying such teachings. Let him refrain, at the outset, from 
insisting on such laws and observances as might impose too severe a 
strain on the seeker's newly awakened faith, and endeavour to nurse him,
 patiently, tactfully, and yet determinedly, into full maturity, and aid
 him to proclaim his unqualified acceptance of whatever has been 
ordained by Baha'u'llah. Let him, as soon as that stage has been 
attained, introduce him to the body of his fellow-believers, and seek, 
through constant fellowship and active participation in the local 
activities of his community, to enable him to contribute his share to 
the enrichment of its life, the furtherance of its tasks, the 
consolidations of its interests, and the coordination of its activities 
with those if its sister communities. Let him not be content until he 
has infused into his spiritual child so deep a longing as to impel him 
to arise independently, in his turn, and devote his energies to the<br>
 quickening of other souls, and the upholding of the laws and principles laid down by his newly adopted Faith.</p>
<p>	("The Advent of Divine Justice", pp. 51-52)</p>
<p>	1931. Every laborer in those fields, whether as traveling teacher or
 settler, should, I feel, make it his chief and constant concern to mix,
 in a friendly manner, with all sections of the population, irrespective
 of class, creed, nationality, or color, to familiarize himself with 
their ideas, tastes, and habits, to study the approach best suited to 
them, to concentrate, patiently and tactfully, on a few who have shown 
marked capacity and receptivity, and to endeavor, with extreme kindness,
 to implant such love, zeal, and devotion in their hearts as to enable 
them to become in turn self-sufficient and independent promoters of the 
Faith in their respective localities....</p>
<p>	("The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 65)</p>
<p>	1932. Nor should any of the pioneers, at this early stage in the 
upbuilding of Baha'i national communities, overlook the fundamental 
prerequisite for any successful teaching enterprise, which is to adapt 
the presentation of the fundamental principles of their Faith to the 
cultural and religious backgrounds, the idealogies, and the temperament 
of the divers races and nations whom they are called upon to enlighten 
and attract. The susceptibilities of these races and nations, from both 
the northern and southern climes, springing from either the Germanic or 
Latin stock, belonging to either the Catholic or Protestant communion, 
some democratic, others totalitarian in outlook, some socialistic, 
others capitalistic in their tendencies, differing widely in their 
customs and standards of living, should at all times be carefully 
considered, and under no circumstances neglected.</p>
<p>	These pioneers, in their contact with the members of divers creeds, 
races and nations, covering a range which offers no parallel in either 
the north or south continents, must neither antagonize them nor 
compromise with their own essential principles. They must be neither 
provocative nor supine, neither fanatical nor excessively liberal, in 
their exposition of the fundamental and distinguishing features of their
 Faith. They must be either wary or bold, they must act swiftly or mark 
time, they must use the direct or indirect method, they must be 
challenging or conciliatory, in strict accordance with the spiritual 
receptivity of the soul<br>
 with whom they come in contact, whether he be a nobleman or a commoner,
 a northerner or a southerner, a layman or a priest, a capitalist or a 
socialist, a statesman or a prince, an artisan or a beggar. In their 
presentation of the Message of Baha'u'llah they must neither hesitate 
nor falter. They must be neither contemptuous of the poor nor timid 
before the great. In their exposition of its verities they must neither 
overstress nor whittle down the truth which they champion, whether their
 hearer belong to royalty, or be a prince of the church, or a 
politician, or a tradesman, or a man of the street. To all alike, high 
or low, rich or poor, they must proffer, with open hands, with a radiant
 heart, with an eloquent tongue, with infinite patience, with 
uncompromising loyalty, with great wisdom, with unshakable courage, the 
Cup of Salvation at so critical an hour, to the confused, the hungry, 
the distraught and fear-stricken multitudes, in the north, in the west, 
in the south and in the heart, of that sorely tried continent.</p>
<p>	("Citadel of Faith: Messages to America 1947-1957" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), pp. 25-26)</p>
<p>	1933. The individual alone must assess its character, consult his 
conscience, prayerfully consider all its aspects, manfully struggle 
against the natural inertia that weighs him down in his effort to arise,
 shed, heroically and irrevocably, the trivial and superfluous 
attachments which hold him back, empty himself of every thought that may
 tend to obstruct his path, mix, in obedience to the counsels of the 
Author of His Faith, and in imitation of the One Who is its true 
Exemplar, with men and women, in all walks of life, seek to touch their 
hearts, through the distinction which characterizes his thoughts, his 
words and his acts, and win them over tactfully, lovingly, prayerfully 
and persistently, to the Faith he himself has espoused.</p>
<p>	("Citadel of Faith: Messages to America 1947-1957", p. 148)</p>
<p>	1934. ...revisit all the centres where you have already sown the 
seed, in order to water the seedlings that have taken root and to sow 
fresh good seed in the prepared ground.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 9 April 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)<br>

</p><p>	1935. Entire and selfless devotion is what is most needful. The 
brighter our torch burns, the more light will it give and the more 
readily will it impart its blaze to others....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 3 May 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1936. Shoghi Effendi feels that he can lay down no rule as to when 
one should introduce the names of the Bab, Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha 
in one's teaching. Much depends on the temperament and aptitude both of 
the teacher and the one taught....</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	We must look to the example of the Master and follow our "Inner 
Light", adapting our message as best we can to the capacity and 
"ripeness" of the one we are seeking to teach.... Man 's spiritual 
digestive powers have similar laws to those that govern physical 
digestion. When people are spiritually hungry and thirsty they must be 
given wholesome and suitable spiritual food, but if we give too much at a
 time or too rich food for the digestive powers, it only causes nausea 
and rejection or malassimilation.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 October 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)</p>
<p>	1937. Although teaching the Cause is the duty of every real Baha'i 
and must be our main aim in life, to obtain the best results extensive 
and organized efforts at teaching must be by the approval and through 
the help and supervision of either the Local or the National Spiritual 
Assemblies. Shoghi Effendi hopes that you will translate your 
earnestness and enthusiasm into real service in close co-operation with 
the friends and the Assemblies.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 31 May 1926 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1938. In spreading the Cause we should be mindful not to lower its 
prestige and also try and get the people whom we approach really 
attracted. Shoghi Effendi has often in his letters mentioned the 
importance of follow-up work. Seeds sown but not watered and reared will
 not mature into fruition.<br>

</p><p>	(From a letter dated 13 August 1928 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1939. Perhaps the reason why you have not accomplished so much in 
the field of teaching is the extent you looked upon your own weaknesses 
and inabilities to spread the message. Baha'u'llah and the Master have 
both urged us repeatedly to disregard our own handicaps and lay our 
whole reliance upon God. He will come to our help if we only arise and 
become an active channel for God's grace. Do you think it is the 
teachers who make converts and change human hearts? No, surely not. They
 are only pure souls who take the first step, and then let the spirit of
 Baha'u'llah move them and make use of them. If any one of them should 
even for a second consider his achievements as due to his own 
capacities, his work is ended and his fall starts. This is in fact the 
reason why so many competent souls have after wonderful services 
suddenly found themselves absolutely impotent and perhaps thrown aside 
by the Spirit of the Cause as useless souls. The criterion is the extent
 to which we are ready to have the will of God operate through us.</p>
<p>	Stop being conscious of your frailties, therefore; have a perfect 
reliance upon God; let your heart burn with the desire to serve His 
mission and proclaim His call; and you will observe how eloquence and 
the power to change human hearts will come as a matter of course.</p>
<p>	Shoghi Effendi will surely pray for your success if you should arise
 and start to teach. In fact the mere act of arising will win for you 
God's help and blessings.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 31 March 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1940. It is on young and active Baha'is, like you, that the Guardian
 centres all his hopes for the future progress and expansion of the 
Cause, and it is on their shoulders that he lays all the responsibility 
for the upkeep of the spirit of selfless service among their 
fellow-believers. Without that spirit no work can be successfully 
achieved. With it triumph, though hardly won, is but inevitable. You 
should, therefore, try all your best to carry aflame within you the 
torch of faith, for through it you will surely find guidance, strength 
and eventual success.<br>

</p><p>	...every one of them is able, in his own measure, to deliver the
 Message ... Everyone is a potential teacher. He has only to use what 
God has given him and thus prove that he is faithful to his trust.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 1 September 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1941. In teaching the Cause, much depends on the personality of the 
teacher and on the method he chooses for presenting the message. 
Different personalities and different classes and types of individuals 
need different methods of approach. And it is the sign of an able 
teacher to know how to best adapt his methods to various types of people
 whom he happens to meet. There is no one method one can follow all 
through. But there should be as many ways of approach as there are types
 of individual seekers. Flexibility and variety of method is, therefore,
 an essential prerequisite for the success of every teaching activity.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 31 May 1934 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1942. There are innumerable ways of teaching the Cause. You can choose the one that suits best your nature and capacity.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 13 November 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1943. A true and adequate knowledge of the Cause is, indeed, 
indispensable to every one who wishes to successfully teach the Message.
 The book of "Gleanings" gives the friends a splendid opportunity to 
acquire this necessary knowledge and understanding. It gives them, in 
addition, that inspiration and spiritual fervour which the reading of 
the Holy Words can alone impart.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 2 December 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1944. What the Guardian feels it of vital importance for the friends
 to do is to teach the Cause directly and by means of imparting the Holy
 Words....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 May 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1945. It is in intellectual circles such as this that the 
believers should endeavour to teach, confident that no matter how 
limited their capacity may be, yet their efforts are continually guided 
and reinforced from on High. This spirit of confident hope, of cheerful 
courage, and of undaunted enthusiasm in itself, irrespective of any 
tangible results which it may procure, can alone ensure the ultimate 
success of our teaching efforts.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 31 October 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1946. ...the upper classes ... need the right type of people to 
approach them, and a method that can suit their mentality. Our teaching 
methods should allow a certain degree of elasticity in establishing 
contacts with various types of individual seekers. Every inquirer has to
 be approached from his own angle. Those who are essentially of the 
mystic type should first be given those teachings of the Cause which 
emphasize the nature and value of spiritual realities; while those who 
are practically minded and of a positive type are naturally more ready 
and inclined to accept the social aspect of the Teachings. But of 
course, gradually the entire Message, in all its aspects and with the 
full implications it entails, should be explained to the newcomer. For 
to be a believer means to accept the Cause in its wholeness, and not to 
adhere to some of its teachings. However, as already stated, this ought 
to be done gradually and tactfully. For conversion is after all a slow 
process.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 December 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1947. Do not feel discourag[ed] if your labours do not always yield 
an abundant fruitage. For a quick and rapidly-won success is not always 
the best and the most lasting. The harder you strive to attain your 
goal, the greater will be the confirmations of Baha'u'llah, and the more
 certain you can feel to attain success. Be cheerful, therefore, and 
exert yourself with full faith and confidence. For Baha'u'llah has 
promised His Divine assistance to everyone who arises with a pure and 
detached heart to spread His holy Word, even though he may be bereft of 
every human knowledge and capacity, and notwithstanding the forces of 
darkness and of opposition which may be arrayed against him. The goal is
 clear, the path<br>
 safe and certain, and the assurances of Baha'u'llah as to the eventual 
success of our efforts quite emphatic. Let us keep firm, and 
whole-heartedly carry on the great work which He has entrusted into our 
hands.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 3 February 1937 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1948. The Baha'i teacher must be all confidence. Therein lies his 
strength and the secret of his success. Though single-handed, and no 
matter how great the apathy of the people around you may be, you should 
have faith that the hosts of the Kingdom are on your side, and that 
through their help you are bound to overcome the forces of darkness that
 are facing the Cause of God. Persevere, be happy and confident, 
therefore.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 June 1937 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1949. ...refrain, under any circumstances, from involving 
yourselves, much less the Cause, in lengthy discussions of a 
controversial character, as these besides being fruitless actually cause
 incalculable harm to the Faith. Baha'u'llah has repeatedly urged us not
 to engage in religious controversies, as the adepts of former religions
 have done. The Baha'i teacher should be concerned above all in 
presenting the Message, in explaining and clarifying all its aspects, 
rather than in attacking other religions. He should avoid all situations
 that, he feels, would lead to strife, to hair-splitting and 
interminable discussions.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 29 November 1937 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1950. The believers ought to give the Message even to those who do 
not seem to be ready for it, because they can never judge the real 
extent to which the Word of God can influence the hearts and minds of 
the people, even those who appear to lack any power of receptivity to 
the Teachings.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 January 1938 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1951. The love we bear mankind, our conviction that Baha'u'llah's 
Faith contains the only and the Divine remedy for all its ills, must be<br>
 demonstrated today in action by bringing the Cause before the public. 
No doubt the majority are not yet able to see its true significance, but
 they must not be deprived, through our failure in obligation, of the 
opportunity of hearing of it. And there are many precious souls who are 
seeking for it and ready to embrace it.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 March 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1952. If the friends always waited until they were fully qualified 
to do any particular task, the work of the Cause would be almost at a 
standstill! But the very act of striving to serve, however unworthy one 
may feel, attracts the blessings of God and enables one to become more 
fitted for the task.</p>
<p>	Today the need is so great on the part of humanity to hear of the 
Divine Message, that the believers must plunge into the work, wherever 
and however they can, heedless of their own shortcomings, but ever 
heedful of the crying need of their fellow-men to hear of the teachings 
in their darkest hour of travail.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 4 May 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1953. The Cause of God has room for all. It would, indeed, not be 
the Cause of God if it did not take in and welcome everyone -- poor and 
rich, educated and ignorant, the unknown, and the prominent -- God 
surely wants them all, as He created them all.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 10 December 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)</p>
<p>	1954. ...no system, for teachers to practise, exists. But obviously 
the more people know about the teachings and the Cause, the better they 
will be able to present the subject. If some people find that prayer and
 placing all their trust in God, releases in them a flood of 
inspiration, they should be left free to pursue this method if it is 
productive of results.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 January 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)<br>

</p><p>	1955. Through example, loving fellowship, prayer, and kindness 
the friends can attract the hearts of such people and enable them to 
realize that this is the Cause of God in deed, not merely words!...</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 24 February 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1956. Unless and until the believers really come to realize they are
 one spiritual family, knit together by a bond more lasting than mere 
physical ties can ever be, they will not be able to create that warm 
community atmosphere which alone can attract the hearts of humanity, 
frozen for lack of real love and feeling.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 May 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1957. Not all of us are capable of serving in the same way, but the 
one way every Baha'i can spread the Faith is by example. This moves the 
hearts of people far more deeply than words ever can.</p>
<p>	The love we show others, the hospitality and understanding, the 
willingness to help them, these are the very best advertisements of the 
Faith....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 October 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1958. By all means persevere and associate in a friendly spirit with
 other groups of young people, particularly of a different race or 
minority nationality, for such association will demonstrate your 
complete conviction of the oneness of mankind and attract others to the 
Faith, both young and old alike.</p>
<p>	A spirit of prejudice-free, loving comradeship with others is what 
will open the eyes of people more than any amount of words. Combined 
with such deeds you can teach the Faith easily.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 June 1945 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of Dayton, Oh)</p>
<p>	1959. ...a sound knowledge of history, including religious history, 
and also of social and economic subjects, is of great help in teaching 
the Cause to intelligent people...<br>

</p><p>	(From a letter dated 4 May 1946 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1960. He feels you should, in teaching, certainly not start with 
such a difficult point as abstinence from wine; but when the person 
wishes to join the Faith he must be told....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 7 April 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)</p>
<p>	1961. All the Baha'is, new and old alike, should devote themselves 
as much as possible to teaching the Faith; they should also realize that
 the atmosphere of true love and unity which they manifest within the 
Baha'i Community will directly affect the public, and be the greatest 
magnet for attracting people to the Faith and confirming them.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 4 April 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Stuttgart, Germany)</p>
<p>	1962. In teaching people, when they begin to seriously study the 
Faith there is no objection to impressing upon them that this message 
involves great spiritual responsibility, and should not be either 
accepted or cast aside lightly. But we must be very gentle, tactful and 
patient, and not administer shocks to people.</p>
<p>	We must always teach constructively, and be very sure that none of 
us, through disagreement among ourselves or indiscretion, cool off the 
souls of the seekers.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 October 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1963. There is no objection to leaving Baha'i Literature in a public
 place as long as it is not overdone and does not savour of 
proselytizing.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 December 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1964. ...it is spirit, determination, faith and devotion which bring
 victories into being, one after another, in Britain, and not luxury and
 leisure....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 29 April 1948 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles)<br>

</p><p>	1965. We should never insist on teaching those who are not 
really ready for the Cause. If a man is not hungry you cannot make him 
eat. Among the Theosophists there are, no doubt, many receptive souls, 
but those who are satisfied should be just associated with in a friendly
 way, but let alone. Once a seeker comes to accept the concept of 
progressive religion, and accepts Baha'u'llah as the Manifestation for 
this day, the reincarnation concept will fade away in the light of 
truth; we should try and avoid controversial issues in the beginning, if
 possible.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 June 1948 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1966. It seems what we need now is a more profound and co-ordinated 
Baha'i scholarship in order to attract such men as you are contacting. 
The world has -- at least the thinking world -- caught up by now with 
all the great and universal principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah over 70
 years ago, and so of course it does not sound "new" to them. But we 
know that the deeper teachings, the capacity of His projected World 
Order to re-create society, are new and dynamic. It is these we must 
learn to present intelligently and enticingly to such men!</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 3 July 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1967. ...we, the few who have caught the vision, should not waste 
our energies beating up and down the paths pursued by humanity, and 
which are not solving its ghastly present-day problems. We should 
concentrate on the Cause, because it is what is needed to cure the 
world....</p>
<p>	If the Baha'is want to be really effective in teaching the Cause 
they need to be much better informed and able to discuss intelligently, 
intellectually, the present condition of the world and its problems.... 
We Baha'is should, in other words, arm our minds with knowledge in order
 to better demonstrate to, especially, the educated classes, the truths 
enshrined in our Faith....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 July 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1968. Teaching individually is of great importance, and often 
enables you to confirm people, whereas public speaking, while it carries
 the Message to more people, does not confirm very many. You can do 
both.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 August 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1969. ...when we put our trust in Him, Baha'u'llah solves our problems and opens the way.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 October 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1970. To find these receptive souls and teach them, with tact and 
understanding, is the duty and privilege of every single Baha'i.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 October 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1971. Without the spirit of real love for Baha'u'llah, for His Faith
 and its Institutions, and the believers for each other, the Cause can 
never really bring in large numbers of people. For it is not preaching 
and rules the world wants, but love and action.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 October 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1972. Just one mature soul, with spiritual understanding and a 
profound knowledge of the Faith, can set a whole country ablaze -- so 
great is the power of the Cause to work through a pure and selfless 
channel.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 November 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1973. As we have such wonderful prayers and meditations in our 
writings, the reading of these with friends who are interested in and 
crave for this type of small meeting is often a step towards attracting 
them to the Faith. Perhaps you could start such an activity in your 
city.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 4 February 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1974. The believers are entirely free to hold as many little 
teaching groups or Firesides as they please in their own homes... In 
fact this personal, informal, home teaching is perhaps the most 
productive of results.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 24 February 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1975. ...make a special point of praying ardently not only for 
success in general, but that God may send to you the souls that are 
ready. There are such souls in every city...</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 March 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Punta Arenas)</p>
<p>	1976. The people of the world are submerged in an atmosphere which 
is the very antithesis, morally, of the Baha'i atmosphere; we must teach
 them. If we are too strict in the beginning most -- not all -- types 
will be rebuffed and veer away from what they might otherwise be led to 
accept. On the other hand, we don't want Baha'is who do not seriously 
try to live up to the teachings -- we must therefore use great tact and 
challenge strong souls and lead weak souls.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 7 August 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1977. At all times we must look at the greatness of the Cause, and 
remember that Baha'u'llah will assist all who arise in His service. When
 we look at ourselves, we are sure to feel discouraged by our 
shortcomings and insignificance!</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 December 1950 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1978. The excellent work you are doing in the teaching field, he 
appreciates very deeply and wishes you to persevere and go on teaching 
people of importance. Even if they are not always good prospects as far 
as being converted to the Faith goes, it is very necessary that they 
should hear of it and be made friendly towards it.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 10 February 1951 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1979. Although it is good not to provoke conventional people too
 much, on the other hand, we must not allow them to come between us and 
obeying Baha'u'llah; and we know that He has instructed His servants to 
spread His Message....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 1 May 1951 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1980. ...whilst actively teaching, the friends must themselves be 
taught and deepened in the spirit of the Faith, which brings love and 
unity.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 July 1951 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1981. These people, finding the Baha'is sincerely lacking in either 
prejudice -- or that even worse attitude, condescension -- might not 
only take interest in our Teachings, but also help us to reach their 
people in the proper way.</p>
<p>	It is a great mistake to believe that because people are illiterate 
or live primitive lives, they are lacking in either intelligence or 
sensibility. On the contrary, they may well look on us, with the evils 
of our civilization, with its moral corruption, its ruinous wars, its 
hypocrisy and conceit, as people who merit watching with both suspicion 
and contempt. We should meet them as equals, well-wishers, people who 
admire and respect their ancient descent, and who feel that they will be
 interested, as we are, in a living religion and not in the dead forms 
of present-day churches.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 September 1951 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the Comite Nacional de ensenanza Baha'i para los indigenas)</p>
<p>	1982. Teaching is of course the head corner-stone of all Baha'i 
service, but successful teaching is dependent upon many factors, one of 
which is the development of a true Baha'i way of living and the 
fulfilment of responsibilities which we have incurred.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 3 June 1952 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1983. It should not be overlooked, however, that the most powerful 
and effective teaching medium that has been found so far is the fireside
 meeting, because in the fireside meeting, intimate personal questions 
can<br>
 be answered, and the student find the spirit of the Faith more abundant there.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 December 1952 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to a Local Spiritual Assembly and an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Today, as never before, the magnet which attracts the blessings from
 on high is teaching the Faith of God. The Hosts of Heaven are poised 
between heaven and earth, just waiting, and patiently, for the Baha'i to
 step forth, with pure devotion and consecration, to teach the Cause of 
God, so they may rush to his aid and assistance. It is the Guardian's 
prayer that the Friends may treble their efforts, as the time is short 
-- alas, the workers too few. Let those who wish to achieve immortality 
step forth and raise the Divine Call. They will be astonished at the 
spiritual victories they will gain.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 March 1953 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1984. What is needed to achieve success in the teaching field is a 
complete dedication on the part of the individual, consecration to the 
glorious task of spreading the Faith, and the living of the Baha'i life,
 because that creates the magnet for the Holy Spirit, and it is the Holy
 Spirit which quickens the new soul. Thus the individual should be as a 
reed, through which the Holy Spirit may flow, to give new life to the 
seeking soul.</p>
<p>	One should search out those who are receptive to the Faith, and then concentrate on these persons in their teaching.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 December 1953 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1985. The peoples generally are seeking the light of Divine 
Guidance. The problems of the world have awakened the populace. It only 
remains for the Baha'is to raise the Call and give the Message according
 to the high standards enunciated by the beloved Master. The world can 
become alive with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, if the Baha'is fulfil 
their sacred obligation.</p>
<p>	In pioneering fields, and on the home front, the friends must arise 
with the same spirit of dedication and consecration which animated the 
original pioneers. If they do, they will be astonished at the great 
results they will achieve.<br>

</p><p>	Setting aside all the shibboleths of present-day living, leaving
 behind the false standards of those endeavouring to solve the world's 
problems by weak platitudes, and demonstrating the new Baha'i way of 
dynamic spiritual living, let them, relying on the guidance of the Holy 
Spirit, arise to spread the Water of Life over America. This will 
produce the results which the cries of humanity today require. Where are
 the spiritual souls who will now seize their opportunity, and achieve 
immortal glory in the service of the Faith!</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 April 1954 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	1986. As you interest different ones in the Faith, you must be very 
cautious, and gradually lead them into the Light of Divine Guidance, 
especially the practices of Baha'i living. Thus you should not be 
dogmatic about any of the secondary practices of the Faith....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 June 1954 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1987. The Guardian feels that the most effective way for the Baha'is
 to teach the Faith is to make strong friends with their neighbours and 
associates. When the friends have confidence in the Baha'is and the 
Baha'is in their friends, they should give the Message and teach the 
Cause. Individual teaching of this type is more effective than any other
 type.</p>
<p>	The principle of the fireside meeting, which was established in 
order to permit and encourage the individual to teach in his own home, 
has been proven the most effective instrument for spreading the 
Faith....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 27 December 1954 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1988. It is better to have one Baha'i who understands the Teachings 
and is wholeheartedly convinced of their truth, than a number of 
Baha'is, who are not well aware of the Cause, and deep-rooted in the 
Covenant.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 January 1955 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1989. Consecration, dedication and enthusiastic service is the 
Keynote to successful teaching. One must become like a reed through 
which the Holy Spirit descends to reach the student of the Faith.</p>
<p>	We give the Message, and explain the Teachings, but it is the Holy Spirit that quickens and confirms.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 16 February 1955 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1990. The Guardian thinks perhaps a different approach to the 
aborigines might attract them; one of being interested in their lives 
and their folklore, and of trying to become their friend, rather than 
trying to change them or improve them.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 9 April 1955 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1991. The Baha'is must realize that the success of this work depends
 upon the individual. The individual must arise as never before to 
proclaim the Faith of Baha'u'llah. The most effective way for them to 
carry on their work is for the individual to make many contacts, select a
 few who they feel would become Baha'is, develop a close friendship with
 them, then complete confidence, and finally teach them the Faith, until
 they become strong supporters of the Cause of God.</p>
<p>	(Prom a letter dated 13 May 1955 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	1992. The all-important thing of course is that every activity ... 
is for the purpose of teaching the Faith and confirming people. 
Therefore you and the other Baha'is should watch the situation very 
closely. You should study those who attend the meetings, and when you 
find one who you feel would become a strong and active Baha'i, then you 
should concentrate on teaching him. Thus, if you are able to confirm 
some souls, you will have rendered distinguished and outstanding 
service. Actually this is the goal of all such activities in all of the 
universities.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 1 June 1955 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1993. The Hosts of the Supreme Concourse are in martial array, 
poised between Earth and Heaven ready to rush to the assistance of those
 who arise to Teach the Faith. If one seeks the confirmation of the Holy
 Spirit, one can find it in rich abundance in the Teaching Field. The 
world is seeking as never before, and if the Friends will arise with new
 determination, fully consecrated to the noble task ahead of them, 
victory after victory will be won for the Glorious Faith of God.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 2 February 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1994. The greatest glory and honor which can come to an individual 
is to bring the light of guidance to some new soul. The quickening power
 of the Holy Spirit, which has come into the world through Baha'u'llah, 
is the source of immortal life; and those who are quickened by this 
spirit in this world will find themselves in great honor and glory in 
the next world. The most meritorious service which anyone could render 
is to bring the light of divine guidance and the quickening power of the
 spirit to an entirely new area. Humanity is crying for salvation; and 
it is only by the Baha'is going into the various areas of the world, 
that it can be brought to them. This is the reason the Guardian has 
encouraged all of the friends to disperse to new territories, for this 
is the hour for the quickening of the world.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 March 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'i Community of Tacoma, US)</p>
<p>	1995. The need of the Hour is Teaching on the Home Front. Its goals 
can be won, by a new spirit of dedication and consecration on the part 
of the friends, each in his own country, in his own home.... Never must 
they let a day pass without teaching some soul, trusting to Baha'u'llah 
that the seed will grow. The friends should seek pure souls, gain their 
confidence, and then teach that person carefully until he becomes a 
Baha'i, and then nurture him until he becomes a firm and active 
supporter of the Faith.</p>
<p>	Everyone must remember that it is the "Holy Spirit that quickens" 
and therefore the teacher must become like a reed through which the Holy
 Spirit may reach the seeking soul.</p>
<p>	The beloved Guardian has stressed over and over again, that to 
effectively teach the Faith, the individual must study deeply, the 
Divine<br>
 Word, imbibe Its life-giving waters, and feast upon Its glorious 
teachings. He should then meditate on the import of the Word, and 
finding its spiritual depths, pray for guidance and assistance. But most
 important, after prayer is action. After one has prayed and meditated, 
he must arise, relying fully on the guidance and confirmation of 
Baha'u'llah, to teach His Faith. Perseverance in action is essential, 
just as wisdom and audacity are necessary for effective teaching. The 
individual must sacrifice all things to this great goal, and then the 
victories will be won.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 May 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Hands of the Cause in the United States)</p>
<p>	1996. The spirit of the hour is teaching on the Home Fronts. Its 
goal can only be won by a new spirit of dedication and consecration on 
the part of the friends at home. Miraculous victories are being won, in 
the difficult virgin areas, because the pioneers have consecrated their 
lives to the Noble Mission they have embarked upon. The Friends at home 
must display this same consecration and dedication. Never must they let a
 day pass, without teaching some soul, hoping that Baha'u'llah will 
cause each seed to grow. The Friends should seek pure souls, gain their 
confidence and then teach that person carefully until he becomes a 
Baha'i -- and then nurture him until he becomes a firm and active 
supporter of the Faith.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 15 June 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of Lafayette, In)</p>
<p>	1997. He hopes you will be guided and confirmed in your work, so 
many souls may find eternal life, through your selfless services. It is 
important that you make contact with pure hearted individuals, gain 
their confidence, they gain confidence in you, and then gradually teach 
them. It is better to concentrate on a few, rather than attempt to teach
 too many at a time. Consecration, devotion, dedication, humility are 
essential, that the Holy Spirit may use you as a reed for the diffusion 
of Its creative rays.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 15 July 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1998. The Guardian feels that, if the friends would meditate a 
little more objectively upon both their relationship to the Cause and 
the vast<br>
 non-Baha'i public they hope to influence, they would see things more 
clearly.... He fully realizes that the demands made upon the Baha'is are
 great, and that they often feel inadequate, tired and perhaps 
frightened in the face of the tasks that confront them. This is only 
natural. On the other hand, they must realize that the power of God can 
and will assist them; and that because they are privileged to have 
accepted the Manifestation of God for this Day, this very act has placed
 upon them a great moral responsibility toward their fellow-men. It is 
this moral responsibility to which the Guardian is constantly calling 
their attention...</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 July 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	1999. The friends must certainly explore new channels and have more 
audacity, if they are to get anywhere in adding to their numbers.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 October 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2000. The most effective method of teaching is the Fireside group, 
where new people can be shown Baha'i hospitality, and ask all questions 
which bother them. They can feel there the true Baha'i spirit -- and it 
is the spirit that quickeneth.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 October 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2001. He feels that to distribute Baha'i pamphlets from door to door
 ... is undignified and might create a bad impression of the Faith....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 October 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)</p>
<p>	2002. We must be careful not to teach in a fanatical way. We should 
teach as the Master taught. He was the perfect Exemplar of the 
Teachings. He proclaimed the universal truths, and, through love and 
wise demonstration of the universal verities of the Faith, attracted the
 hearts and the minds.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 October 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	2003. The Master assured us that when we forget ourselves, and 
strive with all our powers to serve and teach the Faith, we receive 
divine assistance. It is not we who do the work, but we are the 
instruments used at that time for the purpose of teaching His Cause.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 November 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2004. The Teaching of the Faith is dependent on the individual and 
his effort. When the individual arise with enthusiasm, with full 
dedication and consecration, and allows nothing to deter him; then 
results will be achieved....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 December 1956 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the Baha'is assembled at the Indiana State Convention)</p>
<p>	2005. The Guardian hopes the Friends ... will display the loving 
spirit of the Master in their contacts, and then win those souls to the 
Faith. The fireside method of teaching seems to produce the greatest 
results, when each one invites friends into their homes once in nineteen
 days, and introduces them to the Faith. Close association and loving 
service affects the hearts; and when the heart is affected, then the 
spirit can enter. It is the Holy Spirit that quickens, and the Friends 
must become channels for its diffusion.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 27 January 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2006. The Guardian was very happy to receive the news of the sudden 
spurt in the number of Friends joining the Faith. It demonstrates that 
one must persevere until the very end, if success is to be achieved....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 April 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2007. ...the world is being shaken to its foundations and the people
 are seeking. If the Baha'is will arise as never before to teach the 
Cause they will find many listeners and many will find eternal life 
through their sacrificial efforts.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 May 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)<br>

</p><p>	2008. Divine Truth is relative and that is why we are enjoined 
to constantly refer the seeker to the Word itself -- and why any 
explanations we make to ease the journey of the soul of any individual 
must be based on the Word -- and the Word alone.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 4 June 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)</p>
<p>	2009. The believers must be encouraged to teach individually in 
their own homes. Baha'u'llah has enjoined upon the Baha'is the sacred 
obligation of teaching. We have no priests, therefore the service once 
rendered by priests to their religions is the service every single 
Baha'i is expected to render individually to his religion. He must be 
the one who enlightens new souls, confirms them, heals the wounded and 
the weary upon the road of life, and gives them to quaff from the 
chalice of everlasting life the knowledge of the Manifestation of God in
 His Day.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 July 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Benelux countries)</p>
<p>	2010. The Beloved Guardian directs me to inform you that you should 
not weary in well doing. He knows you must become discouraged at times 
when hardness of the hearts of the local people does not permit the 
budding of the seeds which you are so diligently sowing. However, he 
assures you that all of the seeds that are sown will ultimately reap 
their fruit. . .</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 7 August 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2011. Teaching is the source of Divine Confirmation. It is not 
sufficient to pray diligently for guidance, but this prayer must be 
followed by meditation as to the best methods of action and then action 
itself Even if the action should not immediately produce results, or 
perhaps not be entirely correct, that does not make so much difference, 
because prayers can only be answered through action and if someone's 
action is wrong, God can use that method of showing the pathway which is
 right....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 August 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	2012. It is not enough for the friends to make the excuse that 
their best teachers and their exemplary believers have arisen and 
answered the call to pioneer. A "best teacher" and an "exemplary 
believer" is ultimately neither more nor less than an ordinary Baha'i 
who has consecrated himself to the work of the Faith, deepened his 
knowledge and understanding of its Teachings, placed his confidence in 
Baha'u'llah, and arisen to serve Him to the best of his ability. This 
door is one which we are assured will open before the face of every 
follower of the Faith who knocks hard enough, so to speak. When the will
 and the desire are strong enough, the means will be found and the way 
opened either to do more work locally, to go to a new goal town ... or 
to enter the foreign pioneer field....</p>
<p>	The Baha'is are the leaven of God, which must leaven the lump of 
their nation. In direct ratio to their success will be the protection 
vouchsafed, not only to them but to their country. These are the 
immutable laws of God, from which there is no escape: "For unto 
whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required."</p>

Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>

</p><p>	TRUSTWORTHINESS: A CARDINAL BAHA'I VIRTUE</p>
<p>	January 1987</p>
<p>	Compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	Extracts from the writings of Baha'u'llah: 2013. O people! The 
goodliest vesture in the sight of God in this day is trustworthiness. 
All bounty and honour shall be the portion of the soul that arrayeth 
itself with this greatest of adornments.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from Persian)</p>
<p>	2014. Regard thou faith as a tree. Its fruits, leaves, boughs and 
branches are, and have ever been, trustworthiness, truthfulness, 
uprightness and forbearance.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2015. The virtues and attributes pertaining unto God are all evident
 and manifest, and have been mentioned and described in all the heavenly
 Books. Among them are trustworthiness, truthfulness, purity of heart 
while communing with God, forbearance, resignation to whatever the 
Almighty hath decreed, contentment with the things His Will hath 
provided, patience, nay, thankfulness in the midst of tribulation, and 
complete reliance, in all circumstances, upon Him. These rank, according
 to the estimate of God, among the highest and most laudable of all 
acts. All other acts are, and will ever remain, secondary and 
subordinate unto them....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), sec. 134, p. 290)</p>
<p>	2016. Beautify your tongues, O people, with truthfulness, and adorn 
your souls with the ornament of honesty. Beware, O people, that ye deal 
not treacherously with any one. Be ye the trustees of God amongst His 
creatures, and the emblems of His generosity amidst His people. They 
that follow their lusts and corrupt inclinations, have erred and 
dissipated their efforts. They, indeed, are of the lost....<br>

</p><p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 136, p. 297)</p>
<p>	2017. The purpose of the one true God in manifesting Himself is to 
summon all mankind to truthfulness and sincerity, to piety and 
trustworthiness, to resignation and submissiveness to the Will of God, 
to forbearance and kindliness, to uprightness and wisdom. His object is 
to array every man with the mantle of a saintly character, and to adorn 
him with the ornament of holy and goodly deeds.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 137, p. 299)</p>
<p>	2018. Say: Let truthfulness and courtesy be your adorning. Suffer 
not yourselves to be deprived of the robe of forbearance and justice, 
that the sweet savors of holiness may be wafted from your hearts upon 
all created things. Say: Beware, O people of Baha, lest ye walk in the 
ways of them whose words differ from their deeds. Strive that ye may be 
enabled to manifest to the peoples of the earth the signs of God, and to
 mirror forth His commandments....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 139, p. 305)</p>
<p>	2019. We ask God, exalted be His glory, to confirm each one of the 
friends in that land in the acquisition of such praiseworthy 
characteristics as shall conduce to the spread of justice and equity 
among the peoples of the world. The first, the fundamental purpose 
underlying creation hath ever been, and will continue to be, none other 
than the appearance of trustworthiness and godliness, of sincerity and 
goodwill amongst mankind, for these qualities are the cause of peace, 
security and tranquillity. Blessed are those who possess such virtues.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2020. I beseech Thee, O my God, by all the transcendent glory of Thy
 Name, to clothe Thy loved ones in the robe of justice and to illumine 
their beings with the light of trustworthiness. Thou art the One Who 
hath power to do as He pleaseth and Who holdeth within His grasp the 
reins of all things, visible and invisible.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)<br>

</p><p>	2021. Say: O people of God! Adorn your temples with the 
adornment of trust- worthiness and piety. Help, then, your Lord with the
 hosts of goodly deeds and a praiseworthy character....</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988), p. 120)</p>
<p>	2022. One day of days We repaired unto Our Green Island. Upon Our 
arrival, We beheld its streams flowing, and its trees luxuriant, and the
 sunlight playing in their midst. Turning Our face to the right, We 
beheld what the pen is powerless to describe; nor can it set forth that 
which the eye of the Lord of Mankind witnessed in that most sanctified, 
that most sublime, that blest, and most exalted Spot. Turning, then, to 
the left We gazed on one of the Beauties of the Most Sublime Paradise, 
standing on a pillar of light, and calling aloud saying: 'O inmates of 
earth and heaven! Behold ye My beauty, and My radiance, and My 
revelation, and My effulgence. By God, the True One! I am 
Trustworthiness and the revelation thereof, and the beauty thereof. I 
will recompense whosoever will cleave unto Me, and recognize My rank and
 station, and hold fast unto My hem. I am the most great ornament of the
 people of Baha, and the vesture of glory unto all who are in the 
kingdom of creation. I am the supreme instrument for the prosperity of 
the world, and the horizon of assurance unto all beings.' Thus have We 
sent down for thee that which will draw men nigh unto the Lord of 
creation.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 122)</p>
<p>	2023. The fourth Taraz concerneth trustworthiness. Verily it is the 
door of security for all that dwell on earth and a token of glory on the
 part of the All-Merciful. He who partaketh thereof hath indeed partaken
 of the treasures of wealth and prosperity. Trustworthiness is the 
greatest portal leading unto the tranquillity and security of the 
people. In truth the stability of every affair hath depended and doth 
depend upon it. All the domains of power, of grandeur and of wealth are 
illumined by its light.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 37)</p>
<p>	2024. Were a man in this day to adorn himself with the raiment of 
trustworthiness it were better for him in the sight of God than that he 
should journey on foot towards the holy court and be blessed with<br>
 meeting the Adored One and standing before His Seat of Glory. 
Trustworthiness is as a stronghold to the city of humanity, and as eyes 
to the human temple. Whosoever remaineth deprived thereof shall, before 
His Throne, be reckoned as one bereft of vision.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2025. We call to remembrance every one of the friends and exhort 
them to have regard to trustworthiness, which is a charge that God hath 
entrusted to the safe-keeping of His servants; to righteousness, which 
He hath made to be a citadel of strength for His well-favoured ones and 
faithful, humble servants; and to whatever virtues shall conduce to 
their dignity and honour among all peoples.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	2026. O ye friends of God in His cities and His loved ones in His 
lands! This Wronged One enjoineth on you honesty and piety. Blessed the 
city that shineth by their light. Through them man is exalted, and the 
door of security is unlocked before the face of all creation. Happy the 
man that cleaveth fast unto them, and recognizeth their virtue, and woe 
betide him that denieth their station.</p>
<p>	("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988), p. 23)</p>
<p>	2027. Be ye God's manifestations of trustworthiness in every land. 
So perfectly should ye mirror forth this quality that even were ye to 
travel through cities heaped with gold, your gaze would not for a single
 moment be seduced by its allure. This is the standard required of you, O
 assemblage of true believers. Assist ye your gracious Lord with your 
wealth and substance so that in all the worlds of God His servants may 
perceive from you the sweet savours of the one true God.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	2028. He is the true servant of God who, in this day, were he to 
pass through cities of silver and gold, would not deign to look upon 
them, and whose heart would remain pure and undefiled from whatever 
things can be seen in this world, be they its goods or its treasures. I 
swear by the Sun of Truth! The breath of such a man is endowed with 
potency, and his words with attraction ....<br>

</p><p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 23)</p>
<p>	2029. Say: O bearer of My Name! Upon thee be My glory and My 
loving-kindness. Thou hast ever been adorned with the fair robe of 
trustworthiness and piety. These twin qualities are as two companions 
for thee in whom thou mayest find solace. They are as two sentinels who 
shall stand watch over thee, and two guardians that shall, by God's 
leave, keep thee from harm.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2030. Cleave ye to the hem of the raiment of virtue and keep fast 
hold of the cord of piety and trustworthiness. Have regard to the good 
of the world and not to your own selfish desires. O peoples of God! Ye 
are the shepherds of the world. Keep ye your flocks unbesmirched by the 
mire of evil passion and desire, and adorn each one with the ornament of
 the fear of God. This is the firm command that hath issued forth in 
this day from the pen of the Ever-Abiding. I swear by the righteousness 
of God! The sword of upright conduct and a goodly character is sharper 
than blades of steel.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	2031. We ask God graciously to grant that all may evince such 
fairness of character, such goodliness of deed and kindliness of word as
 will meet with His good pleasure. It hath been decreed that the 
citadels of men's hearts should be subdued through the hosts of a noble 
character and praiseworthy deeds. Contention, discord, strife and 
sedition have all been forbidden in the Book of God. Beseech the Lord 
that He deprive not His dominions of the effulgent light of the sun of 
trustworthiness, nor deny them the radiance of the Day-Star of 
truthfulness or the splendour of the orb of justice and equity. 
Trustworthiness and piety are even as two luminaries shining resplendent
 above the horizon of the heaven of the Tablet in which are inscribed 
the ordinances of God. Well is it with them that have discerned them, 
and woe betide the heedless!</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)<br>

</p><p>	2032. We have counselled all people, in the most clear and 
eloquent language, to adorn their characters with trustworthiness and 
godliness, and with such qualities as are conducive to the elevation of 
man's station in the world of being. This Wronged One testifieth that 
the purpose for which mortal men have, from utter nothingness, stepped 
into the realm of being, is that they may work for the betterment of the
 world and live together in concord and harmony. Dissension and strife 
have always been, and shall remain, rejected by God. The Books, the 
Scriptures and Holy Writings of previous ages have all proclaimed the 
joyful tidings that the purpose underlying this most mighty Revelation 
is none other than the rehabilitation of the world and its nations; that
 perchance the power of utterance may prevail over the power of arms, 
and the world's affairs be administered through the potency of love. We 
ask God, the True One, to invest all with the mantle of trustworthiness,
 for that is the world's comeliest garment.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2033. Cleave thou to the fear of God and to whatsoever hath been 
revealed in His Book: thus biddeth thee He Who is the Word of Truth and 
the Knower of things unseen. Say: trustworthiness is the sun of the 
heaven of My commandments, truthfulness is its moon, and praiseworthy 
attributes are its stars. Yet the people, for the most part, understand 
not.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	2034. We send Our greetings to the faithful followers of the one 
true God, who have tasted of the sweet waters of loving-kindness and 
directed their gaze toward the Realm of Glory. We enjoin upon them all 
to conduct themselves with trustworthiness and rectitude and to lead 
chaste and virtuous lives.</p>
<p>	O beloved friends! Whoever adorneth his character with such virtues 
will be reckoned among the true servants of God, and his name will be 
commemorated by the Concourse on High; but he who depriveth himself 
thereof shall not be accounted of their number. Strive diligently to 
acquire such goodly qualities and traits of character as will be the 
cause of everlasting salvation. Make not the fruits of the tree of 
trustworthiness targets for the stones of treachery, nor rend its boughs
 asunder with the<br>
 instruments of tyranny and oppression. Truthfulness and sincerity have 
always been the ornament of a man's character, and so they shall ever 
be. O friends! Let not the deceptive glamour of this fleeting world -- 
to whose impermanence all things attest -- cut you off from God's 
enduring bestowals, nor deprive you from partaking of the spiritual 
sustenance that He hath sent down from the heaven of His bounty. Keep 
your gaze centred on Him Who is the Sovereign Word of Truth: place your 
whole reliance upon Him, and beg of Him to destine for you what is meet 
and fitting. Resign your affairs into the hands of God, the Lord of 
creation. Call ye to mind the people of former ages: whither are they 
sped, the prideful and vainglorious, the workers of iniquity and 
unrighteousness?</p>
<p>	Where are their hoards of treasure, their palaces, citadels and 
thrones? Reflect upon those bygone days, and the vicissitudes of which 
they tell, and be ye admonished thereby. The prayer of this Wronged One 
is that God may assist all to do what shall meet with His favour and 
acceptance.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2035. Thou art most dear to Us; and, as We love thee, so love We all
 in whom may be perceived the goodly adornments of trustworthiness and 
uprightness, and such qualities of virtue and integrity as have been 
enjoined upon men in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. 
Happy the lot of the soul that hath perceived the fragrant breaths of 
divine utterance, and given ear to what hath been revealed by God, the 
Omniscient, the All-Informed. God hath, verily, willed that His Cause 
should be assisted by the hosts of goodly deeds and a righteous 
character. Blessed, then, be the man that apprehendeth this truth and 
acteth conformably; and woe betide those who ignore or deny it!</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	2036. We send our greetings to the friends and exhort them to 
conduct themselves with rectitude, trustworthiness, piety, virtue and 
loving-kindness -- with all those qualities, in fine, that will serve to
 bring forth man's true station in the world of being. He Who is the 
Eternal Truth, exalted be His glory, hath ever loved faithfulness. Well 
is it with him who adorneth his temple with its raiment, and is honoured
 by this greatest of distinctions.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	2037. Trustworthiness, wisdom and honesty are, of a truth, God's
 beauteous adornments for His creatures. These fair garments are a 
befitting vesture for every temple. Happy are those that comprehend, and
 well is it with them that acquire such virtues.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	2038. Cleave ye at all times to the cord of trustworthiness and hold
 fast the hem of the garment of truthfulness: thus biddeth you He Who is
 the Truthful, the Trusted One. God is my witness, trustworthiness is a 
light that shineth refulgently from the heavens, and leadeth to the 
exaltation of the Cause of God, the Omnipotent, the Incomparable, the 
All-Praised. Whoso hath remained faithful to the Covenant hath been 
steadfast in his adherence to trustworthiness, whilst those who have 
repudiated it have erred grievously.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	2039. It behoveth ye all so to adorn your inner and outer beings 
that, robed in trustworthiness, girt with righteousness and arrayed in 
truthfulness and rectitude, ye may become a means for the exaltation of 
the Cause and the education of the human race.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2040. The companions of God are, in this day, the lump that must 
leaven the peoples of the world. They must show forth such 
trustworthiness, such truthfulness and perseverance, such deeds and 
character that all mankind may profit by their example....</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 23)</p>
<p>	2041. They who dwell within the Tabernacle of God, and are 
established upon the seats of everlasting glory, will refuse, though 
they be dying of hunger, to stretch their hands, and seize unlawfully 
the property of their neighbour, however vile and worthless he may be. 
The purpose of the one true God in manifesting Himself is to summon all 
mankind to truthfulness and sincerity, to piety and trustworthiness, to 
resignation and submissiveness to the will of God, to forbearance and 
kindliness, to uprightness and wisdom. His object is to array every man 
with the mantle of a saintly character, and to adorn him with the 
ornament of holy and goodly deeds....</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 24)<br>

</p><p>	2042. O My loved ones! We charge you to conduct yourselves with 
trustworthiness and rectitude, that through you the attributes of your 
Lord may be manifested to His servants and the evidences of His exalted 
holiness may appear in every land. He is, verily, the Ordainer, the 
Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	2043. I counsel you, O friends of God, to comport yourselves with 
the utmost trustworthiness in your dealings with my servants and people.
 By its aid shall the Cause of God be promoted throughout the world and 
its exalted sanctity become manifest to all creation. Be ye the 
repositories of the trust of all men. Thus have We commanded them in the
 Tablets. Thy Lord is, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	2044. O friends of God in every land! This Wronged One adjureth you 
by the Best-Beloved of the world, Who is calling aloud in the Kingdom of
 Utterance, that ye deal not faithlessly with the substance of your 
fellow men. Be ye the trustees of God in His dominions and the 
embodiments of truthfulness throughout His realms. Blessed the man that 
heedeth the counsels of God and observeth His precepts.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	2045. We have enjoined upon all to become engaged in some trade or 
profession, and have accounted such occupation to be an act of worship. 
Before all else, however, thou shouldst receive, as a sign of God's 
acceptance, the mantle of trustworthiness from the hands of divine 
favour; for trustworthiness is the chief means of attracting 
confirmation and prosperity. We entreat God to make of it a radiant and 
mercifully showering rain-cloud that shall bring success and blessings 
to thy affairs. He of a truth is the All-Bountiful, the Gracious.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	2046. Commerce is as a heaven, whose sun is trustworthiness and 
whose moon is truthfulness. The most precious of all things in the 
estimation of Him Who is the Sovereign Truth is trustworthiness: thus 
hath it been<br>
 recorded in the sacred Scroll of God. Entreat ye the one true God to 
enable all mankind to attain to this most noble and lofty station.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	2047. In connection with the demands for payment of which thou hast 
written in thy letter, it is manifestly clear that anyone who hath the 
ability to settle his debts, and yet neglecteth to do so, hath not acted
 in accordance with the good pleasure of the one true God. Those who 
incur debts should strive to settle them with all diligence and 
application. God's binding commandments with respect to trustworthiness,
 uprightness and the honouring of rights have been recorded in clear and
 perspicuous language in all the sacred Books, Tablets, Scriptures and 
holy Writings. Well is it with him whom the fleeting vanities of the 
world have not deprived of a lasting adornment, and whom avarice and 
negligence have not shut out from the illumination of the sun of 
trustworthiness. These matters, however, depend on the existence of 
ability, for the making of a demand is contingent upon ability to meet 
it. By the Lord of the Book, the former is not permissible in the 
absence of the latter. To this testifieth the Verse: "Respite thy debtor
 till he findeth means to pay."[1]<br>
 [1 Qur'an 2:280]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	2048. In most of Our Tablets We have counselled the servants of God 
to be trustworthy and righteous, just and fair-minded. We have commanded
 them to eschew iniquity and evil and bidden them practise piety and the
 fear of God. The heedless, however, have been led only into 
ever-increasing loss. Truly, had God's creatures but conformed their 
actions to the will and pleasure of God, exalted be His glory, the whole
 earth would by now be seen as a single country, a blessed land of 
beauty and light.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	2049. Say: desist from wickedness and transgression, and lay hold on
 trustworthiness and piety, candour and sincerity. This is the 
commandment of God, the Lord of the Judgement Day. He Whom the world 
hath wronged speaketh not through the promptings of worldly<br>
 desire, but in accordance with what hath been revealed in the Book of 
God, the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days. Righteousness of character is 
the means whereby the high stations attainable by man in the world of 
being may be made evident: to this testify God's honoured servants, whom
 the evil whisperings of the people have not deterred from arising to 
render service to their Lord, the King of the Mighty Throne.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>2050.        Be thou of the people of hell-fire,<br>
                      but be not a hypocrite.</p>
<p>                 Be thou an unbeliever,<br>
                     but be not a plotter.</p>
<p>             Make thy home in taverns,<br>
                     but tread not the path<br>
                     of the mischief-maker.</p>
<p>             Fear thou God,<br>
                     but not the priest.</p>
<p>             Give to the executioner thy head,<br>
                     but not thy heart.</p>
<p>             Let thine abode be under the stone,<br>
                     but seek not the shelter of the cleric.</p>
<p>	Thus doth the Holy Reed intone its melodies, and the Nightingale of 
Paradise warble its song, so that He may infuse life eternal into the 
mortal frames of men, impart to the temples of dust the essence of the 
Holy Spirit and the heavenly Light, and draw the transient world, 
through the potency of a single word, unto the Everlasting Kingdom.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	Extract from the utterances of the Bab:</p>
<p>	2051. One day the Bab asked that some honey be purchased for Him. 
The price at which it had been bought seemed to Him exorbitant. He 
refused it and said: "Honey of a superior quality could no doubt have 
been<br>
 purchased at a lower price. I who am your example have been a merchant 
by profession. It behoves you in all your transactions to follow in My 
way. You must neither defraud your neighbour nor allow him to defraud 
you. Such was the way of your Master. The shrewdest and ablest of men 
were unable to deceive Him, nor did He on His part choose to act 
ungenerously towards the meanest and most helpless of creatures." He 
insisted that the attendant who had made that purchase should return and
 bring back to Him a honey superior in quality and cheaper in price.</p>
<p>	(Cited in "The Dawn-Breakers: Nabil's Narrative of the Early Days of
 the Baha'i Revelation", trans. and ed. Shoghi Effendi, (Wilmette: 
Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1974), p. 303)</p>
<p>	Extracts from the writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	2052. Truthfulness is the foundation of all human virtues. Without 
truthfulness progress and success, in all the worlds of God, are 
impossible for any soul. When this holy attribute is established in man,
 all the divine qualities will also be acquired.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi,"The Advent of Divine Justice" p. 26)</p>
<p>	2053. O Sadiq![1] Truthfulness, uprightness and integrity are the 
attributes of the righteous and the hallmarks of the pure. Truthfulness 
is the goodliest of qualities as it comprehendeth all other virtues. A 
truthful person will be protected from all moral afflictions, will 
shrink from every evil deed, and be preserved from every wicked act, 
inasmuch as all vices and misdeeds are the very antithesis of 
truthfulness, and a truthful man will hold them all in utter abhorrence.<br>
 [1 The name "Sadiq" means literally "truthful" or "sincere"]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2054. O pure soul! Follow thou in the footsteps of the truthful and 
tread the way of the righteous, so that, through truthfulness, thou 
mayest come to occupy a Seat of Truth,[1] and, through righteousness, 
thou mayest attain to abiding honour. If the sum of all sins were to be 
weighed in the balance, falsehood would, on its own, countervail them; 
nay, its evils would even outweigh them and its detriment prove greater.
 It were better<br>
 for thee that thou shouldst be a blasphemer and tell the truth than 
that thou shouldst mouth the formulas of faith and yet be a liar. These 
clear words are addressed as an admonition to the peoples of the world. 
Render thanks unto God that it is through thee that this counsel hath 
been addressed to all mankind.<br>
 [1  Qur'an, 54:55]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2055. O army of God! Through the protection and help vouchsafed by 
the Blessed Beauty -- may my life be a sacrifice to His loved ones -- ye
 must conduct yourselves in such a manner that ye may stand out 
distinguished and brilliant as the sun among other souls. Should any one
 of you enter a city, he should become a centre of attraction by reason 
of his sincerity, his faithfulness and love, his honesty and fidelity, 
his truthfulness and loving-kindness towards all the peoples of the 
world, so that the people of that city may cry out and say: 'This man is
 unquestionably a Baha'i, for his manners, his behaviour, his conduct, 
his morals, his nature, and disposition reflect the attributes of the 
Baha'is.' Not until ye attain this station can ye be said to have been 
faithful to the Covenant and Testament of God. For He hath, through 
irrefutable Texts, entered into a binding Covenant with us all, 
requiring us to act in accordance with His sacred instructions and 
counsels.</p>
<p>	""Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 35, pp. 70-1)</p>
<p>	2056. ...we, and the friends of God, should on no account slacken 
our efforts to be loyal, sincere and men of good will. We should at all 
times manifest our truthfulness and sincerity, nay rather, we must be 
constant in our faithfulness and trustworthiness, and occupy ourselves 
in offering prayers for the good of all.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha, sec. 225, p. 294)</p>
<p>	2057. The primary characteristic of true believers is 
trustworthiness whereas the primary characteristic of the rebellious is 
faithlessness.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2058. If a man were to perform every good work, yet fail in the 
least scruple to be entirely trustworthy and honest, his good works 
would become as<br>
 dry tinder and his failure as a soul-consuming fire. If, on the other 
hand, he should fall short in all his affairs, yet act with 
trustworthiness and honesty, all his defects would ultimately be 
righted, all injuries remedied, and all infirmities healed. Our meaning 
is that, in the sight of God, trustworthiness is the bedrock of His 
Faith and the foundation of all virtues and perfections. A man deprived 
of this quality is destitute of everything. What shall faith and piety 
avail if trustworthiness be lacking? Of what consequence can they be? 
What benefit or advantage can they confer? Wherefore 'Abdu'l-Baha 
counselleth the friends -- nay, rather, fervently imploreth them -- so 
vigilantly to guard the sanctity of the Cause of God and preserve their 
own dignity as individuals that all nations shall come to know and 
honour them for their trustworthiness and integrity. They can render no 
greater service than this today. To act otherwise would be to take an 
axe to the root of the Cause of God -- we take refuge with God from this
 heinous transgression and pray that He will protect His loved ones from
 committing so flagrant a wrong.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2059. You have written on the question of how the friends should 
proceed in their business dealings with one another. This is a question 
of the greatest importance and a matter that deserveth the liveliest 
concern. In relations of this kind, the friends of God should act with 
the utmost trustworthiness and integrity. To be remiss in this area 
would be to turn one's face away from the counsels of the Blessed Beauty
 and the holy precepts of God. If a man in his own home doth not treat 
his relations and friends with entire trustworthiness and integrity, his
 dealings with the outside world -- no matter how much trustworthiness 
and honesty he may bring to them -- will prove barren and unproductive. 
First one should order one's own domestic affairs, then attend to one's 
business with the public. One should certainly not argue that the 
friends need not be treated with undue care, or that it is unnecessary 
for them to attach too great importance to the practice of 
trustworthiness in their dealings with one another, but that it is in 
their relations with strangers that correct behaviour is essential. Talk
 like this is sheer fantasy and will lead to detriment and loss. Blessed
 be the soul that shineth with the light of trustworthiness among the 
people and becometh a sign of perfection amidst all men.<br>

</p><p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2060. Since the orderly running of your association dependeth upon 
the devotion, integrity, fair-mindedness and sanctity of purpose 
manifested by the friends of God, they should show forth in their 
management of its affairs such purity, nobility and far-sighted wisdom 
that they will become a model for other societies, and all people may be
 edified and enlightened by their example. In this way the Baha'is will 
become known to all as people who are dependable and honest, virtuous 
and enlightened, pure and refined; who are industrious and 
high-principled, liberal-minded and promoters of freedom; whose concern 
is to serve the common good, not to advance their own interests, and 
whose aim is to further the welfare and prosperity of the people, not to
 foster their own well-being.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2061. Your criterion should be to pursue your commercial activities 
with such fairness and equity as to be a cause of guidance to others. 
The friends of God should, through the instrumentality of their 
business, lead the people to God's path, and make them so astonished as 
to exclaim: "How great is their truthfulness, how high their 
trustworthiness, and how true is their good will!"</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2062. Every business company should be established on divine 
principles. Its foundations should be trustworthiness, piety and 
truthfulness in order to protect the rights of the people.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2063. Commerce, agriculture and industry should not, in truth, be a 
bar to service of the one true God. Indeed, such occupations are most 
potent instruments and clear proofs for the manifestation of the 
evidences of one's piety, of one's trustworthiness and of the virtues of
 the All-Merciful Lord.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2064. Ye who are the sincere well-wishers of the state, who are the 
dutiful and compliant subjects of the government, should occupy 
yourselves in<br>
 constant service. Anyone who entereth the employ of the government 
should show forth in all his deeds and actions the highest degree of 
rectitude and honesty, of temperance and self-discipline, of purity and 
sanctity, of justice and equity. If, God forbid, he should be guilty of 
the least breach of trust, or approach his duties in a slack or 
desultory fashion, or extort so much as a farthing from the populace, or
 seek to further his own selfish interests and personal gain -- then it 
is certain that he shall be deprived of the outpourings of God's grace.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2065. In discharging the functions of the office to which thou hast 
been appointed, thy conduct and actions should attest to the highest 
standard of trustworthiness and honesty, to a degree of sincerity that 
is altogether above suspicion, and to an integrity that is immune to the
 promptings of self-interest. Thus shall all know that the Baha'is are 
the embodiments of probity, and the very essence of spotless virtue. If 
they accept office, their motive is to render service to the whole of 
humanity, not to seek their own self-interest; and their object is to 
vindicate the cause of truth, not to give themselves over to 
self-indulgence and base ingratitude.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2066. As for those who are engaged in government service, they 
should perform their duties with the utmost fidelity, trustworthiness, 
rectitude, uprightness, integrity and high-mindedness. Let them not 
tarnish their good repute by pursuing personal interests, nor, for the 
sake of transient worldly benefits, make themselves objects of public 
odium and outcasts of the Threshold of Grandeur.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2067. Those persons who are selected to serve the public, or are 
appointed to administrative positions, should perform their duties in a 
spirit of true servitude and ready compliance. That is to say, they 
should be distinguished by their goodly disposition and virtuous 
character, content themselves with their allotted remuneration, and act 
with trustworthiness in all their doings. They should keep themselves 
aloof from unworthy motives, and be far removed above covetous designs; 
for rectitude, probity and righteousness are among the most potent means
 for attracting the<br>
 grace of God and securing both the prosperity of the country and the 
welfare of the people. Glory and honour for man are not to be found in 
fortunes and riches, least of all in those which have been unlawfully 
amassed through extortion, embezzlement and corruption practised at the 
expense of an exploited populace. Supreme honour, nobility and greatness
 in the human world, and true felicity in this life and the life to come
 -- all consist in equity and uprightness, sanctity and detachment. If a
 man would seek distinction, he should suffice himself with a frugal 
provision, seek to better the lot of the poor of the realm, choose the 
way of justice and fair-mindedness, and tread the path of high-spirited 
service. Such a one, needy though he be, shall win imperishable riches 
and attain unto everlasting honour.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2068. If any of the friends should enter into the service of the 
government, they should make their occupation a means of drawing nearer 
to the divine Threshold: they should act with probity and uprightness, 
rigorously shun all forms of venality and corruption, and content 
themselves with the salaries they are receiving, taking pride, rather, 
in the degree of sagacity, competence and judgement that they can bring 
to their work. If a person content himself with a single loaf of bread, 
and perform his duties with as much justice and fair-mindedness as lieth
 within his power, he will be the prince of mortals, and the most 
praiseworthy of men. Noble and distinguished will he be, despite his 
empty purse! Pre-eminent will he rank among the free, although his garb 
be old and worn! For man, praise and glory reside in virtuous and noble 
qualities; honour and distinction in nearness to the divine Threshold. 
The world's wealth is, by contrast, the stuff of illusion.[1] Those who 
lust after it are the followers of evil and, erelong, they shall be 
plunged into confusion and despair. Which is better -- that a man should
 be thus, or that he should comport himself with consecration and 
sanctity of purpose and stand out conspicuously for his integrity, 
uprightness and honesty? Nay, such qualities are better than the riches 
of Korah,[2] and dearer than all the treasures of existence.<br>
[1  Cf. Qur'an, 3:185 and 57:20]<br>
[2 Name synonymous with great wealth, mentioned (in the form 'Qar'un') in the  Qur'an, 28:76]<br>

</p><p>	2069. If one of the friends ... be appointed to a high 
administrative office, he should strive diligently to perform the duties
 committed to his charge with perfect honesty, integrity, sincerity, 
rectitude and uprightness. If, however, he abuse his position through 
corrupt or mercenary behaviour, he will be held in detestation at the 
Threshold of Grandeur and incur the wrath of the Abha Beauty -- nay, he 
shall be forsaken by the one true God and all who adore Him. So far from
 acting thus, he should content himself with his salary and allowances, 
seek out the way of righteousness, and dedicate his life to the service 
of state and people. Such must be the conduct and bearing of the 
Baha'is. Whoso transgresseth these bounds shall fall at length into 
manifest loss.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2070. Those souls who are employed in government departments should 
approach their duties with entire detachment, integrity and independence
 of spirit, and with complete consecration and sanctity of purpose. 
Content with the wages they are receiving, they should see that they do 
not stain their fair character through acts of bribery and fraud. Were 
one of the friends in this day to misappropriate so much as a single 
penny, the sacred mantle of God's Cause would become sullied by his 
action and the shame of it would attach to the whole community. Heaven 
forbid! Nay, rather, the government and people should come to repose 
such trust in the Baha'is as to wish to commit all affairs of state 
throughout the provinces into the chaste, pure hands of God's 
well-beloved.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2071. All government employees, whether of high or low rank, should,
 with perfect integrity, probity and rectitude, content themselves with 
the modest stipends and allowances that are theirs. They should keep 
their hands unsullied and preserve their fair name from blemish.... If a
 man deal faithlessly with a just government he shall have dealt 
faithlessly with God; and if he render it faithful service he shall have
 rendered that service to God.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian.)<br>

</p><p>	2072. Let them perform their services with complete sanctity and
 detachment, and on no account defile themselves by receiving bribes, 
harbouring unseemly motives, or engaging in noxious practices. Let them 
be content with their wages, and seek distinction in truthfulness, 
straightforwardness, and the pursuit of virtue and excellence; for 
vanity in riches is worthy of none but the base, and pride in 
possessions beseemeth only the foolish. To attain to true glory and 
honour, man should exercise justice and equity, forbear to act in an 
oppressive manner, render service to his government, and work for the 
good of his fellow-citizens. Were he to seek after aught else but this 
he would indeed be in manifest loss.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2073. How foolish and ignorant must a man be, how base his nature, 
and how vile the clay of which he is fashioned, if he would defile 
himself with the contamination of bribery, corruption and perfidy 
towards the state! Truly, the vermin of the earth are to be preferred to
 such people!</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2074. If it should happen that one of the friends be called upon to 
serve his country and people in some capacity, he should apply himself 
to his work with heart and soul, and discharge his duties with perfect 
honesty, trustworthiness and godliness.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	Extracts from letters written by Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	2075. These are the days for rendering the divine Cause victorious 
and effective aid! The victory of God's Faith is dependent upon 
teaching; and teaching is conditional upon righteous actions and goodly 
deeds and conduct. The foundation-stone of a life lived in the way of 
God is the pursuit of moral excellence and the acquisition of a 
character endowed with qualities that are well-pleasing in His sight. 
The Baha'is should adorn themselves with this holy raiment; with this 
mighty sword they should conquer the citadels of men's hearts. People 
have grown weary and impatient of rhetoric and discourse, of preaching 
and sermonizing. In this day, the one thing that can deliver the world 
from its travail and attract the hearts of its peoples is deeds, not 
words; example, not precept; saintly<br>
 virtues, not statements and charters issued by governments and nations 
on socio-political affairs. In all matters, great or small, word must be
 the complement of deed, and deed the companion of word: each must 
supplement, support and reinforce the other. It is in this respect that 
the Baha'is must seek distinction over other peoples and nations, whom 
the Pen of the Most High has epitomized in the following words: "Their 
words are the pride of the world, and their deeds are the shame of the 
nations."</p>
<p>	(8 December 1923 to a Baha'i community - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2076. The employment that the Baha'is accept, the tasks and duties 
that they perform, should be of a kind whose benefits accrue to the 
nation as a whole and not such as are a means of profit to a small 
circle of high officials and a few select individuals. Further, the 
beloved friends and members of the Assemblies should, in the manifold 
circumstances of their lives and in all their multifarious dealings and 
pursuits, by their deeds, their bearing and demeanour, seek to 
demonstrate to their fellow-countrymen the excellence of this sacred 
Cause, to vindicate its truth, and give living testimony to its potency 
and the sublimity of its spirit. It is thus that the friends should 
proceed, not confining themselves to the delivery of the message, to 
explanations, expositions and elucidations. 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Chief 
Interpreter of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, has written:</p>
<p>	Wherefore it is incumbent upon all Baha'is to ponder this very 
delicate and vital matter in their hearts, that, unlike other religions,
 they may not content themselves with the noise, the clamour, the 
hollowness of religious doctrine. Nay, rather, they should exemplify in 
every aspect of their lives those attributes and virtues that are born 
of God and should arise to distinguish themselves by their goodly 
behaviour. They should justify their claim to be Baha'is by deeds and 
not by name. He is a true Baha'i who strives by day and by night to 
progress and advance along the path of human endeavour, whose most 
cherished desire is so to live and act as to enrich and illuminate the 
world, whose source of inspiration is the essence of divine virtue, 
whose aim in life is so to conduct himself as to be the cause of 
infinite progress. Only when he attains unto such perfect gifts can it 
be said of him that he is a true Baha'i. For in this holy Dispensation, 
the crowning glory of<br>
 bygone ages and cycles, true faith is no mere acknowledgement of the 
unity of God, but rather the living of a life that will manifest all the
 perfections and virtues implied in such belief.[1]<br>
 [1 Translated by Shoghi Effendi and published in "The Baha'i World", 
vol. 2, "1925-1928" (New York: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1928), p. 
xvi]</p>
<p>	See how firm and strongly-worded is this statement of 
'Abdu'l-Baha's, and how demanding its requirements! Notwithstanding, it 
is only when the Baha'is are able fully and befittingly to distinguish 
their characters by the adornment of these divine virtues that they will
 appear before the eyes of the world in a worthy and appropriate manner 
and that the name of Baha'u'llah will set the universe ablaze.</p>
<p>	(30 October 1924 to a Local Spiritual Assembly - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2077. Nothing but the abundance of our actions, nothing but the 
purity of our lives and the integrity of our character, can in the last 
resort establish our claim that the Baha'i spirit is in this day the 
sole agency that can translate a long-cherished ideal into an enduring 
achievement.</p>
<p>	(24 November 1924 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932" [rev. ed.], (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 
1980), p. 68)</p>
<p>	2078. This is the day for excellence of character and conduct. We 
should all adorn ourselves with these ornaments of the Kingdom while 
still in this world of being, so that we may render fit service to the 
Threshold of the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>	(In the hand writing of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 
24 November 1924 written on his behalf to an individual believer- 
translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2079. The responsibilities of the members of the Spiritual 
Assemblies that are engaged in teaching the Cause of God in Eastern 
lands have been clearly laid down in the holy Texts.</p>
<p>	These bid them to work towards the improvement of morals and the 
spread of learning; to strive to eradicate ignorance and 
unenlightenment, eliminate prejudice, and reinforce the foundation of 
true faith in people's hearts and minds; to seek to develop 
self-reliance and avoidance of blind imitation; to aim to enhance the 
efficient management of their<br>
 affairs, and observe purity and refinement in all circumstances; to 
show their commitment to truthfulness and honesty, and their ability to 
conduct themselves with frankness, courage and resolution.</p>
<p>	They similarly enjoin them to lend their support to agricultural and
 industrial development, to consolidate the foundations of mutual 
assistance and co-operation, to promote the emancipation and advancement
 of women and support the compulsory education of both sexes, to 
encourage application of the principles of consultation among all 
classes, and to adhere in all dealings to a standard of scrupulous 
integrity.</p>
<p>	They further impress upon them the virtue of trustworthiness and 
godliness, of purity of motive, kindliness of heart, and detachment from
 the fetters of this material world. They call upon them so to sanctify 
themselves that they will rise above the corrupt and evil influences 
that exercise so powerful a sway over the Western world, and charge them
 to abide by the counsel of moderation at all times and under all 
conditions. They urge them to make detailed inquiry into the various 
branches of contemporary learning -- arts and sciences alike -- and to 
concentrate their attention on serving the general interests of the 
people; to deepen themselves by attentive study of the sacred Texts, and
 to apply the divine guidance they contain to the circumstances, needs 
and conditions of society today; to refrain from entering into the 
tangled affairs of political parties and to have neither concern for, 
nor involvement in, the controversies of politicians, the wranglings of 
theologians or any of the ailing social theories current amongst men.</p>
<p>	They finally exhort them to be sincerely obedient, in both thought 
and word, to the laws duly enacted by the government of the realm, and 
to distance themselves from the methods, concepts and ill-grounded 
arguments of extreme traditionalists and modernists alike; to accord 
honour, veneration and respect to -- and endorse the efforts of -- 
exponents of the arts and sciences, and to esteem and revere those who 
are possessed of extensive knowledge and scholarly erudition; to uphold 
the right of freedom of conscience; and to abstain from criticizing and 
disparaging the manners, customs and beliefs of other individuals, 
peoples and nations.</p>
<p>	These are among the most pressing requirements for the nations of 
the East. These are the basic, the binding, the inescapable 
responsibilities<br>
 of the trustees of the Merciful, the representatives of the Baha'i communities, the members of the Spiritual Assemblies.</p>
<p>	(30 January 1926 to the Spiritual Assemblies throughout the East - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2080. The people of Baha, under the jurisdiction of whatsoever state
 or government they may be residing, should conduct themselves with 
honesty and sincerity, trustworthiness and rectitude. They should 
concern themselves with men's hearts, and hold themselves aloof from the
 fluctuations and limitations of the contingent world. They are neither 
thirsty for prominence, nor acquisitive of power; they are neither 
adepts at dissimulation and hypocrisy, nor are they seekers after wealth
 and influence; they neither crave for the pomp and circumstance of high
 office, nor do they lust after the glory of titles and ranks. They are 
averse to affectation and ostentation, and shrink from the use of 
coercive force; they have closed their eyes to all but God, and set 
their hearts on the firm and incontrovertible promises of their Lord; 
they have severed the bonds of earthly expectations and attachments, and
 connected their lives to the One Peerless Beloved. Oblivious to 
themselves, they have occupied their energies in working towards the 
good of society; and, steadfastly adhering to the sound and wholesome 
principles of God's Faith, they have turned their backs on the morbid 
imaginings, the incoherent theories, and pernicious ideas of the victims
 of caprice and folly. While vigilantly refusing to accept political 
posts, they should whole-heartedly welcome the chance to assume 
administrative positions; for the primary purpose of the people of Baha 
is to advance the interests and promote the welfare of the nation, not 
to further the devious ends and designs of the profligate and shameless.
 Such is the method of the Baha'is; such is the conduct of all 
spiritually illumined souls; and aught else is manifest error.</p>
<p>	(February 1927 to the believers throughout the East - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2081. In their homes, ... in the daily contact of business 
transactions, ... the community of the followers of Baha'u'llah should 
satisfy themselves that in the eyes of the world at large and in the 
sight of their vigilant Master they are the living witnesses of those 
truths which He fondly cherished and tirelessly championed to the very 
end of His days....<br>

</p><p>	(12 April 1927 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932", p. 130)</p>
<p>	2082. Let them so shape their lives and regulate their conduct that 
no charge of secrecy, of fraud, of bribery or of intimidation may, 
however ill-founded, be brought against them....</p>
<p>	(21 March 1932 to the believers throughout North America, published 
in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", rev. ed. 
(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 64)</p>
<p>	2083. It [rectitude of conduct] must be constantly reflected in the 
business dealings of all its members, in their domestic lives, in all 
manner of employment, and in any service they may, in the future, render
 their government or people....</p>
<p>	(25 December 1938 to the believers throughout North America, published as "The Advent of Divine Justice" p. 26)</p>
<p>	Extracts from letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	(To individual believers unless otherwise stated)</p>
<p>	2084. The permanence and stability achieved by any association, 
group or nation is a result of -- and dependent upon -- the soundness 
and worth of the principles upon which it bases the running of its 
affairs and the direction of its activities. The guiding principles of 
the Baha'is are: honesty, love, charity and trustworthiness; the setting
 of the common good above private interest; and the practice of 
godliness, virtue and moderation. Ultimately, then, their preservation 
and happiness are assured. Whatever misfortunes they may encounter, 
wrought by the wiles of the schemer and ill-wisher, shall all pass away 
like waves, and hardship shall be succeeded by joy. The friends are 
under the protection of the resistless power and inscrutable providence 
of God. There is no doubt that every blessed soul who brings his life 
into harmony with this all-swaying power shall give lustre to his works 
and win an ample recompense. The actions of those who choose to set 
themselves against it should provoke not antipathy on our part, but 
prayers for their guidance. Such was the way of the Baha'is in days gone
 by, and so must it be, now and for always.<br>

</p><p>	(18 December 1925 to a National Spiritual Assembly - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2085. The Pen of the Most High has recorded: "Fear of God is the 
greatest commander that can render the Cause of God victorious, and the 
hosts which best befit this commander have ever been and are an upright 
character and pure and goodly deeds."[1]<br>
 [1 From the Kitab-i-Ahd, published in "Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed 
after the Kitab-i-'Aqdas" rev. ed. (Haifa: Baha'i World Center, 1982), 
p. 222.]</p>
<p>	The people of Baha should, then, lead their lives and conduct their 
affairs with the highest degree of sanctity and godliness, and 
uncompromisingly repudiate and dissociate themselves from the 
disreputable practices, the deplorable modes and customs prevalent among
 the people of the West. Piety and devotion should be the object of all 
who would be accounted lovers of this Cause, and the adornment of every 
righteous soul; otherwise, slowly but surely, the illumination conferred
 on the innermost reality of men's hearts by the virtues of the human 
world will flicker and fade and die away, to be overwhelmed by the 
engulfing darkness of vice and depravity. Courtesy and dignity are what 
bring nobility and standing to a man; whereas frivolity and 
facetiousness, ribaldry and effrontery will lead to his abasement, 
degradation and humiliation. The Baha'is should, indeed must, seek to 
distinguish themselves in all things, for what difference else would 
there be between them and others? Any action, therefore, that is 
calculated to detract from the dignity of man's station must be 
steadfastly avoided and shunned.</p>
<p>	(21 January 1928 - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2086. You brought up the question of showing forth honesty and 
trustworthiness when engaged in the service of the state. These are 
qualities that must distinguish all the activities of the friends, and 
the acquisition of which is a religious duty incumbent on every 
believer. That some of the leaders whom they serve may be unappreciative
 of their efforts, or fail correctly to value their services, should 
give no cause for surprise. The reason for such conduct is the 
remoteness of such men from the True Source of justice, equity and 
fair-mindedness. We should keep our vision centred on God, not on the 
doings of His creatures. Every<br>
 spotless action, every sincere intent of ours will win the commendation
 of the True One, will be exalted and magnified by Him, and requited 
with a bounteous recompense.</p>
<p>	(8 March 1948 - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2087. It is with deep concern indeed that he has learned of the 
difficulties you have encountered in your business, and [he] was 
particularly grieved to hear of the bitter competition you are meeting 
from some Persians in New York, who seem determined to ruin and force 
you out of business, despite the fact that you have shown them kindness,
 and refused to deal with them harshly. Though the Guardian would advise
 that you continue keeping such [a] true Baha'i attitude of forbearance,
 he wishes you at the same time not to give way, and not to allow any 
threat on their part to discourage or demoralize you. However unethical 
the methods they may employ, it should be your firm conviction that such
 malicious devices cannot in the long run succeed, and that the most 
effective way of counteracting them is for you to maintain unreservedly 
the one true standard of business conduct inculcated in the Teachings.</p>
<p>	(31 October 1938)</p>
<p>	2088. May I, in closing, also express his satisfaction at the 
improvement in Mr....'s business conditions. He will continue to pray 
that the high standard of integrity he has so well maintained in his 
business transactions may not only serve to draw upon him the 
confirmations and blessings of God, but in addition prove an effective 
means for the attraction of many souls to the Faith.</p>
<p>	(4 November 1940)</p>
<p>	2089. As for your comment that the Faith has a need for selfless, 
love-intoxicated followers, for people of outstanding spiritual 
endowments, for powerful, eloquent speakers and for men of material 
resources and talents to vindicate the truth of our beloved Cause, the 
Guardian instructed me to write:</p>
<p>	"What is needed is excellence of character and conduct, and 
compliance with the laws revealed by Baha'u'llah -- these are the 
magnets that attract divine confirmation, and the means of<br>
 establishing the validity and uniqueness of the Cause of the All-Glorious."</p>
<p>	He further bade me write:</p>
<p>	"The removal of imperfections is a gradual process. Constant advice 
and admonition are necessary so that, step by step, the community may 
make good the various deficiencies that beset it and run its affairs on a
 planned and orderly basis."</p>
<p>	(12 January 1946)</p>
<p>	2090. The Guardian feels that your attitude towards the corrupt 
practice of accepting commissions from fellow physicians and pharmacists
 is most admirable. The more upright and noble the Baha'is are in their 
conduct, the more they will impress the public with the spiritual 
vitality of the Faith they believe in.</p>
<p>	(20 October 1953)</p>
<p>	2091. He feels you should both consider the competent running of 
your business not only a moral obligation to any creditors outstanding, 
but also the wise and proper thing to do.</p>

<p>	I. The Baha'i Concept of Equality</p>
<p>	Extracts From the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	2092. O Children of Men! Know ye not why We created you all from the
 same dust? That no one should exalt himself over the other. Ponder at 
all times in your hearts how ye were created. Since We have created you 
all from one same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one 
soul, to walk with the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in 
the same land, that from your inmost being, by your deeds and actions, 
the signs of oneness and the essence of detachment may be made manifest.
 Such is My counsel to you, O concourse of light! Heed ye this counsel 
that ye may obtain the fruit of holiness from the tree of wondrous 
glory.</p>
<p>	("The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah "Arabic no. 68, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1985), p. 20)</p>
<p>	2093. Exalted, immensely exalted is He Who hath removed differences 
and established harmony. Glorified, infinitely glorified is He Who hath 
caused discord to cease, and decreed solidarity and unity. Praised be 
God, the Pen of the Most High hath lifted distinctions from between His 
servants and handmaidens, and, through His consummate favours and 
all-encompassing mercy, hath conferred upon all a station and rank of 
the same plane. He hath broken the back of vain imaginings with the 
sword of utterance and hath obliterated the perils of idle fancies 
through the pervasive power of His might.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2094. This Wronged One hath heard thy voice and that which thy inner
 and outer tongue hath uttered in praise of thy Lord. By the 
righteousness of God! That which the people possess, and the treasures 
of the earth, and that which the rulers and kings own, are not equal in 
this day to the singing of His praise. The Lord of the Kingdom beareth 
witness unto this at this glorious moment. And having heard thy groaning
 and lamentation, We are responding with a Tablet which calleth out 
betwixt earth and heaven and maketh mention of thee with words that 
immortalize what hath appeared from thee in His love, in His service, in
 His remembrance and in His praise. And He hath made that which hath 
issued forth from thy mouth a trust with Him for thee. He is verily the<br>
 Most Bounteous, the Most Generous. If thou truly givest ear to that 
which hath been revealed for thee from My Supreme Pen at this moment, 
thou shalt soar with the wings of eagerness in the heaven of love for 
the Lord of the Day of the Covenant, and wilt say during all the days of
 thy life: Thanks be unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of the world, and 
praise be unto Thee, O Thou the Beloved of the people of understanding. 
May all existence be a sacrifice for Thy favour, and all that hath been 
and will ever be, a ransom for Thy Word, O Thou the Wronged One amongst 
the people of enmity, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of all who are
 in heaven and on earth....</p>
<p>	In this Day the Hand of divine grace hath removed all distinctions. 
The servants of God and His handmaidens are regarded on the same plane. 
Blessed is the servant who hath attained unto that which God hath 
decreed, and likewise the leaf moving in accordance with the breezes of 
His will. This favour is great and this station lofty. His bounties and 
bestowals are ever present and manifest. Who is able to offer befitting 
gratitude for His successive bestowals and continuous favours?</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	2095. By My Life! The names of handmaidens who are devoted to God 
are written and set down by the Pen of the Most High in the Crimson 
Book. They excel over men in the sight of God. How numerous are the 
heroes and knights in the field who are bereft of the True One and have 
no share in His recognition, but thou hast attained and received thy 
fill.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2096. Verily the Pen of the Most High hath borne witness unto thy 
recognition of Him, thy love for Him and thy turning towards the Ancient
 Countenance at a time when the world hath rejected Him, save those whom
 God, the Most High, hath willed....</p>
<p>	Well is it with thee for having adorned thyself with the ornament of
 the love of God and for having been enabled to make mention of Him and 
utter His praise. Divine grace, in its entirety, is in the mighty grasp 
of God, exalted be He. He conferreth it upon whomsoever He willeth. How 
many a man considered himself a celebrated divine and a repository of 
heavenly mysteries, and yet when the slightest test visited him, he 
arose with such opposition and denial as to cause the Concourse on high 
to<br>
 moan and lament. Through the bestowals of the Lord, however, and His 
infinite favour, thou hast attained unto the hidden secret and the 
well-guarded treasure. Preserve then, in the name of God, this lofty 
station and conceal it from the eyes of betrayers. The glory shining 
from the horizon of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon every handmaiden 
who hath attained the splendours of My sublime Throne.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	2097. We beseech God to aid all the leaves to attain the knowledge 
of the Tree and deprive them not of the ocean of His generosity. In this
 day no regard is paid to loftiness or lowliness, to poverty or wealth, 
to nobility and lineage, to weakness or might. Whosoever recognizeth the
 incomparable Beloved is the possessor of true wealth and occupieth a 
divine station. Today, in the court of the True One, the queen of the 
world and her like are not worth a mustard seed, because although she 
may speak in the name of God, invoke the Lord of creation every day in 
the temple of her body, and spend large sums of earthly wealth for the 
development of her nation, she is deprived of recognition of the Sun of 
His Manifestation and is barred from the True One in Whose remembrance 
she is engaged....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	2098. Throughout the centuries and ages many a man hath waited 
expectant for God's Revelation, and yet when the Light shone forth from 
the horizon of the world, all but a few turned their faces away from it.
 Whosoever from amongst the handmaidens hath recognized the Lord of all 
Names is recorded in the Book as one of those men by the Pen of the Most
 High. Offer thou praise to the Beloved of the world for having aided 
thee to recognize the Dayspring of His Signs and the Revealer of the 
evidences of His Glory. This is a great bounty, a bounteous favour. 
Preserve it in the name of the True One....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	Extracts From the Writings and Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	2099. From the beginning of existence until the Promised Day men 
retained superiority over women in every respect. It is revealed in the 
Qur'an: "Men have superiority over women." But in this wondrous<br>
 Dispensation, the supreme outpouring of the Glorious Lord became the 
cause of manifest achievements by women. Some handmaidens arose who 
excelled men in the arena of knowledge. They arose with such love and 
spirituality that they became the cause of the outpouring of the bounty 
of the Sovereign Lord upon mankind, and with their sanctity, purity and 
attributes of the spirit led a great many to the shore of unity. They 
became a guiding torch to the wanderers in the wastes of bewilderment, 
and enkindled the despondent in the nether world with the flame of the 
love of the Lord. This is a bounteous characteristic of this wondrous 
Age which hath granted strength to the weaker sex and hath bestowed 
masculine might upon womanhood....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2100. O handmaid of God! In this wondrous dispensation in which the 
Ancient Beauty and the Manifest Light -- may my spirit be sacrificed for
 His loved ones -- hath risen from the horizon of age-old hopes, women 
have assumed the attributes of men in showing forth steadfastness in the
 Cause of God, and revealing the heroism and might of fearless men. They
 invaded the arena of mystic knowledge and hoisted aloft the banner on 
the heights of certitude. Thou, too, must make a mighty effort and show 
forth supreme courage. Exert thyself and taste of the sweetness of a 
heavenly draught, for the sweet taste of the love of God will linger on 
to the end that hath no end.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2101. Render thanks to the Lord that among that race thou art the 
first believer,[1] arisen to guide others. It is my hope that through 
the bounties and favours of the Abha Beauty thy countenance may be 
illumined, thy<br>
 disposition pleasing, and thy fragrance diffused, that thine eyes may 
be seeing, thine ears attentive, thy tongue eloquent, thy heart filled 
with supreme glad-tidings, and thy soul refreshed by divine fragrances, 
so that thou mayest arise among that race and occupy thyself with the 
edification of the people, and become filled with light. Although the 
pupil of the eye is black, it is the source of light. Thou shalt 
likewise be. The disposition should be bright, not the appearance. 
Therefore, with supreme confidence and certitude, say: "O God! Make me a
 radiant light, a shining lamp, and a brilliant star, so that I may 
illumine the hearts with an effulgent ray from Thy Kingdom of Abha...."<br>
	[1 This Tablet was addressed to one Mrs. Pocohontas in Washington. 
According to Fadil Mazandarani, the recipient of the Tablet was a black 
woman. See "Tarikh-i-Zuhuru'l-Haq", vol. 8, part 2, p. 1209 (Tihran: 
Baha'i Publishing Trust, 132 B.E.). Additional information provided by 
the Archives of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States 
indicates that Mr. Louis Gregory, in a history of the Washington, D.C. 
that thou hast engaged in spreading sweet-scented breezes, and hast 
Baha'i community, mentions a black Baha'i, Mrs. Pocohontas Pope, who is 
likely the same person. Mrs. Pope learned of the Baha'i Faith through 
Alma and Fanny Knobloch and Joseph and Pauline Hannen. There is, at 
present no other information on Mrs. Pope.]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2102. The establishment of a women's assemblage for the promotion of
 knowledge is entirely acceptable, but discussions must be confined to 
educational matters. It should be done in such a way that differences 
will, day by day, be entirely wiped out, not that, God forbid, it will 
end in argumentation between men and women. As in the question of the 
veil, nothing should be done contrary to wisdom. The individual women 
should, today, follow a course of action which will be the cause of 
eternal glory to all womankind, so that all women will be illumined. And
 that lieth in gathering to learn how to teach, in holding meetings to 
recite the verses, to offer supplications to the kingdom of the Lord of 
evident signs, and to institute education for the girls. Ponder the 
manner in which Jinab-i-Tahirih used to teach. She was free from every 
concern, and for this reason she was resplendent.</p>
<p>	Now the world of women should be a spiritual world, not a political 
one, so that it will be radiant. The women of other nations are all 
immersed in political matters. Of what benefit is this, and what fruit 
doth it yield? To the extent that ye can, ye should busy yourselves with
 spiritual matters which will be conducive to the exaltation of the Word
 of God and of the diffusion of His fragrances. Your demeanour should 
lead to harmony amongst all and to coalescence and the good-pleasure of 
all....</p>
<p>	I am endeavouring, with Baha'u'llah's confirmations and assistance, 
so to improve the world of the handmaidens that all will be astonished. 
This progress is intended to be in spirituality, in virtues, in human 
perfections and in divine knowledge. In America, the cradle of women's 
liberation, women are still debarred from political institutions because<br>
 they squabble. They are yet to have a member in the House of 
Representatives. Also Baha'u'llah hath proclaimed: "O ye men of the 
House of Justice." Ye need to be calm and composed, so that the work 
will proceed with wisdom, otherwise there will be such chaos that ye 
will leave everything and run away. "This newly born babe is traversing 
in one night the path that needeth a hundred years to tread." In brief, 
ye should now engage in matters of pure spirituality and not contend 
with men. 'Abdu'l-Baha will tactfully take appropriate steps. Be 
assured. In the end thou wilt thyself exclaim, "This was indeed supreme 
wisdom!" I appeal to you to obliterate this contention between men and 
women....</p>
<p>	No one can on his own achieve anything. 'Abdu'l-Baha must be well pleased and assist.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2103. Know thou, O handmaid, that in the sight of Baha, women are 
accounted the same as men, and God hath created all humankind in His own
 image, and after His own likeness. That is, men and women alike are the
 revealers of His names and attributes, and from the spiritual viewpoint
 there is no difference between them. Whosoever draweth nearer to God, 
that one is the most favoured, whether man or woman. How many a 
handmaid, ardent and devoted, hath, within the sheltering shade of Baha,
 proved superior to the men, and surpassed the famous of the earth.</p>
<p>	The House of Justice, however, according to the explicit text of the
 Law of God, is confined to men;[1] this for a wisdom of the Lord God's,
 which will ere long be made manifest as clearly as the sun at high 
noon.<br>
 [1 From other extracts it is evident that the limitation of membership 
to men applies only to the Universal House of Justice, and not to the 
National and Local Houses of Justice.]</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 38, pp. 79-80)</p>
<p>	2104. And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is the equality of 
women and men. The world of humanity has two wings -- one is women and 
the other men. Not until both wings are equally developed can the bird 
fly. Should one wing remain weak, flight is impossible. Not until the 
world of women<br>
 becomes equal to the world of men in the acquisition of virtues and 
perfections, can success and prosperity be attained as they ought to be.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 227, p. 302)</p>
<p>	2105. Inasmuch as this is the century of light, it is evident that 
the Sun of Reality, the Word, has revealed itself to all humankind. One 
of the potentialities hidden in the realm of humanity was the capability
 or capacity of womanhood. Through the effulgent rays of divine 
illumination the capacity of woman has become so awakened and manifest 
in this age that equality of man and woman is an established fact....</p>
<p>	In this day man must investigate reality impartially and without 
prejudice in order to reach the true knowledge and conclusions. What, 
then, constitutes the inequality between man and woman? Both are human. 
In powers and function each is the complement of the other. At most it 
is this: that woman has been denied the opportunities which man has so 
long enjoyed, especially the privilege of education....</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	The truth is that all mankind are the creatures and servants of one 
God, and in His estimate all are human. Man is a generic term applying 
to all humanity. The biblical statement "Let us make man in our image, 
after our likeness" does not mean that woman was not created. The image 
and likeness of God apply to her as well. In Persian and Arabic there 
are two distinct words translated into English as man: one meaning man 
and woman collectively, the other distinguishing man as male from woman 
the female. The first word and its pronoun are generic, collective; the 
other is restricted to the male. This is the same in Hebrew. To accept 
and observe a distinction which God has not intended in creation is 
ignorance and superstition....</p>
<p>	It is my hope that the banner of equality may be raised throughout 
the five continents where as yet it is not fully recognized and 
established. In this enlightened world of the West woman has advanced an
 immeasurable degree beyond the women of the Orient. And let it be known
 once more that until woman and man recognize and realize equality, 
social and political progress here or anywhere will not be possible. For
 the world of humanity consists of two parts or members: one<br>
 is woman; the other is man. Until these two members are equal in 
strength, the oneness of humanity cannot be established, and the 
happiness and felicity of mankind will not be a reality. God willing, 
this is to be so.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
2nd. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 74-77)</p>
<p>	2106. Today questions of the utmost importance are facing humanity, questions peculiar to this radiant century....</p>
<p>	One of these questions concerns the rights of woman and her equality
 with man. In past ages it was held that woman and man were not equal --
 that is to say, woman was considered inferior to man, even from the 
standpoint of her anatomy and creation. She was considered especially 
inferior in intelligence, and the idea prevailed universally that it was
 not allowable for her to step into the arena of important affairs. In 
some countries man went so far as to believe and teach that woman 
belonged to a sphere lower than human. But in this century, which is the
 century of light and the revelation of mysteries, God is proving to the
 satisfaction of humanity that all this is ignorance and error; nay, 
rather, it is well established that mankind and womankind as parts of 
composite humanity are coequal and that no difference in estimate is 
allowable, for all are human. The conditions in past centuries were due 
to woman's lack of opportunity. She was denied the right and privilege 
of education and left in her undeveloped state. Naturally, she could not
 and did not advance. In reality, God has created all mankind, and in 
the estimation of God there is no distinction as to male and female. The
 one whose heart is pure is acceptable in His sight, be that one man or 
woman. God does not inquire, "Art thou woman or art thou man?" He judges
 human actions. If these are acceptable in the threshold of the Glorious
 One, man and woman will be equally recognized and rewarded.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 133)</p>
<p>	2107. The world of humanity consists of two parts: male and female. 
Each is the complement of the other. Therefore, if one is defective, the
 other will necessarily be incomplete, and perfection cannot be 
attained. There<br>
 is a right hand and a left hand in the human body, functionally equal 
in service and administration. If either proves defective, the defect 
will naturally extend to the other by involving the completeness of the 
whole; for accomplishment is not normal unless both are perfect. If we 
say one hand is deficient, we prove the inability and incapacity of the 
other; for single-handed there is no full accomplishment. Just as 
physical accomplishment is complete with two hands, so man and woman, 
the two parts of the social body, must be perfect. It is not natural 
that either should remain undeveloped; and until both are perfected, the
 happiness of the human world will not be realized.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 134)</p>
<p>	2108. The status of woman in former times was exceedingly 
deplorable, for it was the belief of the Orient that it was best for 
woman to be ignorant. It was considered preferable that she should not 
know reading or writing in order that she might not be informed of 
events in the world. Woman was considered to be created for rearing 
children and attending to the duties of the household. If she pursued 
educational courses, it was deemed contrary to chastity; hence women 
were made prisoners of the household. The houses did not even have 
windows opening upon the outside world. Baha'u'llah destroyed these 
ideas and proclaimed the equality of man and woman. He made woman 
respected by commanding that all women be educated, that there be no 
difference in the education of the two sexes and that man and woman 
share the same rights. In the estimation of God there is no distinction 
of sex. One whose thought is pure, whose education is superior, whose 
scientific attainments are greater, whose deeds of philanthropy excel, 
be that one man or woman, white or colored, is entitled to full rights 
and recognition; there is no differentiation whatsoever....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 166)</p>
<p>	2109. Woman's lack of progress and proficiency has been due to her 
need of equal education and opportunity. Had she been allowed this 
equality, there is no doubt she would be the counterpart of man in 
ability and capacity. The happiness of mankind will be realized when 
women and<br>
 men coordinate and advance equally, for each is the complement and helpmeet of the other.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 182)</p>
<p>	2110. He establishes the equality of man and woman. This is peculiar
 to the teachings of Baha'u'llah, for all other religions have placed 
man above woman.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 455)</p>
<p>	2111. Women have equal rights with men upon earth; in religion and 
society they are a very important element. As long as women are 
prevented from attaining their highest possibilities, so long will men 
be unable to achieve the greatness which might be theirs.</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 
1911-1912", 10th ed. (London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1979), p. 133)</p>
<p>	2112. In the world of humanity ... the female sex is treated as 
though inferior, and is not allowed equal rights and privileges. This 
condition is due not to nature, but to education. In the Divine Creation
 there is no such distinction. Neither sex is superior to the other in 
the sight of God. Why then should one sex assert the inferiority of the 
other, withholding just rights and privileges as though God had given 
His authority for such a course of action? If women received the same 
educational advantages as those of men, the result would demonstrate the
 equality of capacity of both for scholarship.</p>
<p>	In some respects woman is superior to man. She is more tender-hearted, more receptive, her intuition is more intense.</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912", p. 161)</p>
<p>	2113. Divine Justice demands that the rights of both sexes should be
 equally respected since neither is superior to the other in the eyes of
 Heaven.<br>
 Dignity before God depends, not on sex, but on purity and luminosity of heart. Human virtues belong equally to all!</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912", p. 162)</p>
<p>	2114. In the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah, women are advancing side 
by side with men. There is no area or instance where they will lag 
behind: they have equal rights with men, and will enter, in the future, 
into all branches of the administration of society. Such will be their 
elevation that, in every area of endeavour, they will occupy the highest
 levels in the human world. Rest thou assured. Look not upon their 
present state. In future, the world of womankind will shine with 
lustrous brilliance, for such is the will and purpose of Baha'u'llah. At
 the time of elections the right to vote is the inalienable right of 
women, and the entrance of women into all human departments is an 
irrefutable and incontrovertible question. No soul can retard or prevent
 it.</p>
<p>	But there are certain matters, the participation in which is not 
worthy of women. For example, at the time when the community is taking 
up vigorous defensive measures against the attack of foes, the women are
 exempt from military engagements. It may so happen that at a given time
 warlike and savage tribes may furiously attack the body politic with 
the intention of carrying on a wholesale slaughter of its members; under
 such a circumstance defence is necessary, but it is the duty of men to 
organize and execute such defensive measures and not the women -- 
because their hearts are tender and they cannot endure the sight of the 
horror of carnage, even if it is for the sake of defence. From such and 
similar undertakings the women are exempt. As regards the constitution 
of the House of Justice, Baha'u'llah addresses the men. He says: "O ye 
men of the House of Justice!"</p>
<p>	But when its members are to be elected, the right which belongs to 
women, so far as their voting and their voice is concerned, is 
indisputable. When the women attain to the ultimate degree of progress, 
then, according to the exigency of the time and place and their great 
capacity, they shall obtain extraordinary privileges. Be ye confident on
 these accounts. His Holiness Baha'u'llah has greatly strengthened the 
cause of women, and the rights and privileges of women is one of the 
greatest principles of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Rest ye assured! Ere long the days 
shall come<br>
 when the men addressing the women, shall say: 'Blessed are ye! Blessed 
are ye! Verily ye are worthy of every gift. Verily ye deserve to adorn 
your heads with the crown of everlasting glory, because in sciences and 
arts, in virtues and perfections ye shall become equal to man, and as 
regards tenderness of heart and the abundance of mercy and sympathy ye 
are superior'</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer- translated from the 
Persian, published in "Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in 
Paris in 1911-1912", p. 182-84)</p>
<p>	2115. The woman of the East has progressed. Formerly in India, 
Persia and throughout the Orient, she was not considered a human being. 
Certain Arab tribes counted their women in with the live stock. In their
 language the noun for woman also meant donkey; that is, the same name 
applied to both and a man's wealth was accounted by the number of these 
beasts of burden he possessed. The worst insult one could hurl at a man 
was to cry out, "Thou woman!"</p>
<p>	From the moment Baha'u'llah appeared, this changed. He did away with
 the idea of distinction between the sexes, proclaiming them equal in 
every capacity. In former times it was considered wiser that woman 
should not know how to read or write; she should occupy herself only 
with drudgery. She was very ignorant. Baha'u'llah declares the education
 of woman to be of more importance than that of man. If the mother be 
ignorant, even if the father have great knowledge, the child's education
 will be at fault, for education begins with the milk. A child at the 
breast is like a tender branch that the gardener can train as he wills. 
The East has begun to educate its women. Some there are in Persia who 
have become liberated through this cause, whose cleverness and eloquence
 the 'ulama cannot refute. Many of them are poets. They are absolutely 
fearless. I hope for a like degree of progress among the women of Europe
 -- that each may shine like unto a lamp; that they may cry out the 
proclamation of the kingdom; that they may truly assist the men; nay, 
that they may be even superior to the men, versed in sciences and yet 
detached, so that the whole world may bear witness to the fact that men 
and women have absolutely the same rights. It would be a cause of great<br>
 joy for me to see such women. This is useful work; by it woman will 
enter into the kingdom. Otherwise, there will be no results.</p>
<p>	("'Abdu'l-Baha on Divine Philosophy" (Boston: Tudor Press, 1918), pp. 81-83)</p>
<p>	2116. The world in the past has been ruled by force, and man has 
dominated over woman by reason of his more forceful and aggressive 
qualities both of body and mind. But the balance is already shifting; 
force is losing its dominance, and mental alertness, intuition, and the 
spiritual qualities of love and service, in which woman is strong, are 
gaining ascendancy. Hence the new age will be an age less masculine and 
more permeated with the feminine ideals, or, to speak more exactly, will
 be an age in which the masculine and feminine elements of civilization 
will be more evenly balanced.</p>
<p>	(J. E. Esslemont, "Baha'u'llah and the New Era", 5th rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), p. 149)</p>
<p>	Extracts From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	2117. If presented properly the position of women in the Baha'i 
teachings will surely attract much attention, for it is not only legal 
but also spiritual and educational. Our ideals are so high and at the 
same time so practicable that all other views will fall short if 
compared to them.</p>
<p>	(7 January 1931 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	2118. As regards your question concerning the membership of the 
Universal House of Justice: there is a Tablet from 'Abdul-Baha in which 
He definitely states that the membership of the Universal House is 
confined to men, and that the wisdom of it will be fully revealed and 
appreciated in the future. In the local as well as the national Houses 
of Justice, however, women have the full right of membership. It is, 
therefore, only to the International House that they cannot be elected. 
The Baha'is should accept this statement of the Master in a spirit of 
deep faith, confident that there is a divine guidance and wisdom behind 
it which will be gradually unfolded to the eyes of the world.</p>
<p>	(28 July 1936 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	2119. As regards the membership of the International House of 
Justice, 'Abdu'l-Baha states in a Tablet that it is confined to men, and
 that the wisdom of it will be revealed as manifest as the sun in the 
future. In any case the believers should know that, as 'Abdu'l-Baha 
Himself has explicitly stated that sexes are equal except in some cases,
 the exclusion of women from the International House of Justice should 
not be surprising. From the fact that there is no equality of functions 
between the sexes one should not, however, infer that either sex is 
inherently superior or inferior to the other, or that they are unequal 
in their rights.</p>
<p>	(14 December 1940 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	Extracts From Letters Written by the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	2120. It is apparent from the Guardian's writings that where 
Baha'u'llah has expressed a law as between a man and a woman it applies,
 mutatis mutandis, between a woman and a man unless the context should 
make this impossible. For example, the text of the "Kitab-i-Aqdas" 
forbids a man to marry his father's wife (i.e. his step-mother), and the
 Guardian has indicated that likewise a woman is forbidden to marry her 
step-father....</p>
<p>	(28 April 1974 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2121. Concerning your questions about the equality of men and women,
 this, as 'Abdu'l-Baha has often explained, is a fundamental principle 
of Baha'u'llah; therefore the Laws of the "Aqdas" should be studied in 
the light of it. Equality between men and women does not, indeed 
physiologically it cannot, mean identity of functions. In some things 
women excel men, for others men are better fitted than women, while in 
very many things the difference of sex is of no effect at all. The 
differences of function are most apparent in family life. The capacity 
for motherhood has many far-reaching implications which are recognized 
in Baha'i Law. For example, when it is not possible to educate all one's
 children, daughters receive preference over sons, as mothers are the 
first educators of the next generation. Again, for physiological 
reasons, women are granted certain exemptions from fasting that are not 
applicable to men.</p>
<p>	(24 July 1975 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	2122. The primary question to be resolved is how the present 
world, with its entrenched pattern of conflict, can change to a world in
 which harmony and co-operation will prevail.</p>
<p>	World order can be founded only on an unshakable consciousness of 
the oneness of mankind, a spiritual truth which all the human sciences 
confirm. Anthropology, physiology, psychology, recognize only one human 
species, albeit infinitely varied in the secondary aspects of life. 
Recognition of this truth requires abandonment of prejudice -- prejudice
 of every kind -- race, class, colour, creed, nation, sex, degree of 
material civilization, everything which enables people to consider 
themselves superior to others.</p>
<p>	Acceptance of the oneness of mankind is the first fundamental 
prerequisite for reorganization and administration of the world as one 
country, the home of humankind. Universal acceptance of this spiritual 
principle is essential to any successful attempt to establish world 
peace....</p>
<p>	(October 1985 to the Peoples of the World)</p>
<p>	From Letters Written on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	2123. To the general premise that women and men have equality in the
 Faith, this, as often explained by 'Abdu'l-Baha, is a fundamental 
principle deriving from Baha'u'llah and therefore His mention of the 
"Men of Justice" in the Kitab-i-Aqdas should be considered in light of 
that principle ....</p>
<p>	(29 June 1976 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2124. ...'Abdu'l-Baha asserts: "In this divine age the bounties of 
God have encompassed the world of women. Equality of men and women, 
except in some negligible instances, has been fully and categorically 
announced. Distinctions have been utterly removed." That men and women 
differ from one another in certain characteristics and functions is an 
inescapable fact of nature; the important thing is that He regards such 
inequalities as remain between the sexes as being "negligible".</p>
<p>	(8 January 1981 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	2125. You are quite right in stating that men and women have basic 
and distinct qualities. The solution provided in the teachings of 
Baha'u'llah is not, as you correctly observe, for men to become women, 
and for<br>
 women to become men. 'Abdu'l-Baha gave us the key to the problem when 
He taught that the qualities and functions of men and women "complement"
 each other. He further elucidated this point when He said that the "new
 age" will be "an age in which the masculine and feminine elements of 
civilization will be more properly balanced."</p>
<p>	(22 April 1981 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2126. It may be helpful to stress ... that the Baha'i principle of 
the equality of men and women is clearly stated in the teachings, and 
the fact that there is diversity of function between them in certain 
areas does not negate this principle.</p>
<p>	(23 August 1984 to two believers)</p>
<p>	II. The Role of Education in the Development of Women</p>
<p>	Extracts From the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	2127. It is the bounden duty of parents to rear their children to be
 staunch in faith ... For every praiseworthy deed is born out of the 
light of religion, and lacking this supreme bestowal the child will not 
turn away from any evil, nor will he draw nigh unto any good.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from Persian, published in "Baha'i Education, a compilation, 1976 World Centre edition, p. 6)</p>
<p>	Extracts From the Writings and Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	2128. Praised be God, the women believers have organized meetings 
where they will learn how to teach the Faith, will spread the sweet 
savours of the Teachings and make plans for training the children.</p>
<p>	...those present should concern themselves with every means of 
training the girl children; with teaching the various branches of 
knowledge, good behaviour, a proper way of life, the cultivation of a 
good character, chastity and constancy, perseverance, strength, 
determination, firmness of purpose; with household management, the 
education of children, and whatever especially applieth to the needs of 
girls -- to the end that these girls, reared in the stronghold of all 
perfections, and with the protection of a goodly character, will, when 
they themselves become mothers, bring up their children from earliest 
infancy to have a good character and conduct themselves well.<br>

</p><p>	Let them also study whatever will nurture the health of the body
 and its physical soundness, and how to guard their children from 
disease.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 94, pp. 123-24)</p>
<p>	2129. Work ye for the guidance of the women in that land, teach the 
young girls and the children, so that the mothers may educate their 
little ones from their earliest days, thoroughly train them, rear them 
to have a goodly character and good morals, guide them to all the 
virtues of humankind, prevent the development of any behaviour that 
would be worthy of blame, and foster them in the embrace of Baha'i 
education. Thus shall these tender infants be nurtured at the breast of 
the knowledge of God and His love. Thus shall they grow and flourish, 
and be taught righteousness and the dignity of humankind, resolution and
 the will to strive and to endure. Thus shall they learn perseverance in
 all things, the will to advance, high mindedness and high resolve, 
chastity and purity of life. Thus shall they be enabled to carry to a 
successful conclusion whatsoever they undertake.</p>
<p>	Let the mothers consider that whatever concerneth the education of 
children is of the first importance. Let them put forth every effort in 
this regard, for when the bough is green and tender it will grow in 
whatever way ye train it. Therefore it is incumbent upon the mothers to 
rear their little ones even as a gardener tendeth his young plants. Let 
them strive by day and by night to establish within their children faith
 and certitude, the fear of God, the love of the Beloved of the worlds, 
and all good qualities and traits. Whensoever a mother seeth that her 
child hath done well, let her praise and applaud him and cheer his 
heart; and if the slightest undesirable trait should manifest itself, 
let her counsel the child and punish him, and use means based on reason,
 even a slight verbal chastisement should this be necessary. It is not, 
however, permissible to strike a child, or vilify him, for the child's 
character will be totally perverted if he be subjected to blows or 
verbal abuse.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 95, pp. 124-25)</p>
<p>	2130. ...it is incumbent upon the father and mother to train their 
children both in good conduct and the study of books; study, that is, to
 the degree required, so that no child, whether girl or boy, will remain
 illiterate....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec 101, p. 127)<br>

</p><p>	2131. 'Abdu'l-Baha's supreme joy is in observing that a number 
of leaves from among the handmaidens of the Blessed Beauty have been 
educated, that they are the essence of detachment, and are well-informed
 of the mysteries of the world of being; that they raise such a call in 
their glorification and praise of the Greatest Name as to cause the 
inmates of the Fanes of the Kingdom to become attracted and overjoyed, 
and that they recite prayers in prose and poetry, and melodiously chant 
the divine verses. I cherish the hope that thou wilt be one of them, 
wilt cast forth pearls, wilt be constantly engaged in singing His praise
 and wilt intone celestial strains in glorification of His 
attributes....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2132. ...Thou hast written about the girls' school. What was 
previously written still holdeth true. There can be no improvement 
unless the girls are brought up in schools and centres of learning, 
unless they are taught the sciences and other branches of knowledge, and
 unless they acquire the manifold arts, as necessary, and are divinely 
trained. For the day will come when these girls will become mothers. 
Mothers are the first educators of children, who establish virtues in 
the child's inner nature. They encourage the child to acquire 
perfections and goodly manners, warn him against unbecoming qualities, 
and encourage him to show forth resolve, firmness, and endurance under 
hardship, and to advance on the high road to progress. Due regard for 
the education of girls is, therefore, necessary. This is a very 
important subject, and it should be administered and organized under the
 aegis of the Spiritual Assembly....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2133. ...it is incumbent upon the girls of this glorious era to be 
fully versed in the various branches of knowledge, in sciences and the 
arts and all the wonders of this pre-eminent time, that they may then 
educate their children and train them from their earliest days in the 
ways of perfection.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2134. Furthermore, the education of woman is more necessary and 
important than that of man, for woman is the trainer of the child from 
its infancy. If she be defective and imperfect herself, the child will 
necessarily be deficient; therefore, imperfection of woman implies a<br>
 condition of imperfection in all mankind, for it is the mother who 
rears, nurtures and guides the growth of the child. This is not the 
function of the father. If the educator be incompetent, the educated 
will be correspondingly lacking. This is evident and incontrovertible. 
Could the student be brilliant and accomplished if the teacher is 
illiterate and ignorant? The mothers are the first educators of mankind;
 if they be imperfect, alas for the condition and future of the race.</p>
<p>	It has been objected by some that woman is not equally capable with 
man and that she is deficient by creation. This is pure imagination. The
 difference in capability between man and woman is due entirely to 
opportunity and education. Heretofore woman has been denied the right 
and privilege of equal development. If equal opportunity be granted her,
 there is no doubt she would be the peer of man. History will evidence 
this. In past ages noted women have arisen in the affairs of nations and
 surpassed men in their accomplishments....</p>
<p>	The purpose, in brief, is this: that if woman be fully educated and 
granted her rights, she will attain the capacity for wonderful 
accomplishments and prove herself the equal of man. She is the coadjutor
 of man, his complement and helpmeet. Both are human; both are endowed 
with potentialities of intelligence and embody the virtues of humanity. 
In all human powers and functions they are partners and coequals. At 
present in spheres of human activity woman does not manifest her natal 
prerogatives, owing to lack of education and opportunity. Without doubt 
education will establish her equality with men....</p>
<p>("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by<br>
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada<br>
in 1912", pp. 133-37) </p>
<p>	2135. In proclaiming the oneness of mankind He taught that men and 
women are equal in the sight of God and that there is no distinction to 
be made between them. The only difference between them now is due to 
lack of education and training. If woman is given equal opportunity of 
education, distinction and estimate of inferiority will disappear....</p>
<p>	He promulgated the adoption of the same course of education for man 
and woman. Daughters and sons must follow the same curriculum<br>
 of study, thereby promoting unity of the sexes. When all mankind shall 
receive the same opportunity of education and the equality of men and 
women be realized, the foundations of war will be utterly destroyed....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912, 
pp. 17475)</p>
<p>	2136. Why should a woman be left mentally undeveloped? Science is 
praiseworthy -- whether investigated by the intellect of man or woman. 
So, little by little, woman advanced, giving increasing evidence of 
equal capabilities with man -- whether in scientific research, political
 ability or any other sphere of human activity. The conclusion is 
evident that woman has been outdistanced through lack of education and 
intellectual facilities. If given the same educational opportunities or 
course of study, she would develop the same capacity and abilities.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 281)</p>
<p>	2137. Baha'u'llah has announced that inasmuch as ignorance and lack 
of education are barriers of separation among mankind, all must receive 
training and instruction. Through this provision the lack of mutual 
understanding will be remedied and the unity of mankind furthered and 
advanced. Universal education is a universal law. It is, therefore, 
incumbent upon every father to teach and instruct his children according
 to his possibilities. If he is unable to educate them, the body 
politic, the representative of the people, must provide the means for 
their education.</p>
<p>	The sex distinction which exists in the human world is due to the 
lack of education for woman, who has been denied equal opportunity for 
development and advancement. Equality of the sexes will be established 
in proportion to the increased opportunities afforded woman in this age,
 for man and woman are equally the recipients of powers and endowments 
from God, the Creator. God has not ordained distinction between them in 
His consummate purpose.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 300)</p>
<p>	2138. The education of each child is compulsory.... In addition to 
this widespread education each child must be taught a profession, art, 
or<br>
 trade, so that every member of the community will be enabled to earn 
his own livelihood. Work done in the spirit of service is the highest 
form of worship....</p>
<p>	("'Abdu'l-Baha on Divine Philosophy", p. 78)</p>
<p>	2139. Devote ye particular attention to the school for girls, for 
the greatness of this wondrous Age will be manifested as a result of 
progress in the world of women. This is why ye observe that in every 
land the world of women is on the march, and this is due to the impact 
of the Most Great Manifestation, and the power of the teachings of God.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- Translated from the Persian, published in "Baha'i Education, a compilation", p. 37)</p>
<p>	2140. Our hearts rejoiced at thy letter concerning a school for girls.</p>
<p>	Praised be God that there is now a school of this type in Tihran 
where young maidens can, through His bounty, receive an education and 
with all vigour acquire the accomplishments of humankind. Erelong will 
women in every field keep pace with the men. Until now, in Persia, the 
means for women's advancement were non-existent. But now, God be 
thanked, ever since the dawning of the Morn of Salvation, they have been
 going forward day by day. The hope is that they will take the lead in 
virtues and attainments, in closeness to the Court of Almighty God, in 
faith and certitude -- and that the women of the East will become the 
envy of the women of the West.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- Translated from the Persian, published in "Baha'i Education, a compilation", p. 48)</p>
<p>	Extract From a Letter Written by the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	2141. The cause of universal education, which has already enlisted 
in its service an army of dedicated people from every faith and nation, 
deserves the utmost support that the governments of the world can lend 
it. For ignorance is indisputably the principal reason for the decline 
and fall of peoples and the perpetuation of prejudice. No nation can 
achieve success unless education is accorded all its citizens. Lack of 
resources limits the ability of many nations to fulfil this necessity, 
imposing a certain ordering of priorities. The decision-making agencies 
involved would do well to consider giving first priority to the 
education of women and girls, since it<br>
 is through educated mothers that the benefits of knowledge can be most 
effectively and rapidly diffused throughout society. In keeping with the
 requirements of the times, consideration should also be given to 
teaching the concept of world citizenship as part of the standard 
education of every child.</p>
<p>	(October 1985 to the Peoples of the World)</p>
<p>	Extracts From Letters Written on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	2142. A very important element in the attainment of such equality is
 Baha'u'llah's provision that boys and girls must follow essentially the
 same curriculum in schools.</p>
<p>	(28 December 1980 to the National Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand)</p>
<p>	2143. The House of Justice regards the need to educate and guide 
women in their primary responsibility as mothers as an excellent 
opportunity for organizing women's activities. Your efforts should focus
 on helping them in their function as educators of the rising 
generation. Women should also be encouraged to attract their husbands 
and male members of their families to the Faith so that the Baha'i 
community will be representative of the society of which it forms a 
part. Gradually the spirit of unity and fellowship, as set forth in our 
teachings, will be reflected in the life of Baha'i families.</p>
<p>	(29 February 1984 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Mariana Islands)</p>
<p>	III. Application of the Principle of Equality to Family Life</p>
<p>	Extracts From the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	2144. Steadfastness in the Cause is mentioned in the Tablets and set
 forth by the Pen of the Ancient of Days. Render thanks to the Beloved 
of the world that thou hast set thy heart on Him and art uttering His 
praise. Many a man hath in this day been deprived of making mention of 
the All-Sufficing Lord and of recognizing His truth; and many a woman 
hath fixed her gaze upon the Horizon of the Most High, and hath adorned 
herself with the garb of the love of the Desire of the world. This is 
God's grace which He bestoweth upon whomsoever He pleaseth. By the 
Day-Star<br>
 of ancient mysteries! The sweet-scented fragrance of every breath 
breathed in the love of God is wafted in the court of the presence of 
the Lord of Revelation. The reward of no good deed is or ever will be 
lost. Blessed art thou, doubly blessed art thou! Thou art reckoned 
amongst those handmaidens whose love for their kin hath not prevented 
them from attaining the shores of the Sea of Grace and Mercy. God 
willing, thou shalt rest eternally neath the shade of the favours of the
 All-Merciful and shalt be assured of His bounties. Engage in the praise
 of the True One and rejoice in His loving-kindness.</p>
<p>	The world passeth away, and that which is everlasting is the love of
 God. God willing, thou shalt circumambulate the True One in every world
 of His worlds and shalt be free from all else save Him....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	2145. All should know, and in this regard attain the splendours of 
the sun of certitude, and be illumined thereby: Women and men have been 
and will always be equal in the sight of God. The Dawning-Place of the 
Light of God sheddeth its radiance upon all with the same effulgence. 
Verily God created women for men, and men for women. The most beloved of
 people before God are the most steadfast and those who have surpassed 
others in their love for God, exalted be His glory....</p>
<p>	The friends of God must be adorned with the ornament of justice, 
equity, kindness and love. As they do not allow themselves to be the 
object of cruelty and transgression, in like manner they should not 
allow such tyranny to visit the handmaidens of God. He, verily, speaketh
 the truth and commandeth that which benefitteth His servants and 
handmaidens. He is the Protector of all in this world and the next.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	Extracts From the Writings and Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	2146. The Lord, peerless is He, hath made woman and man to abide 
with each other in the closest companionship, and to be even as a single
 soul. They are two helpmates, two intimate friends, who should be 
concerned about the welfare of each other.</p>
<p>	If they live thus, they will pass through this world with perfect 
contentment, bliss, and peace of heart, and become the object of divine 
grace and favour in the Kingdom of heaven. But if they do other than<br>
 this, they will live out their lives in great bitterness, longing at 
every moment for death, and will be shamefaced in the heavenly realm.</p>
<p>	Strive, then, to abide, heart and soul, with each other as two doves in the nest, for this is to be blessed in both worlds.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec 92, p. 122)</p>
<p>	2147. ...following the precepts of God and the holy Law, suckle your
 children from their infancy with the milk of a universal education, and
 rear them so that from their earliest days, within their inmost heart, 
their very nature, a way of life will be firmly established that will 
conform to the divine Teachings in all things.</p>
<p>	For mothers are the first educators, the first mentors; and truly it
 is the mothers who determine the happiness, the future greatness, the 
courteous ways and learning and judgement, the understanding and the 
faith of their little ones.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 96, p. 126)</p>
<p>	2148. ...it is enjoined upon the father and mother, as a duty, to 
strive with all effort to train the daughter and the son, to nurse them 
from the breast of knowledge and to rear them in the bosom of sciences 
and arts. Should they neglect this matter, they shall be held 
responsible and worthy of reproach in the presence of the stern Lord.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 98, p. 127)</p>
<p>	2149. O ye loving mothers, know ye that in God's sight, the best of 
all ways to worship Him is to educate the children and train them in all
 the perfections of humankind; and no nobler deed than this can be 
imagined.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 144, p. 139)</p>
<p>	2150. Note ye how easily, where unity existeth in a given family, 
the affairs of that family are conducted; what progress the members of 
that family make, how they prosper in the world. Their concerns are in 
order, they enjoy comfort and tranquillity, they are secure, their 
position is assured, they come to be envied by all. Such a family but 
addeth to its stature and its lasting honour, as day succeedeth day....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 221, p. 279)<br>

</p><p>	2151. You have asked whether a husband would be able to prevent 
his wife from embracing the divine light or a wife dissuade her husband 
from gaining entry into the Kingdom of God. In truth neither of them 
could prevent the other from entering into the Kingdom, unless the 
husband hath an excessive attachment to the wife or the wife to the 
husband. Indeed when either of the two worshippeth the other to the 
exclusion of God, then each could prevent the other from seeking 
admittance into His Kingdom.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - Translated from the Arabic, published in "Family Life, a compilation", p. 8)</p>
<p>	2152. Question: What is the attitude of your belief toward the family?</p>
<p>	Answer: According to the teachings of Baha'u'llah the family, being a
 human unit, must be educated according to the rules of sanctity. All 
the virtues must be taught the family. The integrity of the family bond 
must be constantly considered, and the rights of the individual members 
must not be transgressed. The rights of the son, the father, the mother 
-- none of them must be transgressed, none of them must be arbitrary. 
Just as the son has certain obligations to his father, the father, 
likewise, has certain obligations to his son. The mother, the sister and
 other members of the household have their certain prerogatives. All 
these rights and prerogatives must be conserved, yet the unity of the 
family must be sustained. The injury of one shall be considered the 
injury of all; the comfort of each, the comfort of all; the honor of 
one, the honor of all.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912" 
p. 168)</p>
<p>	Extracts From letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to individual believers unless otherwise cited:</p>
<p>	2153. When such difference of opinion and belief occurs between 
husband and wife it is very unfortunate for undoubtedly it detracts from
 that spiritual bond which is the stronghold of the family bond, 
especially in times of difficulty. The way, however, that it could be 
remedied is not by acting in such wise as to alienate the other party. 
One of the objects of the Cause is actually to bring about a closer bond
 in the homes. In all such cases, therefore, the Master used to advise 
obedience to the wishes of the other party and prayer. Pray that your 
husband may gradually see<br>
 the light and at the same time so act as to draw him nearer rather than
 prejudice him. Once that harmony is secured then you will be able to 
serve unhampered.</p>
<p>	(15 July 1928)</p>
<p>	2154. Shoghi Effendi trusts that as a result of his cable and this 
letter your wife will be able to devote a little more time to her 
family, but he also hopes that you will be able to assist her in 
obtaining the time and opportunity to serve a Cause that is so dear and 
near to her heart and in which her services are much appreciated.</p>
<p>	(19 June 1931)</p>
<p>	2155. The Guardian, in his remarks ... about parents' and 
children's, wives' and husbands' relations in America, meant that there 
is a tendency in that country for children to be too independent of the 
wishes of their parents and lacking in the respect due to them. Also 
wives, in some cases, have a tendency to exert an unjust degree of 
domination over their husbands, which, of course, is not right, any more
 than that the husband should unjustly dominate his wife.</p>
<p>	(22 July 1943)</p>
<p>	2156. It is one of the essential teachings of the Faith that unity 
should be maintained in the home. Of course this does not mean that any 
member of the family has a right to influence the faith of any other 
member; and if this is realized by all the members, then it seems 
certain that unity would be feasible.</p>
<p>	(6 July 1952)</p>
<p>	2157. The Guardian fully appreciates your desire to go forth as a 
pioneer at this time, and to help establish the Faith in the virgin 
areas, but you should not go against the wishes of your husband, and 
force him to give up everything in order that you might serve the Faith 
in this manner. We must bear in mind the wishes and the rights of those 
who are closely connected in our lives.</p>
<p>	If your husband wishes you to remain where you are, certainly there is a vast field for teaching there....</p>
<p>	(31 July 1953)<br>

</p><p>	2158. Wherever there is a Baha'i family, those concerned should 
by all means do all they can to preserve it, because divorce is strongly
 condemned in the Teachings, whereas harmony, unity and love are held up
 as the highest ideals in human relationships. This must always apply to
 the Baha'is, whether they are serving in the pioneering field or not.</p>
<p>	(9 November 1956 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Central America)</p>
<p>	Extracts From letters Written on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice to individual believers unless otherwise cited:</p>
<p>	2159. That the first teacher of the child is the mother should not 
be startling, for the primary orientation of the infant is to its 
mother. This provision of nature in no way minimizes the role of the 
father in the Baha'i family. Again, equality of status does not mean 
identity of function.</p>
<p>	(23 June 1974)</p>
<p>	2160. In considering the problems that you and your wife are 
experiencing, the House of Justice points out that the unity of your 
family should take priority over any other consideration. Baha'u'llah 
came to bring unity to the world, and a fundamental unity is that of the
 family. Therefore, we must believe that the Faith is intended to 
strengthen the family, not weaken it. For example, service to the Cause 
should not produce neglect of the family. It is important for you to 
arrange your time so that your family life is harmonious and your 
household receives the attention it requires.</p>
<p>	Baha'u'llah also stressed the importance of consultation. We should 
not think this worthwhile method of seeking solutions is confined to the
 administrative institutions of the Cause. Family consultation employing
 full and frank discussion, and animated by awareness of the need for 
moderation and balance, can be the panacea for domestic conflict. Wives 
should not attempt to dominate their husbands, nor husbands their 
wives....</p>
<p>	(1 August 1978)</p>
<p>	2161. Noting that you and your husband have consulted about your 
family problems with your Spiritual Assembly but did not receive any 
advice, and<br>
 also discussed your situation with a family counsellor without success,
 the House of Justice feels it most essential for your husband and you 
to understand that marriage can be a source of well-being, conveying a 
sense of security and spiritual happiness. However, it is not something 
that just happens. For marriage to become a haven of contentment it 
requires the cooperation of the marriage partners themselves, and the 
assistance of their families....</p>
<p>	(24 June 1979)</p>
<p>	2162. The members of a family all have duties and responsibilities 
towards one another and to the family as a whole, and these duties and 
responsibilities vary from member to member because of their natural 
relationships. The parents have the inescapable duty to educate their 
children -- but not vice versa; the children have the duty to obey their
 parents -- the parents do not obey the children; the mother -- not the 
father -- bears the children, nurses them in babyhood, and is thus their
 first educator; hence daughters have a prior right to education over 
sons and, as the Guardian's secretary has written on his behalf, 'The 
task of bringing up a Baha'i child, as emphasized time and again in 
Baha'i Writings, is the chief responsibility of the mother, whose unique
 privilege is indeed to create in her home such conditions as would be 
most conducive to both his material and spiritual welfare and 
advancement. The training which a child first receives through his 
mother constitutes the strongest foundation for his future 
development..." A corollary of this responsibility of the mother is her 
right to be supported by her husband -- a husband has no explicit right 
to be supported by his wife....</p>
<p>	In any group, however loving the consultation, there are 
nevertheless points on which, from time to time, agreement cannot be 
reached. In a Spiritual Assembly this dilemma is resolved by a majority 
vote. There can, however, be no majority where only two parties are 
involved, as in the case of a husband and wife. There are, therefore, 
times when a wife should defer to her husband, and times when a husband 
should defer to his wife, but neither should ever unjustly dominate the 
other. In short, the relationship between husband and wife should be as 
held forth in the prayer revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha which is often read at
 Baha'i weddings:<br>
 "Verily, they are married in obedience to Thy command. Cause them to 
become the signs of harmony and unity until the end of time."</p>
<p>	These are all relationships within the family, but there is a much 
wider sphere of relationships between men and women than in the home, 
and this too we should consider in the context of Baha'i society, not in
 that of past or present social norms. For example, although the mother 
is the first educator of the child, and the most important formative 
influence in his development, the father also has the responsibility of 
educating his children, and this responsibility is so weighty that 
Baha'u'llah has stated that a father who fails to exercise it forfeits 
his rights of fatherhood. Similarly, although the primary responsibility
 for supporting the family financially is placed upon the husband, this 
does not by any means imply that the place of woman is confined to the 
home....</p>
<p>	(28 December 1980 to the National Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand)</p>
<p>	2163. You have asked, however, for specific rules of conduct to 
govern the relationships of husbands and wives. This the House of 
Justice does not wish to do, and it feels that there is already adequate
 guidance included in the compilation on this subject. For example the 
principle that the rights of each and all in the family unit must be 
upheld, and the advice that loving consultation should be the keynote, 
that all matters should be settled in harmony and love, and that there 
are times when the husband and the wife should defer to the wishes of 
the other. Exactly under what circumstances such deference should take 
place, is a matter for each couple to determine....</p>
<p>	(16 May 1982)</p>
<p>	2164. You ask about the admonition that everyone must work, and want
 to know if this means that you, a wife and mother, must work for a 
livelihood as your husband does. We are requested to enclose for your 
perusal an excerpt, "The twelfth Glad-Tidings", from Baha'u'llah's 
"Tablet of Bisharat".[3] You will see that the directive is for the 
friends to be engaged in an occupation which will be of benefit to 
mankind. Homemaking is a highly honourable and responsible work of 
fundamental importance for mankind....<br>
 [3 This passage appears in the present compilation under<br>
Section IV., page 21.]<br>

</p><p>	(16 June 1982)</p>
<p>	2165. With regard to your question whether mothers should work 
outside the home, it is helpful to consider the matter from the 
perspective of the concept of a Baha'i family. This concept is based on 
the principle that the man has primary responsibility for the financial 
support of the family, and the woman is the chief and primary educator 
of the children. This by no means implies that these functions are 
inflexibly fixed and cannot be changed and adjusted to suit particular 
family situations, nor does it mean that the place of the woman is 
confined to the home. Rather, while primary responsibility is assigned, 
it is anticipated that fathers would play a significant role in the 
education of the children and women could also be breadwinners. As you 
rightly indicated, 'Abdu'l-Baha encouraged women to "participate fully 
and equally in the affairs of the world".</p>
<p>	In relation to your specific queries, the decision concerning the 
amount of time a mother may spend in working outside the home depends on
 circumstances existing within the home, which may vary from time to 
time. Family consultation will help to provide the answers....</p>
<p>	(9 August 1984)</p>
<p>	2166. The great importance attached to the mother's role derives 
from the fact that she is the first educator of the child. Her attitude,
 her prayers, even what she eats and her physical condition have a great
 influence on the child when it is still in the womb. When the child is 
born, it is she who has been endowed by God with the milk which is the 
first food designed for it, and it is intended that, if possible, she 
should be with the baby to train and nurture it in its earliest days and
 months. This does not mean that the father does not also love, pray 
for, and care for his baby, but as he has the primary responsibility of 
providing for the family, his time to be with his child is usually 
limited, while the mother is usually closely associated with the baby 
during this intensely formative time when it is growing and developing 
faster than it ever will again during the whole of its life. As the 
child grows older and more independent, the relative nature of its 
relationship with its mother and father modifies and the father can play
 a greater role.</p>

</p><p>	IV. Women in the World at Large</p>
<p>	Extract From the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	2167. It is enjoined upon every one of you to engage in some form of
 occupation, such as crafts, trades and the like. We have graciously 
exalted your engagement in such work to the rank of worship unto God, 
the True One. Ponder ye in your hearts the grace and the blessings of 
God and render thanks unto Him at eventide and at dawn. Waste not your 
time in idleness and sloth. Occupy yourselves with that which profiteth 
yourselves and others. Thus hath it been decreed in this Tablet from 
whose horizon the day-star of wisdom and utterance shineth resplendent.</p>
<p>	The most despised of men in the sight of God are those who sit idly 
and beg. Hold ye fast unto the cord of material means, placing your 
whole trust in God, the Provider of all means. When anyone occupieth 
himself in a craft or trade, such occupation itself is regarded in the 
estimation of God as an act of worship; and this is naught but a token 
of His infinite and all-pervasive bounty.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 26)</p>
<p>	Extracts From the Writings and Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	2168. The handmaidens of God and the bondsmaids in His divine Court 
should reveal such attributes and attitudes amongst the women of the 
world as would cause them to stand out and achieve renown in the circles
 of women. That is, they should associate with them with supreme 
chastity and steadfast decency, with unshakeable faith, articulate 
speech, an eloquent tongue, irrefutable testimony and high resolve. 
Beseech God that thou mayest attain unto all these bounties.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2169. Until the reality of equality between man and woman is fully 
established and attained, the highest social development of mankind is 
not possible. Even granted that woman is inferior to man in some degree 
of capacity or accomplishment, this or any other distinction would 
continue to be productive of discord and trouble. The only remedy is 
education, opportunity; for equality means equal qualification....<br>

</p><p>	And let it be known once more that until woman and man recognize
 and realize equality, social and political progress here or anywhere 
will not be possible....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912, 
pp. 76-77)</p>
<p>	2170. ...the principle of religion has been revealed by Baha'u'llah 
that woman must be given the privilege of equal education with man and 
full right to his prerogatives. That is to say, there must be no 
difference in the education of male and female in order that womankind 
may develop equal capacity and importance with man in the social and 
economic equation. Then the world will attain unity and harmony. In past
 ages humanity has been defective and inefficient because it has been 
incomplete. War and its ravages have blighted the world; the education 
of woman will be a mighty step toward its abolition and ending, for she 
will use her whole influence against war. Woman rears the child and 
educates the youth to maturity. She will refuse to give her sons for 
sacrifice upon the field of battle. In truth, she will be the greatest 
factor in establishing universal peace and international arbitration. 
Assuredly, woman will abolish warfare among mankind....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 108)</p>
<p>	2171. Again, it is well established in history that where woman has 
not participated in human affairs the outcomes have never attained a 
state of completion and perfection. On the other hand, every influential
 undertaking of the human world wherein woman has been a participant has
 attained importance. This is historically true and beyond disproof even
 in religion. Jesus Christ had twelve disciples and among His followers a
 woman known as Mary Magdalene. Judas Iscariot had become a traitor and 
hypocrite, and after the crucifixion the remaining eleven disciples were
 wavering and undecided. It is certain from the evidence of the Gospels 
that the one who comforted them and reestablished their faith was Mary 
Magdalene.</p>
<p>	The most momentous question of this day is international peace and 
arbitration, and universal peace is impossible without universal 
suffrage. . . .<br>

</p><p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 134)</p>
<p>	2172. Question: Is it not a fact that universal peace cannot be 
accomplished until there is political democracy in all the countries of 
the world?</p>
<p>	Answer: It is very evident that in the future there shall be no 
centralization in the countries of the world, be they constitutional in 
government, republican or democratic in form. The United States may be 
held up as the example of future government -- that is to say, each 
province will be independent in itself, but there will be federal union 
protecting the interests of the various independent states. It may not 
be a republican or a democratic form. To cast aside centralization which
 promotes despotism is the exigency of the time. This will be productive
 of international peace. Another fact of equal importance in bringing 
about international peace is woman 's suffrage. That is to say, when 
perfect equality shall be established between men and women, peace may 
be realized for the simple reason that womankind in general will never 
favor warfare. Women will not be willing to allow those whom they have 
so tenderly cared for to go to the battlefield. When they shall have a 
vote, they will oppose any cause of warfare. Another factor which will 
bring about universal peace is the linking together of the Orient and 
the Occident.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 167)</p>
<p>	2173. When all mankind shall receive the same opportunity of 
education and the equality of men and women be realized, the foundations
 of war will be utterly destroyed. Without equality this will be 
impossible because all differences and distinction are conducive to 
discord and strife. Equality between men and women is conducive to the 
abolition of warfare for the reason that women will never be willing to 
sanction it....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 175)<br>

</p><p>	2174. Woman must especially devote her energies and abilities 
toward the industrial and agricultural sciences, seeking to assist 
mankind in that which is most needful. By this means she will 
demonstrate capability and ensure recognition of equality in the social 
and economic equation....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 283)</p>
<p>	2175. Therefore, strive to show in the human world that women are 
most capable and efficient, that their hearts are more tender and 
susceptible than the hearts of men, that they are more philanthropic and
 responsive toward the needy and suffering, that they are inflexibly 
opposed to war and are lovers of peace. Strive that the ideal of 
international peace may become realized through the efforts of 
womankind, for man is more inclined to war than woman, and a real 
evidence of woman's superiority will be her service and efficiency in 
the establishment of universal peace.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912" 
p. 284)</p>
<p>	2176. ...imbued with the same virtues as man, rising through all the
 degrees of human attainment, women will become the peers of men, and 
until this equality is established, true progress and attainment for the
 human race will not be facilitated.</p>
<p>	The evident reasons underlying this are as follows: Woman by nature 
is opposed to war; she is an advocate of peace. Children are reared and 
brought up by the mothers who give them the first principles of 
education and labor assiduously in their behalf. Consider, for instance,
 a mother who has tenderly reared a son for twenty years to the age of 
maturity. Surely she will not consent to having that son torn asunder 
and killed in the field of battle. Therefore, as woman advances toward 
the degree of man in power and privilege, with the right of vote and 
control in human government, most assuredly war will cease; for woman is
 naturally the most devoted and staunch advocate of international peace.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 375)<br>

</p><p>	2177. According to the spirit of this age, women must advance 
and fulfill their mission in all departments of life, becoming equal to 
men. They must be on the same level as men and enjoy equal rights. This 
is my earnest prayer and it is one of the fundamental principles of 
Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(J. E. Esslemont, "Baha'u'llah and the New Era" p. 147)</p>
<p>	2178. ...The woman is indeed of the greater importance to the race. 
She has the greater burden and the greater work. Look at the vegetable 
and the animal worlds. The palm which carries the fruit is the tree most
 prized by the date grower. The Arab knows that for a long journey the 
mare has the longest wind. For her greater strength and fierceness, the 
lioness is more feared by the hunter than the lion.</p>
<p>	The woman has greater moral courage than the man; she has also 
special gifts which enable her to govern in moments of danger and 
crisis....</p>
<p>	("'Abdu'l-Baha in London: Addresses, and Notes of Conversations" (London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 102-3)</p>
<p>	Extracts From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	2179. Concerning Baha'i representation at the All-Asian Women's 
Conference: this is undoubtedly a most commendable thing to do 
especially as the Cause has so much concerning the position of women in 
society. Shoghi Effendi hopes that the National Assembly will do its 
best to win the admiration of all the assembled delegates for the 
teachings of the Cause along that line. We should always take such 
opportunities that present themselves. Maybe we would succeed to render 
some service to society and alleviate its ills.</p>
<p>	(10 November 1930 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	2180. What 'Abdu'l-Baha meant about the women arising for peace is 
that this is a matter which vitally affects women, and when they form a 
conscious and overwhelming mass of public opinion against war there can 
be no war. The Baha'i women are already organized through being members 
of the Faith and the Administrative Order. No further organization is 
needed. But they should, through teaching and through the active moral 
support they give to every movement directed towards peace, seek to 
exert a strong influence on other women's minds in regard to this 
essential matter.<br>

</p><p>	(24 March 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Extract From a Letter Written by the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	2181. The emancipation of women, the achievement of full equality 
between the sexes, is one of the most important, though less 
acknowledged prerequisites of peace. The denial of such equality 
perpetrates an injustice against one half of the world's population and 
promotes in men harmful attitudes and habits that are carried from the 
family to the workplace, to political life, and ultimately to 
international relations. There are no grounds, moral, practical, or 
biological, upon which such denial can be justified. Only as women are 
welcomed into full partnership in all fields of human endeavour will the
 moral and psychological climate be created in which international peace
 can emerge.</p>
<p>	(October 1985 to the Peoples of the World)</p>
<p>	Extracts From Letters Written on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	2182. ...there is a much wider sphere of relationships between men 
and women than in the home, and this too we should consider in the 
context of Baha'i society, not in that of past or present social norms. 
For example, although the mother is the first educator of the child, and
 the most important formative influence in his development, the father 
also has the responsibility of educating his children, and this 
responsibility is so weighty that Baha'u'llah has stated that a father 
who fails to exercise it forfeits his rights of fatherhood. Similarly, 
although the primary responsibility for supporting the family 
financially is placed upon the husband, this does not by any means imply
 that the place of woman is confined to the home. On the contrary, 
'Abdu'l-Baha has stated:</p>
<p>    In the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah, women are advancing<br>
side by side with men. There is no area or instance where they<br>
will lag behind: they have equal rights with men, and will<br>
enter, in the future, into all branches of the administration<br>
of society. Such will be their elevation that, in every area of<br>
endeavour, they will occupy the highest levels in the human<br>
world....[1]<br>
 [1 The quotation in the original letter which was taken from "Paris 
Talks", p. 182, has been replaced by this revised translation.]<br>

</p><p>	and again:</p>
<p>	So it will come to pass that when women participate fully and 
equally in the affairs of the world, when they enter confidently and 
capably the great arena of laws and politics, war will cease;...</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace", p. 135)</p>
<p>	In the Tablet of the World, Baha'u'llah Himself has envisaged that women as well as men would be breadwinners in stating:</p>
<p>	Everyone, whether man or woman, should hand over to a trusted person
 a portion of what he or she earneth through trade, agriculture or other
 occupation, for the training and education of children, to be spent for
 this purpose with the knowledge of the Trustees of the House of 
Justice.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 90) 
(28 December 1980 to the National Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand)</p>
<p>	2183. The duty of women in being the first educators of mankind is 
clearly set forth in the Writings. It is for every woman, if and when 
she becomes a mother, to determine how best she can discharge on the one
 hand her chief responsibility as a mother and on the other, to the 
extent possible, to participate in other aspects of the activities of 
the society of which she forms a part....</p>
<p>	(22 April 1981 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	V. Fostering the Development of Women</p>
<p>	Extracts From the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	2184. In this Day the Blessed Tree of Remembrance speaketh forth in 
the Kingdom of Utterance saying: Well is it with the servant who hath 
turned his face towards Him, and embraced His truth, and with the 
handmaiden who hath hearkened to His Voice and become of the blissful. 
Verily, she is a champion of the field of true understanding. To this 
the Tongue of Truth beareth witness from His exalted Station.</p>
<p>	O My leaf, blessed art thou for having responded to My call when it 
was raised in the name of the True One. Thou didst recognize My 
Revelation when men of renown were immersed in manifest idle fancies. 
Thou hast verily attained the mercy of thy Lord time and again. Render 
thanks unto Him and glorify Him with thy Praise. He is, in truth, with 
His<br>
 handmaidens and servants who have turned towards Him. The shining glory
 from the Horizon of My Kingdom be upon thee and upon the one who hath 
guided thee to My straight path.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	2185. We beseech the True One to adorn His handmaidens with the 
ornament of chastity, of trustworthiness, of righteousness and of 
purity. Verily, He is the All-Bestowing, the All-Generous. We make 
mention of the handmaidens of God at this time and announce unto them 
the glad-tidings of the tokens of the mercy and compassion of God and 
His consideration for them, glorified be He, and We supplicate Him for 
all His assistance to perform such deeds as are the cause of the 
exaltation of His Word. He verily speaketh the truth and enjoineth upon 
His servants and His handmaidens that which will profit them in every 
world of His worlds. He, verily, is the All-Forgiving, the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	Extracts From the Writings and Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	2186. The effulgence of the rays of the Sun of Truth is abundant and
 the favours of the Blessed Beauty surround the women believers and the 
handmaidens who have attained unto certitude. At every moment a 
bounteous bestowal is revealed. The handmaidens of the Merciful should 
seize the opportunities afforded in these days. Each one should strive 
to draw nigh unto the divine Threshold and seek bounties from the Source
 of existence. She should attain such a state and be confirmed with such
 a power as to make, with but the utterance of one word, a lowly person 
to be held in reverence, initiate him who is deprived into the world of 
the spirit, impart hope to the despondent, endow the portionless one 
with a share of the great bestowal, and confer knowledge and insight 
upon the ignorant and the blind, and alertness and vigilance on the 
indolent and heedless. This is the attribute of the handmaidens of the 
Merciful. This is the characteristic of the bondsmaids of God's 
Threshold.</p>
<p>	O ye leaves who have attained certitude! In the countries of Europe 
and America the maidservants of the Merciful have won the prize of 
excellence and advancement from the arena of men, and in the fields of 
teaching and spreading the divine fragrances they have shown a brilliant
 hand. Soon they will soar like the birds of the Concourse on high in 
the<br>
 far corners of the world and will guide the people and reveal to them 
the divine mysteries. Ye, who are the blessed leaves from the East, 
should burn more brightly, and engage in spreading the sweet savours of 
the Lord and in reciting the verses of God. Arise, therefore, and exert 
yourselves to fulfil the exhortations and counsels of the Blessed 
Beauty, that all hopes may be realized and that the plain of streams and
 orchards may become the garden of oneness.</p>
<p>	Upon ye, men and women, be the glory of glories.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2187. In this great Cycle and wondrous Dispensation some women have 
been raised up who were the emblems of unity and ensigns of oneness, for
 the revelation of divine bestowals is received by men and women in 
equal measure. "Verily the most honoured in the sight of God is the most
 virtuous amongst you"[1] is applicable to both men and women, to 
servants and handmaidens. All are under the shadow of the Word of God 
and all derive their strength from the bounties of the Lord. Therefore, 
do not consider thyself to be insignificant by doubting what a 
handmaiden living behind the veil can do....<br>
 [1 Qur'an 49:13]</p>
<p>	With a firm heart, a steadfast step and an eloquent tongue arise to 
spread the Word of God and say: "O God, although I am sitting concealed 
behind the screen of chastity and am restricted by the veil and 
exigencies of modesty, my cherished hope is to raise the banner of 
service and to become a maidservant at Thy Holy Threshold; to ride on a 
charger and penetrate the army of the ignorant, defeat the mighty 
regiments and subvert the foundations of error and violation. Thou art 
the Helper of the weak, Thou art the Sustainer of the poor, Thou art the
 Succourer of the handmaidens. Verily, Thou art the Almighty and 
All-Powerful."</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2188. Confirmations from the kingdom of God will assuredly be 
received, enabling some radiant leaves to appear resplendent in the 
assemblage of this world with clear proofs and convincing reasons, which
 will adorn the cause of womanhood. They will prove that in this cycle 
women are equal to men, nay, in certain respects they will excel. Ponder
 ye: in this<br>
 wonderful Cause numerous were the men who scaled the heights of 
knowledge; they had a brilliant utterance, a convincing proof, an 
eloquent tongue and magnificent speech, but the blessed leaf, 
Jinab-i-Tahirih, because she was a woman, emerged with immense splendour
 and dumbfounded all the people. If she were a man, this would not have 
been so at all. Therefore, ye should know that the greatness of the 
Cause hath penetrated the nerves and veins of the world in such wise 
that if one of the leaves is attracted and gains mastery in 
demonstrating reasons and proofs and in uttering convincing evidences, 
she will shine resplendently. O radiant leaves, I swear by the Beauty of
 the Desired One and the Mystery of Existence that if ye work actively 
in this realm, the outpourings of the Blessed Beauty will reflect as the
 sun in the mirrors of the hearts. Your progress will astonish all.</p>
<p>	The attracted leaves should not, when associating with each other, 
talk merely about the temperature of the weather, the coldness of the 
water, the beauty of the flowers and gardens, the freshness of the grass
 and the flowing water. They should rather restrict their discussions to
 glorification and praise and the uttering of proofs and reasons, to 
quoting verses and traditions and putting forth clear testimonies, so 
that all the homes of the loved ones will be converted into gathering 
places for lessons on teaching the Cause. If ye do so, in a short while 
the outpourings of the Kingdom will be so manifested that each one of 
the handmaidens of the Merciful will become a perspicuous book revealing
 the mysteries of the Lord of Mercy. Upon you be the glory of glories.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2189. In this wondrous Dispensation the favours of the Glorious Lord
 are vouchsafed unto the handmaidens of the Merciful. Therefore, they 
should, like unto men, seize the prize and excel in the field, so that 
it will be proven and made manifest that the penetrative influence of 
the Word of God in this new Dispensation hath caused women to be equal 
with men, and that in the arena of tests they will outdo others. 
Therefore, the true bondsmaids of the Blessed Beauty must be revived by 
the spirit of detachment, and refreshed by the breezes of attraction. 
With hearts overflowing with the love of God, with souls gladdened by 
the heavenly glad-tidings, and with extreme humility and lowliness, let 
them speak out<br>
 with eloquent speech, and praise and glorify the Great Lord, for they 
are the manifestations of His bounty and adorned with the crown of 
splendour.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2190. Blessed, blessed are ye for ye have arranged spiritual 
meetings and engaged in propounding divine proofs and evidences. Ye are 
intent on vindicating truth in support of the manifest Light of the 
Cause, through conclusive arguments and proofs based on the sacred 
scriptures of the past. This is a very noble aim, and this cherished 
hope a cause of the illumination of all peoples and nations.</p>
<p>	From the beginning of existence until the present day, in any of the
 past cycles and dispensations, no assemblies for women have ever been 
established and classes for the purpose of spreading the teachings were 
never held by them. This is one of the characteristics of this glorious 
Dispensation and this great century. Ye should, most certainly, strive 
to perfect this assemblage and increase your knowledge of the realities 
of heavenly mysteries, so that, God willing, in a short time, women will
 become the same as men; they will take a leading position amongst the 
learned, will each have a fluent tongue and eloquent speech, and shine 
like unto lamps of guidance throughout the world. In some respects, 
women have astonishing capacities; they hasten in their attraction to 
God, and are intense in their fiery ardour for Him.</p>
<p>	In brief, spend your nights and days in the study of the holy 
Utterances and in acquiring perfections. Occupy yourselves always in 
discussing these matters. When ye meet each other, convey the 
glad-tidings and impart hope to one another because of the confirmations
 and bounties of the Ancient and Ever-Living Lord. Let each set forth 
proofs and evidences, and talk about the mysteries of the Kingdom, so 
that the true and divine Spirit may permeate the body of the contingent 
world and the secrets of all things, whether of the past or of the 
future, may become openly manifest and resplendent.</p>
<p>	O loved handmaidens of God! Consider not your present merits and 
capacities, rather fix your gaze on the favours and confirmations of the
 Blessed Beauty, because His everlasting grace will make of the 
insignificant plant a blessed tree, will turn the mirage into cool water
 and wine; will cause the forsaken atom to become the very essence of 
being,<br>
 the puny one erudite in the school of knowledge. It enableth a thorny 
bush to give forth blossoms, and the dark earth to produce fragrant and 
rich hyacinths. It will transmute the stone into a ruby of great price, 
and fill the sea shells with brilliant pearls. It will assist a 
fledgling schoolchild to become a learned teacher and enable a frail 
embryo to reveal the reality of the verse: "Hallowed be the Lord, the 
Most Excellent of all creators."[1]<br>
 [1 Qur'an 23:14]</p>
<p>	Verily, my Lord is powerful over things.<br>
	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2191. In this day the duty of everyone, whether man or woman, is to 
teach the Cause. In America, the women have outdone the men in this 
regard and have taken the lead in this field. They strive harder in 
guiding the peoples of the world, and their endeavours are greater. They
 are confirmed by divine bestowals and blessings. It is my hope that in 
the East the handmaids of the Merciful will also exert such effort, 
reveal their powers, and manifest their capacities....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2192. Now is the time to speak forth and to deliver speeches, the 
time to teach and to give testimony. Loosen thy tongue, expound the 
truths, and establish the validity of the verse: "The All-Merciful hath 
taught the Qur'an."[1] The Holy Spirit speaketh through the innermost 
essence of the human tongue, God's Spirit which desireth communion with 
the human soul unfoldeth the truths, the Faithful Spirit writeth down 
and the Spirit of the Ancient of Days confirmeth. I swear by that 
Peerless Beauty, Who is in the Unseen Kingdom, that when the leaves 
loose their tongues in praise and glorification of the All-Loving Lord, 
and in teaching the Cause of the Kind Lord, the concourse of the Kingdom
 and the inmates of the Unseen Realms will give ear, and cry out with 
exclamations of extreme joy and jubilation.<br>
 [1 Qur'an 55:2]</p>
<p>	Glory be upon thee and upon every handmaiden who is steadfast in the Covenant.<br>
	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	2193. O handmaid of God!... To the mothers must be given the 
divine Teachings and effective counsel, and they must be encouraged and 
made eager to train their children, for the mother is the first educator
 of the child. It is she who must, at the very beginning, suckle the 
new-born at the breast of God's Faith and God's Law, that divine love 
may enter into him even with his mother's milk, and be with him till his
 final breath.</p>
<p>	So long as the mother faileth to train her children, and start them 
on a proper way of life, the training which they receive later on will 
not take its full effect. It is incumbent upon the Spiritual Assemblies 
to provide the mothers with a well-planned programme for the education 
of children, showing how, from infancy, the child must be watched over 
and taught. These instructions must be given to every mother to serve 
her as a guide, so that each will train and nurture her children in 
accordance with the Teachings.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.],<br>
	(Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 113, p. 138)</p>
<p>	2194. ...we must not make distinctions between individual members of
 the human family. We must not consider any soul as barren or deprived. 
Our duty lies in educating souls so that the Sun of the bestowals of God
 shall become resplendent in them, and this is possible through the 
power of the oneness of humanity. The more love is expressed among 
mankind and the stronger the power of unity, the greater will be this 
reflection and revelation, for the greatest bestowal of God is love. 
Love is the source of all the bestowals of God. Until love takes 
possession of the heart, no other divine bounty can be revealed in it.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 15)</p>
<p>	2195. In brief, the assumption of superiority by man will continue 
to be depressing to the ambition of woman, as if her attainment to 
equality was creationally impossible; woman's aspiration toward 
advancement will be checked by it, and she will gradually become 
hopeless. On the contrary, we must declare that her capacity is equal, 
even greater than man's. This will inspire her with hope and ambition, 
and her susceptibilities for advancement will continually increase. She 
must not be told and taught that she is weaker and inferior in capacity 
and qualification. If a pupil is<br>
 told that his intelligence is less than his fellow pupils, it is a very
 great drawback and handicap to his progress. He must be encouraged to 
advance by the statement, "You are most capable, and if you endeavour, 
you will attain the highest degree."</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
pp. 76-77)</p>
<p>	2196. The purpose, in brief, is this: that if woman be fully 
educated and granted her rights, she will attain the capacity for 
wonderful accomplishments and prove herself the equal of man. She is the
 coadjutor of man, his complement and helpmeet....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 136)</p>
<p>	2197. The realities of things have been revealed in this radiant 
century, and that which is true must come to the surface. Among these 
realities is the principle of the equality of man and woman -- equal 
rights and prerogatives in all things appertaining to humanity. 
Baha'u'llah declared this reality over fifty years ago. But while this 
principle of equality is true, it is likewise true that woman must prove
 her capacity and aptitude, must show forth the evidences of equality. 
She must become proficient in the arts and sciences and prove by her 
accomplishments that her abilities and powers have merely been latent. 
Demonstrations of force, such as are now taking place in England, are 
neither becoming nor effective in the cause of womanhood and equality. 
Woman must especially devote her energies and abilities toward the 
industrial and agricultural sciences, seeking to assist mankind in that 
which is most needful. By this means she will demonstrate capability and
 ensure recognition of equality in the social and economic equation. 
Undoubtedly God will confirm her in her efforts and endeavours, for in 
this century of radiance Baha'u'llah has proclaimed the reality of the 
oneness of the world of humanity and announced that all nations, peoples
 and races are one....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
pp. 283-84)</p>
<p>	2198. Equality of the sexes will be established in proportion to the
 increased opportunities afforded woman in this age, for man and woman 
are equally<br>
 the recipients of powers and endowments from God, the Creator. God has 
not ordained distinction between them in His consummate purpose.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912, 
p. 300)</p>
<p>	2199. Woman must endeavour then to attain greater perfection, to be 
man's equal in every respect, to make progress in all in which she has 
been backward, so that man will be compelled to acknowledge her equality
 of capacity and attainment.</p>
<p>	In Europe women have made greater progress than in the East, but 
there is still much to be done! When students have arrived at the end of
 their school term an examination takes place, and the result thereof 
determines the knowledge and capacity of each student. So will it be 
with woman; her actions will show her power, there will no longer be any
 need to proclaim it by words. It is my hope that women of the East, as 
well as their Western sisters, will progress rapidly until humanity 
shall reach perfection. God's Bounty is for all and gives power for all 
progress. When men own the equality of women there will be no need for 
them to struggle for their rights! One of the principles then of 
Baha'u'llah is the equality of sex. Women must make the greatest effort 
to acquire spiritual power and to increase in the virtue of wisdom and 
holiness until their enlightenment and striving succeeds in bringing 
about the unity of mankind. They must work with a burning enthusiasm to 
spread the Teaching of Baha'u'llah among the peoples, so that the 
radiant light of the Divine Bounty may envelop the souls of all the 
nations of the world!</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912", pp. 162-63)</p>
<p>	Extracts From Letters Written by Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	2200. Regarding the position of the Baha'i women in India and Burma,
 and their future collaboration with the men in the administrative work 
of the Cause, I feel that the time is now ripe that those women who have
 already conformed to the prevailing custom in India and Burma by 
discarding the veil should not only be given the right to vote for the 
election of their local and national representatives, but should 
themselves be eligible to<br>
 the membership of all Baha'i Assemblies throughout India and Burma, be they local or national.</p>
<p>	This definite and most important step, however, should be taken with
 the greatest care and caution, prudence and thoughtfulness. Due regard 
must be paid to their actual capacity and present attainments, and only 
those who are best qualified for membership, be they men or women, and 
irrespective of social standing, should be elected to the extremely 
responsible position of a member of the Baha'i Assembly.</p>
<p>	This momentous decision, I trust, will prove to be a great incentive
 to the women Baha'is throughout India and Burma who, I hope, will now 
bestir themselves and endeavour to the best of their ability to acquire a
 better and more profound knowledge of the Cause, to take a more active 
and systematic part in the general affairs of the Movement, and prove 
themselves in every way enlightened, responsible and efficient 
co-workers to their fellow-men in their common task for the advancement 
of the Cause throughout their country.</p>
<p>	May they fully realize their high responsibilities in this day, may 
they do all in their power to justify the high hopes we cherish for 
their future, and may they prove themselves in every respect worthy of 
the noble mission which the Baha'i world is now entrusting to their 
charge.</p>
<p>	(27 December 1923 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	2201. Full rights have been accorded to Baha'i women residing in the
 cradle of the Faith, to participate in the membership of both national 
and local Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies, removing thereby the last 
remaining obstacle to the enjoyment of complete equality of rights in 
the conduct of the administrative affairs of the Persian Baha'i 
Community.</p>
<p>	(April 1954, published in "Messages to the Baha'i World 1950-1957" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1971), p. 65)</p>
<p>	2202. That the members of this community, of either sex and of every
 age, of whatever race or background, however limited in experience, 
capacity and knowledge, may arise as one man, and seize with both hands 
the God-given opportunities now presented to them through the 
dispensations of an all-loving, ever-watchful, ever-sustaining 
Providence, and lend thereby a tremendous impetus to the propelling 
forces mysteriously guiding the operations of this newly-launched, 
unspeakably<br>
 potent, world-encompassing Crusade, is one of the dearest wishes which a
 loving and longing heart holds for them at this great turning point in 
the fortunes of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in the American continent.</p>
<p>	(20 June 1954 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States, published in "Citadel of Faith: Messages to America 1947-1957" 
(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), p. 132)</p>
<p>	Extract From Letters and a Telex Written by the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	2203. Concerning the point you raised in your letter ... that the 
women's liberation movement in . .. is assuming extreme positions which 
are having some influence on impressionable Baha'i young women, we feel 
it would be helpful if your Assembly were to stress the unique position 
that women occupy by being members of the Baha'i Faith particularly 
through participation in the administration of its affairs on both a 
local and national scale.</p>
<p>	(9 April 1971 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	2204. 'Abdu'l-Baha has pointed out that "Among the miracles which 
distinguish this sacred dispensation is this, that women have evinced a 
greater boldness than men when enlisted in the ranks of the Faith." 
Shoghi Effendi has further stated that this "boldness" must, in the 
course of time, "be more convincingly demonstrated, and win for the 
beloved Cause victories more stirring than any it has as yet achieved." 
Although obviously the entire Baha'i world is committed to encouraging 
and stimulating the vital role of women in the Baha'i community as well 
as in society at large, the Five Year Plan calls specifically on eighty 
National Spiritual Assemblies to organize Baha'i activities for women. 
In the course of the current year which has been designated 
"International Women's Year" as a world-wide activity of the United 
Nations, the Baha'is, particularly in these eighty national communities,
 should initiate and implement programs which will stimulate and promote
 the full and equal participation of women in all aspects of Baha'i 
community life, so that through their accomplishments the friends will 
demonstrate the distinction of the Cause of God in this field of human 
endeavour. </p>
<p>	(25 May 1975 to all National Spiritual Assemblies)<br>

</p><p>	2205. PARTICULARLY CALL UPON BAHA'I WOMEN, WHOSE CAPACITIES IN 
MANY LANDS STILL LARGELY UNUSED, AND WHOSE POTENTIAL FOR SERVICE CAUSE 
SO GREAT, TO ARISE AND DEMONSTRATE IMPORTANCE PART THEY ARE TO PLAY IN 
ALL FIELDS SERVICE FAITH.</p>
<p>	(24 March 1977 to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	2206. The youth have long been in the forefront of the teaching 
work, and now our hearts rejoice to see the women, in so many lands 
where previously their capacities were largely left unused, devoting 
their capable services to the life of the Baha'i community....</p>
<p>	(Ridvan 1978 to the International Baha'i Convention)</p>
<p>	2207. At the heart of all activities, the spiritual, intellectual 
and community life of the believers must be developed and fostered, 
requiring: the prosecution with increased vigour of the development of 
Local Spiritual Assemblies so that they may exercise their beneficial 
influence and guidance on the life of Baha'i communities; the nurturing 
of a deeper understanding of Baha'i family life; the Baha'i education of
 children, including the holding of regular Baha'i classes and, where 
necessary, the establishment of tutorial schools for the provision of 
elementary education; the encouragement of Baha'i youth in study and 
service; and the encouragement of Baha'i women to exercise to the full 
their privileges and responsibilities in the work of the community -- 
may they befittingly bear witness to the memory of the Greatest Holy 
Leaf, the immortal heroine of the Baha'i Dispensation, as we approach 
the fiftieth anniversary of her passing.</p>
<p>	(Naw Ruz 1979 to the Baha'is of the World)</p>
<p>	2208. The equality of men and women is not, at the present time, 
universally applied. In those areas where traditional inequality still 
hampers its progress we must take the lead in practising this Baha'i 
principle. Baha'i women and girls must be encouraged to take part in the
 social, spiritual and administrative activities of their 
communities....</p>
<p>	(Ridvan 1984 to the Baha'is of the World)<br>

</p><p>	2209. Calling upon local and national Baha'i communities to 
sponsor a wide range of activities which will engage the attention of 
people from all walks of life to various topics relevant to peace, such 
as: the role of women...</p>
<p>	(23 January 1985 to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	Extracts From Letters Written on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	2210. The House of Justice regards the need to educate and guide 
women in their primary responsibility as mothers as an excellent 
opportunity for organizing women's activities. Your efforts should focus
 on helping them in their function as educators of the rising 
generation....</p>
<p>	(29 February 1984 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Mariana Islands)</p>
<p>	2211. The principle of the equality between women and men, like the 
other teachings of the Faith, can be effectively and universally 
established among the friends when it is pursued in conjunction with all
 the other aspects of Baha'i life. Change is an evolutionary process 
requiring patience with one's self and others, loving education and the 
passage of time as the believers deepen their knowledge of the 
principles of the Faith, gradually discard long-held traditional 
attitudes and progressively conform their lives to the unifying 
teachings of the Cause.</p>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE BAHA'I WRITINGS ON THE<br>
	SUBJECT OF WRITERS AND WRITING</p>
<p>	July 1980</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Baha'u'llah</p>
<p>	2212. Thou hast written that one of the friends hath composed a 
treatise. This was mentioned in the Holy Presence, and this is what was 
revealed in response: Great care should be exercised that whatever is 
written in these days doth not cause dissension, and invite the 
objection of the people. Whatever the friends of the one true God say in
 these days is listened to by the people of the world. It hath been 
revealed in the Lawh-i-Hikmat: "The unbelievers have inclined their ears
 towards us in order to hear that which might enable them to cavil 
against God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting."[1] Whatever is 
written should not transgress the bounds of tact and wisdom, and in the 
words used there should lie hid the property of milk, so that the 
children of the world may be nurtured therewith, and attain maturity. We
 have said in the past that one word hath the influence of spring and 
causeth hearts to become fresh and verdant, while another is like unto 
blight which causeth the blossoms and flowers to wither. God grant that 
authors among the friends will write in such a way as would be 
acceptable to fair-minded souls, and not lead to cavilling by the 
people.<br>
 [1 "Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988), p. 141]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet of Baha'u'llah to an individual believer- translated from Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	2213. Say: O men! This is a matchless Day. Matchless must, likewise,
 be the tongue that celebrateth the praise of the Desire of all nations,
 and matchless the deed that aspireth to be acceptable in His sight. The
 whole human race hath longed for this Day, that perchance it may fulfil
 that which well beseemeth its station, and is worthy of its destiny. 
Blessed is the man whom the affairs of the world have failed to deter 
from recognizing Him Who is the Lord of all things.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), sec XVI, p. 39)<br>

</p><p>	2214. How great the multitude of truths which the garment of 
words can never contain! How vast the number of such verities as no 
expression can adequately describe, whose significance can never be 
unfolded, and to which not even the remotest allusions can be made! How 
manifold are the truths which must remain unuttered until the appointed 
time is come! Even as it hath been said: "Not everything that a man 
knoweth can be disclosed, nor can everything that he can disclose be 
regarded as timely, nor can every timely utterance be considered as 
suited to the capacity those who hear it."</p>
<p>	Of these truths some can be disclosed only to the extent of the 
capacity of the repositories of the light of Our knowledge, and the 
recipients of Our hidden grace. We beseech God to strengthen thee with 
His power, and enable thee to recognize Him Who is the Source of all 
knowledge, that thou mayest detach thyself from all human learning, for,
 "what would it profit any man to strive after learning when he hath 
already found and recognized Him Who is the Object of all knowledge?" 
Cleave to the Root of Knowledge, and to Him Who is the Fountain thereof,
 that thou mayest find thyself independent of all who claim to be well 
versed in human learning, and whose claim no clear proof, nor the 
testimony of any enlightening book, can support.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah" sec. LXXXIX, pp. 176-77)</p>
<p>	2215. In this Day the secrets of the earth are laid bare before the 
eyes of men. The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the 
mirror of the world. They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers 
peoples and kindreds. They both reflect them and make them known. They 
are a mirror endowed with hearing, sight and speech. This is an amazing 
and potent phenomenon. However, it behoveth the writers thereof to be 
purged from the promptings of evil passions and desires and to be 
attired with the raiment of justice and equity. They should enquire into
 situations as much as possible and ascertain the facts, then set them 
down in writing.</p>
<p>	(From the Tarazat, published in "Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, pp. 3940)</p>
<p>	2216. It ill beseemeth thee to turn thy gaze unto former or more 
recent times. Make thou mention of this Day and magnify that which hath 
appeared therein. It will in truth suffice all mankind. Indeed 
expositions<br>
 and discourses in explanation of such things cause the spirits to be 
chilled. It behoveth thee to speak forth in such wise as to set the 
hearts of true believers ablaze and cause their bodies to soar.</p>
<p>	Teach thou the Cause of God with an utterance which will cause the 
bushes to be enkindled, and the call "Verily, there is no God but Me, 
the Almighty, the Unconstrained" to be raised therefrom. Say: Human 
utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence and 
needeth moderation. As to its influence, this is conditional upon 
refinement which in turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached and
 pure. As to its moderation, this hath to be combined with tact and 
wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures and Tablets. Meditate upon 
that which hath streamed forth from the heaven of the Will of thy Lord, 
He Who is the Source of all grace, that thou mayest grasp the intended 
meaning which is enshrined in the sacred depths of the Holy Writings.</p>
<p>	(From the Lawh-i-Hikmat, published in "Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, pp. 142-43)</p>
<p>	2217. Every word of thy poetry is indeed like unto a mirror in which
 the evidences of the devotion and love thou cherishest for God and His 
chosen ones are reflected. Well is it with thee who hast quaffed the 
choice wine of utterance and partaken of the soft flowing stream of true
 knowledge. Happy is he who hath drunk his fill and attained unto Him 
and woe betide the heedless. Its perusal hath truly proved highly 
impressive, for it was indicative of both the light of reunion and the 
fire of separation.</p>
<p>	(From the Lawh-i-Maqsud, published in "Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, pp. 175-76)</p>
<p>	From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha</p>
<p>	2218. It is my hope that thou mayest succeed in writing thy book. 
However, the language should be moderate, tempered, and infinitely 
courteous. Look not at the language used by that hostile writer, for he 
was prejudiced and unrefined. Any person with the slightest degree of 
fairness will understand that his writing is totally biased and inspired
 by enmity. This is enough proof that what he hath written is spurious.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	2219. Pure souls, such as Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, upon him be the 
Glory of God, spend their nights and days in demonstrating the truth of 
the Revelation, by adducing conclusive and brilliant proofs and 
expanding the verities of the Faith, by lifting the veils, promoting the
 religion of God and spreading His fragrances.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2220. Great care should be exercised in preparing this translation. 
Mr.... should make a supreme effort so that the language will be most 
exquisite, eloquent and lucid, even if the translated text is to be 
submitted to, and made dependent upon the opinions of, experts in 
language. </p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2221. The subjects to be taught in children's school are many, and 
for lack of time We can touch on only a few: First and most important is
 training in behaviour and good character; the rectification of 
qualities; arousing the desire to become accomplished and acquire 
perfections, and to cleave unto the religion of God and stand firm in 
His Laws: to accord total obedience to every just government, to show 
forth loyalty and trustworthiness to the ruler of the time, to be well 
wishers of mankind, to be kind to all.</p>
<p>	And further, as well as in the ideals of character, instruction in 
such arts and sciences as are of benefit, and in foreign tongues. Also, 
the repeating of prayers for the well-being of ruler and ruled; and the 
avoidance of materialistic works that are current among those who see 
only natural causation, and tales of love, and books that arouse the 
passions. To sum up, let all the lessons be entirely devoted to the 
acquisition of human perfections. Here, then, in brief are directions 
for the curriculum of these schools. Greetings be unto you, and praise.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer, published in "The Baha'i World: 1972-1976, vol. 16, pp. 36-37)</p>
<p>	From a Letter written by Shoghi Effendi to an Individual Believer</p>
<p>	2222. I am overjoyed at such a splendid production. I strongly urge 
you to secure the assistance of one of the best and most respected 
publishers in<br>
 England and to ensure that it will receive the fullest attention 
regarding its outward form and style of printing. The book is correct in
 its presentation of the essentials of the Faith, eminently readable, 
exquisitely arranged, and has a distinctive charm unsurpassed by any 
book of its kind whether written by Eastern or Western believers. I 
heartily recommend it to every earnest and devout teacher of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 11 November 1927 written on his behalf)</p>
<p>	From Letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Individual Believers</p>
<p>	2223. Your literary ability makes you especially qualified to teach 
the Cause. For in the world of today much can be achieved through the 
power of the pen. All you need is to try to deepen your knowledge of the
 history and the teachings of the Faith, and thus well-equipped you will
 assuredly win a glorious success -- Baha'u'llah has given us the 
assurance that He will be always on our side and will give us all the 
help we may need. You should, therefore, arise steadfastly to serve our 
beloved Cause and dedicate the rest of your life to the noble ideal 
which it seeks to realize.</p>
<p>	(30 July 1932)</p>
<p>	2224. What Baha'u'llah meant primarily with "sciences that begin and
 end in words" are those theological treatises and commentaries that 
encumber the human mind rather than help it to attain the truth. The 
students would devote their life to their study but still attain no 
where. Baha'u'llah surely never meant to include story writing under 
such a category; and shorthand and typewriting are both most useful 
talents very necessary in our present social and economic life.</p>
<p>	What you could do, and should do, is to use your stories to become a
 source of inspiration and guidance for those who read them. With such a
 means at your disposal you can spread the spirit and teachings of the 
Cause; you can show the evils that exist in society, as well as the way 
they can be remedied. If you possess a real talent in writing you should
 consider it as given by God and exert your efforts to use it for the 
betterment of society.[1]<br>
 [1 This advice was given to a believer who asked whether such skills as
 shorthand and typing, and the writing of stories dealing with human 
experience, would be classified among those sciences that "begin and end
 in words", as mentioned by Baha'u'llah.]<br>

</p><p>	2225. He has received and read with deepest interest the 
manuscripts you had enclosed in your letter, one entitled "The Ocean of 
His Utterances", and the other consisting of a long poem in which you 
had made an attempt to present the Message indirectly.</p>
<p>	As to this last one, he approves of your suggestion to write a 
sequel to it, and to refer more directly to the Cause. He would, 
however, advise you to couch the whole subject in such a form as to make
 it interesting and appealing to the non-Baha'i reader. The direct 
presentation of the Teachings is surely highly important and even 
indispensable nowadays. But it should be done with utmost care and tact,
 and in a manner that would appeal to the non-believers.</p>
<p>	(31 December 1935)</p>
<p>	2226. There is a great need for teaching the Cause at present; every
 Baha'i should teach, and each one has his own capacities and can expect
 to reach certain souls who respond to his efforts. Your gift of writing
 should by all means be utilized in serving the Cause. Every one is 
perforce only an instrument in giving the Message which is more or less 
coloured by his own capacities and approach to life. There is no harm in
 this. You should write freely what you feel, what you wish to convey to
 the mind of the reader; afterwards you yourself, and those who pass 
upon Baha'i manuscripts and publications, can make sure that all your 
points conform to the teachings. The way you give them out and present 
them is an individual matter and there is no objection to this at all.</p>
<p>	He would not recommend fiction as a means of teaching; the condition
 of the world is too acute to permit of delay in giving them the direct 
teachings, associated with the name of Baha'u'llah. But any suitable 
approach to the Faith, which appeals to this or that group, is certainly
 worthy of effort, as we wish to bring the Cause to all men, in all 
walks of life, of all mentalities.[1]<br>
 [1 This advice was given to a believer who sought the counsel of the 
Guardian on ways one might use writing skills to teach the Faith. The 
believer proposed writing a novel in which the Baha'i teachings and 
their source would be presented indirectly and in such a way as to 
stimulate curiosity and search by the reader. HJ5. 137.032]</p>
<p>	(23 March 1945)<br>

</p><p>	2227. Regarding your question about what courses would be most 
useful for you to study: He feels that both radio and journalistic work 
are fields in which the Baha'is could well learn to express themselves 
for the sake of helping their teaching work, and advises you, if you 
have the time, to study these subjects.</p>
<p>	(15 August 1945)</p>
<p>	2228. Your suggestion regarding a book for the general public is a 
good one. The question is not only have we Baha'is competent to present 
this subject in a way which would catch the attention of the public, but
 also even if such a book existed would it achieve its end? We have, 
unfortunately, not very many capable Baha'i writers, and the condition 
of confusion in the world is such that it seems doubtful if such a work 
would arrest the attention of distracted mankind.</p>
<p>	However, we need more and better Baha'i books, and he suggests you 
present your idea to the German, British and American National Spiritual
 Assemblies.</p>
<p>	(26 October 1950)</p>
<p>	2229. There is no objection to your being a journalist as long as 
you try to keep off political issues; especially the big East-West 
issue. You have a talent for writing, and it might be of help to you 
financially and in making contacts for the Faith.</p>
<p>	(30 November 1950)</p>
<p>	2230. Regarding the advice you asked him for, he feels that to 
devote all one's studies with the object of becoming a Baha'i author, is
 rather risky. We need Baha'i authors badly, but you have to be assured 
that you have the talent to earn your living in that field, and also 
serve the Faith in it.</p>
<p>	He feels that the best thing for you to do is to devote your studies
 to acquiring a sound education, if you like along literary lines, and 
then see what develops.</p>
<p>	(14 May 1957)</p>
<p>	From a Letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	2231. The Universal House of Justice has considered your letter of 6
 December 1979 concerning the novel you are writing involving a<br>
 romantic relationship and asking whether you should continue this 
project in light of the advice of 'Abdu'l-Baha that curricula of schools
 should avoid tales of love.</p>
<p>	We have been asked to say that what should be avoided are stories 
that arouse the passions. From what you say, the purpose of your story 
is to appeal to higher motivations in life and, in fact, to spread the 
spirit and teachings of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(23 December 1979 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Revised - August 1990<br>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT OF YOUTH</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Baha'u'llah</p>
<p>	2232. Blessed is he who in the prime of his youth and the heyday of 
his life will arise to serve the Cause of the Lord of the beginning and 
of the end, and adorn his heart with His love. The manifestation of such
 a grace is greater than the creation of the heavens and of the earth. 
Blessed are the steadfast and well is it with those who are firm. (From a
 Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha</p>
<p>	2233. It is incumbent upon the youth to walk in the footsteps of 
Hakim[1] and to be trained in his ways, for such important souls as he 
and his like have now ascended to the Kingdom of Abha. The youth must 
grow and develop and take the place of their fathers, that this abundant
 grace, in the posterity of each one of the loved ones of God who bore 
great agonies, may day by day increase, until in the end it shall yield 
its fruit on earth and in Heaven.<br>
 [1] One of the distinguished believers of Qazvin</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2234. Wherefore, O ye illumined youth, strive by night and by day to
 unravel the mysteries of the mind and spirit, and to grasp the secrets 
of the Day of God. Inform yourselves of the evidences that the Most 
Great Name hath dawned. Open your lips in praise. Adduce convincing 
arguments and proofs. Lead those who thirst to the fountain of life; 
grant ye true health to the ailing. Be ye apprentices of God; be ye 
physicians directed by God, and heal ye the sick among humankind. Bring 
those who have been excluded into the circle of intimate friends. Make 
the despairing to be filled with hope. Waken them that slumber; make the
 heedless mindful.</p>
<p>	Such are the fruits of this earthly life. Such is the station of resplendent glory. Upon you be Baha'u'l-Abha.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2235. O Lord! Make this youth radiant and confer Thy bounty upon 
this poor creature. Bestow upon him knowledge, grant him added strength<br>
 at the break of every morn and guard him within the shelter of Thy 
protection so that he may be freed from error, may devote himself to the
 service of Thy Cause, may guide the wayward, lead the hapless, free the
 captives and awaken the heedless, that all may be blessed with Thy 
remembrance and praise. Thou art the Mighty and the Powerful.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	From Letters Written by Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	2236. What you have undertaken to achieve, under the guidance and 
instruction, of that valiant and indefatigable servant of the Abha 
Threshold, my well-beloved brother Dr. Bagdadi, is highly praiseworthy 
and of supreme importance. Never flinch in your great enterprise. Deepen
 your knowledge of the Cause. Strive to extend the sphere of your 
activities and seek to understand and promote the harmony that must 
exist between true science and Divine Revelation. I will never fail to 
pray for you. I have great hopes in the ultimate triumph of the task 
before you.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 23
 January 1924 written on his behalf to the Baha'i Youth of Chicago, 
Illinois, U.S.A.)</p>
<p>	2237. The Baha'i youth must be taught how to teach the Cause of God.
 Their knowledge of the fundamentals of the Faith must be deepened and 
the standard of their education in science and literature enhanced. They
 must become thoroughly familiar with the language used and the example 
set by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His public addresses throughout the West. They 
must also be acquainted with those essential prerequisites of teaching 
as recorded in the Holy Books and Tablets.</p>
<p>	(9 June 1925 to the Spiritual Assembly of the East- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2238. I strongly urge you to devote, while you are pursuing your 
studies, as much time as you possibly can to a thorough study of the 
history and Teachings of our Beloved Cause. This is the prerequisite of a
 future successful career of service to the Baha'i Faith in which I hope
 and pray you will distinguish yourself in the days to come.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 18 May 1926 written on his behalf to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	2239. The youthful and eager workers for the Cause ... occupy a 
warm place in my heart. I will remember their hopes, their plans, their 
activities in my hours of prayer at the Holy Shrine. I urge them to 
study profoundly the revealed utterances of Baha'u'llah and the 
discourses of 'Abdu'l-Baha and not to rely unduly on the representation 
and interpretation of the Teachings given by Baha'i speakers and 
teachers. May the Almighty sustain you and guide you in your work.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 20
 March 1929 written on his behalf to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2240. The work in which you are engaged is dear and near to my heart
 and constitutes one of the most vital aspects of the manifold 
activities of our beloved Faith. The highest standards of purity, of 
integrity, of detachment and sacrifice must be maintained by the members
 of your group in order to enable you to play a decisive part in the 
spread and consolidation of the Faith. A tremendous responsibility has 
been laid upon you, and nothing short of a pure, a virtuous, an active 
and truly exemplary life can enable you to fulfil your high destiny. I 
will pray that you may be guided and strengthened to render the most 
effective service to the Cause and by your example lend a fresh impetus 
to the onward march of its new-born institutions.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 6 
September 1934 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the United States and Canada Youth Council)</p>
<p>	From letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	2241. If the younger Baha'i generation, in whom Shoghi Effendi has 
great hopes, take the pain of studying the Cause deeply and thoroughly, 
read its history, find its underlying principles and become both well 
informed and energetic, they surely can achieve a great deal. It is upon
 their shoulders that the Master has laid the tremendous work of 
teaching. They are the ones to raise the call of the Kingdom and arouse 
the people from slumber. If they fail the Cause is doomed to 
stagnation....</p>
<p>	(26 April 1923 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India and Burma)<br>

</p><p>	2242. His hope, as well as that of the friends, is that you 
should increase both in number and spirituality. The future of this 
Cause, which is so dear to us all, depends upon the energy and devotion 
of the rising generation. It is you who before long will be called to 
shoulder its responsibilities and undertake its spread. To do that, 
however, you ought to be well equipped. You ought to have your 
intellectual as well as spiritual side equally developed....</p>
<p>	(28 December 1925 to the Baha'i Youth of Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.)</p>
<p>	2243. We had heard through various channels the wonderful way your 
children had grown to speak about the Cause in public. Shoghi Effendi's 
hope is that they will, the three of them, become able and devoted 
speakers on the Cause and subjects akin to it. To do this properly they 
will need a firm foundation of scientific and literary training which 
fortunately they are obtaining. It is just as important for the Baha'i 
young boys and girls to become properly educated in colleges of high 
standing as it is to be spiritually developed.</p>
<p>	The mental as well as the spiritual side of the youth has to be developed before he can serve the Cause efficiently.</p>
<p>	(28 November 1926 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2244. He was greatly pleased and highly encouraged with your slow 
but progressive work among members of the faculty and the student body 
in State College. It is high time for the Baha'is to try and reach the 
thinking and educated youth of the country upon whom so much of the 
future depends, especially the stupendous task of applying the spirit 
and letter of the Baha'i teachings to the requirements of the time -- a 
work for which generations of preparation might be necessary.</p>
<p>	(13 June 1928 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2245. He was deeply interested in your work among the university 
students and hopes that it will bear much fruit. The youth is 
open-minded, unhampered by prejudice and ready to accept any message 
that satisfies his spiritual longings as well as intellectual demands. 
The work should, however, be both intensive and extensive. It is not 
sufficient that you should address many student bodies; persons have to 
be found to follow up that work, pick those who are interested to know 
more and ground<br>
 them in the teachings. This task undoubtedly pertains to the teaching 
committee which should always be on the alert, see where there is a 
receptive group and send teachers to bring them into the Cause.</p>
<p>	(20 June 1931 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2246. Being a Baha'i you are certainly aware of the fact that 
Baha'u'llah considered education as one of the most fundamental factors 
of a true civilization. This education, however, in order to be adequate
 and fruitful, should be comprehensive in nature and should take into 
consideration not only the physical and the intellectual side of man but
 also his spiritual and ethical aspects. This should be the programme of
 the Baha'i youth all over the world.</p>
<p>	And no doubt the best means through which this educational 
development can be attained is by joining the different associations and
 gatherings which intend to promote the ideals of this new international
 civilization. Although the Guardian prefers that Baha'is should join 
those associations which are within the orbit of Baha'i activities, he 
nevertheless approves and even encourages any person who would like to 
join any non-Baha'i movements, provided that these movements will not 
promote any ideal or principle which will harm and check the advance of 
the Cause.</p>
<p>	(9 July 1931 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2247. The prevailing distress in America and Europe should awaken 
the youth to the futility of concentrating their whole life on purely 
material pursuits. They should learn the lesson that spiritual 
considerations should be the dominating factors of our life, that our 
guiding purpose should be to enhance our moral life and seek what is 
eternal and abiding.</p>
<p>	Should the different nations continue to go wrong and be guided by 
the selfish desire of personal aggrandizement, you will be the group 
that will suffer most. Our present policies bear their fruits only in 
the future and it is the youth of the present that are the men and women
 of the future.</p>
<p>	(2 November 1931 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2248. Shoghi Effendi was delighted to see the result of the work 
achieved, which proved the deep interest the young Baha'is are showing 
in the<br>
 progress of the Faith. The message of Baha'u'llah which contains the 
only true and lasting solution of the social and spiritual problems that
 confront society at present, is entrusted to their care. It is they who
 should, with a spirit of complete detachment and consecration, raise 
the banner of the Faith and enlist the support of strong and devoted 
souls.</p>
<p>	Through such conferences Shoghi Effendi hopes you will develop your 
knowledge of modern problems and at the same time help those non-Bahais 
who come to help, to see the light brought by Baha'u'llah to the world. 
People who come so close to our doors and perhaps enter our home should 
not be left to go without carrying away some of the delights we are 
enjoying. They are also seeking souls earnestly desiring to attain their
 spiritual and social ideals. To approach them may need tact and care 
and may entail much difficulty, but such is our duty we are called to 
carry through.</p>
<p>	Shoghi Effendi hopes that the success of this last summer will 
encourage you to hold more conferences in the future, thus arousing the 
youth to true service and spreading the Message far and wide. He will 
remember you all in his prayers and ask for you divine guidance and 
assistance....</p>
<p>	[Postscript in the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi:]</p>
<p>	I am delighted with your letter enclosing the splendid report on 
International relations. I am particularly gratified to learn of the 
active part played by the Baha'i youth and of their harmonious 
co-operation with the older and more experienced believers. I would warn
 them to be on their guard lest the impression be given to the outside 
world that the Baha'is are political in their aims and pursuits or 
interfere in matters that pertain to the political activities of their 
respective governments. The Cause, still in its state of infancy, should
 be adequately protected from this particular danger....</p>
<p>	(13 November 1931 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2249. The youth should be encouraged to train themselves in public 
speaking while they are still pursuing their studies in schools or 
colleges.</p>
<p>	(7 December 1931 to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 64 (July 1932), p 4)<br>

</p><p>	2250. The account of your work among the foreign students made 
Shoghi Effendi very happy. Not only will these young people get a good 
impression of American families and hospitality, but the spiritual 
training you try to give them will make their education so much more 
complete and worthwhile. This is beside the fact that in their heart is 
planted the seeds of the Baha'i teachings which in time will germinate 
and bring forth wondrous fruits. All these young people when they return
 home will carry the Message with them and even though they do not 
become confirmed believers, they will remain friends always ready to 
render a service to the Baha'i teachers they happen to meet. Shoghi 
Effendi hopes you will carry on that work but at the same time try to 
make them true Baha'is -- in spirit as well as in faith.</p>
<p>	(4 February 1932 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2251. The present condition of the world -- its economic 
instability, social dissensions, political dissatisfaction and 
international distrust -- should awaken the youth from their slumber and
 make them inquire what the future is going to bring. It is surely they 
who will suffer most if some calamity sweep over the world. They should 
therefore open their eyes to the existing conditions, study the evil 
forces that are at play and then with a concerted effort arise and bring
 about the necessary reforms -- reforms that shall contain within their 
scope the spiritual as well as social and political phases of human 
life.</p>
<p>	(13 March 1932 to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 68 (November 1932), p. 3)</p>
<p>	2252. What impressed him most in the account of your services was 
the statement that the old and the young Baha'is are firmly united and 
co-operating in bearing the burdens of the Faith in that locality. 
Nothing will attract God's blessings and grace more than the unity of 
the friends, and nothing is more destructive of their highest purpose 
than divisions and misunderstandings. Cling therefore to unity if you 
desire to succeed and abide by the will of your Lord Baha'u'llah; for 
that is the true objective of His Mission in this world.</p>
<p>	(11 October 1932 to the Local Spiritual Assembly of West Englewood, New Jersey, U.S.A.)<br>

</p><p>	2253. Surely in this very critical period of human history when 
old institutions are beginning to crumble down or being considerably 
modified, there is a certain amount of maladjustments and unfortunate 
happenings; but such a condition is not permanent. The Cause and its 
institutions will gradually take their place and with its virile spirit 
secure the full obedience of its followers and of the people of the 
world as a whole. So we need not be too pessimistic as to the future or 
take passing conditions too seriously. The young people who are living 
between these two eras, and seeing the destruction of old institutions 
are therefore apt to discard all respect for them and in fact view with 
contempt any person that may still cherish the old. Hence we see the 
loose morality prevalent among them. This condition is not true only of 
America and Europe but also of the East, and I dare say in the East more
 than in the West.</p>
<p>	Even though the Baha'i Youth should feel with the condition in which
 they see their non-Baha'i friends and not indict them for it, they 
should not let themselves be carried by the wave of world events as they
 are being carried. Whereas they see before them only a world that is 
crumbling down we are also seeing a new world being built up. Whereas 
they experience the destruction of old institutions that commanded their
 respect, we are beholding the dawn of a new era with its strict 
commands and new social bonds. Their materialistic outlook shows them 
the futility of all things while our faith in a regenerated and 
spiritualized man makes us look to the future and build for it. To make 
them follow our ways we should sympathize with their plight but should 
not follow their ways. We should take our stand on a higher plane of 
moral and spiritual life and, setting for them the true example, urge 
them up to our level. The young people should read what Baha'u'llah and 
the Master say on such matters and follow them conscientiously. That is 
if they desire to be true to the teachings and establish them throughout
 the world.</p>
<p>	[Postscript in the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi:]</p>
<p>	The activities, hopes and ideals of the Baha'i Youth in America, as 
well as in all other parts of the world are close and dear to my heart. 
Upon them rests the supreme and challenging responsibility to promote 
the interests of the Cause of God in the days to come, to co-ordinate 
its world-wide activities, to extend its scope, to safeguard its 
integrity, to exalt its virtues, define its purpose, and translate its 
ideals and aims into memorable and abiding achievements. Theirs is a 
mighty task, at once<br>
 holy, stupendous and enthralling. May the spirit of Baha'u'llah 
protect, inspire and sustain them in the prosecution of their 
divinely-appointed task!</p>
<p>	(26 October 1932 to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 443 (February 1968), p. 8)</p>
<p>	2254. The Movement is in need of young people, who have been 
spiritually awakened, to arise and stem the tide of a material 
civilization that has brought mankind to the verge of ruin. Should the 
forces, now playing havoc with society, be let loose, should we neglect 
our duty to check them and bring them under our control, no man dare 
imagine what the future will bring.</p>
<p>	It is upon the young people that the greatest suffering will fall. 
They should, therefore, mobilize their ranks, and, with one accord, 
arise and consummate their task and establish the Kingdom of God upon 
the earth.</p>
<p>	(Published in "Herald of the South" Vol. 4, No. 5, (January - March 
1933), p. 11; also published in "The Baha'i World, Vol. 5, (1932 -1934) 
(New York: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1936), pp.370-72)</p>
<p>	2255. Life is not easy for the young people of this generation. They
 enter life with a heart full of hope, but find before themselves 
nothing but failures, and see in the future nothing but darkness. What 
they need is the light manifested by Baha'u'llah, for that brightens 
their soul and stimulates their vigour in facing difficulties.</p>
<p>	(12 March 1933 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2256. As regards the attitude of her group towards the 
administration, they will come to understand these things, for before 
long they will see that without a proper administrative body the ideas 
of the Cause will never be put into practice, nor will the future 
progress of the Faith be ensured. In dealing with the young people one 
has to use tact and reason out the different problems with them.</p>
<p>	(22 April 1933 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2257. It is always gratifying to learn of the splendid effects which
 the teachings of the Cause inevitably bring in the hearts and minds of 
young Baha'i men and women and to witness their eagerness to mould and<br>
 shape their entire living according to the divine teachings bequeathed 
to the world by Baha'u'llah. For the Baha'i youth constitute the main 
active element in the Cause. Theirs is the duty not only to study and to
 spread the Teachings but to put them into actual practice. It is hoped 
that you will increasingly mirror forth the beauty and the power of the 
principles of the Faith and will become shining examples to every Baha'i
 whose sole aim in life is to scale the heights which Baha'u'llah has 
summoned His followers to attain.</p>
<p>	(5 August 1933 to two believers)</p>
<p>	2258. It is on young and active Baha'is, like you, that the Guardian
 centres all his hopes for the future progress and expansion of the 
Cause, and it is on their shoulders that he lays all the responsibility 
for the upkeep of the spirit of selfless service among their 
fellow-believers. Without that spirit no work can be successfully 
achieved. With it triumph, though hardly won, is but inevitable. You 
should, therefore, try all your best to carry aflame within you the 
torch of faith, for through it you will surely find guidance, strength 
and eventual success.</p>
<p>	(1 September 1933 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2259. I need not tell you what great hopes he cherishes for the 
future role which young Baha'is will be inevitably called upon to play 
in the teaching as well as in the administrative fields of Baha'i 
activity. It is on them that he centres his essential and vital hopes 
for the effective and wide spread of the Message, and for the 
strengthening of the basis of the nascent Baha'i administrative 
institutions which are gradually taking shape amidst storms of an 
unprecedented severity, and under extremely tragic circumstances.</p>
<p>	His brotherly advice to you, and to all loyal and ardent young 
believers like you, is that you should deepen your knowledge of the 
history and of the tenets of the Faith, not merely by means of careful 
and thorough study, but also through active, whole-hearted and continued
 participation in all the activities, whether administrative or 
otherwise, of your community. The Baha'i community life provides you 
with an indispensable laboratory, where you can translate into living 
and constructive action the principles which you imbibe from the 
Teachings. By becoming a real part of that living organism you can catch
 the real<br>
 spirit which runs throughout the Baha'i Teachings. To study the 
principles, and to try to live according to them, are, therefore, the 
two essential mediums through which you can ensure the development and 
progress of your inner spiritual life and of your outer existence as 
well. May Baha'u'llah enable you to attain this high station, and may He
 keep the torch of faith for ever burning in your heart!</p>
<p>	(2 November 1933 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2260. He would advise you, however, to devote some more of your time
 to active teaching in public. To that end he would urge you to attend, 
if possible, all the sessions and meetings at the Geyserville Summer 
School, that you may not only deepen your knowledge of the Teachings, 
but also acquire the necessary training for expounding them to the 
public. The ambition of every young Baha'i should be, indeed, to become a
 well-informed and competent teacher. For this very purpose the 
institution of [the] Baha'i Summer School has been established, and its 
importance so strongly and repeatedly emphasized by the Guardian.</p>
<p>	(21 June 1935 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2261. The problem with which you are faced is one which concerns and
 seriously puzzles many of our present-day youth. How to attain 
spirituality is, indeed, a question to which every young man and woman 
must sooner or later try to find a satisfactory answer. It is precisely 
because no such satisfactory reply has been given or found, that modern 
youth finds itself bewildered, and is being consequently carried away by
 the materialistic forces that are so powerfully undermining the 
foundation of man's moral and spiritual life.</p>
<p>	Indeed, the chief reason for the evils now rampant in society is a 
lack of spirituality. The materialistic civilization of our age has so 
much absorbed the energy and interest of mankind, that people in general
 no longer feel the necessity of raising themselves above the forces and
 conditions of their daily material existence. There is not sufficient 
demand for things that we should call spiritual to differentiate them 
from the needs and requirements of our physical existence. The universal
 crisis affecting mankind is, therefore, essentially spiritual its 
causes. The spirit of the age, taken on the whole, is irreligious. Man's
 outlook upon life is<br>
 too crude and materialistic to enable him to elevate himself into the higher realms of the spirit.</p>
<p>	It is this condition, so sadly morbid, into which society has 
fallen, that religion seeks to improve and transform. For the core of 
religious faith is that mystic feeling that unites man with God. This 
state of spiritual communion can be brought about and maintained by 
means of meditation and prayer. And this is the reason why Baha'u'llah 
has so much stressed the importance of worship. It is not sufficient for
 a believer to merely accept and observe the teachings. He should, in 
addition, cultivate the sense of spirituality, which he can acquire 
chiefly by the means of prayer. The Baha'i Faith, like all other Divine 
religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character. Its chief goal is 
the development of the individual and society, through the acquisition 
of spiritual virtues and powers. It is the soul of man that has first to
 be fed. And this spiritual nourishment prayer can best provide. Laws 
and institutions, as viewed by Baha'u'llah, can become really effective 
only when our inner spiritual life has been perfected and transformed. 
Otherwise religion will degenerate into a mere organization, and become a
 dead thing.</p>
<p>	The believers, particularly the young ones, should therefore fully 
realize the necessity of praying. For prayer is absolutely indispensable
 to their inner spiritual development, and this, already stated, is the 
very foundation and purpose of the Religion of God.</p>
<p>(8 December 1935 to an individual believer, published in<br>
"Baha'i News" 102 (August 1936) p. 3) </p>
<p>	2262. ...the Guardian fully realizes the difficulties that stand in 
the way of co operation between the young and old believers. This is a 
problem that confronts the Cause almost everywhere, especially in those 
communities where the number of young and old Baha'is is nearly the 
same. The solution, as in all such cases, is to be found through 
intelligent and mutual compromise. The old believers have to give up 
something of their old conceptions and ways of working in order to 
better adapt themselves to the changing social conditions and 
circumstances. The young too must learn to act with wisdom, tact and 
moderation, and to take advantage and benefit from the age-long 
experiences of their older fellow-believers. The old and the young have 
each something specific to contribute to the<br>
 progress and welfare of the Baha'i community. The energy of youth should be tempered and guided by the wisdom of old age.</p>
<p>	As to the attitude of resentment which the young believers are 
inclined to assume regarding certain precepts of the Cause, such as 
obligatory prayers: there can and should be no compromise whatever in 
such matters that are specifically enjoined by Baha'u'llah. We should 
neither have any feeling of shame when observing such laws and precepts,
 nor should we overestimate their value and significance. Just as the 
friends have no difficulty in recognizing the value of the specific 
prayers revealed by Baha'u'llah, such as the Tablets of fasting and 
healing, so also they should recognize that the obligatory prayers are 
by their very nature of greater effectiveness and are endowed with a 
greater power than the non-obligatory ones, and as such are essential.</p>
<p>	(4 January 1936 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2263. What can control youth and save it from the pitfalls of the 
crass materialism of the age is the power of a genuine, constructive and
 living Faith such as the one revealed to the world by Baha'u'llah. 
Religion, as in the past, is still the world's sole hope, but not that 
form of religion which our ecclesiastical leaders strive vainly to 
preach. Divorced from true religion, morals lose their effectiveness and
 cease to guide and control man's individual and social life. But when 
true religion is combined with true ethics, then moral progress becomes a
 possibility and not a mere ideal. The need of our modern youth is for 
such a type of ethics founded on pure religious faith. Not until these 
two are rightly combined and brought into full action can there be any 
hope for the future of the race.</p>
<p>	(17 April 1936 to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 104 (December 1936), p. 1)</p>
<p>	2264. The obligation to teach is essentially the responsibility of 
young believers. Their whole training should therefore be directed in 
such a way as to make them competent teachers. It is for this very 
purpose that Baha'i summer schools, which constitute the very basis upon
 which the Baha'i universities of the future will be established, should
 be widely attended by young believers.</p>
<p>	(15 May 1936 to Baha'i Youth Groups United States)<br>

</p><p>	2265. Regarding your question in connection with Baha'i youth 
activity: The chief purpose underlying all such activities undertaken by
 our Baha'i youth throughout the world is to stimulate enthusiasm, 
promote instruction and foster the development of the spirit of 
solidarity and co-operation among young Baha'i men and women, in order 
to enable them at a later age to collaborate intelligently and 
harmoniously with their fellow-believers of whatever class, age or 
origin. Such activities should be undertaken within the framework of the
 Administrative Order. They should neither be overemphasized nor 
curtailed. The formation of youth committees is a means to achieve the 
end stated above, and is not an end in itself.</p>
<p>	(8 November 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2266. It is his fervent hope and his heart's ardent prayer that you 
may increasingly deepen in your faith, and steadily gain in your 
understanding and appreciation of the Teachings, and display such 
earnestness and perseverance in your Baha'i studies as to gradually 
acquire the full knowledge, training and experience necessary for active
 and effective service to the Faith in the future.</p>
<p>	Although still young in age, you should endeavour from now, through 
close association with your fellow-believers, and through your faithful 
application to your Baha'i studies, to prepare yourself for that day 
when you will be called upon, as a grown-up and responsible member of 
the Community, to take full part in the activities of the Cause, and 
thus prove yourself worthy of being a member of this world-wide 
Fellowship created by Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	The Guardian was truly pleased to note that you have already started
 reading some Baha'i books, and would specially advise you to endeavour 
[to] commit to memory certain passages from the Writings of Baha'u'llah,
 and in particular, some of His prayers. This training would undoubtedly
 be of tremendous help to you in your future studies of the Cause, and 
would also serve to considerably deepen and enrich your own spiritual 
life at present.</p>
<p>	(10 April 1939 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1002. He feels the importance of young believers taking an active 
part in every field of service cannot be overestimated, for they must 
carry on the<br>
 great work of reconstruction into the future, which will be in dire need of spiritual example and leadership.</p>
<p>	(16 March 1941 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2267. Indeed it is very important for the Faith, to extend the 
teachings of Baha'u'llah amongst the youth, as it is through their 
activities, that the Cause of our Beloved Master will in future spread 
all over the American continent. They have upon their shoulders all the 
responsibilities for the progress of the Movement; it is our duty to 
rear their spiritual feelings, enlighten their hearts with the light of 
guidance which has been shed before us by the Master.</p>
<p>	(2 November 1932 to two believers, published in "Baha'i News, 143 (May 1941), p. 8)</p>
<p>	2268. The responsibility of young believers is very great, as they 
must not only fit themselves to inherit the work of the older Baha'is 
and carry on the affairs of the Cause in general, but the world which 
lies ahead of them -- as promised by Baha'u'llah -- will be a world 
chastened by its sufferings, ready to listen to His Divine Message at 
last, and consequently a very high character will be expected of the 
exponents of such a religion. To deepen their knowledge, to perfect 
themselves in the Baha'i standards of virtue and upright conduct, should
 be the paramount duty of every young Baha'i.</p>
<p>	(6 June 1941 to the Baha'i Youth of Bombay, India)</p>
<p>	2269. The tasks which will face the present generation of Baha'i 
Youth -- and are indeed already beginning to face them -- are 
stupendous. They cannot but expect to find themselves most severely 
tested in the days to come -- tested as to their characters, their 
faith, the strength of their convictions, and their complete adherence 
to the Laws of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	Shoghi Effendi's greatest hope, and his prayer, is that they may so 
distinguish themselves in the eyes of their fellow-countrymen that it 
will become increasingly evident what a Baha'i is and what he stands 
for. How wonderful it would be to witness the time when the actions and 
words of the Baha'is will have become so well known that people will 
say: "Ah! That must be a Baha'i -- they are like that!" and mean it as a
 compliment.<br>

</p><p>	(19 October 1941 to the Baha'i Youth at Louhelen Baha'i School, Youth Session)</p>
<p>	2270. The winds of test and trial have blown upon our Faith more 
than once, and he strongly feels that old believers like yourself should
 do everything in their power to protect the younger Baha'is, to 
strengthen their faith, deepen them in the Covenant, and enable them to 
take full refuge in the Will and Testament of the beloved Master, that 
impregnable fortress He built for our safety when He Himself should have
 gone from our sight.</p>
<p>	(26 October 1941 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2271. If ever it could be said that a religion belonged to the 
youth, then surely the Baha'i Faith today is that religion. The whole 
world is suffering, it is sunk in misery, crushed beneath its heavy 
problems. The task of healing its ills and building up its future 
devolves mainly upon the youth. They are the generation who, after the 
war, will have to solve the terrible difficulties created by the war and
 all that brought it about. And they will not be able to upbuild the 
future except by the laws and principles laid down by Baha'u'llah. So 
their task is very great and their responsibility very grave.</p>
<p>	(8 May 1942 to the Baha'i Youth of Peoria, Illinois, U.S.A.)</p>
<p>	2272. Young men such as yourselve[s,] so surprisingly dedicated to a
 movement which the uninitiated might associate with mature people of a 
philosophical bent of mind, so free from the current dissipated habits 
of most young people, are in a position to capture the attention and 
respect of both young and old alike. This Cause, although it embraces 
with equal esteem people of all ages, has a special message and mission 
for the youth of your generation. It is their charter for their future, 
their hope, their guarantee of better days to come. Therefore the 
Guardian is especially happy that the young Baha'is are active in the 
pioneer work....</p>
<p>	(16 June 1942 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2273. The Cause needs more Baha'i scholars, people who not only are 
devoted to it and believe in it and are anxious to tell others about it,
 but also who have a deep grasp of the Teachings and their significance,
 and<br>
 who can correlate its beliefs with the current thoughts and problems of the people of the world.</p>
<p>	The Cause has the remedy for all the world's ills. The reason why 
more people don't accept it is because the Baha'is are not always 
capable of presenting it to them in a way that meets the immediate needs
 of their minds. Young Baha'is like yourself must prepare themselves to 
really bring the Message to their generation, who need it so desperately
 and who can understand the language it speaks so well. He would advise 
you among other books to study the Talks of 'Abdu'l-Baha, as His method 
of approaching the mind of the public cannot be surpassed... He also 
advises you to develop yourself as a public speaker so you will be 
increasingly able to teach the Cause...</p>
<p>	(21 October 1943 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2274. The Guardian hopes that along with whatever other studies you 
take up, you will continually study the teachings and endeavour to 
acquire a profound knowledge of them. The importance of young Baha'is 
becoming thoroughly steeped in every branch of the teachings cannot be 
overemphasized, as they have great teaching tasks ahead of them to 
accomplish.</p>
<p>	(22 January 1944 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2275. The Guardian has always advised young people to study deeply 
such subjects as History, Economics and Sociology as they are all 
related to the teachings and aid in understanding the Faith....</p>
<p>	The greatest need of youth today is character training. Prayer is 
only one factor in this; they must learn to live up to the ethical 
teachings of the Faith....</p>
<p>	He feels that teaching the Faith to the youth is of the utmost 
importance in these days, as they will not only become the workers of 
the future but will be able to widely spread the Message among their own
 generation. He approves of your devoting as much time to this work as 
feasible, in conjunction with the valuable services you are so 
tirelessly rendering the teaching work in various cities and towns.</p>
<p>	(12 March 1944 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	2276. ...concerning what studies you should specialize in with a
 view to teaching in the future: He would suggest either History, 
Economics or Sociology, as these are not only fields in which Baha'is 
take a great interest but also cover subjects which our teachings cast 
an entirely new light upon....</p>
<p>	(13 March 1944 to an individual believer.)</p>
<p>	2277. ...if the believers are going to accomplish their duty and 
present the Divine solution to mankind, they must prepare themselves for
 the great tasks that lie ahead. This and women in the Faith teachings, 
so that they can all the problems facing them have Administration, so 
that they can wisely and efficiently administer ever-growing affairs of 
the Cause; and they must exemplify the Baha'i way of living....</p>
<p>	(12 May 1944 to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 175 June 1945), p. 3)</p>
<p>	2278. He hopes that you will develop into Baha'is in character as 
well as in belief. The whole purpose of Baha'u'llah is that we should 
become a new kind of people, people who are upright, kind, intelligent, 
truthful, and honest and who live according to His great laws laid down 
for this new epoch in man's development. To call ourselves Baha'is is 
not enough, our inmost being must become ennobled and enlightened 
through living a Baha'i life.</p>
<p>	(25 August 1944 to the Louhelen School, Youth Session)</p>
<p>	2279. Aside from teaching the Cause, the greatest service the Baha'i
 Youth can render is to exemplify in their lives the teachings and 
especially to be promoters -- within the Baha'i communities and in the 
world at large -- of love and harmony, qualities so sadly lacking in 
these days of hatred, suspicion, vindictiveness and prejudice.</p>
<p>	(15 October 1944 to the Louhelen School, Youth Session)</p>
<p>	2280. The youth are indeed those to whom the Cause should perforce 
offer its greatest appeal, as it holds alone the promise for their 
future security.<br>
 Without that which Baha'u'llah has given to humanity the outlook for 
the future of the world would appear truly hopeless, for the evil forces
 in men's nature seem to have gained the ascendancy, and only a 
spiritual force, direct from God, can enable the good side of human 
nature to again assume command of men's lives.</p>
<p>	(15 June 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2281. By all means persevere and associate in a friendly spirit with
 other groups of young people, particularly of a different race or 
minority nationality, for such association will demonstrate your 
complete conviction of the oneness of mankind and attract others to the 
Faith, both young and old alike.</p>
<p>	A spirit of prejudice-free, loving comradeship with others is what 
will open the eyes of people more than any amount of words. Combined 
with such deeds you can teach the Faith easily.</p>
<p>	(18 June 1945 to the Baha'is of Dayton, Ohio, U.S.A.)</p>
<p>	2282. He is always pleased to see enlightened and capable young 
people embrace the Cause, because the world of the near future naturally
 belongs to them and the heavy responsibilities of that future must 
needs fall on their shoulders. They cannot find a pattern to work by 
comparable to that which Baha'u'llah has given to the world in this age;
 the sanity, the justice, the perfect balance of His system can alone 
accomplish the next step in Man's evolution -- the unification of the 
human race as one family inhabiting this planet.</p>
<p>	(1 July 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2283. He feels that one of the primary duties of your Committee is 
to encourage young Baha'is to prepare themselves for pioneer work, 
particularly in Latin America; as he has already informed the American 
believers, the tremendous tasks facing them in Europe -- and indeed all 
over the world -- cannot be embarked upon until they have finished the 
work begun in South America. In this field youthful Baha'is have already
 accomplished much, and he hopes others will arise and follow them.</p>
<p>	Now that the war is over and so many young people are being released
 from the services and returning to a more normal life, the young 
Baha'is in every city should make a point of keeping in touch with local
 youth<br>
 activities and clubs, and endeavouring to make their views known to as 
many young people in as many ways as possible. Above all they should set
 a high example to them; chastity, politeness, friendliness, 
hospitality, joyous optimism about the ultimate future happiness and 
well-being of mankind, should distinguish them and win over to them the 
love and admiration of their fellow youth. The thing which is most 
conspicuously lacking in modern life is a high standard of conduct and 
good character; the young Baha'is must demonstrate both, if they hope to
 seriously win over to the Faith members of their own generation, so 
sorely disillusioned and so contaminated by the laxity war gives rise 
to.</p>
<p>	He assures you he will certainly pray for the success of your 
Committee's work, and for the Baha'i youth in general, for whom he feels
 a strong affection and for whom he cherishes very high hopes.</p>
<p>	(20 October 1945 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada National Youth Committee)</p>
<p>	2284. He was also very happy to see the Baha'i youth are holding 
meetings and making every effort to mingle with other young people, 
through local clubs and groups, and thus bring the Cause to their 
notice.</p>
<p>	As the beloved Master so constantly reiterated, example is the 
greatest teacher of all, and the Guardian feels that the Baha'is must, 
each and every one of them, contribute his share to the unity of the 
community he lives in, and show forth to his fellow believers, and to 
the world at large, that love for which the world is dying, the love of 
God. When non-Baha'is see us loving and united, our power will be 
irresistible; the perfection of our teachings, laws, and principles will
 then be seen as a practical reality.</p>
<p>	(23 October 1945 to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Dayton, Ohio)</p>
<p>	2285. The Guardian has urged, over and over again, the paramount 
necessity for Baha'i Youth to exemplify the Teachings, most particularly
 the moral aspect of them. If they are not distinguished for their high 
conduct they cannot expect other young people to take the Cause very 
seriously.</p>
<p>	He heartily agrees with you that unless we practise the Teachings we
 cannot possibly expect the Faith to grow, because the fundamental 
purpose of all religions -- including our own -- is to bring man nearer 
to God, and to change his character, which is of the utmost importance.<br>
 Too much emphasis is often laid on the social and economic aspects of 
the Teachings; but the moral aspect cannot be over-emphasized.</p>
<p>	(6 September 1946 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2286. He feels that the youth, in particular, must constantly and 
determinedly strive to exemplify a Baha'i life. In the world around us 
we see moral decay, promiscuity, indecency, vulgarity, bad manners -- 
the Baha'i young people must be the opposite of these things, and, by 
their chastity, their uprightness, their decency, their consideration 
and good manners, attract others, old and young, to the Faith. The world
 is tired of words; it wants example, and it is up to the Baha'i youth 
to furnish it.</p>
<p>	(19 September 1946 to the Green Acre Baha'i Summer School)</p>
<p>	2287. They now have a golden opportunity to arise and fulfil their 
own cherished plans before it is too late.... More believers must arise,
 and, putting their trust in Baha'u'llah, do their duty to the Faith 
they believe in and love so dearly. The youth in particular should be 
encouraged to enter this field of service, for the spread of the Cause 
is their only hope for a stable world in which to live and establish 
families of their own.</p>
<p>	(12 October 1946 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the British Isles)</p>
<p>	2288. He appreciates very much the devoted and determined spirit 
with which you are facing the future and all the Baha'i responsibility 
it will bring to you increasingly. The part of youth is very great; you 
have the opportunity to really determine to exemplify in word and deed 
the teachings of Baha'u'llah, and to show your generation that the New 
World Order He has brought is a tangible reality in the lives of His 
followers.</p>
<p>	(12 March 1946 to Louhelen School, Senior Youth Session, published in "Baha'i News" 190 (December 1946), p. 1)</p>
<p>	2289. In fact the youth work everywhere in the Baha'i world is dear 
to his heart, and he attaches great importance to it. The young people, 
who will inevitably grow up to shoulder all the work of the Cause, are 
really its hope, and should be one of the most active factors in its 
propagation. Through their courageous adherence to the high moral and 
ethical standards set by Baha'u'llah, and through gaining a mastery of 
His many,<br>
 diversified, and profound teachings, they can shape, to a great extent,
 the development and aid in the rapid expansion of their beloved Faith 
in the various countries in which they labour. They should be made to 
realize their responsibility is heavy and their privilege very precious.</p>
<p>	(26 December 1946 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles National Youth Committee)</p>
<p>	2290. In the years that lie ahead, in order to accomplish the 
tremendous tasks entrusted to our care by the Master, young people like 
yourself will be required to carry the work forward and fill the places 
left vacant by the older generation of believers; indeed they must do 
more than that, they must create new places and functions for 
themselves.</p>
<p>	What the Cause really needs most at present is capable teachers, 
wise, deeply grounded in the Faith. He hopes you will fit yourself to be
 one of these.</p>
<p>	(5 February 1947 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2291. As regards your future: he feels that if you specialize in the
 Social Sciences this would be also of assistance to you in teaching the
 Cause. And he would also suggest that, if feasible when you decide on a
 place to study, or to establish yourself permanently, you could render 
the Cause a great service by going somewhere where there is a weak 
Assembly or a group only and helping in developing the Faith there.</p>
<p>	(24 June 1947 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2292. He is very happy to hear of the formation of the new youth 
groups you mention, as this will not only greatly stimulate the Baha'i 
youth and enable them to attract new young people to the Faith, but will
 also do the general work of the Cause in these cities a great deal of 
good. He urges your Committee to make every effort to establish youth 
groups wherever there are Spiritual Assemblies, and circumstances 
permit.</p>
<p>	(25 September 1947 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles National Youth Committee)</p>
<p>	2293. There are two kinds of Baha'is, one might say: those whose 
religion is Baha'i and those who live for the Faith. Needless to say, if
 one can belong to the latter category, if one can be in the vanguard of
 heroes,<br>
 martyrs and saints, it is more praiseworthy in the sight of God. He hopes you will attain to this high station.</p>
<p>	But, as you must earn your living, he advises you to consult with 
your teachers at the University, and see in what field they believe you 
might excel and be able to find employment. This is a detail which he 
cannot advise you about. In principle it is good if the young Baha'is 
seek careers which would enable them to find employment abroad, as then 
they can render valuable pioneer services.</p>
<p>	(16 April 1950 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2294. He urges you to make up your minds to do great, great deeds 
for the Faith; the condition of the world is steadily growing worse, and
 your generation must provide the saints, heroes, martyrs and 
administrators of future years. With dedication and will-power you can 
rise to great heights!</p>
<p>	(2 October 1951 to the Louhelen School, Youth Session, published in "Baha'i News" 253 (March 1952), p. 1)</p>
<p>	2295. He urges you all to devote particular attention to the contact
 with racial minorities. In a country which has such a large element of 
prejudice against its coloured citizens as the United States, it is of 
the greatest importance that the Baha'is -- and more especially the 
youth -- should demonstrate actively our complete lack of prejudice and,
 indeed, our prejudice in favour of minorities.</p>
<p>	We cannot very well prosecute a teaching campaign successfully in 
Africa if we do not in our home communities demonstrate to the fullest 
extent our love for the people who spring from the African population!</p>
<p>	(11 November 1951 to the Louhelen School)</p>
<p>	2296. He, therefore, urges you to seriously consider the type of 
profession or trade that might ensure you a post in a pioneer field in 
Africa, or the Pacific Islands, or Asia, in which you could earn your 
living while serving the Cause as well. It is a great challenge, and a 
great opportunity offered your generation...</p>
<p>	(5 August 1952 to the Louhelen school, youth session)<br>

</p><p>	2297. On the shoulders of the youth today rests the future of 
the Faith. Therefore they should be well educated and trained not only 
in the Teachings of the Faith, but also in secular matters.</p>
<p>	(24 May 1954 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2298. Your niece's profession in training and educating children is 
one that will give her a rich reward, because she is aiding in the 
development of the characters of the youth of today, who will become the
 ones who will guide humanity tomorrow. If they could be guided both 
materially and spiritually then it would be a great victory, because 
after the world goes through its present travail, spiritual values will 
predominate, and those youth who have the benefit of both material and 
spiritual education will be the true leaders of society.</p>
<p>	(22 May 1955 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	2299. He hopes that the Baha'i youth in Germany will be encouraged 
to take a more active part in administrative affairs and in the teaching
 work. They must always realize that they are the future of the Cause, 
and they should gain from experience as teachers and administrators from
 the older friends, in preparation for the time when the burden of the 
work will fall on their shoulders.</p>
<p>	(21 June 1956 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Germany and Austria)</p>
<p>	2300. The beloved Guardian feels that sufficient attention is not 
being paid to the matter of contacting minorities in the United States. A
 great impetus could be lent to the work in the European countries, in 
certain far-eastern areas, and in Latin America if the Baha'is residing 
in the big cities and university towns would make a determined and 
sufficient effort to extend friendship and hospitality to students and 
nationals from countries where the Baha'is are struggling so hard to 
establish the Faith. They would not only have the possibility of making 
more local believers, but they might also increase the membership of 
communities abroad, by sending back Baha'is from the United States. This
 has happened already a number of times with Chinese and Japanese 
friends, etc., to the great advantage of the Cause.<br>

</p><p>	(19 July 1956 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States)</p>
<p>	2301. The Divine Confirmations are descending in torrents on those 
who arise to teach. At this critical time in the history of the Faith, 
teaching is the one Baha'i service that is confirmed.</p>
<p>	The Guardian hopes that you will therefore arise with renewed effort
 to take your part in this great Crusade that is now sweeping the world.
 America has been called upon by the Master to play the preponderating 
role in this great World Crusade which is moving forward with increasing
 momentum. If more Baha'is are not confirmed in the United States, then 
America may be deprived of its great Spiritual Destiny. The Guardian is 
looking to the Youth of America to raise the Banner of the Faith to ever
 higher and more glorious heights. The Youth should become severed from 
all things of the world and filled with the dynamic power of the Holy 
Spirit, arise to spread the Message and quicken the hearts.</p>

</p><p>	PRESERVING BAHA'I MARRIAGES</p>
<p>	A compilation prepared by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	December 1990</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Baha'u'llah</p>
<p>	2302. God doth verily love union and concord, and abhorreth separation and divorce.</p>
<p>("Kitab-i-Aqdas", provisional translation)</p>
<p>	2303. If antipathy or resentment develop on the part of either the 
husband or the wife, divorce is permissible, only after the lapse of one
 full year ....</p>
<p>	("A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy 
Book of Baha'u'llah" (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1973), p. 42)</p>
<p>	From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha</p>
<p>	2304. Marriage, among the mass of the people, is a physical bond, 
and this union can only be temporary, since it is foredoomed to a 
physical separation at the close.</p>
<p>	Among the people of Baha, however, marriage must be a union of the 
body and of the spirit as well, for here both husband and wife are aglow
 with the same wine, both are enamoured of the same matchless Face, both
 live and move through the same spirit, both are illumined by the same 
glory. This connection between them is a spiritual one, hence it is a 
bond that will abide forever. Likewise do they enjoy strong and lasting 
ties in the physical world as well, for if the marriage is based both on
 the spirit and the body, that union is a true one, hence it will 
endure. If, however, the bond is physical and nothing more, it is sure 
to be only temporary, and must inexorably end in separation.</p>
<p>	When, therefore, the people of Baha undertake to marry, the union 
must be a true relationship, a spiritual coming together as well as a 
physical one, so that throughout every phase of life, and in all the 
worlds of God, their union will endure; for this real oneness is a 
gleaming out of the love of God.</p>
<p>	In the same way, when any souls grow to be true believers, they will
 attain a spiritual relationship with one another, and show forth a 
tenderness which is not of this world. They will, all of them, become 
elated<br>
 from a draught of divine love, and that union of theirs, that 
connection, will also abide forever. Souls, that is, who will consign 
their own selves to oblivion, strip from themselves the defects of 
humankind, and unchain themselves from human bondage, will beyond any 
doubt be illumined with the heavenly splendours of oneness, and will all
 attain unto real union in the world that dieth not.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 84, pp. 117-18)</p>
<p>	2305. As for the question regarding marriage under the Law of God: 
first thou must choose one who is pleasing to thee, and then the matter 
is subject to the consent of the father and mother. Before thou makest 
thy choice, they have no right to interfere."</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 85, p. 118)</p>
<p>	2306. Baha'i marriage is the commitment of the two parties one to 
the other, and their mutual attachment of mind and heart. Each must, 
however, exercise the utmost care to become thoroughly acquainted with 
the character of the other, that the binding covenant between them may 
be a tie that will endure forever. Their purpose must be this: to become
 loving companions and comrades and at one and eternity ....</p>
<p>	The true marriage of Baha'is is this, united both physically and 
spiritually, that they may ever improve the spiritual life of each 
other, and may enjoy everlasting unity throughout all the worlds of God.
 This is Baha'i marriage.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 86, p. 11)</p>
<p>	2307. O ye two believers in God! The Lord, peerless is He, hath made
 woman and man to abide with each other in the closest companionship, 
and to be even as a single soul. They are two helpmates, two intimate 
friends, who should be concerned about the welfare of each other.</p>
<p>	If they live thus, they will pass through this world with perfect 
contentment, bliss, and peace of heart, and become the object of divine 
grace and favour in the Kingdom of heaven. But if they do other than 
this, they will live out their lives in great bitterness, longing at 
every moment for death, and will be shamefaced in the heavenly realm.<br>

</p><p>	Strive, then, to abide, heart and soul, with each other as two doves in the nest, for this is to be blessed in both worlds.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 92, p. 122)</p>
<p>	2308. Formerly in Persia divorce was very easily obtained. Among the
 people of the past Dispensation a trifling matter would cause divorce. 
However, as the light of the Kingdom shone forth, souls were quickened 
by the spirit of Baha'u'llah, then they totally eschewed divorce. In 
Persia now divorce doth not take place among the friends, unless a 
compelling reason existeth which makes harmony impossible. Under such 
rare circumstances some cases of divorce take place.</p>
<p>	Now the friends in America must live and conduct themselves in this 
way. They must strictly refrain from divorce unless something ariseth 
which compelleth them to separate because of their aversion for each 
other, in that case with the knowledge of the Spiritual Assembly they 
may decide to separate. They must then be patient and wait one complete 
year. If during this year, harmony is not re-established between them, 
then their divorce may be realized. It should not happen that upon the 
occurrence of a slight friction or displeasure between husband and wife,
 the husband would think of union with some other woman, or, God forbid,
 the wife also think of another husband. This is contrary to the 
standard of heavenly value and true chastity. The friends of God must so
 live and conduct themselves, and evince such excellence of character 
and conduct, as to make others astonished. The love between husband and 
wife must not be purely physical, nay, rather, it must be spiritual and 
heavenly. These two souls should be considered as one soul. How 
difficult it would be to divide a single soul! Nay, great would be the 
difficulty!</p>
<p>	In short, the foundation of the Kingdom of God is based upon harmony
 and love, oneness, relationship and union, not upon differences, 
especially between husband and wife. If one of these two becomes the 
cause of divorce, that one will unquestionably fall into great 
difficulties, will become the victim of formidable calamities and 
experience deep remorse.</p>

<p>	2309. When such difference of opinion and belief occurs between 
husband and wife it is very unfortunate for undoubtedly it detracts from
 that spiritual bond which is the stronghold of the family bond, 
especially in times of difficulty. The way, however, that it could be 
remedied is not by acting in such wise as to alienate the other party. 
One of the objects of the Cause is actually to bring about a closer bond
 in the homes. In all such cases, therefore, the Master used to advise 
obedience to the wishes of the other party and prayer. Pray that your 
husband may gradually see the light and at the same time so act as to 
draw him nearer rather than prejudice him. Once that harmony is secured 
then you will be able to serve unhampered.</p>
<p>	(15 July 1928)</p>
<p>	2310. Divorce is, according to the "Aqdas", permissible. But it is 
discouraged. Both the husband and wife have equal right to ask for 
divorce, and whenever either of them feels it absolutely essential to do
 so. Divorce becomes valid even if one of the parties refuses to accept 
it, and after one year of separation, during which period the husband is
 under the obligation of providing for his wife and children.</p>
<p>	(6 July 1935)</p>
<p>	2311. The Guardian has received your letter ... and has learned with
 deep concern of your family difficulties and troubles. He wishes me to 
assure you of his fervent prayers on your behalf and on behalf of your 
dear ones at home, that you may be guided and assisted from on High to 
compose your differences and to restore complete harmony and fellowship 
in your midst. While he would urge you to make any sacrifice in order to
 bring about unity in your family, he wishes you not to feel discouraged
 if your endeavours do not yield any immediate fruit. You should do your
 part with absolute faith that in doing so you are fulfilling your duty 
as a Baha'i. The rest is assuredly in God's hand.</p>
<p>	(23 July 1937)<br>

</p><p>	2312. The validity of a Baha'i marriage is dependent upon the 
free and full consent of all four parents. The freedom of the parents in
 the exercise of this right is unrestricted and unconditioned. They may 
refuse their consent on any ground, and they are responsible for their 
decision to God alone.</p>
<p>	(19 March 1938)</p>
<p>	2313. Regarding divorce, the Guardian stated that it is discouraged,
 deprecated and against the good pleasure of God. The Assembly must 
circulate among the friends whatever has been revealed from the Pen of 
'Abdu'l-Baha in this connection so that all may be fully reminded. 
Divorce is conditional upon the approval and permission of the Spiritual
 Assembly. The members of the Assembly must in such matters 
independently and carefully study and investigate each case. If there 
should be valid grounds for divorce and it is found that reconciliation 
is utterly impossible, that antipathy is intense and its removal is not 
possible, then the Assembly may approve the divorce.</p>
<p>	(7 July 1938 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	2314. The Guardian is in receipt of your letter .. . and has learned
 with deep concern of the state of disharmony existing between you and 
your husband.</p>
<p>	While he wishes me to assure you that he will pray for the solution 
of your domestic troubles, he would urge you to endeavour, by every 
means in your power, to compose your differences, and not to allow them 
to reach such proportions as to lead to your complete and final 
separation from your husband. For while, according to the Baha'i law, 
divorce is permissible, yet it is highly discouraged, and should be 
resorted to only when every effort to prevent it has proved to be vain 
and ineffective. It is for you, and for Mr.... as well, to ponder 
carefully over the spiritual implications which any act of divorce on 
either part would involve, and, strengthened by the power of faith and 
confident in the blessings which strict adherence to the principles and 
laws of Baha'u'llah is bound to confer upon every one of His faithful 
followers, to make a<br>
 fresh resolve to solve your common difficulties and to restore the harmony, peace and happiness of your family life.</p>
<p>	(11 September 1938)</p>
<p>	2315. I wish to assure you, in particular, of his supplications for 
your guidance in connection with your proposed plan to unite in marriage
 with Dr.. May the Beloved help you in forming the right decision, and 
spare you the anxiety and suffering which too hasty action in such 
matters inevitably produces. You should give this question, which is of 
such vital concern to your future, the full consideration it deserves, 
and examine all its aspects carefully and dispassionately. The final 
decision rests with you and Dr.....</p>
<p>	(17 January 1939)</p>
<p>	2316. The Baha'i Teachings do not only encourage marital life, 
considering it the natural and normal way of existence for every sane, 
healthy and socially-conscious and responsible person, but raise 
marriage to the status of a divine institution, its chief and sacred 
purpose being the perpetuation of the human race -- which is the very 
flower of the entire creation -- and its elevation to the true station 
destined for it by God.</p>
<p>	(15 April 1939)</p>
<p>	2317. The situation facing you[1] is admittedly difficult and 
delicate, but no less grave and indeed vital are the responsibilities 
which it entails and which, as a faithful and loyal believer, you should
 conscientiously and thoroughly assume. The Guardian, therefore, while 
fully alive to the special circumstances of your case, and however 
profound his sympathy may be for you in this challenging issue with 
which you are so sadly faced, cannot, in view of the emphatic 
injunctions contained in the Teachings, either sanction your demand to 
contract a second marriage while your first wife is still alive and is 
united with you in the sacred bonds of matrimony, or even suggest or 
approve that you divorce her just in order to be permitted to marry a 
new one.</p>
<p>[1 A believer who, having married his first wife out of compassion, 
now wished to be permitted to marry a woman with whom he had fallen in 
love, saying that his wife was agreeable to his taking this second 
wife.]</p>

<p>	For the Baha'i Teachings do not only preclude the possibility of 
bigamy, but also, while permitting divorce, consider it a reprehensible 
act, which should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances, and 
when grave issues are involved, transcending such considerations as 
physical attraction or sexual compatibility and harmony. The institution
 of marriage, as established by Baha'u'llah, while giving due importance
 to the physical aspect of marital union, considers it as subordinate to
 the moral and spiritual purposes and functions with which it has been 
invested by an all-wise and loving Providence. Only when these different
 values are given each their due importance, and only on the basis of 
the subordination of the physical to the moral, and the carnal to the 
spiritual, can such excesses and laxity in marital relations as our 
decadent age is so sadly witnessing be avoided, and family life be 
restored to its original purity, and fulfil the true function for which 
it has been instituted by God.</p>
<p>	The Guardian will most fervently pray that, inspired and guided by 
such a divine standard, and strengthened by Baha'u'llah's unfailing 
assistance and confirmations, you may be able to satisfactorily adjust 
your relations with the persons concerned, and thus reach the one right 
solution to this assuredly challenging problem of your life.</p>
<p>	(8 May 1939)</p>
<p>	2318. He has noted the question you had asked concerning the problem
 of marriage, and its infrequency among the believers in general. It is 
indeed a matter of deep regret to him that some of our young believers 
do not attach due importance to the question of marriage, and seem, as 
you state, to be under the impression that marital life has been 
discouraged in the Cause. This is certainly an erroneous conception, and
 whosoever takes the pain to carefully and intelligently read the words 
of Baha'u'llah, and to ponder over their implications, cannot but be 
convinced of the truth that in the Baha'i Faith marriage, and family 
life, in particular, are both not only commendable, but constitute a 
social function of highest and indeed vital importance, as through them 
alone the human race is perpetuated.</p>
<p>	The believers should well know that whereas Baha'u'llah has not made
 marriage a binding obligation, He has nevertheless attributed to it 
such spiritual and social significance as no individual believer, under 
normal circumstances, can well be justified in disregarding it. In fact,
 in<br>
 His Book of Laws (the "Kitab-i-Aqdas") He emphatically stresses its 
importance, and defines its essential purpose, namely the procreation of
 children and their training in the Religion of God, that they may know 
and adore Him, and mention and praise His Name.</p>
<p>	(17 February 1940)</p>
<p>	2319. ... he indeed feels rejoiced at the happy news of the 
settlement of your domestic differences with Mrs.... and particularly to
 know that you have jointly undertaken a most successful teaching tour 
.. This bond of common service to the Cause which is has proved such an 
effective solution of your personal problems, he hopes, and indeed will 
fervently pray, will be further cemented by the passing of years and 
through your increased and joint participation in the teaching work ...</p>
<p>	(16 December 1940)</p>
<p>	2320. Regarding the question whether it is necessary to obtain the 
consent of the parents of a non-Baha'i participant in a marriage with a 
Baha'i: as Baha'u'llah has stated that the consent of the parents of 
both parties is required in order to promote unity and avoid friction, 
and as the "Aqdas" does not specify any exceptions to this rule, the 
Guardian feels that under all circumstances the consent of the parents 
of both parties is required.</p>
<p>	(12 August 1941 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	2321. Baha'u'llah has laid great emphasis on the sanctity of 
marriage, and the believers should exert their utmost to create harmony 
in their homes and a situation which at least is not bad for their 
children. But if, after prayer and self-sacrificing effort, this proves 
quite impossible, then they may resort to divorce.</p>
<p>	(10 November 1943)</p>
<p>	2322. Marriage is, in the "Aqdas", set forth as a most sacred and 
binding tie, and the Baha'is should realize that divorce is viewed as a 
last resort, to be avoided at all costs if possible and not to be 
lightly granted.</p>
<p>	(17 October 1944)<br>

</p><p>	2323. He feels that you and your wife should do everything in 
your power to produce a harmonious relationship between you and avoid 
divorce by all means, if possible. The Baha'i attitude is that marriage 
is a very serious and sacred relationship and divorce a last resort to 
be avoided if humanly possible.</p>
<p>	(10 August 1945)</p>
<p>	2324. He was very sorry to hear that you and your husband are still 
so unhappy together. It is always a source of sorrow in life when 
married people cannot get on well together, but the Guardian feels that 
you and your husband, in contemplating divorce, should think of the 
future of your children and how this major step on your part will 
influence their lives and happiness.</p>
<p>	If you feel the need of advice and consultation he suggests you 
consult your Local Assembly; your fellow Baha'is will surely do all they
 can to counsel and help you, protect your interests and those of the 
Cause.</p>
<p>	(16 November 1945)</p>
<p>	2325. The Guardian has the impression that your husband is a fine 
man, and he is very pleased to hear you two are arranging to be 
reunited. He feels very strongly that Baha'is, if possible, more 
especially Baha'is who serve the Cause as actively and conspicuously as 
you and your family do, should set the newer believers and the young 
Baha'is a high example in every way. As Baha'u'llah was so very much 
against divorce (even though He permits it) and considered marriage a 
most sacred responsibility, believers should do everything in their 
power to preserve the marriages they have contracted, and to make of 
them exemplary unions, governed by the noblest motives.</p>
<p>	(19 October 1947)</p>
<p>	2326. Baha'u'llah has clearly stated the consent of all living 
parents is required for a Baha'i marriage. This applies whether the 
parents are Baha'is or non-Baha'is, divorced for years or not. This 
great law He has laid down to strengthen the social fabric, to knit 
closer the ties of the home, to place a certain gratitude and respect in
 the hearts of children for those who have given them life and sent 
their souls out on the eternal journey towards their Creator. We Baha'is
 must realize that in present-day<br>
 society the exact opposite process is taking place: young people care 
less and less for their parents' wishes, divorce is considered a natural
 right, and obtained on the flimsiest and most unwarrantable and shabby 
pretexts. People separated from each other, especially if one of them 
has had full custody of the children, are only too willing to belittle 
the importance of the partner in marriage also responsible as a parent 
for bringing those children into this world. The Baha'is must, through 
rigid adherence to the Baha'i laws and teachings, combat these corrosive
 forces which are so rapidly destroying home life and the beauty of 
family relationships, and tearing down the moral structure of society.</p>
<p>	(25 October 1947 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	2327. There is no doubt about it that the believers in America, 
probably unconsciously influenced by the extremely lax morals prevalent 
and the flippant attitude towards divorce which seems to be increasingly
 prevailing, do not take divorce seriously enough and do not seem to 
grasp the fact that although Baha'u'llah has permitted it, He has only 
permitted it as a last resort and strongly condemns it.</p>
<p>	The presence of children, as a factor in divorce, cannot be ignored,
 for surely it places an even greater weight of moral responsibility on 
the man and wife in considering such a step. Divorce under such 
circumstances no longer just concerns them and their desires and 
feelings but also concerns the children's entire future and their own 
attitude towards marriage.</p>
<p>	As to whether you and Mr.... should now divorce: this is a matter 
which so intimately concerns you both, your children, and your future 
that he does not feel he can do more than point out to you what he has 
stated above. The decision must rest with you both.</p>
<p>	(19 December 1947)</p>
<p>	2328. Divorce should be avoided most strictly by the believers, and 
only under rare and urgent circumstances be resorted to. Modern society 
is criminally lax as to the sacred nature of marriage, and the believers
 must combat this trend assiduously.</p>
<p>	(5 January 1948)<br>

</p><p>	2329. He was sorry to hear of the inharmony and unhappiness 
which has arisen in your home, and he assures you he will pray for its 
removal.</p>
<p>	He suggests to you that perhaps you are not giving your husband 
enough of your love, physically and spiritually, to keep his interest 
centred in you. Marriage problems are often very involved and subtle, 
and we Baha'is, being enlightened and progressive people, should not 
hesitate, if it seems necessary or desirable, to turn to science for 
help in such matters. If you and your husband talked over your problems 
-- together or separately -- with a good physician you might find that 
you can cure your own husband, or at least try to do so. It is a great 
pity that two believers, united in this glorious Cause, and blessed with
 a family, should not be able to live together really harmoniously, and 
he feels you should take constructive action and not allow the situation
 to get worse. When the shadow of separation hangs over a husband and 
wife they should leave no stone unturned in their effort to avert its 
becoming a reality.</p>
<p>	He urges you both to devote more of your time to teaching the Cause 
and to pray together that Baha'u'llah may give you a real and lasting 
love for each other.</p>
<p>	(5 July 1949)</p>
<p>	2330. He was very sorry to hear that you are contemplating 
separation from your husband. As you no doubt know, Baha'u'llah 
considers the marriage bond very sacred; and only under very exceptional
 and unbearable circumstances is divorce advisable for Baha'is.</p>
<p>	The Guardian does not tell you that you must not divorce your 
husband; but he does urge you to consider prayerfully, not only because 
you are a believer and anxious to obey the laws of God, but also for the
 sake of the happiness of your children, whether it is not possible for 
you to rise above the limitations you have felt in your marriage 
hitherto, and make a go of it together. We often feel that our happiness
 lies in a certain direction; and yet, if we have to pay too heavy a 
price for it in the end we may discover that we have not really 
purchased either freedom or happiness, but just some new situation of 
frustration and disillusion.</p>
<p>	(5 April 1951)<br>

</p><p>	2331. He feels that you should by all means make every effort to
 hold your marriage together, especially for the sake of your children, 
who, like all children of divorced parents, cannot but suffer from 
conflicting loyalties, for they are deprived of the blessing of a father
 and mother in one home, to look after their interests and love them 
jointly.</p>
<p>	Now that you realize that your husband is ill, you should be able to
 reconcile yourself to the difficulties you have faced with him 
emotionally, and not take an unforgiving attitude, however much you may 
suffer.</p>
<p>	We know that Baha'u'llah has very strongly frowned upon divorce; and
 it is really incumbent upon the Baha'is to make almost a superhuman 
effort not to allow a Baha'i marriage to be dissolved.</p>
<p>	(6 March 1953)</p>
<p>	2332. What the Baha'is must do is not commit adultery if they are 
married, and refrain from sexual intimacy before marriage. It is not a 
sin in the Baha'i Faith if you do not marry, but marriage is recommended
 to the believers by Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	There is no teaching in the Baha'i Faith that "soul mates" exist. 
What is meant is that marriage should lead to a profound friendship of 
spirit, which will endure in the next world, where there is no sex, and 
no giving and taking in marriage; just the way we should establish with 
our parents, our children, our brothers and sisters and friends a deep 
spiritual bond which will be everlasting, and not merely physical bonds 
of human relationship.</p>
<p>	(4 December 1954)</p>
<p>	2333. He has been very sorry to hear that your marriage seems to 
have failed utterly. I need not tell you as a Baha'i that every effort 
should be made by any Baha'i to salvage their marriage for the sake of 
God, rather than for their own sake. In the case of pioneers, it is even
 more important, because they are before the public eye. However, in 
such matters it is neither befitting nor right that the Guardian should 
bring pressure on individuals. He can only appeal to you and ... to try 
again; but if you cannot rise to this test, that is naturally a personal
 matter.</p>
<p>	(13 January 1956)<br>

</p><p>	2334. The Guardian will pray for the solution of your problems. 
He will pray for the healing of your son, and for the happiness and 
unity of your family. The true basis of unity is service, and he hopes 
all the members will arise with renewed effort to teach the Faith.</p>
<p>	(6 September 1956)</p>
<p>	2335. Wherever there is a Baha'i family, those concerned should by 
all means do all they can to preserve it, because divorce is strongly 
condemned in the Teachings, whereas harmony, unity and love are held up 
as the highest ideals in human relationships. This must always apply to 
the Baha'is, whether they are serving in the pioneering field or not.</p>
<p>	(9 November 1956 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	Extracts from Letters Written on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice[1]<br>
 [1 To individual believers unless otherwise noted]</p>
<p>	2336. In considering the problems that you and your wife are 
experiencing, the House of Justice points out that the unity of your 
family should take priority over any other consideration. Baha'u'llah 
came to bring unity to the world, and a fundamental unity is that of the
 family. Therefore, we must believe that the Faith is intended to 
strengthen the family, not weaken it. For example, service to the Cause 
should not produce neglect of the family. It is important for you to 
arrange your time so that your family life is harmonious and your 
household receives the attention it requires.</p>
<p>	Baha'u'llah also stressed the importance of consultation. We should 
not think this worthwhile method of seeking solutions is confined to the
 administrative institutions of the Cause. Family consultation employing
 full and frank discussion, and animated by awareness of the need for 
moderation and balance, can be the panacea for domestic conflict. Wives 
should not attempt to dominate their husbands, nor husbands their 
wives....</p>
<p>	(1 August 1978)</p>
<p>	2337. You letter ... describing the difficulties confronting your 
family distressed the Universal House of Justice and we are requested to
 convey the following to you.<br>

</p><p>	Noting that you and your husband have consulted about your 
family problems with your Spiritual Assembly but did not receive any 
advice, and also discussed your situation with a family counsellor 
without success, the House of Justice feels it most essential for your 
husband and you to understand that marriage can be a source of 
well-being, conveying a sense of security and spiritual happiness. 
However, it is not something that just happens. For marriage to become a
 haven of contentment it requires the cooperation of the marriage 
partners themselves, and the assistance of their families. You mention 
your concern over your eldest daughter. It is suggested that you include
 her and perhaps your younger children in family consultations. As 
Baha'is we understand the importance of the consultative process and we 
should not feel it is to be used only by the Spiritual Assemblies.</p>
<p>	(24 June 1979)</p>
<p>	2338. Irreconcilable antipathy arising between the parties to a 
marriage is not merely a lack of love for one's spouse but an antipathy 
which cannot be resolved. It is for the Spiritual Assembly to decide 
whether this condition exists before it sets the date for the beginning 
of the year of waiting, and this it may do on the application of one of 
the parties. It is not affected by the other party's not wishing to 
apply for a divorce.</p>
<p>	The date for the beginning of the year of waiting having been fixed,
 it is the obligation of the parties to make every effort to reconcile 
their differences and to try to preserve the marriage. The Spiritual 
Assembly has the obligation to offer them every assistance in this 
regard ...</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	Obviously, seeking the assistance of one's Spiritual Assembly is a 
part of the Baha'i divorce procedure, and the parties concerned should 
consult with the Assembly about their problems. It is within the 
discretion of the parties, or either of them, to also avail themselves 
of professional marriage counsellors.</p>
<p>	(12 July 1979)</p>
<p>	2339. Your letter of ... to the Universal House of Justice makes 
clear that you are seeking to re-establish your marriage through study 
of the Writings and through various modes of consultation and 
assistance. We are asked to convey its advice on this vital subject of 
reconciliation of<br>
 partners in marriage in the context of understanding of yourself and your relationship to others.</p>
<p>	You are urged to persevere in your studies, in your prayers for 
resolution of your problems, and in your meditation which may provide 
guidance and confidence, inasmuch as the understanding of self and of 
relationships to others are contained in the Writings and in the example
 of the Master, 'Abdu'l-Baha.</p>
<p>	Neither you nor your husband should hesitate to continue consulting 
professional marriage counsellors, individually and together if 
possible, and also to take advantage of the supportive counselling which
 can come from wise and mature friends. Non-Baha'i counselling can be 
useful but it is usually necessary to temper it with Baha'i insight.</p>
<p>	You ask how to deal with anger. The House of Justice suggests that 
you call to mind the admonitions found in our Writings on the need to 
overlook the shortcomings of others; to forgive and conceal their 
misdeeds, not to expose their bad qualities, but to search for and 
affirm their praiseworthy ones, and to endeavour to be always 
forbearing, patient, and merciful. Such passages as the following 
extracts from letters written on behalf of the beloved Guardian will be 
helpful:</p>
<p>	There are qualities in everyone which we can appreciate and admire, 
and for which we can love them; and perhaps, if you determine to think 
only of these qualities which your husband possesses, this will help to 
improve the situation .... You should turn your thoughts away from the 
things which upset you, and constantly pray to Baha'u'llah to help you. 
Then you will find how that pure love, enkindled by God, which burns in 
the soul when we read and study the Teachings, will warm and heal, more 
than anything else. Each of us is responsible for one life only, and 
that is our own. Each of us is immeasurably far from being "perfect as 
our heavenly father is perfect" and the task of perfecting our own life 
and character is one that requires all our attention, our will-power and
 energy ....</p>
<p>	(17 July 1979)</p>
<p>	2340. The relationship between husband and wife must be viewed in 
the context of the Baha'i ideal of family life. Baha'u'llah came to 
bring unity to the world, and a fundamental unity is that of the family.
 Therefore,<br>
 one must believe that the Faith is intended to strengthen the family, 
not weaken it, and one of the keys to a strengthening of unity is loving
 consultation. The atmosphere within a Baha'i family as within the 
community as a whole should express "the keynote of the Cause of God" 
which, the beloved Guardian has stated, "is not dictatorial authority, 
but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but the spirit of frank and 
loving consultation...."</p>
<p>	In any group, however loving the consultation, there are 
nevertheless points on which, from time to time, agreement cannot be 
reached. In a Spiritual Assembly this dilemma is resolved by a majority 
vote. There can, however, be no majority where only two parties are 
involved, as in the case of a husband and wife. There are, therefore, 
times when a wife should defer to her husband, and times when a husband 
should defer to his wife, but neither should ever unjustly dominate the 
other....</p>
<p>	(28 December 1980 to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	2341. You have asked, however, for specific rules of conduct to 
govern the relationships of husbands and wives. This the House of 
Justice does not wish to do, and it feels that there is already adequate
 guidance included in the compilation on this subject; for example, the 
principle that the rights of each and all in the family unit must be 
upheld, and the advice that loving consultation should be the keynote, 
that all matters must be settled in harmony and love, and that there are
 times when the husband and wife should defer to the wishes of the 
other. Exactly under what circumstances such deference should take place
 is a matter for each couple to determine. If, God forbid, they fail to 
agree, and their disagreement leads to estrangement, they should seek 
counsel from those they trust and in whose sincerity and sound judgement
 they have confidence, in order to preserve and strengthen their ties as
 a united family.</p>
<p>	(16 May 1982)</p>
<p>	2342. Concerning the definition of the term "aversion" in relation 
to Baha'i divorce law, the Universal House of Justice points out that 
there are no specific "grounds" for Baha'i divorce such as there are in 
some codes of civil law. Baha'i law permits divorce but, as both 
Baha'u'llah and<br>
 'Abdu'l-Baha have made very clear, divorce is abhorred. Thus, from the 
point of view of the individual believer he should do all he can to 
refrain from divorce. Baha'is should be profoundly aware of the sanctity
 of marriage and should strive to make their marriages an eternal bond 
of unity and harmony. This requires effort and sacrifice and wisdom and 
self-abnegation. A Baha'i should consider the possibility of divorce 
only if the situation is intolerable and he or she has a strong aversion
 to being married to the other partner. This is a standard held up to 
the individual. It is not a law, but an exhortation. It is a goal to 
which we should strive.</p>
<p>	From the point of view of the Spiritual Assembly, however, the 
matter is somewhat different. The Spiritual Assembly should always be 
concerned that the believers in its community are being deepened in 
their understanding of the Baha'i concept of marriage, especially the 
young people, so that the very thought of divorce will be abhorrent to 
them.... It can be seen, therefore, that "aversion" is not a specific 
legal term that needs to be defined. Indeed a number of other terms are 
used in describing the situation that can lead to divorce in Baha'i law,
 such as "antipathy", "resentment", "estrangement", "impossibility of 
establishing harmony" and "irreconcilability". The texts, however, point
 out that divorce is strongly condemned, should be viewed as "a last 
resort" when "rare and urgent circumstances" exist, and that the partner
 who is the "cause of divorce" will "unquestionably" become the "victim 
of formidable calamities".</p>
<p>	(3 November 1982)</p>
<p>	2343. When an application for divorce is made to a Spiritual 
Assembly, its first thought and action should be to reconcile the couple
 and to ensure that they know the Baha'i teachings on the matter. God 
willing, the Assembly will be successful and no year of waiting need be 
started. However, if the Assembly finds that it is unable to persuade 
the party concerned to withdraw the application for divorce, it must 
conclude that, from its point of view, there appears to be an 
irreconcilable antipathy, and it has no alternative to setting the date 
for the beginning of the year of waiting. During the year the couple 
have the responsibility of attempting to reconcile their differences, 
and the Assembly has the duty to help them and encourage them. But if 
the year of waiting comes to an<br>
 end without reconciliation the Baha'i divorce must be granted as at the
 date of the granting of the civil divorce if this has not already taken
 place.</p>
<p>	(6 May 1987)</p>
<p>	2344. It is clear that the Baha'i teachings call for an absolute 
standard of fidelity in the relationship between husband and wife. An 
excerpt from a letter dated 28 September 1941 to an individual believer 
written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, quoted in "Messages from the 
Universal House of Justice, 1968-1973", page 108, states:</p>
<p>	The question you raise as to the place in one's life that a deep 
bond of love with someone we meet other than our husband or wife can 
have is easily defined in view of the teachings. Chastity implies both 
before and after marriage an unsullied, chaste sex life. Before marriage
 absolutely chaste, after marriage absolutely faithful to one's chosen 
companion. Faithful in all sexual acts, faithful in word and in deed.</p>
<p>	It is also evident from Baha'i teachings that no husband should 
subject his wife to abuse of any kind, and that such a reprehensible 
action is the antithesis of the relationship of mutual respect and 
equality enjoined by the Baha'i writings -- a relationship governed by 
the principles of consultation and devoid of the use of force to compel 
obedience to one's will.</p>
<p>	(22 July 1987)</p>
<p>	2345. The House of Justice advises you to continue the strenuous 
efforts you are making to overcome the difficulties in your marriage. It
 is pleased to note that you and your husband have turned to the Local 
Spiritual Assembly for guidance and have sought help from a Baha'i who 
is a marriage counsellor. Such endeavours, when combined with a strong 
and determined effort, improve greatly the prospects that your marriage 
can be maintained. However, it must also be borne in mind that the fact 
that Baha'u'llah has permitted divorce is, no doubt, an indication that 
in certain circumstances it is unavoidable. If your earnest efforts to 
maintain your marriage do not yield the desired result, you should not 
be distraught.</p>
<p>	(28 April 1989)<br>

</p><p>	2346. The House of Justice is distressed to learn that you and 
your husband are continuing to experience marital difficulties. It has 
frequently advised believers in such situations to turn to the Spiritual
 Assemblies for advice and counsel, and to follow this advice in their 
efforts to preserve the unity of their marital relationship. It has been
 found useful in many instances to also seek the assistance of competent
 professional marriage counsellors, who can provide useful insights and 
guidance in the use of constructive measures to bring about a greater 
degree of unity.</p>
<p>	(17 July 1989)</p>
<p>	2347. ... no husband should subject his wife to abuse of any kind, whether emotional, mental or physical....</p>
<p>	When a Baha'i wife finds herself in such a situation and feels it 
cannot be resolved through consultation with her husband, she could well
 turn to the Local Spiritual Assembly for advice and guidance, and might
 also find it highly advantageous to seek the assistance of competent 
professional counsellors. If the husband is also a Baha'i, the Local 
Spiritual Assembly can bring to his attention the need to avoid abusive 
behaviour and can, if necessary, take firm measures to encourage him to 
conform to the admonitions of the teachings. There have been many 
instances in which a couple, through a consecrated and determined 
effort, aided by the power of prayer and the advice of experts, 
succeeded in overcoming seemingly insuperable obstacles to their 
reconciliation and in reconstructing a strong foundation for their 
marriage. There are also innumerable examples of individuals who have 
been able to effect drastic and enduring changes in their behaviour, 
through drawing on the spiritual powers available by the bounty of God. 
As you know, in the Baha'i Faith, divorce is discouraged and should be 
resorted to only when a prolonged effort to effect reconciliation has 
been unsuccessful. However, it should also be noted that divorce is 
permissible when an irreconcilable antipathy exists between the two 
parties to the marriage.</p>
