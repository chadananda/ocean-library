    <p id='7'>For a number of years the House of Spirituality has been gathering copies of Tablets, received by the Friends in America from Abdul-Baha Abbas, for sacred preservation in its archives, in accord with permission from him to do so in a Tablet addressed to it dated April 21, 1903, as follows: “As to the compiling of the Tablets in a Book for the House of Spirituality, this depends upon the consent of the receivers of the Tablets; if the owners of the Tablets consent, copies should be kept and collected in the House of Spirituality and it will be acceptable.”</p>
  
    <p id='8'>Although many Tablets, both published and unpublished, were known to be in circulation among the believers, and notwithstanding the restriction to collect only copies sent in with the consent of the recipients, yet, in the spring of 1907, through the hearty response and co-operation in this endeavor about 500 copies of different Tablets had been received, acknowledge and filed with data concerning each in a safety deposit vault equipped with all modern appliances for protection.</p>
  
    <p id='9'>We believe the Friends everywhere will be further interested in knowing that at that time a draft of the Tablets was made by the Librarian of the House of Spirituality for the Bahai Publishing Society (who contemplated issuing same in book form), with all references to personalities eliminated, and said compilation was taken by Mr. Agnew to the presence of Abdul-Baha, who inquired especially as to elimination of all names of persons and everything of a clearly personal nature, and as to whether the recipients of the Tablets had consented to publication of them, etc.—to all of which he gave approval and instructed the Publishing Society to proceed with the work.</p>
  
    <p id='10'>The purpose of this communication is therefore twofold: First, that the endeavor be continued to preserve a copy of every Tablet obtainable; and second, that it be accomplished at the earliest possible moment in order to make the forthcoming Volumes of Tablets (now being prepared by the Publishing Society) as complete as possible, for only the Tablets in the archives of the House will be used, as therein is recorded the desire of the recipients.</p>
  
    <p id='11'>In sending copies of Tablets, kindly see in so far as possible that together with each is given: (1) Full name of recipient (2) present address, mentioning street number, city or town, and state, (3) on or about date translation, (4) name of translator, (5) clearly state whether or not permission to publish all or only a portion of same is granted. Should there be any doubt as to whether or not a copy of any certain Tablet is already in the archives, you may be assured in knowing that every Tablet received has been acknowledged on a special printed form, signed by the Librarian.</p>
  
    <p id='12'>Concerning this important matter the following words of Abdul-Baha will be of interest to all: “Verily know, that the Tablets (Book) of Abdul-Baha and his address is a hidden mystery and concealed fact; no one is informed of its greatness and importance at these times. But in the course of times and future centuries, the signs thereof will be manifested, the lights thereof will dawn, the fragrance thereof will be diffused, and the greatness, the importance thereof will be known. The truth I say unto thee, that each leaflet from Abdul-Baha will be a wide-spread Book; nay, rather, a glistening Gem on the Glorious Crown. Know thou Its value and hold great Its station!”</p>
  
    <p id='13'>Thanking you in advance, we are your fellow servants in the Vineyard of El-Abha,</p>

    <p id='15'>A sufficient number of Tablets having been gathered together, they have been entrusted to the Baha’i Publishing Society for publication in this concrete form for the enlightenment of the English-speaking world.</p>
  
    <p id='16'>The Tablets appear in the book in the order received and filed in the archives, i.e. the first to respond to the above letter sent out by the House of Spirituality appear first in the book, and, so far as possible, all the Tablets to any one person or to a family or to an assembly have been placed together.</p>
  
    <p id='17'>Regarding publications, the following Tablet from Abdul-Baha was received by this Society in October, 1906: </p>

    <p id='19'>Your letter was received and its contents became known. Ye have written concerning the printing and publication of the Tablets.</p>
  
    <p id='20'>The translation of the Surat-ul-Hykl <a data-fnid='2'></a> is of the utmost difficulty. It must be translated by a committee who are exceedingly efficient both in Persian and English, exercising the closest and most minute attention. Otherwise the text would not become intelligible. The same rule applieth to other Writings and Tablets. For the present the organization of such a committee of translators is not possible and there is no other means than the translations made by individuals. In the future, God willing, means will be brought about. Translations will be made by a committee composed of two most erudite Persians and two learned Americans, all of them having the utmost proficiency in both languages and possessing a certain knowledge of sciences and arts. Then others from among the scholars and thinkers must assist. At that time Tablets will be translated correctly and published. What ye have in your hands and what is already printed will impart a certain degree of information. Whatever matter the spiritual Boards of Council in New York, Chicago, Washington and Kenosha unanimously deem advisable to print and publish, ye may print and publish; and have the utmost union and oneness with each other.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='2'>Surat-ul-Hykl, by Baha’o’llah, a portion of which was translated by Anton Haddad, published in 1900. The retranslation of this book has not yet been undertaken.</aside>
  
    <p id='21'>Regarding the Tablets of Abdul-Baha: Each of them is important. Print ye those which are in detail.</p>
  
    <p id='22'>As to the question of annihilation and destruction of the Spirits <a data-fnid='3'></a> : Mr. Phelps hath not not fully understood the matter or else the translator hath made some mistake. It was not intended to convey the idea that the unbelieving souls are absolutely annihilated. Nay, rather, it was meant that the existence of the evil spirits in comparison to the existence of the sanctified souls was like unto annihilation. As you clearly behold, the existence of mineral in comparison with the existence of man is like unto non-being. When the body of man is destroyed and disintegrated, it returneth to the mineral.</p>

    <p id='23'>Concerning the income of the printing and publishing society, as ye write, it must be expended for charitable purposes.</p>
  
    <p id='24'>O ye believers of God! I am pleased with you and seek for your assistance and confirmation. I hope that ye may, day by day, add to your love, steadfastness, purity of intention and service to the Cause of God.</p>

    <p id='27'>These Tablets were originally written in Persian and all bear the caption, “He is God!” <a data-fnid='4'></a> and close with expressions of good will, such as, “Upon ye be greetings and praise!” These expressions have been omitted from this compilation; also such portions as are clearly of a personal nature, as well as names of persons, as instructed by Abdul-Baha.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='4'>This is a usage of the people of the East. The purpose is that in every matter the commencement should be in the Name of God.</aside>
  
    <p id='28'>Omission of names of persons has been designated by the sign, thus ….….; omission of purely personal portions of the text have been designated by the sign, thus ***. The translator’s interpolations are enclosed in parentheses, thus ( ); editor’s interpolations are enclosed in brackets, thus [ ]. For messages within Tablets a special sign has been found necessary and these messages are enclosed within this special sign, thus ~ ~. Quotations are shown by the usual sign, thus “ ”.</p>
  
    <p id='29'>The great labor of translating these Tablets from the original language has been entrusted to the following translators, whose inestimable service is hereby gratefully acknowledged: Anton Haddad, Mirza S. M. Raffie, Mirza Housein Rouhy, Ali Kuli Khan, Dr. Ameen U. Fareed, H. S. M. Taki Manshadi, Mirza Ahmad Esphahani, Mrs. Getsinger, Miss Barney and Mirza Moneer Zane.</p>
  
    <p id='30'>The House of Spirituality desires to thank all who have assisted in this matter of gathering in copies of Tablets for preservation in its archives, and requests the Bahais everywhere to continue the endeavor as outlined in the circular letter sent out by that Body, as herein quoted. Address such communications to the Librarian of the House of Spirituality, P. O. Box 283, Chicago, Ill.</p>
  
    <p id='31'>Only a portion of the Tablets now on file with the House of Spirituality are contained in this volume. Other volumes will be issued as soon as possible. Tablets coming in will take their place in order according to the date received and appear in forth-coming volumes.</p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='“For the information of those who know little or nothing…”'></h3>
  
    <p id='34'>For the information of those who know little or nothing of the Bahai Revelation, we quote the following account translated from the (French) Encyclopaedia of Larousse:—</p>
  
    <p id='35'>Bahaism the religion of the disciples of Baha’o’llah, an outcome of Babism.—Mirza Husain Ali Nuri Baha’o’llah was born at Teheran in 1817 A. D. From 1844 he was one of the first adherents of the Bab, and devoted himself to the pacific propagation of his doctrine in Persia. After the death of the Bab he was, with the principal Babis, exiled to Baghdad, and later to Constantinople and Adrianople, under the surveillance of the Ottoman Government. It was in the latter city that he openly declared his mission. He was “He whom God would make manifest,” whom the Bab had announced in his writings, the great Manifestation of God, promised for the last days; and in his letters to the principal Rulers of the States of Europe he invited them to join him in establishing religion and universal peace. From this time, the Babis who acknowledged him became Bahais. The sultan then exiled him (1868 A. D.) to Acca in Palestine, where he composed the greater part of his doctrinal works, and where he died in 1892 A. D. (May 29). He had confided to his son, Abbas Effendi Abdul-Baha, the work of spreading the religion and continuing the connection between the Bahais of all parts of the world. In point of fact, there are Bahais everywhere, not only in Mohammedan countries, but also in all the countries of Europe, as well as in the United States, Canada, Japan, India, etc. This is because Baha’o’llah has known how to transform Babism into a universal religion, which is presented as the fulfillment and completion of all the ancient faiths. The Jews await the Messiah, the Christians the return of Christ, the Moslem the Mahdi, the Buddhists the fifth Buddha, the Zoroastrians Shah Bahram, the Hindoos the reincarnation of Krishna, and the Atheists—a better social organization! Baha’o’llah represents all these, and thus destroys the rivalries and the enmities of the different religions; reconciles them in their primitive purity, and frees them from the corruption of dogmas and rites. For Bahaism has no clergy, no religious ceremonial, no public prayers; its only dogma is belief in God and in his Manifestations (Zoroaster, Moses, Jesus, et al., Baha’o’llah). The principal works of Baha’o’llah are the Kitab-ul-Ighan, the Kitab-ul-Akdas, the Kitab-ul-Ahd, and numerous letters or tablets addressed to sovereigns or to private individuals. Ritual holds no place in the religion, which must be expressed in all the actions of life, and accomplished in neighborly love. Every one must have an occupation. The education of children is enjoined and regulated. No one has the power to receive confession of sins, or to give absolution. The priests of the existing religions should renounce celibacy, and should preach by their example, mingling in the life of the people. Monogamy is universally recommended, etc. Questions not treated of are left to the civil law of each country, and to the decisions of the Bait-ul-Adl, or House of Justice, instituted by Baha’o’llah. Respect toward the Head of the State is a part of respect toward God. A universal language, and the creation of tribunals of arbitration between nations, are to suppress wars. “You are all leaves of the same tree, and drops of the same sea,” Baha’o’llah has said. Briefly, it is not so much a new religion as Religion renewed and unified, which is directed today by Abdul-Baha.—(Nouveau Larousse Illustre, supplement, p. 66.) </p>

    <p id='58'>Verily, I hope, through the kindness of my Lord and His mercy, bounty and generosity, to be suspended in the air in His path and that my breast may become the target to be be pierced by thousands of bullets; or that I may be cast into the bottomless seas, or thrown into the wilderness and plains of barrenness. This is my utmost aim, my supreme desire, the animation of my <span data-pg='5' id='pg5'></span> spirit, the healing of my bosom and the sight of my eyes.</p>
  
    <p id='59'>As to you, O friends of God: Make firm your feet in the Cause of God with such firmness as cannot be shaken by the most great disasters of this world. Be not troubled by anything under any condition. Be as lofty mountains, dawning stars from the horizon of existence, brilliant lamps in the assemblies of oneness and lowly souls, pure hearted, with the friends.</p>
  
    <p id='60'>Be signs of guidance; lights of piety; severed from the world, holding fast to the firm rope; spreaders of the spirit of life; abiders in the ark of safety; manifestations of mercy; dawning-stars of the mysteries of existence; points of revelation; day-springs of light; strengthened by the Holy Spirit; attracted toward God; sanctified from all things and from the (natural) qualities of people, and characterized with the attributes of the angels of heaven—so ye may attain to the greatest gift in this great century and new age.</p>
  
    <p id='61'>By the life of El-Abha! No one will obtain this great favor save he who cuts himself from this world, being attracted by the love of God, who is dead to the desires and appetites of self, sincere to God in all things and meek, humble, imploring, pleading and lowly before God. </p>

    <p id='88'>O ye friends of Abdul-Baha!</p>
  
    <p id='89'>Verily I read your reports with great joy. They are a cause of spirituality and fragrance and a source of dilation of souls. If this Spiritual Meeting, by the divine fragrance and heavenly confirmation, be firmly established (or continued) it will become a source of great signs and will be confirmed in matters of paramount importance.</p>
  
    <p id='90'>The Spiritual Meetings, which are organized in this cycle of God and this divine century, have never had their simile or likeness in bygone cycles. For the great meetings (organizations) were under the protection of aristocratic men, while these meetings (or organizations) are under the protection of the bounty of El-Abha. The helper or supporter of those (organizations) was either a prince or a king; either a priest was the principal, or a great republic (the cause); but the Helper, the Assistant, the Confirmer and the Inspirer of these spiritual meetings (or organizations) is His Majesty the Everlasting God.</p>
  
    <p id='91'>Consider not the present condition, but rather foresee the future and the end. A seed in the beginning is very small, but in the end a great tree. One should not consider the seed, but the tree and its abundance of blossoms, leaves and fruits.</p>
  
    <p id='92'>Consider the days of Jesus, when there was only a small body of people, and then observe the great tree which grew from that seed and what an abundant fruit it produced. This is greater than that, forasmuch as it is the calling of the Lord of Hosts and the Voice of the Trumpet of the Living God; it is the summons unto the harmony and unison of the world, and it is the banner <span data-pg='11' id='pg11'></span> of faithfulness, trustworthiness and friendship among the difference nations and sects of the universe; it is the light of the Sun of Truth and the spirituality of the Majestic One. Verily this great cycle (dispensation) will encompass all the horizons and ultimately all the nations will gather together under this standard.</p>
  
    <p id='93'>Therefore, know the importance of this seed which was planted in the divine field by the heavenly Gardener, watered with the rain of grace and nurtured by the heat and light of the Sun of Truth. Thus, O ye friends of God, give thanks unto His Majesty, the One, that ye became (or were made) the manifestation of such a gift and the recipient of such favor.</p>
  
    <p id='94'>Blessed are ye! Good-tidings unto you for this great blessing! </p>

    <p id='101'>O ye who are attracted by the Fragrances of God!</p>
  
    <p id='102'>Verily I read your letters which uttered your steadfastness in the Cause of God, your firmness in His Religion and your joy by the breezes wafted from the garden of the Kingdom of God.</p>
  
    <p id='103'>The truth, I say unto you, <specmsg>“Verily, the Supreme Concourse utter praise upon you, because ye forsook the desires of self, were illumined by the light of guidance, clothed yourselves with the garment of sanctity and called in the Name of El-Abha among the people. Verily, ye shall reap what ye sow and obtain the fruits of what ye plant. This is a pre-ordained fact.”</specmsg></p>
  
    <p id='104'>O ye beloved of God! When the winds blow severely, rains fall fiercely, the lightning flashes, the thunder roars, the bold descends and storms of trial become severe, grieve not; for after this storm, verily, the divine spring will arrive, the hills and fields will become verdant, the expanses of grain will joyfully wave, the earth will become covered with blossoms, the trees will be clothed with green garments and adorned with <span data-pg='13' id='pg13'></span> blossoms and fruits. Thus blessings become manifest in all countries. These favors are results of those storms and hurricanes.</p>
  
    <p id='105'>The discerning man rejoiceth at the day of trials, his breast becometh dilated at the time of severe storms, his eyes become brightened when seeing the showers of rain and gusts of wind, whereby trees are uprooted; because he foreseeth the result and the end (of these trials), the leaves, blossoms and fruits (which follow this wintry storm); while the ignorant (short-sighted) person becometh troubled when he seeth a storm, is saddened when it raineth severely, is terrified by the thunder and trembleth at the surging of the waves which storm the shores.</p>
  
    <p id='106'>As ye have heard of the former times, when (for example) Christ—glory be to Him! —appeared, a storm of trials arose, afflictions appeared, the winds of tests blew, the thunder of temptation descended and hosts of people (Pharisees) surrounded the houses of the friends; then the weak ones were shaken and were misled after once being guided; but the disciples withstood the hardships and endured the storms of ordeals, remaining firm in the Religion of God. Then observe that which occurred after the storm and what appeared subsequent to that severity, whereby the members (followers) trembled.</p>
  
    <p id='107'>God hath changed the sorrow to joy, the destructive darkness of calamity into the shining light from the Supreme Concourse. The people at the beginning persecuted and reviled the believers in God and said of them: “These are the people of aberration.” Then, when <span data-pg='14' id='pg14'></span> their light appeared, their stars shone and their lamps illuminated, the people returned into love and affinity; they prayed to them, offered words of glory night and day (in their name) and remembered them in eulogy, reverence, honor and majesty.</p>
  
    <p id='108'>Therefore, O ye beloved of God, be not grieved when people stand against you, persecute you, afflict and trouble you and say all manner of evil against you. The darkness will pass away and the light of the manifest signs will appear, the veil will be withdrawn and the Light of Reality will shine forth from the unseen [Kingdom] of El-Abha. This we inform you before it occurs, so that when the hosts of people arise against you for my love, be not disturbed or troubled; nay, rather, be firm as a mountain, for this persecution and reviling of the people upon you is a pre-ordained matter. Blessed is the soul who is firm in the path! </p>

    <p id='133'>Souls are like unto mirrors, and the bounty of God is like unto the sun. When the mirrors pass beyond all coloring and attain purity and polish, and are confronted with the sun, they will reflect in full perfection its light and glory.

    <p id='138'>Your long letter was considered and its contents were a source of happiness. Thank God that ye, western friends, have become dawning-points of the love of God and stars of knowledge leading to Him; night and day are ye thinking of imparting life to souls and of educating people of discernment.</p>
  
    <p id='139'>Regarding the blessed word, the Greatest Name: Its writing or spelling is according to its pronunciation (i.e., it is spelled as it is pronounced) in the Persian language. Baha is correct; Beha is incorrect. However <span data-pg='21' id='pg21'></span> this question must not cause inharmony and grief among the friends. This truth shall become manifest.</p>
  
    <p id='140'>Should ye attribute a mistake to a person, it will be a cause of offense and grief to him—how much greater would this be if it is attributed to a number of people! How often it hath occurred that a slight difference hath caused a great dissension and hath been made a reason for division. Now, you write Baha’u’llah, <a data-fnid='20'></a> but do not object to any person. All will eventually follow the correct spelling.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='20'>This spelling was later changed by Abdul-Baha to Baha’o’llah, as an aid to more correct pronunciation.</aside>
  
    <p id='141'>O ye beloved ones of God! The manifestation of the Light of Unity is for binding together the people of the world. If this unity is not attained, the tree of life is made fruitless, the heavenly bounty is not utilized. The blessed blood (of the saints) was shed for bringing about unity and harmony. These souls gave their lives as sacrifice in order to produce the love that bindeth the hearts of all the people. Therefore, ye should all spend your efforts in uniting and reconciling (the people), so that the light of God’s love may permeate the universe.</p>
  
    <p id='142'>The Spiritual Meeting of men (House of Spirituality) and the Spiritual Meeting of women (Assembly of Teaching) in Chicago are indeed endeavoring to serve. If they unite, as they should, they will produce great results. Especially, if the Spiritual Meetings of <span data-pg='22' id='pg22'></span> Chicago unite with those of New York and become bound together, in a short while the fragrance of the divine garden, which giveth life, will perfume all regions. </p>

    <p id='146'>The spiritual love of God maketh man pure and holy and clotheth him with the garment of virtue and purity. And when man attacheth his heart wholly to God and becometh related to the Blessed Perfection, the divine bounty will dawn. This love is not physical, nay, rather, it is absolutely spiritual.</p>

This is the station of the sincere. This is the quality of those who are firm. This is the illumination of the faces of those who are near.</p>
  
    <p id='150'>Therefore, O ye friends of God, ye must in perfect purity attain spiritual unity and agreement to a degree that ye may express one spirit and one life.</p>
  
    <p id='151'>In this condition physical bodies play no part: the command and authority are in the hand of the spirit. When the spirit becometh all inclusive, the Spiritual union shall be attained. Night and day endeavor to attain perfect harmony; be thoughtful concerning your own spiritual developments and close your eyes to the shortcomings of one another.</p>
  
    <p id='152'>By good deeds, pure lives, humility and meekness be a lesson for others.</p>
  
    <p id='153'>Abdul-Baha wisheth no one’s heart to feel hurt, nor will he be a source of grief to any one; for there is no greater satisfaction than being a source of joy to the hearts.</p>

    <p id='169'><a data-fnid='24'></a> *** Thou has written concerning the Board of Consultation.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='24'>Extracts from a Tablet to Mirza Assad Ullah, at the time of the organization of the House of Justice, and the Assembly of Teaching of Chicago, in September, 1901.</aside>
  
    <p id='170'>It is very proper thou shouldst exert thyself with heart and soul so that this assembly shall become a source of merciful events, and enter the shadow of the protection and preservation of His Highness, the One God. The more this gains strength and becomes effective, the greater will become the penetration of the Word of God, and the more will the doors of confirmation be opened.</p>
  
    <p id='171'>As to the Assembly of Teaching, the revered members of which are the maid-servants of the Merciful, they are also assisted by the help and the providence of the Beauty of El-ABHA. They will soon discover that they are strengthened by the invisible hosts, and rendered successful by the abundant bounty of the Kingdom of the Forgiving Lord. They will set such a flame to the regions as will kindle the heart of the universe, and will cause the pillars of the world to tremble. But all of their mention and thought in their meeting should be confined to teaching the truth, and to <span data-pg='27' id='pg27'></span> constantly persuade people in pure and divine brilliancy and in absolute godlike spirituality. They should not interfere with the affairs which have regard to the Board of Consultation, because confusion of thought conduces to division and causes disturbance to the mind, and then pure spirituality would cease. But if all mentions are turned into one mention, and all thoughts concentrated in one point, then man will find (a higher) spirit, and witness (a higher) confirmation. His power and penetration will increase, and his armies and hosts will gain successive victories. By this it is intended that the assembly of the maid-servants of the Merciful should be with pure spirituality and with absolute brilliancy, and become a torch of that blessed fire, a center of the merciful feelings.</p>
  
    <p id='172'>The Assembly of Teaching is in this day of the first importance, and is promised to be assisted and protected through the assistance of His Highness, the One God.</p>
  
    <p id='173'>Announce infinite glad-tidings to the revered maid-servants of God—the members of the merciful assembly, so that they may arise with the utmost tranquility (to further) prosperity and success, because Abdul-Baha is their strong and firm assistant through the help and the providence of the Lord of Hosts.</p>
  
    <p id='174'>Concerning organizing Houses of Justice of men and Assemblies of Teaching of maid-servants of God, the more endeavor is made, the more agreeable it will be. It is very useful. Likewise, electing men and women teachers, and their traveling and journeying in all parts, and their going and coming in cities and villages, is greatly conducive to the solidity of the Cause.*** </p>

    <p id='208'>O ye my divine friends! <a data-fnid='32'></a></p>
    <aside data-fnid='32'>Revealed in response to a supplication signed by 422 believers in America and sent July 4, 1905.</aside>
  
    <p id='209'>At a time when the sea of tests had become tempestuous and the waves of calamity were heaving and the hosts of nations were in the utmost violence and the people of oppression dealt with infinite injustice, some of the calumniators, uniting with our unkind brother, wrote a letter replete with false accusations and engaged in seditions and calumnies.</p>
  
    <p id='210'>They confused the mind of the government and agitated the state authorities. From this it is evident how a prisoner in this ruined walled city would fare and how the conditions are so full of perplexity and confusion as to baffle all description! Notwithstanding, this imprisoned exile is in the utmost firmness and calmness, trusts in His Highness the Peerless God, and wishes for every calamity and affliction in the path of the love of God! (To us) the arrow of oppression is a rich flow of divine bounty, and deadly poison is a swift-healing antidote.</p>
  
    <p id='211'>We were in such a state when a letter came from the friends in America. The whole of its contents showed an agreement on their part to be in unity and harmony in all respects, and it was signed by all, determined to be self-sacrificing in the path of the love of God, in order thus to secure eternal life.</p>
  
    <p id='212'>Upon perusing that letter and looking at the name signed to it, such a joy and gladness came over Abdul-Baha as is beyond description, and he thanked God that such friends are found in that country, who in utmost joy and fragrance are in union and accord and <span data-pg='36' id='pg36'></span> one in agreement with each other. The more this Covenant is strengthened, the happier, the better, the sweeter it will be and it will thus attract the divine confirmations. If the friends of God are wishing for confirmation in order to enjoy the friendship of the Supreme Concourse, they must exert themselves to confirm and strengthen this Covenant; for the making of a covenant, and an alliance for brotherhood and unity is like unto the irrigation of the tree of life which is conducive to eternal life!</p>
  
    <p id='213'>Briefly, O ye friends of God! Make your feet firm, make a firm compact, and in union and accord endeavor to diffuse the fragrance of the love of God and to spread the divine teachings, in order that ye may impart life to the dead body of this world, and bestow a real healing on every one diseased (in soul).</p>
  
    <p id='214'>O ye friends of God! The world is like the body of man—it hath become sick, feeble and infirm. Its eye is devoid of sight, its ear hath become destitute of hearing and its faculties of sense are entirely dissolved. The friends of God must become as wise physicians and care for and heal this sick person, in accord with the divine teachings, in order that—God willing—it may perchance gain health, find eternal healing and that its lost powers may be restored; and that the person of the world may find such health, freshness and purity that it will appear in the utmost beauty and charm.</p>
  
    <p id='215'>The first remedy is to guide the people, so that they may turn unto God, hearken unto the divine commandments and go forth with a hearing ear and seeing eye. After this swift and certain remedy hath been applied, then according to the divine teachings, they ought to <span data-pg='37' id='pg37'></span> be trained in the conduct, morals and deeds of the Supreme Concourse, encouraged and inspire with the gifts of the Kingdom of ABHA. The hearts should be purified and cleansed from every trace of hatred and rancor and enabled to engage in truthfulness, conciliation, uprightness and love toward the world of humanity; so that the East and the West may embrace each other like unto two lovers, enmity and animosity may vanish from the human world and the universal peace be established!</p>
  
    <p id='216'>O ye friends of God! Be kind to all peoples and nations, have love for all of them, exert yourselves to purify the hearts as much as you can, and bestow abundant effort in rejoicing the souls. Be ye a sprinkling of rain to every meadow and a water of life to every tree. Be ye as fragrant musk to every nostril and a soul-refreshing breeze to every invalid. Be ye salutary water to every thirsty one, a wise guide to every one led astray, an affectionate father or mother to every orphan, and, in the utmost joy and fragrance, a son or daughter to every one bent with age. Be ye a rich treasure to every indigent one; consider love and union as a delectable paradise, and count annoyance and hostility as the torment of hell-fire. Exert with your soul; seek no rest in body; supplicate and beseech with your heart and search for divine assistance and favor, in order that ye may make this world the Paradise of ABHA and this terrestrial globe the arena of the Supreme Kingdom. If ye make an effort, it is certain that these lights will shine, this cloud of mercy shall rain, this soul-nourishing breeze shall waft, and the scent of this most fragrant musk be diffused. <span data-pg='38' id='pg38'></span></p>
  
    <p id='217'>O ye friends of God! Be ye not concerned with the events transpiring at this Blessed Spot, and give no thought thereto. Whatever may happen is good, for calamities are bestowal itself, hardship is the reality of mercy, discomposure is but composure of mind, and sacrifice of life is a manifest gift. Whatever may happen is a bounty from God, the Most High. Be ye engaged in your own affairs; be employed in guiding the people; train the souls in the qualities and nature of Abdul-Baha, and convey the glad-tidings of the Kingdom of ABHA to the people. Do not seek rest during night and day and sit not tranquil for a minute. Bring these glad-tidings to the hearing of mankind with the utmost exertion, and accept every calamity and affliction in your love for God and reliance on Abdul-Baha. Endure the censure of enemies and bear the reproaches of the people of oppression with patience. Follow the example of Abdul-Baha and at every moment wish to offer yourselves in the path of the Beauty of ABHA. Shine ye like unto the sun and roar and move like unto the sea; impart life to mountain and desert like unto clouds, and similar to the vernal breeze, bestow freshness, grace and elegance on the trees of human temples. </p>

    <aside data-fnid='33'>Revealed for American believers in 1906, who had sent Abdul-Baha a New Year’s greeting.</aside>
  
    <p id='219'>It is New Year; that is to say, the rounding of the cycle of the year. A year is the expression of a cycle (of the sun); but now is the beginning of a cycle of Realty, a New Cycle, a New Age, a New Century, a <span data-pg='39' id='pg39'></span> New Time and a New Year. Therefore it is very blessed.</p>
  
    <p id='220'>I wish this blessing to appear and become manifest in the faces and characteristics of the believers, so that they, too, may become a new people, and having found new life and been baptized with fire and spirit, may make the world a new world, to the end that the old earth may disappear and the new earth appear; old ideas depart and new thoughts come; old garments be cast aside and new garments put on; ancient politics whose foundation is war be discarded and modern politics founded on peace raise the standard of victory; the new star shine and gleam and the new sun illumine and radiate; new flowers bloom; the new spring become known; the new breeze blow; the new bounty descend; the new tree give forth new fruit; the new voice become raised and this new sound reach the ears, that the new will follow the new, and all the old furnishings and adornments be cast aside and new decorations put in their places.</p>
  
    <p id='221'>I desire for you all that you will have this great assistance and partake of this great bounty, and that in spirit and heart you will strive and endeavor until the world of war become the world of peace; the world of darkness the world of light; satanic conduct be turned into heavenly behavior; the ruined places become built up; the sword be turned into the olive branch; the flash of hatred become the flame of the love of God and the noise of the gun the voice of the Kingdom; the soldiers of death the soldiers of life; all the nations of the world one nation; all races as one <span data-pg='40' id='pg40'></span> race; and all national anthems harmonized into one melody.</p>

    <p id='223'>O ye <a data-fnid='34'></a> Cohorts of God!</p>
    <aside data-fnid='34'>Revealed in response to a supplication signed by 489 believers in America during the period of the 19-day fast in 1906.</aside>
  
    <p id='224'>A letter which was signed by you in general was received. Its content was of the utmost beauty, sweetness, eloquence and perfection. While reading it the utmost happiness was produced. It spoke of fasting during the month of the Fast. Happy is your condition for you have executed the divine command; and have arisen to fast in these blessed days. For this physical fasting is a symbol of the spiritual fasting, that is, abstaining from all carnal desires, becoming characterized with the attributes of the spiritual ones, attracted to the heavenly fragrances and enkindled with the fire of the love of God.</p>
  
    <p id='225'>Likewise your letter was an evidence of the union and affinity of the hearts. I hope that through the bounty and favors of the Most Glorious Lord, in this new age, the regions of the West become the East of the Sun of Truth, the believers of God become the dawning-places of lights, the manifestors of the signs, be protected and guarded from the doubts of the heedless ones, remain firm and steadfast in the Covenant and Testament, and strive day and night in order to awaken those who are asleep, to make mindful those who are heedless, to make confident of the mysteries of the Kingdom those who are deprived, to confer a <span data-pg='41' id='pg41'></span> share from the never-ending outpouring upon those who are helpless, to become the heralds of the Kingdom and to call the inhabitants of this terrestrial world to the Celestial Realm.</p>
  
    <p id='226'>O ye Cohorts of God! Today in the present world each community is wandering in a wilderness, moving in accord with some passion and desire, and running to and fro in pursuance of his own imagination. Among the communities of the world, this community of the “Most Great Name” is free from every thought, keeping aloof from every project and scheme, arising with the purest designs and intentions, and striving and endeavoring with the utmost hope to live in accordance with the divine teachings in order that the surface of the earth become the delectable paradise, the nether world become the mirror of the Kingdom, the universe become another universe, and the human race attain to higher morals, conduct and manners.</p>
  
    <p id='227'>O ye Cohorts of God! Through the protection and help of the Blessed Perfection—may my life be a sacrifice to His beloved ones! —you must conduct and deport yourselves in such a manner that you may stand out among other souls distinguished by a brilliancy like unto the sun. If any one of you enters a city he must become the center of attraction because of the sincerity, faithfulness, love, honesty, fidelity, truthfulness and loving-kindness of his disposition and nature toward all the inhabitants of the world, that the people of the city may all cry out: “This person is unquestionably a Bahai; for his manners, his behaviour, his conduct, his morals, his nature and his disposition are of the attributes of the Bahais.” Until you do attain to this <span data-pg='42' id='pg42'></span> station, you have not fulfilled the Covenant and the Testament of God. For according to the irrefutable texts, He has taken from us a firm covenant that we may live and act in accord with the divine exhortations, commands and lordly teachings.</p>
  
    <p id='228'>O ye Cohorts of God! Now is the time when the signs and the perfections of the “Most Great Name” become manifest and clear in this golden cycle in order that it may become demonstrated and established beyond doubt that this period is the period of the Blessed Perfection, and this cycle is distinguished from all other cycles and epochs.</p>
  
    <p id='229'>O ye Cohorts of God! If you observe that a soul has turned his face completely toward the Cause of God, his intention is centralized upon the penetration of the Word of God, he is serving the Cause day and night with the utmost fidelity, no scent of selfishness is inhaled from his manners and deeds, and no trace of egotism or prejudice is seen in his personality—nay rather is he a wanderer in the wilderness of the love of God, and one intoxicated with the wine of the knowledge of God, occupied wholly with the diffusion of the fragrances of God, and attracted to the signs of the Kingdom of God; know ye of a certainty that he is confirmed with the powers of the Kingdom, assisted by the heaven of Might; and he will shine, gleam and sparkle like unto the morning star with the utmost brilliancy and splendor from the horizon of the everlasting gift. If he is alloyed with the slightest trace of passion, desire, ostentation or self-interest, it is certain that the results of all efforts will prove fruitless, and he will become deprived and hopeless. <span data-pg='43' id='pg43'></span></p>
  
    <p id='230'>O ye Cohorts of God! Praise be to God! —that the Blessed Perfection hath freed the necks from the bonds and fetters and released all from racial attachments by proclaiming, “Ye are all the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch.” Be ye kind to the human world, and be ye compassionate to the race of man, deal with the strangers as you deal with the friends, be ye gentle toward the outsiders as you are toward the beloved ones, know the enemy as the friend, look upon the satan as upon the angel, receive the unjust with the utmost love like unto a faithful one, and diffuse far and wide the fragrances of the musk of the gazelles of Kheta and Khotan <a data-fnid='35'></a> to the nostrils of the ravenous wolves.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='35'>Kheta and Khotan are two cities in China celebrated for having large numbers of musk-producing animals. The reference here symbolizes the severed and detached believers who are diffusing the fragrance of the Word of God.</aside>
  
    <p id='231'>Become ye a shelter and asylum to the fearful ones, be ye a cause of tranquility and cease to the souls and hearts of the agitated ones, impart ye strength to the helpless ones, be ye a remedy and antidote to the afflicted ones, and a physician and nurse to the sick ones. Serve ye for the promotion of peace and concord and establish in this transitory world the foundation of friendship, fidelity, reconciliation and truthfulness.</p>
  
    <p id='232'>O ye Cohorts of God! Strive ye that this human world may be changed into a luminous realm and this mound of earth become the Paradise of ABHA. Darkness hath environed the world upon all sides. Savage tempers and inclination predominate. The human world has become the battlefield of the rapacious savages <span data-pg='44' id='pg44'></span> and the arena of the heedless and ignorant ones. The souls are either bloodthirsty wolves or beasts with degenerate reason. They are either deadly poison, or worthless plants. There are a few souls who in reality have some humanitarian intentions and are thinking of the well-being and prosperity of human kind. You must in this instance (that is, service to humanity) sacrifice your lives, and in sacrificing your lives celebrate happiness and beatitude.</p>
  
    <p id='233'>O ye Cohorts of God! His Highness, the Supreme <a data-fnid='36'></a> —may my life be a sacrifice to Him! —hath given up His life, and at every moment the Blessed Perfection <a data-fnid='37'></a> in His own life sacrificed hundreds of lives, endured dire calamities and oppressions. Laden with fetters He was thrown into the dark dungeon, He was exiled and banished to distant lands and finally passed His days in the Most Great Prison <a data-fnid='38'></a> . Likewise a multitude of friends drank the sweet chalice of martyrdom and sacrificed soul, possession, family and relatives for the Cause. How many houses were overthrown! How many residences were pillaged and rapined! How many magnificent palaces were turned into a desolate tomb! All these phenomena transpired only that the world of humanity may become a luminous realm; ignorance be changed into wisdom, human souls become merciful, warfare and bloodshed be destroyed to their very foundation, and the Kingdom of Peace become paramount over all men. Now strive ye, that perchance this Beloved of Hopes appear in the assemblage of the world and this Providence become a realized fact. <span data-pg='45' id='pg45'></span></p>

    <p id='234'>O ye Cohorts of God! Beware lest ye offend the feelings of anyone, or sadden the heart of any person, or move the tongue in reproach of and finding fault with anybody, whether he is friend or stranger, believer or enemy. Pray in behalf of all and entreat God for forgiveness and bounty for all. Beware, beware that any soul take revenge or retaliate over another even if he be a bloodthirsty enemy. Beware, beware that any one rebuke or reproach a soul, though he may be an ill-wisher and an ill-doer. Do ye not look upon the creature, advance ye toward the Creator. Behold ye not the rebellious people, turn your faces toward the Lord of Hosts. Look ye not upon the ground, raise your eyes to the world-illuminating Sun, which hath transformed every atom of the gloomy soil into bright and luminous substance.</p>
  
    <p id='235'>O ye Cohorts of God! In the moment of catastrophe, find ye patience, resignation and submission.</p>
  
    <p id='236'>The more the calamities are intensified the less become ye disturbed. Withstand ye, with perfect assurance, the flood of trials and calamities, through the power of His Highness, the Almighty.</p>
  
    <p id='237'>Last year some of the known and unknown, friends and strangers, slandered, calumniated and presented false accusations against these exiled ones, before the throne of His Imperial Majesty, the Padeshah of the Ottomans; while these oppressed ones were entirely free from those calumnies. The government, conformable with prudent measures, arose to investigate these calumnies and dispatched some commissioners (or examiners) to this city. Therefore it is evident that the field which was found by the ill-wishers and the flood <span data-pg='46' id='pg46'></span> which was brought about by them, can neither be written nor explained. However, relying upon God, we conducted ourselves with the utmost patience and submission, resignation and calmness; so much so that if one did not know anything about these matters, he would have thought that we were in perfect ease of soul, enjoying the tranquility of heart and mind, and were engaged in happiness and felicity. The matters reached to such an issue that the plaintiffs and calumniators entered into alliance and intrigue with the officials, in regard to the carrying out of the work of investigation. Consequently, the plaintiff, the magistrate and the witness became as one single soul. Therefore it is clear what things transpired! But here one witnesses the fairness and impartiality of His Imperial Majesty, the Padeshah of the Ottomans, who so far has not given any consideration to these slanders, statements, stories and calumnies, but has dealt with the utmost justice and equity. Truly, I say, if there had been any other person except this Padeshah, no trace of these exiled ones would remain. This is the truth! We must not overlook justice. In reality today in the Asiatic world, the Padeshah of the Ottoman Empire and the Shah of Persia, Mozeffer-Eddin, are peerless and have no equals. If you could realize the degree of the malignity of the enemies, and the wickedness and mischief done by the ill-wishers, especially by the unkind brother, both here and in Persia, and that notwithstanding these seditions and villainies, these two kings have treated us with tranquility and mildness, ye would undoubtedly feel sure that both are just. If they were like kings of bygone ages, unquestionably <span data-pg='47' id='pg47'></span> every day thousands of souls would have been deprived of life in Persia. Therefore pray ye earnestly in behalf of these two kings, beseech for them protection and confirmation in the threshold of the Almighty, and ask for them, from God, victory and triumph; especially for the Padeshah of the Ottoman Empire, who has dealt at all times in justice with these exiled ones.</p>

    <p id='289'>Verily I read thy letter, which expressed thy surprise at some of the commandments of the law of God, such as that concerning the hunting of innocent animals. Be not surprised at this. Ponder over the contingent realities, their mysteries, wisdom, connection and relations. The world is harmonious in all things and the connection therein is mighty and nothing is missing. All things are eaters and eaten in the physical creation. The plant sucks from the mineral, the animal eats and swallows the plant, and the human eats the animal. Then the mineral (in turn) eats the human body. Physical bodies are transferred from death to death and life to life. Therefore, all things are subject to transfer and change except the Cause of existence, which cannot be changed or transferred, because it is the foundation for life in all kinds and species and in all possible realities in the world of creation.</p>
  
    <p id='290'>If thou observest closely through a microscope the water which man drinks and the air which he breathes, thou wilt see that in every breath which man breathes, that breath contains numerous animals, and in every draught of water great number of animals exist. This could not be prevented because the existent beings are eaters and eaten and, by this, existence is caused; otherwise, <span data-pg='56' id='pg56'></span> the relations between existent things would cease. When a thing decomposes and decays, being bereft of life, it becomes promoted to a world of life greater than the former. For instance, it ceased in a mineral life and was promoted to the vegetable life; then leaves the vegetable life and is elevated to that of the animal; then leaving the animal life it advances to the human, and this is on account of the favor of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Clement.</p>
  
    <p id='291'>I ask God to strengthen thee in comprehending the mysteries deposited in the reality of existence, to lift up the veil before thee and thy sister, so that the concealed mystery and the hidden reality become manifest as the sun at noon, and to confirm thy sister and thy husband in entering the Kingdom of God, and heal thee from all physical and spiritual disease in the world of creation. </p>

    <p id='472'>O thou who hast humbled thyself before the Kingdom of God!</p>
  
    <p id='473'>Blessed art thou that thine heart is attracted to the Beauty of God, is illumined with the light of knowledge and the ray of the Kingdom hath shone within it. <span data-pg='87' id='pg87'></span></p>
  
    <p id='474'>Know thou, verily, God is with thee under all circumstances and guards thee from the concerns of the world and makes thee a servant in His great vineyard.</p>
  
    <p id='475'>As to thy question concerning training children: It is incumbent upon thee to nurture them from the breast of the love of God, to urge them towards spiritual matters, to turn unto God and to acquire good manners, best characteristics and praiseworthy virtues and qualities in the world of humanity, and to study sciences with the utmost diligence; so that they may become spiritual, heavenly and attracted to the fragrances of sanctity from their childhood and be reared in a religious, spiritual and heavenly training. Verily, I beg of God to confirm them therein.</p>
  
    <p id='476'>As to thy revered husband: It is expedient that thou shouldst behave toward him in the best way and persevere in his good pleasure (i.e., please him) and treat him with kindness under all aspects; until (or so that) he may find that through thy turning toward the Kingdom of God (i.e., by becoming a believer) thy affection toward him and thy love for God is increased and that thou hast regard for his good will in every condition.</p>
  
    <p id='477'>Verily, I beg of God to make thee steadfast in His love and to cause thee to diffuse the fragrances of sanctity in those places (i.e., to teach the Truth). </p>

    <p id='478'>O thou loving torch, flaming by the fire of the Love of God!</p>
  
    <p id='479'>Verily, I read thy letter sent by thee and was rejoiced in heart by the wonderful meaning and eloquent content, which proved thy extreme sincerity in the <span data-pg='88' id='pg88'></span> Cause of God, thy steadfastness in the path of the Kingdom of God and thy firmness in the religion of God, forasmuch as this is of the utmost importance before God.</p>
  
    <p id='480'>How many souls advanced unto God, entered the shadow of the Word of God and became celebrated in the world, as Judas Iscariot. Then, when the tests became severe and trials great, their feet turned from the path; turned from confession to denial; changed from love and affection to severe enmity. Then the power of tests, whereby the foundations shake, were manifested.</p>
  
    <p id='481'>Judas Iscariot was one of the greatest disciples, was called unto Jesus; he thought that Jesus increased his kindness to Peter, the disciple, when saying to him: “Thou art Peter; upon thee I shall build my church.” This speech affecting Peter with special impression whereby envy was created in the heart of Judas and, therefore, he turned after advancing, denied after confessing, hated after loving, until he became the cause of the crucifixion of the Glorious Lord and Manifest Light. This is the end of envy which causes people to turn from the right path. Such has taken place and will occur in this Great Cause; but there is no harm in it, as it is the cause of manifesting the firmness of the rest and the arising of the firm souls who are as solid as the lofty mountains in the love of the Manifest Light.</p>
  
    <p id='482'>As to thee, convey unto the maid-servants of the Merciful that they must be firm in the love of El-Baha at the time of the severe trials and tests; forasmuch as the storms and winds occur during the winter seasons; <span data-pg='89' id='pg89'></span> then comes the spring with the wonderful scenery and it adorns the hills and plains with flowers and beautiful birds sing the melodies of joy on the branches of the trees and warble beautiful tunes on the roofs of bowers, in wonderful melodies. Soon shalt thou see that the lights have shone forth, the banners of the Kingdom have been raised, the fragrances of God diffused, the hosts of the Kingdom descending, the angels of heaven confirmed and the Holy Spirit breathed into those horizons (regions). Then shalt thou see the waverers frightened and at loss. This is a complete matter on the part of the Lord of Signs.</p>
  
    <p id='483'>Blessed art thou for keeping firm in the Cause of God. I pray God to give thee a divine spirit, spiritual blood and to make thee a growing and thriving leaf on the Tree of Life, so that thou mayest serve the maid-servants of God in fragrance and spirituality.</p>
  
    <p id='484'>Thy generous Lord will confirm thee in serving in His great vineyard and will make thee an instrument for spreading the spirit of concord and union among the maid-servants of the Merciful, will open thine insight by the light of knowledge and forgive thee thy sins and change them to good deeds.</p>
  
    <p id='485'>Verily thy Lord is the Forgiving, the Merciful and Possessor of Great Bounty! </p>

    <p id='486'>O maid-servant of God who art swayed like a strong branch by the breeze of God!</p>
  
    <p id='487'>I have read thy letter which evinces the abundance of thy love and the warmth of thy devotion and thy zeal in acknowledging God.</p>
  
    <p id='488'>Commit thyself to God; give up thy will and choose <span data-pg='90' id='pg90'></span> that of God; abandon thy desire and lay hold on that of God; that thou mayest be a holy, spiritual and heavenly example among the maid-servants of God.</p>
  
    <p id='489'>O maid-servant of God! Know thou that in the sight of God, the conduct of women is the same as that of men. All are the creatures of God and He has created them after His form and likeness; that is to say, after the form and likeness of the Manifestations of His names and His attributes. From the spiritual point of view, therefore, there is no difference between women and men. “The nearer we draw to God, the nearer He comes to us” without regard to whether the person be a man or a woman. How many women, thus drawn to God, have surpassed men in the shadow of Baha’ in bringing men under it—women famous throughout the world!</p>
  
    <p id='490'>The House of Justice, however, according to the positive commandments of the Doctrine of God, has been specialized to the men, for a (specific) reason or exercise of wisdom on the part of God, and this reason will presently appear, even as the sun at midday.</p>
  
    <p id='491'>And as to you—you other maid-servants attracted by the perfume of God—establish spiritual gatherings (assemblies) and heavenly meetings. This work is the beginning of the diffusing of the perfume of God and the foundation of the elevating of the Word of God and the making known of the commandments of God. Is there a blessing greater than this? These spiritual gatherings (assemblies) are sustained (reinforced) by the Spirit of God, and their protector is Abdul-Baha, who spreads his wings (over) above them. Is there a blessing greater than this? These <span data-pg='91' id='pg91'></span> spiritual gatherings (assemblies) are glowing lamps and heavenly gardens which cast the light of knowledge upon the contingent world and cause the spirit of life to penetrate to every quarter. This, then, is the best means of the progress of the human race in all conditions and circumstances. Is there a greater blessing than this? </p>

    <p id='494'>O thou dear maid-servant of God!</p>
  
    <p id='495'>Thank God that thou hast come near unto the Holy Threshold and art dear in the Kingdom of His Glory. Thou art president of an assembly which is a type of the assemblages of the Supreme Concourse and a reflection of the semblances of the Kingdom of God. With heart and soul, with entire devotion, supplication, humbleness and submissiveness, endeavor to promulgate the law of God and strive to diffuse the fragrances <span data-pg='92' id='pg92'></span> of God. Exert yourself to become the real president of assemblies of spiritual ones and a companion of the Kingdom of the Merciful.</p>
  
    <p id='496'>Thou hast asked in regard to the 10th verse of the 21st chapter of Revelation and to the 17th verse:</p>
  
    <p id='497'>Know that the firmament of the bright sun of the world of possibilities is divided into twelve sections, according to mathematical principles, which are called the twelve constellations; likewise, the Sun of Truth manifests and pours forth His bounty in twelve constellations of holiness. By these constellations are meant holy souls who are the manifestations of purity and the dawning-points of the lights of Unity. Observe that in the day of His Holiness the Speaker of God (Moses), there were twelve holy souls who were the leaders of the Truth. In like manner, in the cycle of His Holiness the Spirit (Jesus Christ), note that there were twelve apostles under the shadow of the light of the Most High, and the Sun of Truth was manifested through those bright dawning-places like unto the phenomenal sun. Likewise, in the time of His Holiness Mohammed, consider that there were twelve dawning points of holiness who were the manifestations of confirmation. Such is the case.</p>
  
    <p id='498'>Accordingly, St. John, the divine, declared in his vision regarding the twelve doors and the twelve foundations. By the great and holy city of Jerusalem, which is descended from heaven, is meant the sacred law of God. This subject has been repeatedly explained in many Tablets and in the Scriptures of the ancient prophets. For example, it is said in one place: “I beheld Jerusalem marching on to the wilderness.” The purport <span data-pg='93' id='pg93'></span> is that this Heavenly Jerusalem has twelve doors through which the advancing souls enter into the City of God. These doors are the souls who are the stars of guidance and doors unto bounty and knowledge. “At the gates twelve angels stood.” By “angel” is meant the power of the confirmation of God; that the candle of the power of the divine confirmation shines forth and is illumined in those souls. That is to say, that each one of those souls will be confirmed by the mightiest power. Those twelve gates surround the whole universe. This signifies that all existence is under the shadow of those souls; also, that these doors are the foundation of the city of God, the divine Jerusalem; that upon each of these foundations the name of one of the Apostles of His Holiness the Spirit <a data-fnid='59'></a> is written. That is to say, the manifestation of the perfections, glad-tidings, virtues and high attributes of that holy soul.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='59'>Christ.</aside>
  
    <p id='499'>In brief, it is said that: “And he that talked with me had a golden rod to measure the city and the gates thereof and the walls thereof.” The purport is this, that certain souls guided (people) with a rod of the plant, that is, a reed wherewith he shepherded the sheep, like unto the rod of Moses; other trained (the people) with a rod of iron and drove them, as in the time of Mohammed (The scepter of Mohammed was the sword). In this Greatest Day the rod of the plant and the rod of iron are changed into a rod which is of pure gold and is from the endless treasuries of the Kingdom of God.</p>
  
    <p id='500'>By the instrumentality of this, all people shall be <span data-pg='94' id='pg94'></span> trained. Observe the difference: In a certain time the teachings of God were like unto the twigs of a tree and by them the signs of God were spread, the law of God promulgated and the religion of God founded. Later a time came when the rod of the divine Shepherd was like iron, and now in this blessed and glorious cycle that rod is become like unto pure gold. What a great difference exists between them! Therefore know that the law of God and the divine teachings prove a great advance in this day. They have reached a degree of supremacy, compared with former ages. Nay, rather, this is pure gold, while that was iron and wood.</p>
  
    <p id='501'>This answer was written briefly because there was no more time. You will certainly excuse. The maid-servants of God must reach a station wherein they themselves shall comprehend the realities and meanings, to give clear explanations for each word and the fountains of wisdom gush forth from the reality of their hearts like a full flowing stream. </p>

    <p id='503'>Verily, I noted the contents of thy letter, which was beautifully composed, was informed of thy sorrow, the shedding of thy tears and the glowing of thy heart on account of the imprisonment of Abdul-Baha.</p>
  
    <p id='504'>O maid-servant of God! This prison is indeed more precious and sweet than a garden to me, this fetter is greater than any liberty and the confinement is broader than the most spacious wilderness. Therefore, grieve not on this account. Verily, if my Lord destine unto me and causes me to taste the sweetness of the cup <span data-pg='95' id='pg95'></span> of the great martyrdom, my greatest desire will be fulfilled. Fear not if this Branch be severed from the material earth and cast aside the leaves—nay, rather, its leaves will flourish, for this Branch will grow after it is cut from the earth (world), will ascend until it shelters the universe, its foliage will reach the Supreme Apex and bear fruits, imparting fragrant perfume unto the world. Therefore, turn unto thy Supreme Lord and say:</p>
  
    <p class='Sblockquote2' id='505'>O my God! O my God! This Thy maid-servant supplicates to Thee, trusts in Thee and directs herself unto Thee, asking Thee to shed Thy divine mercies upon her, to manifest Thy spiritual mysteries and to show forth Thy majesty unto her. O Lord! O Lord! Illumine the sight of my husband, cheer his breast by the light of knowing Thee, attract his heart unto Thy manifest Beauty and gladden his spirit by the manifestation of Thy radiant light. O Lord! Withdraw the veil from his sight, grant him Thy compassion, exhilarate him with the wine of Thy love among the people, make him an angel of Thine walking upon the earth, let his spirit soar unto heaven and make him a lamp glistening with the light of Thy knowledge in the community. Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Precious, the Bestower! </p>

Thus their breasts may become dilated by the holy fragrances emanating from the Kingdom of El-ABHA.</p>

At that time the maid-servants who are firm and constant will rejoice; while every doubtful soul who wavers will regret.

    <p id='542'>I have considered thy writing, which indicates brightness of heart and the love of God. Blessed art thou for having been thus favored and for having attained to guidance.</p>
  
    <p id='543'>You have asked me two questions: “That if the same spirit is manifest in all the Manifestations and Prophets, then what is the distinction or difference between Christ (or rather Jesus) and the other Prophets; also [what is the difference] between Father and Son?”</p>
  
    <p id='544'>Know that the human spirit is one, but it manifests <span data-pg='103' id='pg103'></span> itself in various members of the body in a certain (measure or) form. The human spirit is existent in the sight (eyes); it is also existent in the brain, which is the location of great functions and powers; it is also existent in the heart, which organ is largely connected with the brain or the center of the mind, and the heart, or that center which is connection with the brain, has a distinct and separate function, effect and appearance. In this connection, the hair and nails have no command (nor direct feeling).</p>
  
    <p id='545'>Figuratively speaking, the Father is the center of the brain and the Son is the center of the heart; the rest of the Prophets are members and parts. Fatherhood and Prophethood, in this case, are two expressions of the same thing, as man and creature are two names of the same reality.

    <p id='546'>O maid-servant of God! I pray God to confirm thee forever anew. Give greeting to thy dear mother. Superstition hath somewhat overcome her. When the imagined Satan overpowers, let her say: “O Baha-el-ABHA!” She should then turn to the highest Kingdom. Thus will the imagined Satan leave her. [She] has a form of obsession; therefore, you may not heed her sayings.</p>
  
    <p id='547'>Cultivate the land and thus, through its fruits, you will obtain benefits. God will relieve you from care (on account) of your mother.</p>
  
    <p id='548'>Give your good husband my spiritual greeting. I pray that he may be made a recipient of the divine bounties and attain to the grace of God. </p>

Then it is said by Jesus in the Gospel, that similar signs would appear in the “last day”—or in other words—in the day when Christ will come the second time in this world.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='64'>“Bible” signifies the Old Testament; “Gospel” signifies the New Testament.</aside>
  
    <p id='570'>The interpretation of these statements is mentioned in the clearest manner and with the most wonderful proofs in the Book of Ighan <a data-fnid='65'></a> .

Then you will be informed of the explanation and interpretation of these verses and statements as elucidated by the Blessed Perfection. Therefore my interpretation is not necessary.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='65'>During the time of BAHA’O’LLAH’S residence in Baghdad (the Dwelling of Peace), men of learning, including Jews, Christians and Mohammedans, visited Him seeking answer to religious and scriptural questions. Such answer He gave in the Book of Ighan, otherwise known as the Book of Explanations and Assurance. It concerns the Reality and Authority of the human Divine “Manifestations.”</aside>
    <aside data-fnid='66'>The book was published in 1904.</aside>
  
    <p id='571'>As to thy question concerning the 54th chapter of Isaiah: This chapter refers to the Exalted Leaf, the mother of Abdul-Baha. As a proof to this it is said: “For more are the children of the desolate, than the children of the married wife.” Reflect upon this statement and then upon the following: “And thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.” And truly the humiliation and reproach which she suffered in the path of God is a fact which no one can refute. For the calamities and afflictions mentioned in the whole chapter are such afflictions which she suffered in the path of God, all of which she endured with patience and thanked God therefor and praised Him, because He had enabled her to endure afflictions for the sake of Baha’. During <span data-pg='108' id='pg108'></span> all this time, the men and women (nakazeen) persecuted her in an incomparable manner, while she was patient, God-fearing, calm, humble and contented through the favor of her Lord and by the bounty of her Creator.</p>

    <aside data-fnid='70'>The Tomb of BAHA’O’LLAH.</aside>
  
    <p id='611'>Now as to what thou askest concerning the spirit and its “return” to this world of humanity and this elemental space: Know that spirit in general is divided into five sorts—the vegetable spirit, the animal spirit, the human spirit, the spirit of faith, and the divine spirit of sanctity.</p>
  
    <p id='612'>The vegetable spirit is the virtue augmentative, or growing or vegetative faculty, which results from the admixture of the simple elements, with the co-operation of water, air and heat.</p>
  
    <p id='613'>The animal spirit is the virtue perceptive resulting from the admixture and absorption of the vital elements generated in the heart, which apprehend sense impressions.</p>
  
    <p id='614'>The human spirit consists of the rational, or logical, reasoning faculty, which apprehends general ideas and things intelligible and perceptible. <span data-pg='116' id='pg116'></span></p>
  
    <p id='615'>Now these “spirits” are not reckoned as Spirit in the terminology of the Scriptures and the usage of the people of the Truth, inasmuch as the laws governing them are as the laws which govern all phenomenal being (i.e., all existences belonging to the phenomenal or material universe, called “the world of generation and corruption”), in respect to generation, corruption, production, change and reversion, as is clearly indicated in the Gospel where it says: “Let the dead bury their dead;” “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit”; inasmuch as he who would bury these dead was alive with the vegetative, animal and rational human soul, yet did Christ—to whom be glory! —declare such dead and devoid of life, in that this person was devoid of the Spirit of Faith, which is of the Kingdom of God.</p>
  
    <p id='616'>In brief, for these three spirits there is no restitution or “return,” but they are subordinate to reversions and production and corruption.</p>
  
    <p id='617'>But the Spirit of Faith which is of the Kingdom (of God) consists of the all-comprehending Grace and the perfect attainment (or salvation, fruition, achievement) and the power of sanctity and the divine effulgence from the Sun of Truth on luminous light-seeking essences from the presence of the divine Unity. And by this Spirit is the life of the spirit of man, when it is fortified thereby, as Christ saith: “That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.” And this Spirit hath both restitution and return, inasmuch as it consists of the Light of God and the unconditioned Grace. So, having regard to this state and station. Christ announced that John the Baptist was Elias, who was to come before <span data-pg='117' id='pg117'></span> Christ (Matt. 11:14). And the likeness of this station is as that of lamps kindled (from one another): for these in respect to their glasses and oil-holders, are different, but in respect to their light, One, and in respect to their illumination, One; nay, each one is identical with the other, without imputation of plurality, or diversity or multiplicity or separateness. This is the Truth and beyond the Truth there is only error.</p>
  
    <p id='618'>But as to the question of the Trinity, know, O advancer unto God, that in each one of the cycles wherein the Lights have shone forth upon the horizons (i.e., in each prophetic dispensation) and the Forgiving Lord hath revealed Himself on Mount Paran (see Habbakkuk 3:3, etc.) or Mount Sinai, or Mount Seir (see Ezekiel 35), there are necessarily three things: The Giver of the Grace, and the Grace, and the Recipient of the Grace; the Source of the Effulgence, and the Effulgence, and the Recipient of the Effulgence; the Illuminator, and the Illumination, and the Illuminated. Look at the Mosaic cycle: The Lord, and Moses, and the Fire (i.e., the burning bush), the Intermediary; and in the Mohammedan cycle: The Lord, the Apostle (or Messenger, Mohammed), and Gabriel (for, as the Mohammedans believe, Gabriel brought the Revelation from God to Mohammed). Look at the sun and its rays and the heat which results from its rays; the rays and the heart are but two effects of the sun, but inseparable from it; yet the sun is one in its essence, unique in its real identity, single in its attributes, neither is it possible that anything should <span data-pg='118' id='pg118'></span> resemble it. Such is the essence of the Truth concerning the Unity, the real doctrine of the Singularity, the undiluted reality as to the (Divine) Sanctity.</p>
  
    <p id='619'>But as to the question concerning the atonement on the part of the Holy Redeemer, I have explained this to thee by word of mouth in a plain and detailed manner, devoid of ambiguities, and I have made it clear to thee as the sun at noonday.</p>
  
    <p id='620'>And I ask God to open unto thee the gates, that thou mayest thyself apprehend the true meanings of these mysteries. Verily, He is the Confirmer, the Beneficent, the Merciful! </p>

The purpose of that cablegram is this: That each one of the beloved ones of God (believers in general who may wish to publish any writings or articles, etc.) should first send the same to the Holy Land, to be seen (or examined) and then printed. And this matter is general and this (message) was sent equally to America, Persia, India and Turkestan. I have the utmost love for thee and thy family for thou servest me—how can I be offended at you? Be assured and happy. Convey my greetings to thy sons and also to the maid-servant of God, thy wife. </p>

    <p id='625'>Thy letter was received. Praise be to God! It indicated thy firmness and steadfastness in the love of God—therefore, it was the cause of happiness.</p>
  
    <p id='626'>Thou hast written regarding the meeting of his honor Mr. ….…., his respected wife and daughter. Truly, I say, Mr. ….…. is a blessed soul and is engaged in the service of the Cause and his extreme hope is to bring about affinity between the souls and cause the believers to be united and agree. This is also my highest hope. I hope, God willing, this unity and agreement will be established and this imprisoned one, immersed in the sea of trials, become exhilarated and rejoiced. The aim of the appearance of the Blessed Perfection—may my life be a sacrifice for His beloved ones! —was the unity and agreement of all the people of the world. Therefore, my utmost desire, firstly, is the accord and union and love of the believers and after that of all the people of the world. Now, if unity and agreement is not established among the believers, <span data-pg='120' id='pg120'></span> I will become heartbroken and the afflictions will leave a greater imprint upon me. But if the fragrance of love and unity among the believers is wafted to my nostrils, every trial will become a mercy, every unhappiness a joy, every difficulty an expansion, every misery a treasure and every hardship a felicity.</p>
  
    <p id='627'>Convey on my behalf the utmost love and kindness to the favored maid-servant of God [thy wife], and thy worthy and noble sons. </p>

    <p id='657'>I have seen the letter which thou hast written to Mr. ….….. The opinion (expressed therein) was very agreeable. The Spiritual Meeting of Consultation of New York must be in the utmost union and harmony with the Spiritual Meeting of Consultation of Chicago, and that which they deem advisable to publish, these two Meetings of Consultation must unitedly approve of it and deem its publication advisable. Then the Meeting of Consultation must send one copy thereof to Acca, in order that it may be also approved of here and then returned, and that the it may be printed and published.</p>
  
    <p id='658'>That the two Spiritual Meetings of Chicago and New York must be in unity and harmony is very important, and when a Spiritual Meeting may be also organized in Washington in a befitting manner, these two meeting (of Chicago and New York) must be also in unity and harmony with that meeting.</p>
  
    <p id='659'>To be brief, it hath been decided by the Desire of <span data-pg='125' id='pg125'></span> God that union and harmony may day by day increase among the friends of God and maid-servants of the Merciful One, in the West. Not until this is realized will the affairs advance by any means whatever! And the greatest means for the union and harmony of all is Spiritual Meetings. This matter is very important and is as a magnet (to attract or) for divine confirmation. If the beauty of this Divine Beloved One—that is, unity of believers—does appear in the ornament of the Kingdom of ABHA, it is certain that those countries will, in a short time, become the Paradise of ABHA and the light of Unity (or Oneness) and Singleness will shine upon the whole world from the West. We <a data-fnid='72'></a> are endeavoring with all heart an soul, have no rest night and day, nor a moment of tranquility, so that we may make the world of humanity the mirror of the divine unity; how much more the beloved of God! And this wish and hope shall appear and shine forth at that time when the true friends of God may arise and act in accord with the teachings of the Beauty of ABHA—may my life be a sacrifice to His beloved ones! One of the teachings is that love and faithfulness must so prevail in the hearts that men may see the stranger as a friend, the sinner as an intimate fellow, may count enemies as allies, regard foes as loving comrades, call their executioner the giver of life, consider the denier as a believer and the unbeliever as a faithful one—that is, men must behave in such a manner as may befit the believers, the faithful, the friend and the confidant. If this lamp may shine in a befitting manner in the assemblage of the world you <span data-pg='126' id='pg126'></span> will find that the regions will become fragrant and the world become a delectable paradise, the surface of the earth will become an excellent garden, the world will become as one home, the different nations will become as one kind, and the peoples and nationalities of the East and West will become as one household. I hope such a day may come and such lights may dawn and such a Countenance may appear in the utmost beauty. </p>

    <p id='720'>O maid-servant of God!</p>
  
    <p id='721'>Thy letter was understood. Thou hast asked, very humbly, for certain things and all were worthy to be coveted. Thou desirest forgiveness of sins; didst ask for great unity and peace; sought nearness to the Threshold of God; hoped to be detached from thine own will, seeking the will of God; prayed for rescue from self-love (or selfishness); hoped for progress in <span data-pg='136' id='pg136'></span> the station of knowledge; desired to serve God; and prayed that thy honorable husband and thy children may be set aglow with the fire of the love of God and may manifest light on their brows through the radiance of the knowledge of God. All these wishes are well worthy of asking. Especially the rescue from self-love. This is a strange trait and means of the destruction of many important souls in the world. If man be imbued with all good qualities but be selfish, all the other virtues will fade or pass away and eventually he will grow worse.</p>
  
    <p id='722'>I hope the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful will be entirely freed from selfishness. Should this become their nature, they will indeed become manifestations of great bounties, and the doors of the divine grace will open.</p>

    <p id='790'>Convey longing greeting of great love from me to the members of the Meeting of Consultation: * * * Whenever I think of them I find soulful repose and conscious joy.</p>
  
    <p id='791'>The feast (supper) [every nineteen days] is very acceptable and will finally produce good results. The beloved and the maid-servants of the Merciful must inaugurate the feast in such wise as to resurrect the feast of the ancients—namely, the “lord’s supper.” The attracted maid-servant of God, Mrs. ….…., I hope will be inspired so she may become the means of unity among the friends in every city. That meeting for feast for which thou wert preparing and providing, should recur every so often, so that it may prove a means of attracting the confirmation of the Kingdom of ABHA.</p>
  
    <p id='792'>Inform the maid-servant of God, who prepared her home as a [temporary] Mashrak-el-Azcar, that this service was accepted in the Kingdom of ABHA.</p>
  
    <p id='793'>Inform the near (dear) maid-servant of God [thy wife], who hath organized a school of industry in order that children may learn an industry and chant communes, that this is very agreeable.</p>
  
    <p id='794'>O thou servant of God! To look after the sick is one of the greatest duties. Every soul who becomes sick, the other friends should certainly offer the life (of service) in the utmost kindness.</p>
  
    <p id='795'>Thou hast asked regarding the naming of children: When thou wishest to name a babe, prepare a meeting <span data-pg='150' id='pg150'></span> therefor; chant the verses and communes, and supplicate and implore the Threshold of Oneness and beg the attainment of guidance for the babe and wish confirmated firmness and constancy; then give the name and enjoy beverage and sweetmeat. This is spiritual baptism.</p>
  
    <p id='796'>His honor, Mr. ……, Mrs. …… and …… arrived. They were attracted by the fragrances of God and ignited by the fire of the love of God. With a new spirit and fresh life they returned.</p>
  
    <p id='797'>O son of the Kingdom! Thy services in the Kingdom of ABHA are evident, well known and accepted. Indeed thou art a truthful servant of the Holy Threshold and a firm caller to the divine Kingdom.</p>
  
    <p id='798'>Strive so that the odor of violation cease and all come under the protection of the Covenant.</p>
  
    <p id='799'>Remain in and about that town and know that trial is the cause of promotion. But thou must deal with all in the utmost love and do kindness. Although they lift up the head of pride, show thou greater humility and meekness and treat them with the utmost submission and lowliness.</p>

What can these ignorant creatures do? They might imprison the body, but the spirit they cannot; the spirit will ever soar in the atmosphere of eternal bliss and glory. Therefore, neither the prison is a cause of sorrow, nor freedom from it a source of joy.</p>

And as the heavenly abundance and the divine gifts and the omnipotent grace come in these days successively and uninterruptedly, therefore, thou shouldst establish a heavenly edifice to facilitate and level the way before the divine transaction, to carry out the divine order, to gladden the pure hearts of every one, to sanctify thyself from everything but God and to keep aloof from all the worldly things for the Cause of God; to be kindled with the fire of the love of God, to spread the fragrance of God and to expose thyself to the gentle breeze of God.</p>

    <p id='836'>I received thy letter and its contents caused the utmost joy and fragrance within me, because it showed thy firmness in the Cause of God and proved thy steadfastness in the love of the Word of God.

    <p id='837'>I beseech the Threshold of Unity with all humility and supplication to make thee confirmed in His service and to enable thee to be serviceable in the Holy Threshold; that thou mayest not be a moment at rest nor take a breath of composure; nay, rather to pass all thy life in this greatest gift and this supreme favor employed in diffusing the breath of God; that thy sincerity of heart, thy sanctity and purity may increase and that thou mayest become entirely separated from aught else save God. Except a man be purified and sanctified from the soil of his dependence on this world, the spiritual purity will not become manifest in him.

    <p id='838'>As to those things published in journals against thee: Thou shouldst not be grieved nor sorry therefor, because thousands of journals have written traducing Abdul-Baha, have given false and base accusations and awful calumnies. Notwithstanding these he was neither troubled nor grieved thereby; nay, rather these cause me to exert myself more than usual in the path of God and to drink the cup of sacrifice and to boil in the fire of His love. Man must seek to gain the acceptance of God and not that of the different classes of men. If one is praised and chosen by God, the accusation of all the creatures will cause no loss to him; and if the man is not accepted in the threshold of God, the praise and admiration of all men will be of no use to him.</p>
  
    <p id='839'>By all these it is meant that thou must not be sorry and grieved because of these things the papers have written against thee; nay, rather trust in God and be unmoved by either the praise or the false accusations declared by people towards thee, depend entirely on God and exert thyself to serve His holy vineyard. All else save this is but imagination, though it be the praises of all people in thy behalf; because all else is of no result and bears no fruit.</p>
  
    <p id='840'>As to thine action against the journal which hath libeled thee: It is not at all best to bring action against them, because there is no profit in doing that; nay, it will lead to more sayings of a similar nature. Under these circumstances silence is best. Thou must not be disappointed, sorry or grieved thereat; God will remove all these difficulties. If thou wilt employ thyself <span data-pg='159' id='pg159'></span> in the service (of the Cause of God) the past losses will be recovered and all the troubles will be settled.</p>

    <p id='930'>O beloved! Thank God that He chose thee for His love and elected thy wife for the calling of the appearance of the Kingdom of God. Verily, this is a great favor, and wert thou aware of the results which will follow it in the Kingdom of God, thou wouldst, verily, rejoice exceedingly and wouldst call with loud voice: <specmsg>“Blessed are we for this great favor, and glad-tidings be unto us for this glorious attainment.”</specmsg></p>
  
    <p id='931'>Consider the past, so that thou mayest become informed of the mysteries which shall be disclosed in the future. When the disciples were calling in the name of Christ, the Jews scoffed, scorned and laughed at them. They were saying, “They (i.e., the disciples) are taken with madness, and madness is made an art.” They even beat them with whips, threw stones at them, prevented the people from approaching them, and were saying, “This man (Christ) is naught but a sorcerer, blasphemeth God and is possess of a devil.”</p>
  
    <p id='932'>Then observe how that persecution and scorn were changed to glory, honor and reverence. Ultimately, they (the Jews) honored their sublime stations and acknowledged their loftiness, which was exalted, promoted and glorified in the center of the horizons until it reached the degree of exaggeration in deeds. They <span data-pg='176' id='pg176'></span> made for them likenesses and pictures, decorated with jewels shining in the eyes; they placed these likenesses or pictures in the temples, churches and monasteries built on the tops of the mountains, and worshipped them with respect, glory, majesty and reverence. This is the condition of the neglectful ones who are deprived of the Truth (the Manifestations of God) at the day of their existence among them. After the ascension of their (the prophets’) spirits unto the Center of Purity and Piety, then the negligent ones repent and return, making likenesses and pictures according to their own ideas, which do not bear resemblance, and worship the same. This is the station of the ignorant ones who are as animals, following every croaker and shaken by every wind. “Forsake them to play in their shallow waters.”</p>
  
    <p id='933'>As to thee: Be happy because of what thy Lord, the Clement, the Merciful, hath given thee; choosing thee and thy esteemed wife for entrance into His Kingdom, for calling in His name, praising Him in assemblies, gatherings and meetings.</p>
  
    <p id='934'>The truth I verily say unto thee, this divine grace cannot be exchanged for the sovereignty of the earth, the east or the west. For that (the worldly kingdom) is naught but dreams, torture to the spirit, trouble for the hearts; its mortality is certain and its destruction a well known fact—while this spiritual kingdom and divine grace will shine, and it is an ABHA (Glorious) jewel which will glisten on the diadems of great glory in the course of centuries and cycles. </p>

    <aside data-fnid='90'>A prayer for the forgiveness of souls who have departed from this world in ignorance of the Truth.</aside>
  
    <p id='945'>Although certain souls finished the days of life in ignorance, were estranged and selfish, yet the ocean of Thy forgiveness is, verily, able to redeem and make <span data-pg='179' id='pg179'></span> free the sinners by one of its waves. Thou redeemest whomsoever Thou willest and deprivest whomsoever Thou willest not <a data-fnid='91'></a> ! Shouldst Thou treat justly, we all are sinners and deserve to be deprived; and shouldst Thou observe mercy, every sinner shall be made pure and every stranger shall become a friend. Therefore, forgive and pardon and grant Thy mercy unto all. Thou art the Forgiver, the Light-giver and the Compassionate! </p>
    <aside data-fnid='91'>“Deprivest whomsoever Thou willest not,” refers to the reward and punishment of the souls according to its deeds. There are many instances of this in all the heavenly Scriptures.</aside>

    <p id='1020'>O thou who art advancing toward the Divine Kingdom!</p>
  
    <p id='1021'>What thou hast written was understood and noted. Thou hast asked concerning the station of this servant. The station of this servant is servitude to the Holy Threshold (BAHA’O’LLAH) and I glory and honor in this. Abdul-Baha is the standard of the divine love, the sign of the gift of God, the servant of the assemblage of the merciful ones, the light of the meeting of the spiritual ones. He is the orb of peace and reconciliation and the light of love in the world of humanity. He is the herald of the Kingdom of the Merciful One and the promulgator of the religion of rectitude and security. This is the station of this servant! This is the Truth!</p>
  
    <p id='1022'>I hope through the divine grace that the brilliancy of the love of God will pervade all regions, and that he will remove warfare and strife from the world of existence. Then the human world will become expressive of the unity of the merciful world, the inferior world will become a clear and purified mirror reflecting the Supreme Concourse, the East and West will embrace each other like unto two longing ones and the North and South will shake hands and clasp each other <span data-pg='192' id='pg192'></span> in the arms like unto two beloved ones. This is the station of Abdul-Baha.</p>
  
    <p id='1023'>As to the light thou dost witness: It is not an earthly light (phenomenal); nay, rather, it is a heavenly light. It cannot be seen by the sight; nay, rather, it is perceived by the insight.</p>
  
    <p id='1024'>As to the resurrection of the body of Christ three days subsequent to His departure: This signified the divine teachings and spiritual religion of His Holiness Christ, which constitute His spiritual body, which is living and perpetual forevermore.</p>
  
    <p id='1025'>By the “three days” of His death is meant that after the great martyrdom, the penetration of the divine teachings and the spread of the spiritual law became relaxed on account of the crucifixion of Christ. For the disciples were somewhat troubled by the violence of divine tests. But when they became firm, that divine spirit resurrected and that body—which signifies the divine word—arose.</p>
  
    <p id='1026'>Likewise the address of the angels to the people of Galilee, “That this Christ will return in the same way and that He will descend from heaven,” is a spiritual address. For when Christ appeared, He came from heaven, although He was outwardly born from the womb of Mary. For He said: “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven.”</p>
  
    <p id='1027'>He said: “I came down from heaven and likewise will go to heaven.” By “heaven” is not meant this infinite phenomenal space, but “heaven” signifies the world of the divine kingdom which is the supreme station and seat of the Sun of Truth.</p>
  
    <p id='1028'>To be brief: The mysteries of the Holy Books are <span data-pg='193' id='pg193'></span> many and require explanation and elucidation. I hope thine insight will be so opened that the divine mysteries may become manifest and clear. O thou candle of the love of God!</p>
  
    <p id='1029'>I read what thou hast written. Its meanings were spiritual and its contents merciful. It indicated (thy) pure intention and expressed clear brilliancy.</p>
  
    <p id='1030'>I beg of God that thou mayest become an associate and partner of Abdul-Baha in servitude to the Holy Threshold of Baha’, that thou mayest praise me in my pure servitude and summon all to the Most Great Guidance. </p>

    <p id='1033'>Know thou that the Messianic Spirit and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is always manifest, but capacity and ability (to receive it) is more in some and less in others. After the crucifixion the apostles had not in the beginning the capacity and ability of witnessing the Messianic reality. For they were agitated. But when they found firmness and steadfastness their inner sight became opened, and they saw the reality of the Messiah as manifest. For the body of Christ was crucified and vanished, but the Spirit of Christ is always pouring upon the contingent world, <span data-pg='194' id='pg194'></span> and is manifest before the insight of the people of assurance.</p>
  
    <p id='1034'>O thou seeker of the kingdom of God! If thou wishest thy speech and utterance to take effect in the hardened hearts, be thou severed from all attachment to this world and turn unto the Kingdom of God. Enkindle the fire of the love of God in the heart with such intensity that thou mayest become a flame of fire and a luminous lamp of guidance. At that time thy speech will take effect within the hearts, through the confirmation of the Holy Spirit. </p>

    <p id='1044'>The letter which thou hast written was perused and its contents were noted. Thou hast written concerning spiritual hearing and insight. The insight (or inner perception) is a correct sight, for it never blundereth. But the outward sight doth err (or misjudgeth); it seeth the mirage as water, considereth the revolving flame as a circle, imagineth the images reflected in a mirror as a reality and judgeth huge bodies as small ones, from a remote distance. There are many evidences as to the blundering of the sight; but the insight apprehendeth the reality and discovereth the mysteries.</p>
  
    <p id='1045'>As to the difference between inspiration and imagination: Inspiration is in conformity with the Divine Texts, but imaginations do not conform therewith. A real, spiritual connection between the True One and the servant is a luminous bounty which causeth an ecstatic (or divine) flame, passion and attraction. When this connection is secured (or realized) such an ecstasy and happiness become manifest in the heart that man doth fly away (with joy) and uttereth melody and song. Just as the soul bringeth the body in motion, so that spiritual bounty and real connection likewise moveth (or cheereth) the human soul. <span data-pg='196' id='pg196'></span> As to truthful dreams: I beg of God that thy inner eye (insight) may be so opened that thou mayest thyself differentiate between truthful and untruthful dreams.</p>

    <p id='1080'>Praise thou God, for that thou hast found the Light of Guidance, recognized the Lord of the Kingdom, art engaged in the service of the Divine Garden and hast guided a number of souls and led them to the Kingdom of Existence. When thou occupiest thyself with all thy strength in service, thou wilt become a magnet of attraction and cause every seeker to reach the presence of the Desired One; thou wilt raise a great clamor in the world and evince such an ecstasy and rapture that will astonish the minds.</p>
  
    <p id='1081'>Send my loving greeting to those souls whom thou hast guided unto the divine kingdom and say unto them: <specmsg>“Ye must appreciate Miss ……. Move your tongues in thanksgiving and be obliged for her great effort; for she gave you to drink the wine of guidance from the cup of the love of God and led you to the kingdom of lights. Were you to thank her for many years as a reward for this guidance, ye will not be able to repay your obligation for this gift.”</specmsg> <span data-pg='204' id='pg204'></span></p>
  
    <p id='1082'>Thou hast written concerning the Impersonality of the Divinity. Personality is in the Manifestation of the Divinity, not in the Essence of the Divinity. The reality of the divine world is purified and sanctified from limits and restriction. But the pure Mirror, which is the Manifestor of the Sun of Truth and in which the Sun of Truth is manifest in appearance—that mirror is restricted, not the lights. The soul pervadeth throughout the whole body, and its commands are effective in all the parts and limbs of man. Notwithstanding its utmost sanctification (or abstraction) this soul is manifest and evident in all its grades, in this material form. By seeing God is meant beholding the Manifestation of Himself; for witnessing the sun in its entire splendor, in a clear glassy surface, is identical with witnessing the essence of the sun itself.</p>
  
    <p id='1083'>When the souls of the sincere depart (from this body), then their unreal vision (i.e., seeing) is changed into a vision of reality. Even as man, when in the age of babyhood and imperfection, though he seeth things, yet that vision is superficial and external. But when he reacheth the world (or age) of perfection and becometh endowed with reasoning faculty and (the power of) discrimination and comprehension, then that vision of his is a vision (i.e., seeing) of reality <a data-fnid='98'></a> and not the unreality.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='98'>Insight.</aside>
  
    <p id='1084'>It is evident that the divine nearness is an unlimited nearness, be it in this world or the next one. This is a nearness which is sanctified from the comprehension of the minds. The more a man seeketh light from the Sun of Truth, the nearer he will draw. For <span data-pg='205' id='pg205'></span> instance, a clear body is near unto the sun, and a black stone is far from the sun. This nearness dependeth upon clearness, purity and perfection and that remoteness is due to density, dullness (or obscurity) and imperfection.</p>
  
    <p id='1085'>As to the question whether the souls will recognize each other in the spiritual world: This (fact) is certain; for the Kingdom is the world of vision (i.e., things are visible in it), where all the concealed realities will become disclosed. How much more the well-known souls will become manifest. The mysteries of which man is heedless in this earthly world, those will he discover in the heavenly world, and there will he be informed of the secret of truth; how much more will he recognize or discover persons with whom he hath been associated. Undoubtedly, the holy souls who find a pure eye and are favored with insight will, in the kingdom of lights, be acquainted with all mysteries, and will seek the bounty of witnessing the reality of every great soul. Even they will manifestly behold the Beauty of God in that world. Likewise will they find all the friends of God, both those of the former and recent times, present in the heavenly assemblage.</p>
  
    <p id='1086'>As to the difference and distinction between Lazarus and that “rich man”: The first was spiritual, while the second was material. One was in the highest degree of knowledge and the other in the lowest depths of ignorance. The difference and distinction will naturally become realized between all men after their departure from this mortal world. But this (distinction) is not in respect to place, but it is in respect to the soul and conscience. For the Kingdom of God is sanctified <span data-pg='206' id='pg206'></span> (or free) from time and place; it is another world and another universe. But the holy souls are promised the gift of intercession. And know thou for a certainty, that in the divine worlds, the spiritual beloved ones (believers) will recognize each other, and will seek union (with each other), but a spiritual union. Likewise, a love that one may have entertained for any one will not be forgotten in the world of the Kingdom. Likewise, thou wilt not forget (there) the life that thou hast had in the material world.</p>

But if the health and welfare of man be spent in sensual desires, in a life on the animal plane, and in devilish pursuits—then disease is better than such health; nay, death itself is preferable to such a life.

    <p id='1095'>That matter (or substance) which is the cause of the moderation and perfection of the body is that perfect moderate temperament which is produced by the organization and admixture of constituent elements; that matter (or substance) is material (or physical) not spiritual.

Therefore the animal is deprived of reason, and it (reason) is specialized to mankind. The animal feeleth realities which are perceptible to the senses, but man perceiveth intellectual realities (or things perceptible to reason). Consequently, it hath become evident that reason is a spiritual faculty, not physical (or material).</p>

But the capacity is necessary for the descent of rain, and preparation of soil is of great importance. The heavenly outpouring will develop from the pure ground roses and hyacinths. We also hope that such things will appear from them.</p>

Where is the throne of David, the Glorious? Where is his iron rod? Where are his innumerable hosts? Where are his attacking armies? Where are his angels of heaven? Where do we see justice of government existing among people and even among beasts and insects? Where is his great majesty? Where is his power, which shaketh heaven and earth? Is not this a claim of one who is bewildered and wandering amidst valleys and hills? Doth he not ride upon as ass, while on his head there is a crown of thorns and he is despised?”</p>

    <p id='1276'>I have read thy brilliant letter, which although short in words yet [is] loquacious, and shows thy firmness in the Covenant of God, thy steadfastness in the religion of God, thy adherence to the laws of God, and thine energy which thou hast shown towards the doctrines of God. Thou has done well. Thou has done well, O thou shining star in the Horizon of El-Abha! Well done! Well done! O thou burning candle in the glass of that remote country!</p>
  
    <p id='1277'>It hath been reported by ….. that thou hast rendered valuable services to the vineyard of God and His beloved servants, that thou art encouraging the shaking hearts and making them more firm and solid, and about the facilitations thou hast made for the promotion of the utterances of God amongst the people. By the Life of God! the angels of heaven magnify thee, the Supreme Concourse praise thee, the party of the Kingdom of El-Abha announce to thee the glad-tidings and the hosts of the unseen assist thee and render thee victorious through the banners of Baha.</p>

    <p id='1306'>In these times thanksgiving for the bounty of the Merciful One consists in the illumination of the heart and the feeling of the soul. This is the reality of thanksgiving. But, although offering thanks through speech or writings is approvable, yet, in comparison with that, it is but unreal, for the foundation is spiritual feelings and merciful sentiments. I hope that you may be favored therewith. But the lack of capacity and merit in the Day of Judgment does not prevent one from bounty and generosity, for it is the day of grace and not justice, and to give every one his due is justice. Consequently, do not look upon thy capacity, nay, rather, look upon the infinite grace of the Bounty of Abha who grace is comprehending and whose bounty is perfect.</p>
  
    <p id='1307'>I beg of God through the confirmation and assistance of the True One thou mayest show the utmost eloquence, fluency, ability and skill in teaching the real significances of the Bible. Turn toward the Kingdom of Abha and seek the bounty of the Holy Spirit. Loosen the tongue and the confirmation of the Spirit shall reach thee.</p>
  
    <p id='1308'>As to that great Sun which thou sawest in a dream: That is His Holiness the Promised One and the lights <span data-pg='244' id='pg244'></span> thereof are His bounties. The surface of the water is transparent body—that is, pure hearts. Its waves are the moving of the hearts, the cheering of the souls—that is, spiritual feelings and merciful sentiments. Thank thou God for that thou hast had such a revelation in the world of dreams.</p>
  
    <p id='1309'>As to the fact that man must entirely forget himself, by this is meant that he should arise in the mystery of sacrifice and that is the disappearance of mortal sentiments and extinction of blamable morals which constitute the temporal gloom, and not that the physical health should be changed into weakness and debility.</p>
  
    <p id='1310'>I humbly supplicate to the Threshold of Oneness that heavenly blessings and merciful forgiveness may overtake thy dear mother, sisters and loving relations, especially thy betrothed who suddenly departed from this world to the next one. </p>

    <p id='1459'>Verily I considered the contents of thy recent letter, thy beautiful writing and I observed thy heartfelt thanks. Verily my heart is filled with love and affection; overflowing with spiritual attractions.</p>
  
    <p id='1460'>Verily I know that the Tablets (Book) of Abdul-Baha and his address is a hidden mystery and concealed fact. No one is informed of its greatness and importance at these times, but in the course of time and future centuries the signs thereof will be manifested, the lights thereof will dawn forth, the fragrances thereof will be diffused and the greatness, the importance thereof will be known. The truth I say unto thee, that each leaflet from Abdul-Baha will be a wide-spread book, nay, rather, a glistening gem on the Glorious Crown. Know tho its value and hold great its station.</p>
  
    <p id='1461'>Then praise God for that He chose thee to love Him and elected thee to spread His fragrances. He selected thee from among the women of the world, so that thou become a flame to the fire of His love, a sign of the Kingdom of His Grace and a summoner to His Name, <span data-pg='268' id='pg268'></span> in humbleness and meekness, invocation and supplication to God.</p>
  
    <p id='1462'>Verily I ask God to protect thee from the waves of tests and storms of trial until thou becomest firm in the Cause of thy Lord—a firmness whereby thou be enabled to withstand all nations and peoples. When thou art thus confirmed by God, with firmness and solidity in His Covenant among the people, thou wilt see the hosts of the Kingdom shelter thee from all sides with banners whereunto all heads bow.</p>
  
    <p id='1463'>O maid-servant of God! It is incumbent upon thee to be firm! It is incumbent upon thee to be steadfast! It is incumbent upon thee to be steadfast! It is incumbent upon thee to be steadfast in the Cause of the Light which hath shone forth unto the world with great brilliancy!</p>
  
    <p id='1464'>O maid-servant of God! Verily, Mary, the Magdalene, was a villager, but she kept firm in the Cause of Christ and confirmed the apostles at the time she declared to them (thus): “Verily, Christ is alive and eternal and death did not overtake Him; and verily, the foundation of His religion is not shaken by His crucifixion at the hand of the oppressors!” By this her face is eternally shining from the horizon of guidance.</p>
  
    <p id='1465'>O maid-servant of God! The circumstances will be severe for every thankful servant (i.e., believer in the Teachings) in those boundaries and countries. The people shall arise against you with the most bitter hatred, opposition and envy. Swords of persecution and curses shall be thrown at you by all the nations. The wind of tests and trials shall fiercely blow and thereby the weak trees, which are not firmly rooted in <span data-pg='269' id='pg269'></span> this wonderful vineyard, shall be uprooted. But the trees which are strong, thriving and green will be strengthened, their branches extended, their leaves opened, their appearance beautified and their blossoms and fruits increased. I ask God to make thee one of those firmly rooted trees and an extended branch in this most great vineyard, and to make thy heart like unto a cup overflowing with His love in every assemblage. Verily He is the Powerful, the Generous!</p>
  
    <p id='1466'>Supplicate to God to guide Mrs. ….…., so that she may become thy partner and partaker of this great bounty, and to confirm the family of Mr. ….…., so that they may be blest with blessings and successive aids and with the appearance of the manifest signs. Thus all ye may become spreaders of the banner of union, love, harmony and peace upon plains and deserts, hills and mountains. </p>

    <p id='1541'>O maid-servant of God! By God the True One, verily Abdul-Baha invokes God to strengthen thee through the mightiest power, so that thou mayest become a star of guidance in Green Acre, to diffuse the fragrances of God, to blow forth the spirit of God, to summon people to the Word of god, and may speeches pour forth from thy pure lips as a torrent which rapidly pours down from the loftiest mountains! </p>

    <p id='1542'>O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of the Garden of the Covenant and art speaking the praise of the Orb of the Universe!</p>
  
    <p id='1543'>Know thou, verily, I read thy letter which expressed the commemoration of thy Lord, the Great, and indicated that the fire of the love of God is ablaze in thy heart and in the soul of the sincere ones. Truly I say unto thee, verily thy magnificent letter was as one of the melodies of the birds of holiness in the wonderful garden. Verily the hearts of the Supreme Concourse are dilated with the songs which thou hast warbled on the Blessed Tree in the Exalted Paradise.</p>
  
    <p id='1544'>O maid-servant of God! Verily Abdul-Baha was with you in Green Acre in his spirit, soul and in all <span data-pg='284' id='pg284'></span> of his spiritual grades, and he was your companion in your meetings and was bearing unto you, with his spiritual tongue, the glad-tidings of the divine splendors which shall be poured forth upon you from the Kingdom of God, in a short time.</p>
  
    <p id='1545'>O maid-servant of God! Be rejoiced at this glad-tidings whereby the hearts of the people of the Kingdom of El-Abha are moved with joy. Verily I beseech God to make Green Acre as the paradise of El-Abha, so that the melodies of the nightingale of sanctity may be heard from it and that the chanting of the verses of unity may be raised therein; to cause the clouds of the great gift to pour upon it the rains falling from heaven; to make those countries become verdant with the myrtles of truth and inner significances and to plant therein blessed trees, with the hand of Providence, which may bring forth pure and excellent fruits wherefrom the fragrances of God may be diffused throughout all regions. These signs shall surely appear and these lights shall shine forth.</p>
  
    <p id='1546'>O maid-servant of God, the Merciful! It is incumbent upon you to unveil the covering and to witness the Beauty of the Almighty! Ye shall surely see the lights rising in those parts, as ye have already seen them. Ye shall surely behold a Pillar of Fire extending upward to the Supreme Apex and it will call unto you with the most wonderful expression and will address you, saying:</p>
  
    <p id='1547'>“I am the Ancient Light! I am the Lord of the Exalted Kingdom! I am the Star shining forth unto the horizon of the hearts of the people of Oneness!”</p>
  
    <p id='1548'>O maid-servant of God! Be tranquil in heart and be enkindled with the fire ignited in the Blessed Tree—an <span data-pg='285' id='pg285'></span> enkindlement which may cause a fire to blaze in the inanimate hearts in those regions.</p>
  
    <p id='1549'>O maid-servant of God! Be not disheartened if thou hearest the murmuring of the deniers, the clamor of the hypocrites, the shouting of the contradictors, the barking of the furious, harmful dogs, in those climes. Remember the persecutions which consecutively befell the disciples of christ from the perverse Jews. Consequently, withstand their oppositions with all quiescence and dignity (patience) and their contradictions with all cheerfulness, gladness and dilation of heart (i.e., exaltation) by day and night. Resist their fighting with peace and reconciliation, their blows with kindness and perfection and their blame with joy and tranquility. Do beseech God to direct them to the Path of Salvation and breathe into them the Spirit of Life. Be thou a light to every darkness, a dispeller of every sadness, a healer for every sick person, a quencher for every thirst, a shelter for every refugee, a refuge for every captive. If the Pharisees interfere with thee, it is incumbent upon thee to implore God to guide them to the road of salvation! And it is incumbent upon thee to be affable to them under all circumstances, to be patient in afflictions, to be courteous with the enemies and to pray for the hateful sinners! This is the nature of the faithful and convinced women believers whose hearts are dilated with the fragrances of God and who instruct (people) in the teachings of God!</p>
  
    <p id='1550'>O maid-servant of God! Trust in the grace of thy Lord. He shall surely assist thee with a confirmation whereat minds will be amazed and the thoughts of the men of learning will be astonished. Consider the divine <span data-pg='286' id='pg286'></span> splendors in Green Acre: One of them is the tree of fire and another is what was witnessed by thy friend—a light shining forth unto all sides. This is through the grace of thy Lord unto thee! Consequently, be engaged in perusing St. John’s Revelation; all these signs are spoken of in that vision. Thou shalt soon behold (things) still greater than this.</p>
  
    <p id='1551'>O maid-servant of God! It is incumbent upon thee to diffuse the fragrances of God and to be occupied in delivering (teaching) the Cause of God! Deliver my greeting to ….…. and say unto them: “Trust ye in the grace of your Lord and thank your Master, for He hath directed you to the Path of the Kingdom of God. Verily He is the Assister, the Beneficent!”</p>
  
    <p id='1552'>The coming of any one to these countries is, at this time, difficult and unallowable. I beg of God to facilitate it and then we will permit ….…. to come. I beg of God to manifest His lights in the heart of ….…. so that he may apprehend that which he never before apprehended and behold the mysteries of the Kingdom with real certainty in this glorious age.</p>
  
    <p id='1553'>God willing, next year some of the teachers (of the Truth) will present themselves at Green Acre and will cause the voices of the people of the Kingdom to reach the Supreme Apex. </p>

This is the station of (or for) every maid-servant whose heart is filled with the love of God and attracted to the Beauty of El-Abha.</p>

Peace be unto thee!” His white vestment is the garment of the Manifestation and [His] brilliant color. Regarding the gems which appeared on His breast, they are peerless pearls of wisdom which shine unto the horizons with a godlike fame. As to His shining face, verily it hath illumined the earth and dispersed the darkness from the contingent world. Regarding thine entrance with thy friend into the gallery lighted with lamps, know thou that gallery is the world of humanity and the lamps His wonderful teaching, His all-wisdom, His perfect bounty and His clear manifestation. He is the Absent-Present in the world of humanity.</p>
  
    <p id='1558'>O maid-servant of God! It is incumbent upon thee to diffuse the fragrances, it is incumbent upon thee to <span data-pg='288' id='pg288'></span> promulgate the teachings of God and it is incumbent upon thee to breathe the spirit of life into the hearts of the people of those regions, so that thou be a lamp of guidance in the recess of Green Acre. Take the cup of the love of God in thy right hand and with thy left hand hoist the banner of universal peace, love and affection among the nations of the earth. Call out (saying): “Hasten! Hasten unto the Great Bounty! Press! Press forward unto the Abundant Mercy! Speed! Speed unto the Manifest Light! Be urgent! Be urgent for the Great Attainment! Verily, by God the Truth, the doors of the Kingdom are opened, the lights of God have shown forth and illumined the horizon of the earth! The Lord of Hosts hath descended with the army of lights and angels of heaven and depressed the armies of darkness! He sent His angels to all directions, with a call of the trumpet of realities and meanings, instructions and teachings! Therefore, O people of the earth, appreciate the opportunity, in this new century, wherein the lights have been revealed by the Glorious Lord!”</p>
  
    <p id='1559'>In regard to the school which tho didst think of and its organization: I ask God that thou shouldst become confirmed in it with all order and command. But now it is necessary first to organize the Cause of God in those countries; then, order and preparation.

    <p id='1560'>O thou who art attracted to the Fragrances of God!</p>
  
    <p id='1561'>Verily I read thy excellent letter and was dilated through its excellent contents. Know thou that the distance of habitation doth not prevent the rising of the lights, and that time and place only control the bodies and not the spirits which are free from the contingent beings, not (do they control) the realities which are sanctified from the stains of the world. When the Spirit is breathed in the East, its signs immediately appear in the West and it hath a spiritual dominion which penetrates the pillars of the world.</p>
  
    <p id='1562'>Then know thou that God hath not ordained any greater happiness and joy than the removing of the veils by witnessing the Kingdom of God and presenting oneself in an assembly which is radiant with merciful emotions which cannot be apprehended by minds and thoughts.</p>
  
    <p id='1563'>O maid-servant of God! Verily opposition will wax fierce upon thee and denial and unbelief will day by day increase. People will arise to oppression and people will torment thee for thou hast believed in God, art attracted to the fragrances of God and hath spoken His praise among the maid-servants. They will execrate, revile, curse and oppress thee with acute tongues. Be not distressed at this; nay, rather continue with an increased firmness and stanchness in the Cause of God. For through calamity the heart of Abdul-Baha is attracted; through (suffering) oppression the breast of Abdul-Baha is dilated; through enduring afflictions the faithfulness of Abdul-Baha is proven; through imprisonment the soul of Abdul-Baha is <span data-pg='290' id='pg290'></span> cheered; at every moment he wishes to quaff the cup of sacrifice in the path of God.</p>
  
    <p id='1564'>O maid-servant of God! Opposition shall surely pass away, the dark clouds in all regions will be dispelled and the lights of the Covenant shall shine forth. At that time your value shall appear among the nations of the world and tribes and people will arise to praise you. Take warning by the former cycles and the bygone Manifestations.</p>
  
    <p id='1565'>O maid-servant of God! Verily the Cause is great and great! Regiments and regiments enter therein! Some people must necessarily turn their backs upon it, on account of their lack of sincerity in the Cause of God and for their selfishness and egotism.</p>
  
    <p id='1566'>O maid-servant of God! A pure sea doth not accept a dead body, therefore the waves will necessarily throw the dead finally upon the shores.</p>
  
    <p id='1567'>O maid-servant of God! When some souls turn away from the love of God, there is no harm therein. Did not Judas Iscariot, the chief of the apostles, turn away on account of jealousy for Peter the apostle? Likewise, some people must necessarily turn away on account of jealousy for others.</p>
  
    <p id='1568'>As to thee: Consider the predecessors as a warning to posterity and purify thy heart from all else save God, under all circumstances. When thou was in Acca we pointed this out to thee.</p>
  
    <p id='1569'>O maid-servant of God! Whenever sorrows and afflictions grow violent toward thee, remember that which we told thee during thy presence in these lands; then thy sorrows shall be removed and thy heart shall <span data-pg='291' id='pg291'></span> become dilated through the fragrances of God in these days.</p>
  
    <p id='1570'>Be thou rejoiced at the glad-tidings of God! Be as a globe of fire from which the heat of the love of God will be diffused. Sanctify thyself from the grades of this world, be purified from the superstitions of people and be characterized with spiritual qualities. Be thou a mountain of quiescence, a sign of meekness, a sea of patience, a light of love, a standard of utter separation (from all else save God), so that thou mayest become everlasting in the Kingdom of God.</p>
  
    <p id='1571'>The light shall surely encompass the maid-servants who are attracted by the fragrances of God and it will shine forth from their faces upon all regions.</p>
  
    <p id='1572'>O maid-servant of God! Let thy joy and happiness be increased every moment through the light of God.</p>

    <p id='1577'>What thou hast said (in thy letter) concerning the servant of Baha’, the “Mother of the Faithful,” is but true. Verily she is purified in soul, enkindled by the fire of the love of God, hath sincerely turned unto her Master, hath completely faced toward the Kingdom of God and hath arisen to diffuse His fragrances in all parts and serve His friends with a sincerity and joy unto which the Supreme Concourse beareth witness. She shall surely have a firm and steady footing in the Cause of God, her face shall shine forth from the Horizon of Loftiness, her fame shall be spread in the Kingdom of God, and [she] shall have a ringing voice throughout regions, and the lights of her glorious deeds shall beam forth during cycles and ages.</p>

    <p id='1581'>As to the son of the “Mother of the Faithful”: I beg of God to make his ears attentive, his eyes observing, his heart abounding with the lights of guidance and to make his soul as one of the signs of his Mighty Lord. Pray ye in his behalf night and day that God may strengthen him in a matter which may shine, beam and glow in the niche of the Kingdom of God and that He may cause him to arise and assist the pious ones, to seek bounty from the signs, to gain illumination from the lights, deliver the necks of all men from the chains of superstition, to feed the needy ones upon the food of the Kingdom of God and support the weak ones with a penetrative power from the Word of God.

Consider that the last year’s springtime is past and all that thou mayest say or hear (about it) is but a story (or narrative); but appreciate thou this New Year’s Spring—which is this present time—hath pitched its tent with the utmost magnificence in the field and plain and hath made the mountain and desert verdant and fresh, hath made the trees to appear pure and fresh, blooming with flowers and blossoms through the vernal bounty and caused them to bring forth pure fruits.

Among such ideas those which owe their source to the Light of Truth will be realized in the outward world; while others of a different origin vanish, come and go like waves on the sea of imagination and find no realization in the world of existence.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='129'>The following Tablet as received bore no opening line of address.</aside>
  
    <p id='1616'>“Similarly, numerous, various meetings and assemblages have been organized during the past ages and bygone centuries. All these produced no result except those assemblages which rendered unmixed service to the Light of Truth; from such assemblages alone great results were realized in the world of existence.</p>
  
    <p id='1617'>“For instance, consider how many a thousand assemblages—religious, political and literary—have been organized in India, Persia, Turkestan, Chinese countries and, in a word, in every part of Asia. All these gave no result except that assemblage of the disciples of Christ on the mount fifty days after Christ’s ascension. all that hath since been effected along the line of diffusing the holy fragrances of Christ, uplifting the Word of God, spreading the Gospel, training souls and guiding the people, hath been wholly from the result of the effects produced by that assemblage of the disciples. Those effects are continual even in the present time.</p>
  
    <p id='1618'>“Consequently, if one looks for praiseworthy results and wishes to produce eternal effects, let him make exceeding effort, in order that Green Acre may become <span data-pg='302' id='pg302'></span> an assemblage for the Word of God and a gathering place for the spiritual ones of the heavenly world.</p>
  
    <p id='1619'>“The moldered, two-thousand-years-old superstitions of the heedless, ignorant peoples, whether of Asia or Europe, should not be spread in that revered gathering place; for, if such be the case, let it be known for certain that that assemblage will yield no result and will, before long, be forgotten and consigned to oblivion, similar to other meetings of bygone times.</p>
  
    <p id='1620'>“I beg of God that that esteemed maid-servant of God shall be the cause of spreading the Cause of God, so that the Light of Truth may shine and the world be illumined.</p>
  
    <p id='1621'>“When you reflect attentively, you will find that the Word is what we have hereby said and that all else save this is pure imagination, is of no stability and is evanescent.</p>
  
    <p id='1622'>“The tree must have roots in order to yield fruit. The trees of the forest of Asia have yielded no fruit for thousands of years, except the blessed Trees of the Divine Manifestations, for each one of these Trees hath so developed and flourished that it hath trained and nourished the whole earth with fruits and yields.” </p>

In my previous letter to thee it was my intention to point out to thee that in the way of exalting the Word of God there are tests and trials, and in His love there are at all times calamities and afflictions and sufferings.

    <p id='1700'>We are all poor at His Door, weak before His Power, lowly at His Threshold, and we possess the power <span data-pg='315' id='pg315'></span> of neither good nor harm. He is indeed the Confirmer, the Strengthener, the Benevolent!</p>
  
    <p id='1701'>Truly hath He opened before our faces the doors of the Kingdom, granted us the treasures of His mysteries through the divine bounty and He hath chosen us for His love, for attainment unto His lights, the study of His teachings, the spreading of His name, the guidance unto His path and service in His great vineyard. I pray for confirmation in thy behalf and thou shouldst pray for strength on my part. Thy prayers for me should be that I may attain martyrdom in His path, that my spirit may be His sacrifice, and that my blood may be shed for His love.</p>
  
    <p id='1702'>O maid-servant of God! verily, I long for that cup, which is overflowing with the bounty of God, as a patient desiring to be healed, as a thirsty soul seeking water, as the poor in quest of wealth, and as one in separation yearning after the meeting of the beloved one night and day. </p>

    <p id='1706'>O thou who dost believe in the Spirit of Christ, in the Kingdom of God!</p>
  
    <p id='1707'>The body is composed, in truth, of corporeal elements and every composition is necessarily subject to decomposition; but the spirit is an essence, simple, pure, spiritual, eternal, perpetual and divine. He who seeketh Christ from the point of view of His body hath, in truth, debased Him and hath gone astray from Him; but he who seeketh Christ from the point of view of His Spirit will grow from day to day in joy, attraction, zeal, proximity, perception and vision.</p>
  
    <p id='1708'>Thou hast then to seek the Spirit of Christ in this marvelous day. The heaven whither Christ ascended is not an infinite space. His heaven is much rather the kingdom of His Lord, the Munificent. As He said, “The Son of Man is in heaven.” It is known then that His heaven is beyond the boundaries that surround existence and that He is elevated for the people who adore.</p>
  
    <p id='1709'>Pray God to ascend to this heaven, to taste of its food—and know thou that the people have not understood to this day the mystery of the Holy Scriptures. They believe that Christ was deprived of His heaven when He was in this world, that He had fallen from the heights of His elevation and that later He ascended to this elevated pinnacle—that is to say, towards the heaven <span data-pg='317' id='pg317'></span> which doth not exist, for there is only space. They expect that He will descend from this heaven seated upon a cloud. They believe that there is in the heavens a cloud upon which He will be seated and by which He will descend; while, in reality, the clouds are vapors which rise from the earth and which do not descend from the heavens. The cloud mentioned in the Holy Scriptures is the human body, because it is a veil for them, like a cloud, which prevents them from seeing the Sun of Truth which is shining in the horizon of Christ.</p>
  
    <p id='1710'>I pray God to open before your face the gates of revelation and of vision in such a way that thou shalt learn the mysteries of God in this known day.*** </p>

    <p id='1716'>Thy letter is received and perused. It afforded us joy and pleasure, gave us good news and is the token of the wealth of thy love. This period of time is the Promised Age, the assembling of the human race to the “Resurrection Day” and now is the great “Day of Judgment.” Soon the whole world, as in springtime, will change its garb. The turning and falling of the autumn leaves is past; the bleakness of the winter time is over. The new year hath appeared and the spiritual springtime is at hand. The black earth is becoming a <span data-pg='319' id='pg319'></span> verdant garden; the deserts and mountains are teeming with red flowers; from the borders of the wilderness the tall grasses are standing like advance guards before the cypress and jessamine trees; while the birds are singing among the rose branches like the angels in the highest heavens, announcing the glad-tidings of the approach of that spiritual spring, and the sweet music of their voices is causing the real essence of all things to move and quiver.</p>
  
    <p id='1717'>O my spiritual friend! Dost thou know from what airs emanate the notes sung by those birds? They are from the melodies of peace and reconciliation, of love and unity, of justice and security, of concord and harmony. In a short time this heavenly singing will intoxicate all humanity; the foundations of enmity shall be destroyed; unity and affection shall be witnessed in every assembly; and the lovers of the love of God at these great festivals shall behold their splendor.</p>
  
    <p id='1718'>Therefore, contemplate what a spirit of life God hath given that the the body of the whole earth may attain life everlasting! The Paradise of El-Abha will soon spread a pavilion from the pole-star of the world, under whose shelter the beloved shall rejoice and the pure hearts shall repose in peace. </p>

    <p id='1728'>What thou has written me hath been seen. Indeed thou belongest to the Kingdom and thou turnest towards the Horizon of Abha. I ask from the bounty of God that thou mayest be enflamed day by day more and more by the fire of the love of God.</p>
  
    <p id='1729'>It seems that thou wast uncertain whether to occupy thyself in writing or in delivering the tidings of the Cause of God. In these days, to deliver the glad-tidings is the best of all. Open then thy tongue to the guidance of the human race on any occasion that presents itself.</p>
  
    <p id='1730'>Thou hast asked about knowledge and cognition. Read the divine books and tablets and look into he books of proofs that have been written in presenting <span data-pg='322' id='pg322'></span> this Cause. One of them is the Book of Ighan <a data-fnid='135'></a> , which is translated into English. There is also the book <a data-fnid='136'></a> by Mirza Abul Fazl and there are others written by the believers. In the time to come, many divine books and tablets will be translated and thou wilt read them; but thou mayest ask God that thou mayest attract divine knowledge by the magnet of the love of God. When the soul becomes sanctified in every condition and becomes pure and holy, then the door of the divine knowledge will be opened to the face.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='135'>During the time of Baha’o’llah’s residence in Baghdad (the Dwelling of Peace), men of learning, including Jews, Christians and Mohammedans, visited Him seeking answer to religious and scriptural questions. Such answer He gave in the Book of Ighan, otherwise known as the Book of Explanations and Assurance. It concerns the Reality and Authority of the human “Divine Manifestations.”</aside>
    <aside data-fnid='136'>“The Bahai Proofs.”</aside>
  
    <p id='1731'>Thou hast written about the dear maid-servant of God, Mrs. ….…. That one attracted unto God is indeed always occupied in the service and she doth her utmost to spread the divine lights; if she continueth in the same way there will be great results in the future. That which is of the greatest importance is to have firmness, steadfastness and constancy.</p>
  
    <p id='1732'>I pray God that through the desires and the efforts of the maid-servants of the Merciful the foot of the mountains by the ocean’s shore <a data-fnid='137'></a> will be enlightened by the brilliancy of the love of God in such a way that its light may be transmitted all over the world.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='137'>Refers to California and the Pacific coast.</aside>
  
    <p id='1733'>You ask if, through the appearance of the Kingdom of God, every soul hath been saved. The Sun of Reality hath appeared to the all the world. This Luminous Appearance is salvation and life; but only he who hath opened the eye of reality and who hath seen these lights will be saved. <span data-pg='323' id='pg323'></span></p>
  
    <p id='1734'>You also ask about the eventual victory of spirituality in the Bahai age. It is certain that spirituality will overcome materiality and that the divine will have the victory over the human; it is also true that by divine education souls in every condition of existence will be elevated, except those that are blind, deaf, dumb and dead. How can such souls comprehend the light? The sun lighteth up all the dark world, but the blind man hath no portion in its brilliancy; the cloud of mercy poureth forth streams of water, but the sterile land will never produce plants and flowers.</p>

She must not rest until she makes him her spiritual as well as physical partner in life. But the Bahai engagement is the perfect communication and the entire consent of both parties. However, they must show forth the utmost attention and become informed of one another’s character and the firm covenant made between each other must become an eternal binding, and their intentions must be everlasting affinity, friendship, unity and life. The bridegroom must, before the bridesman and a few others, say: “Verily, we are content with the will of God”.

According to that membership, they became veiled from that brilliant Beauty. Therefore, turn thou thy face to the Church of God which consists in divine instructions and merciful exhortations.

    <p id='1758'>Endeavor that thou mayest enter in this Church of God. Although thou hast given oath to attend the church, yet thy spirit is under the Covenant and Testament of the Spiritual Divine Church. Thou shouldst protect this. Although they consider the wine and the bread in the church as the blood and body of Christ, yet this is but the appearance and not the reality.

    <p id='1816'>O thou honored friend!</p>
  
    <p id='1817'>Verily the sight of Providence is far reaching and the divine glance is perfect. Thou hast always been a recipient of favors and the object of the bounty of the glorious Beauty of Abha. I trust in God that thou mayest be thus aided by Him to serve His Cause and so shine as a luminous star in the horizon of His Kingdom, an illumining candle burning in the assemblage of the Bahais; that thou mayest be confirmed by a power of the Kingdom and attain divine bounty and providence.</p>
  
    <p id='1818'>As to the question of women being chosen rather <span data-pg='336' id='pg336'></span> than men: In this cycle there were men who arose through a divine power and who shone forth as the sun from the dawning-point of holiness; and, likewise, there appeared certain women who became side by side with men. The expression which you quote, “Every woman who is directed to the guidance of God in this great age, will surpass men in every respect,” signified that, in this age, certain women will appear who will surpass some men. It does not mean that they will surpass all the men who have given their lives as sacrifices in this Cause; for in this wonderful cycle there appeared such men as his holiness Khudoos, his holiness Bab-el-Bab, his holiness the “King of Martyrs” and his holiness the “Beloved of Martyrs,” his holiness the great Vaheed <a data-fnid='142'></a> , and such ones who have no equals in the world of existence.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='142'>All martyred in Persia. Khudoos, in the city of Barfurush; Bab-el-Bab, in Tabarsi; King of Martyrs and Beloved of Martyrs, both in Ispahan; Vaheed, in Nariz.</aside>
  
    <p id='1819'>If, in the letters to the maid-servants of the Merciful, there hath been written in the sense of encouragement (that form which such meanings can be inferred), the purport is that some women in the wonderful age have surpassed some men, and not that all women have surpassed all men. The members of the House of Spirituality must give unlimited encouragement to women. In this age, both men and women are in the shadow of the Word of God. Whosoever endeavors the most will attain the greatest share, be it of men or of women, of the strong or of the weak.</p>
  
    <p id='1820'>As to the matter of teaching and the choosing of men, the letters which I have written to the Spiritual Meeting (House of Spirituality) of which you are a <span data-pg='337' id='pg337'></span> member, will answer this question and will manifest the station of men who remain firm in the Covenant of God. Refer to them.</p>
  
    <p id='1821'>As to the number of Tablets to women, this is due to the fact that most of the letters which come to the Holy Land are from women. Rarely do letters come from men and, naturally, to women the most are written. Men are enjoined more than women to give the Message of the Cause of God and to diffuse His fragrances.</p>
  
    <p id='1822'>My dear friend! If thou didst know how dear thou art to Abdul-Baha, thou wouldst spread wings, and through excess of joy, soar and begin teaching all that country.</p>
  
    <p id='1823'>As to the question: “Whither shall we turn in our prayers?” There is an appointed center toward which one must direct himself in prayer, but at present this center is not unfolded because of wisdom. In its time this shall be announced. At present, in those regions, you should direct yourself, as formerly, to the East. The appointed and certain center will be announced in its time.</p>
  
    <p id='1824'>You also ask: “To whom shall we turn?” Turn to the Ancient Beauty. If it be the will of God, the blessed likeness (of the Manifestation) will be sent in its proper time, so that, in the world of the heart, thou mayest direct thyself to that holy likeness and thus be saved from imagination and phantasy. However, in the Temple (Mashrak-el-Azcar) the blessed picture must never be placed (or hung) on the wall. This you should know.</p>
  
    <p id='1825'>As to the subject of babes and infants and weak ones <span data-pg='338' id='pg338'></span> who are afflicted by the hands of oppressors: This contains great wisdom and this subject is of paramount importance. In brief, for those souls there is a recompense in another world and many details are connected with this matter. For those souls that suffering is the greatest mercy of God. Verily that mercy of the Lord is far better and preferable to all the comfort of this world and the growth and development of this place of mortality. If it be the will of God, when thou shalt be present this will be explained in detail by word of mouth. </p>

Then thou didst receive permission to return so that thou mayest serve the Kingdom on the continent of America and show (to the people) the way to heaven and lead them toward the Lord of Hosts. I hope that, with a divine strength and a godlike personality, with a heavenly guidance, with a divine attraction and with a spiritual zeal, thou wilt educate the people.</p>
  
    <p id='1844'>O thou, the firm one in the Covenant! Give my respectful greeting to thy honored wife and say to her from me: “The Jewish people were expecting the manifestation of Jesus and were at the same time attracted to Moses. When His Holiness Christ appeared, they (the Jewish people) thought that holy personality intended to take away the eternal honor of Moses. Moses, in the eye of Israel, had no equal. Now, these had never thought that a greater than him (Moses) would appear. So this way of thinking became the cause of their being kept away from the Light of Christ and they were prevented from the precious things of the Holy Spirit, notwithstanding the fact that the greatest friend of Moses was Christ and He made His Holiness Moses great in the eye of the world and made Him to be glorious in the contingent world; whereas, even now, Israel (that is, the Jews) deny His Holiness, the promised Christ, and count Him to be <span data-pg='342' id='pg342'></span> an enemy of His Holiness Moses and of Aaron and David; and they were kept away from the bounties of Christ. They think that no other great person like Moses could ever come upon the earth and if such a person should be sent (by God), he must come under the shadow of His Holiness Moses and promulgate the law of the Torah. This negligence on the part of the Jews became the cause of keeping away a multitude from the heavenly bounties and from the beneficence of the Holy Spirit for nineteen-hundred years.</p>
  
    <p id='1845'>“The Sun is ever the same, but the place whence the Sun hath appeared hath changed. Then, at Christ’s time, it appeared in the sign of Aquarius, but not it hath manifested itself from the sign of Cancer. These signs are just for an illustration. The sun is the same sun, no matter from what sign it may manifest itself or from what spot it may arise. Thou must look at the Sun; do not become veiled by the places from which the Sun appears.”</p>
  
    <p id='1846'>O Mr. ….….! Likewise instruct and give my love to thy dear son and say: “O dear one of Abdul-Baha! Be the son of thy father and be the fruit of that tree. Be a son that hath been born of his soul and heart and not only of the water and clay. A real son is such an one as hath branches from the spiritual part of a man. I ask God that thou mayest be at all times confirmed and strengthened.”</p>
  
    <p id='1847'>O thou servant of Baha’! Thou hast asked regarding the political affairs. In the United States it is necessary that the citizens shall take part in elections. This is a necessary matter and no excuse from it is possible. My object in telling the believers that they should not <span data-pg='343' id='pg343'></span> interfere in the affairs of government is this: That they should not make any trouble and that they should not move against the opinion of the government, but obedience to the laws and the administration of the commonwealth is necessary.

    <p id='1855'>The letter, which thou hast written to his honor Mirza ….…., was considered.</p>
  
    <p id='1856'>Be thou happy! Be thou happy! that thou hast put aside rest and composure; that thou hast traveled through and visited different states and endured innumerable inconveniences so that thou might diffuse the fragrances of mysteries and perfume the nostrils of the spiritual ones. When thou wert engaged in the service of the Cause, thou wert my partner in all trials and difficulties. Thou hast been my associate and companion and both of us were intoxicated and exhilarated with the wine of the love of god.</p>
  
    <p id='1857'>Praise be to God that thou hast been confirmed in the service and I have likewise been assisted in visiting the Holy Threshold. In one day <a data-fnid='143'></a> the world hath become another world and the chains and manacles of prison and incarceration have been broken to pieces, and Abdul-Baha hath attained to the meeting of the Holy Threshold.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='143'>July 24,1908, the day of the proclamation of a constitutional government in Turkey, and the freeing of all political prisoners and exiles.</aside>
  
    <p id='1858'>Although in prison, I have experienced the utmost joy and fragrance, the heart was attracted, the spirit rejoiced, the eyes turned toward the Kingdom of God and the tongue mentioning the Name of the True One and displaying the utmost effort and endeavor in the promotion of the Word of God and the diffusion of the fragrances of God; yet, under all difficulties, there <span data-pg='345' id='pg345'></span> have been no shortcomings, nor hath there been any lack of enthusiasm. The call hath been raised uninterruptedly and the fragrances of holiness have been diffused through all regions and empires.</p>
  
    <p id='1859'>In the meeting that had been organised in Los Angeles the rays of the Sun of Truth shone forth, making it an assembly of illumination. The house of Mr. and Mrs. ….…. became the nest and shelter of the birds of the Kingdom, and the house of Mrs. ….….. and the residence of Miss ….…. in Pasadena became the gathering-place of the Merciful and the rose-garden of realities and significances. I supplicate from the bounty and favor of His Holiness the Almighty to assist those holy souls by the invisible confirmations and that they be helped by the providence and grace of His Highness the One.</p>
  
    <p id='1860'>Convey on my behalf longing greeting to the brother of Mr. ….…. and say: “Praise God that thou hast followed in the footsteps of thy respected brother, associated with him and become his confidant.”</p>
  
    <p id='1861'>Likewise announce my longing greeting to the assemblies of Oakland and San Francisco. The houses of Mrs. ….…. and Mrs. ….…. have become the place of reading the divine verses and the nests of the nightingales of the heavenly orchard. A sweet fragrance hath reached the spirit and soul from those assemblies.</p>
  
    <p id='1862'>Praise be to God, that in all cities the believers have met thee with the utmost attraction and thy shining face and joyful disposition became the cause of the enkindlement of the fire of their souls and hearts. Undoubtedly thou shalt also make a trip to Green Acre. <span data-pg='346' id='pg346'></span></p>
  
    <p id='1863'>The utmost joy was produced by the news of the purchase of the ground for the erection of the Temple. I hope that ere long they may lay the foundation.</p>
  
    <p id='1864'>Deliver on my behalf divine glad-tidings to the assemblies in Seattle, the members of the houses of Mrs. ….…. and Mrs. ….…. and the assemblies in Portland and Denver and say: “O ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom! Be ye thankful that although the light of guidance hath dawned from the East, yet, praise be to God, it illuminated both the East and the West! In order that glorification and thanks may be shown for these bounties, the words and actions must be in accordance with the advices and behests of His Highness Baha’o’llah. Thanks does not depend upon words but upon deeds!” </p>

    <aside data-fnid='146'>To two members of the Chicago assembly.</aside>
  
    <p id='1879'>Verily, I read your letter and was informed of its contents filled with spiritual attractions and thanked <span data-pg='349' id='pg349'></span> God—glorified is He!—for His grace and His merciful bestowals.</p>
  
    <p id='1880'>It behooveth you to be the first assistant to the Word of God, the first servant of the Cause of God and the first one to withstand the spreaders (of false rumors) who say that which they know not, who calumniate God, well knowing that they are calumniators and that they, themselves, have contrived the thing for their own sakes, and evil is that which they do.</p>
  
    <p id='1881'>Remember what the Pharisees published concerning Jesus, attributed to Him and said about Him and how they oppressed Him until they paraded Him in Jerusalem in such a form as made the angels of sanctity to weep in the Sublime Kingdom. They put on His head a crown of thistles; nay, more, they cast dust in His face—into a face whereby the heaven and the earth is illuminated! They turned their backs upon Him, then bowed and said: “Peace be unto thee, O King of kings! Peace be unto thee, O King of the Jews!”</p>
  
    <p id='1882'>Of the same class are the Pharisees and priests in this manifest day. “Leave them to amuse themselves with their vain discourse.” They are as people deluded by their temptations and are isolated from the gifts of your Lord, the Clement, the Merciful. “They are deaf, dumb and blind; therefore, they will not understand.”</p>
  
    <p id='1883'>Verily, I, through the grace of my Lord, have never heeded these souls, even to reading their articles, inasmuch as their articles signify no other than the buzzing of flies to the hearing of an eagle, or the croaking of a frog of the material world to the ears of the leviathan of the sea of the Kingdom. Is it to be considered as <span data-pg='350' id='pg350'></span> anything? No, by no means! Verily, the eagle soareth high in the supreme apex while the flies rumble in the lowest rubbish.</p>
  
    <p id='1884'>But it is incumbent upon you to block them up as a stone with decisive arguments before which heads are bowed and voices are made humble. God will strengthen you therein. You will surely find these Pharisees in manifest loss. Can one ever prevent the waves of the sea of the Lofty One from rolling? Or is it possible for me to restrain the fragrances of sanctity from diffusion? Or can one withhold the sun from casting its rays to all regions? No, by no means! Nay, rather such souls make the table sent down from heaven unlawful unto themselves.</p>
  
    <p id='1885'>How is the bat to be compared with the most great orb which bestows bounty upon all regions! How is the gnat to be compared with the eagle soaring in the spacious firmament! How are the Caiaphas and Annas to be compared with the Christ mounted on the clouds with great power and glory!</p>
  
    <p id='1886'>Thank God that He hath opened your insight to the Light which is shining from the Supreme Concourse and caused you to witness His most mighty signs. By my life! the hearts of the people of Baha’ are cheered with such gifts! </p>

It is enough humiliation and abasement to them that they have violated the Covenant of God and contradicted the Appointed Center, and desired to demolish this solid edifice—which, alas, could not be!

Were it not for the chain, sword and affliction, how should the people of faithfulness be distinguished from the people of hatred? Nay, otherwise, they would seem as one. This wound cannot be remedied save by a host of calamities, and this illness cannot be cured except by the cup of affliction.</p>
  
    <p id='1894'>I ask God that I may not repose for a moment, but that, night and day, in the love of the Blessed Beauty <a data-fnid='150'></a> —may my spirit be a sacrifice to Him!—I may drink from the rosy cup of the blood of the heart.</p>

    <p id='1901'>O ye <a data-fnid='153'></a> dwellers of the Kingdom!</p>
    <aside data-fnid='153'>To fifteen members of the Chicago assembly.</aside>
  
    <p id='1902'>Thank ye God that ye have turned your faces toward the Kingdom of Abha, and are yearning for the outpouring of the Exalted Realm. Ye are accepted in the Threshold of the True One and are chosen by the Most Great Guidance! <span data-pg='354' id='pg354'></span></p>
  
    <p id='1903'>Ye have asked regarding the word of the “Ransomed Ones”. The mystery of “Ransom” (or Sacrifice) is a most great subject and is inexhaustible.</p>
  
    <p id='1904'>Briefly it is as follows: The moth is a sacrifice to the candle. The spring is a sacrifice to the thirsty one. The sincere lover is a sacrifice to the loved one and the longing one is a sacrifice to the beloved. The point lies in this: He must wholly forget himself, become a wanderer (in the Abode of the Beloved) enamoured with His Tresses. He must consign to oblivion the body and soul, the life, comfort and existence. He must seek the good pleasure of the True One; desire the Face of the True One; and walk in the Path of the True One. He must become intoxicated with His Cup, resigned in His Hand and close the eyes to life and living, in order that he may shine like unto the Light of Truth from the Horizon of Eternity. This is the first station of sacrifice.</p>
  
    <p id='1905'>The second station of sacrifice is as follows: Man must become severed from the human world, be delivered from the contingent gloominess, the illumination of mercifulness must shine and radiate in him, the nether world become as non-existent and the Kingdom become manifest. He must become like unto the iron thrown within the furnace of fire. The qualities of iron, such as blackness, coldness and solidity which belong to the earth disappear and vanish while the characteristics of fire, such as redness, glowing and heat, which belong to the Kingdom become apparent and visible. Therefore, iron hath sacrificed its qualities and grades to the fire, acquiring the virtues of that element.</p>
  
    <p id='1906'>Likewise, when the souls are released from the fetters <span data-pg='355' id='pg355'></span> of the world, the imperfections of mankind and that animalistic darkness, and have stepped into the Realm of Abstraction, have partaken a share from the outpouring of the Placeless and have acquired lordly perfections, they are the “ransomed ones” (or the martyrs) of the Sun of Truth, who are hastening to the altar of heart and soul. </p>

    <p id='1934'>What thou hast written became evident and what thou hast heard from Mirza ….…. regarding the necessity of many teachers in America, is true. I have said so. Indeed, there is need of a thousand teachers, each one severed from the world, attracted by the Holy Spirit in the Supreme Concourse and joyful through the Kingdom of God and in perfect sanctity, holiness and sufficiency.</p>
  
    <p id='1935'>This matter of teachers requires the greatest condition; that is, they should never stain themselves with <span data-pg='360' id='pg360'></span> the world, they should not look for the least pecuniary reward from any soul; nay, rather they should bear the utmost poverty and with the perfect wealth of nature <a data-fnid='155'></a> , through the bounty of God, may they associate with the people. They should seek no reward nor recompense. Freely have they received, freely should they give. His Holiness Christ sayeth: “When ye leave the city, clean off from your shoes the dust thereof.” The holiness of the teachers must reach this degree. Thus may they utter with eloquence, while in ecstasy and great joy, and guide the people to the manifest light.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='155'>“Wealth of Nature” refers to a state wherein man can dispense with things and be happy in their absence.</aside>
  
    <p id='1936'>If this be the endeavor, strive with life and heart and guide the people to he Kingdom of God, lead them to the straight pathway, inform them of the greatness and magnitude of this Cause and give them the glad-tidings through the bounty of divine providence and the revelation of the Sun of Truth in this great age.</p>

    <p id='1941'>Thy letter, through his honor Mirza ….…., was received and thy former letters also became acceptable and through the contents of those writings utmost <span data-pg='361' id='pg361'></span> joy and fragrance was produced, for they all evinced faith, assurance and firmness in the Covenant.</p>
  
    <p id='1942'>In this day the most vital and momentous matter is steadfastness in the love of the Manifestor of Light on the Mount of Sinai and endurance of ordeals and unaccountable calamities in this Cause.</p>
  
    <p id='1943'>Ere long the seditious people shall arise in that country to deride the righteous ones and to ridicule the holy ones. Every day they will cast ignominy and at every moment they will present great persecution. They shall revile the friends for the sake of the love of Baha; and bring down upon them contempt and sarcasm; neither do they fall short in creating torture.</p>
  
    <p id='1944'>This is the custom and sentence of the people of bygone ages. Undoubtedly these things must transpire in these days even with a greater intensity.</p>
  
    <p id='1945'>That is why His Holiness the Christ sayeth: “Everything which hath happened in the cycles of the former prophets will certainly occur again in these days.” Consider ye! What calumny, slander, cruelty and oppression were brought down upon the apostles by the Israelites for the sake of faith and assurance! They unlocked the hands of pillage, persecuted and tortured those sanctified souls. Therefore, there is no doubt but that you will become afflicted with trial, calamity and oppression in the path of the Beauty of Abha. These trials are the essence of bestowal and pure bounty and the proofs of your acceptance in the Threshold of Oneness. Consequently, when the fire of trials is ignited, celebrate ye in joy, dance with overflowing emotions and be ye happy that—praise be to God!—ye have become <span data-pg='362' id='pg362'></span> the target of contempt in the path of the Beauty of Abha and are hated by the people of passion and desire.</p>
  
    <p id='1946'>Thy services in the highway of the Kingdom are accepted, thy toleration of the troubles is known and manifest and thy eloquent speeches in the assemblies of believers are heard and appreciated. I hope that through these services thou mayest become the manifestor of the favors of the Lord of the Kingdom and recipient of the merciful glances of His Highness the Magnificent and the Compassionate. </p>

    <p id='1974'>O my Lord, I have not words enough to praise Thee, nor can the birds of meditation ever ascend to the Kingdom of Thy sanctity. Thou art, in Thine entity, sanctified from every praise and commendation, and art purified, in Thyself, from the thanksgiving of the people of emanation. Thou hast been eternally in the sanctity of Thyself exalted beyond the comprehension of the knowing among the Supreme Concourse, and Thou shalt be permanently in the purity of Thine essence, incomprehensible beyond the knowledge of the praisers among the dwellers in the exalted Realm of Might!</p>

Give me the cup of Thy forgiveness and Thy gift, move me by the breath of Thy love, dilate my breast by the light of Thy knowledge, purify my person by the mysteries of Thy singleness, and quicken me through the breezes of the garden of Thy mercy so that I may sever myself from all beside Thee, lay hold of the hem of the mantle of Thy majesty, forget aught else <span data-pg='367' id='pg367'></span> save Thee, be associated with the fragrance of Thy days, be enabled to continue faithful in the threshold of Thy sanctity and stand up in the service of Thy Cause, be submissive and lowly before Thy beloved ones and to account myself as nothing in the presence of Thy chosen ones. Verily, Thou art the Helper, the Assister, the Exalted, the Generous!</p>
  
    <p id='1977'>O my God, O my God, I beg of Thee, by the effulgence of the light of Thy countenance, whereby all the regions of the world are illumined; by the glances of the eye of Thy mercy, which comprehends all things; by the billows of the sea of Thy favor, wherewith all parts are overflowing; by the rains from the clouds of Thy gift, which are falling upon the essence of the created beings; by the radiance of Thy mercy, which overpowers existence—to strengthen Thy chosen ones to faithfulness, to enable Thy beloved ones to serve Thine exalted Threshold, to encircle them through the hosts of Thy power, which have encompassed all things, and to assist them through Thy numerous armies from the Supreme Concourse.</p>
  
    <p id='1978'>O my God, these are lowly souls in Thy doorway and poor ones before Thy court, humbly seeking Thy grace and in need of Thy confirmation, turning toward the Kingdom of Thy Singleness, and yearning for the bounties of Thy gift. O my Lord, refine their consciences through the lights of Thy sanctity, and purify their hearts through the gift of Thy confirmation, dilate their breasts through the fragrances of joy and happiness, which are being diffused from Thy Supreme Concourse, and illumine their sight by witnessing Thy chief signs. Make them signs of sanctity and standards of <span data-pg='368' id='pg368'></span> purity waving on the apex of the contingent world, unto all creatures; so that their words may take effect in the hearts though they are even as flint.

We are <span data-pg='369' id='pg369'></span> helpless, humble, lowly, and weak; confer Thy mercy upon us, favor us with Thy gifts, overlook our shortcomings, and conceal our endless faults. We are Thine, whatever we might be (good or bad), and whatever we may say or hear is but Thy commendation. We seek but Thy face, and we search but Thy path. Thou art the loving God, while we are but sinners and love Thee passionately. O Thou Cloud of Mercy (shower upon us) a few drops! O Flower-garden of Favor (send to us) some fragrances!

    <aside data-fnid='159'>Salsahil, i.e., Sweet Water of Life.</aside>
  
    <p id='1982'>O friends of God, and assistants of this humble servant! When the Sun of Truth shone forth with His infinite bounties from the dawning-place of hopes, and the horizon of existence was illuminated through the radiance of sanctity—then He cast forth such splendor whereby the gloomy darkness disappeared! Therefore, the earth became the envy of the celestial world, and the realm of dust was made a scene of the exalted kingdom. Then the fragrances of holiness exhaled, and the sweet odors were diffused. The breeze of the divine spring blew, and the fruitful winds of infinite generosity passed by from the point of favor. The brilliant morning dawned and the glad-tidings of the greatest gift were announced. The divine spring appeared throughout the contingent world. The earth of existence moved and the material world was put in motion. The barren and dried up soil turned into an eternal garden, and the inanimate earth was endowed with eternal life. The flowers and myrtles of knowledge grew, and the fresh herbage of the knowledge of God flourished. The material world showed forth the bounties of the Merciful, and the visible world displayed the scene of the invisible world. The call of God was raised, the divine banquet celebrated, the cup of the Testament was circulated and the universal acclamation was uttered! <span data-pg='371' id='pg371'></span></p>
  
    <p id='1983'>Among the people, a multitude became intoxicated with this divine wine—and a multitude were deprived of this great favor. Many a soul enlightened his sight and insight by the radiance of grace, and many were cheered and rejoiced at the melodies of unity. Some birds sang melodies and harmonies, and some nightingales began to warble on the branches of the rose-tree of mercifulness. The Kingdom and the phenomenal world were adorned, and became the envy of the delectable paradise—but, alas—and a thousand times alas!—that the heedless souls are still in the sleep of negligence, and the ignorant are keeping clear of this holy gift. The blind are veiled, the deaf are bereft and the dead despair of attaining to it; just as it is said (in the Koran) “They despair of the life to come, as the infidels despair (of the resurrection of) those who dwell in the graves.”</p>
  
    <p id='1984'>As to you—O friends of the Merciful!—move your tongues to thank the Loving Lord, and employ yourselves in praising and glorifying the Beauty of the Adored One, for ye were granted the privilege to be exhilarated from this most pure cup, and became full of cheer and attraction from this goblet of wine. Ye have perfumed your nostrils with the fragrances of sanctity, and delighted your senses with the scent of the garment of the Joseph of faithfulness. Ye tasted the honey of devotion from the hand of the Unique Beloved and partook of the eternal table at the feast of the blessing of the Presence of the Unity. This favor is one of the special gifts of the Presence of the Merciful, and this grace and generosity is one of the incomparable gifts of our Loving Lord. This is in accordance with what Christ said: “Many are called, but few <span data-pg='372' id='pg372'></span> chosen.” That is to say, there are many who are invited, but those souls who are signalized with the grace and favor of guidance are but very rare. “This is the bounty of God; He will give the same unto whom He pleaseth; and God is endowed with great bounty.”</p>
  
    <p id='1985'>O friends of God! the candle of the Testament is surrounded by the hypocritical winds of the people of the world and the nightingale of faithfulness is surprised by the crows of ill-nature—the violators. The mindless birds of night are plotting against the dove of commemoration and the ferocious beasts are prowling after the gazelle of the plain of the love of God. So, He is in great danger and painful affliction.</p>
  
    <p id='1986'>The beloved of God must be as firm as a mountain, and must not quiver under the most violent shock, nor grieve at the greatest calamities; but must be as a solid foundation. They must cling to the hem of Glory and trust in the Beauty of the Most High. They must lean on the help and assistance of the Ancient Kingdom and confide in the care and protection of the Generous Lord. They must at every instant nourish and refresh themselves with the dew of favor, and in every breath revive and cheer themselves through the waves of the Holy Spirit, raise themselves to serve the Cause of the Supreme, and endeavor their utmost to diffuse the breath of God. They must be as a strongly fortified fortress for the defense of the blessed Cause, and as a well-made fortification for the protection of the hosts of the Pre-existent Beauty. They must in all conditions faithfully guard the edifice of the Cause of God, and be scintillating stars on the horizon of the visible; because the gloomy darkness of all nations prevailed from all <span data-pg='373' id='pg373'></span> directions, and all the creeds of the world are plotting to quench their evident light. Notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of all tribes, how can ye continue heedless thereof? So, ye must be conscious and aware thereof, and be ready to guard and preserve the Cause of the Creator. For this day the most necessary duty is to purify your morals, to correct your manners, and to improve your deeds. The beloved of the Merciful must appear with such morals and habits among the creatures that the fragrant odor of the garden of sanctity may perfume all the horizons and may quicken all the dead souls, because the Manifestation of Divinity and the dawning of the infinite lights of the Invisible is intended for the education of souls and the refinement of the morals of all in existence, so that some blessed souls may be delivered from the gloomy world of brutality and be characterized with attributes which tend to adorn the being of man; that the earthly people may become godlike, the dark ones may become illuminated, the uninstructed ones may become familiar with the mystery of the Kingdom, and the mortal souls may be associated with the Immortal Splendor; the deprived ones may partake of the endless sea, and the ignorant may drink from the living water of knowledge; the savage may give up their ferocity, and the cruel may become forbearing; that the warlike may search after true conciliation and the pitiless savages may be favored with ideal peace; that the degraded may learn about the condition of purity and the soiled ones may attain to the stream of sanctity. If these divine bounties do not appear in the being of men, the bounty of the <span data-pg='374' id='pg374'></span> Divine Manifestation will prove fruitless and the splendor of the Sun of Truth will become without effect.</p>
  
    <p id='1987'>So, O beloved of God, endeavor with your hearts and souls, that ye may be qualified with the morals and attributes of the Blessed Perfection, and partake of the bounties of His sanctity; that ye may become signs of unity and standards of oneness, discover the essence of singleness and sing harmonies and lays in in this divine garden, in merciful melodies; that ye may become as thankful birds, and sing a song in the rose-garden of existence which may astonish minds and senses; that ye may hoist a standard on the apex of the universe which may flutter in the winds of favor, and plant a tree in the field of the visible world which may bring forth fruits of the utmost delicacy and freshness.</p>
  
    <p id='1988'>I swear by the Ideal Educator that, if ye act in compliance with the divine exhortations, as revealed in brilliant Tablets, this gloomy earth will become a mirror of the Exalted Kingdom, and the inferior page will display the Kingdom of Abha!</p>
  
    <p id='1989'>O friends of God! Praise be unto God that the invisible bounties of the Sun of Truth are encompassing you from all directions, and the doors of mercy are opened from all parts. Now is the time to be benefited and filled therewith. Seize the opportunity, and lose not the chance. Keep yourselves entirely clear of the world’s conditions of gloom, and show forth the characters and qualities of divine souls, that ye may consider to what an extent the radiance of the Divine Sun is shining and brilliant, and how the signs of favor are showing forth from the invisible World of Unity.</p>
  
    <p id='1990'>O friends of God! Praise be unto God that His <span data-pg='375' id='pg375'></span> Imperial Majesty, the Shah, acts with the utmost kindness, and His Highness, the Prime Minister, is practising the greatest fairness and equity towards the people. So, the friends of God must night and day pray for the permanence of the glorious empire, and raise themselves to return thanks to His Majesty for his justice, equity and kindness, because this is one of the indisputable commandments of God, as revealed in all celestial books. </p>

    <p id='1992'>O ye dear friends of Abdul-Baha! It is some time since any heart-thrilling melody hath reached the ear of life from certain countries, and life and conscience have not found happiness and joy. Howbeit all are remembered at all times and are indeed present before the sight. For, verily, the chalice of the heart is overflowing with the wine of the love of the friends; and their attachment and the desire to see them flow and circulate in the veins and arteries, even as the spirit.</p>
  
    <p id='1993'>In this condition it is evident how sad and grieved the heart is. In this storm of ordeal, whose wave hath reached the Supreme Apogee, and the arrow of hate hath come in succession from the six points; with every breath there is bewildering news and every day astonishing signs in the Blessed Spot.</p>
  
    <p id='1994'>The center of violation <a data-fnid='160'></a> supposed that through mere pride the foundation of the Covenant and Testament could be destroyed and that the righteous ones would shun and disobey the ordinances of God. Therefore, <span data-pg='376' id='pg376'></span> he spread writings of suspicion to all parts and busied himself with secret plans.</p>

    <aside data-fnid='163'>Syria.</aside>
  
    <p id='1998'>O God, verily I seek shelter in Thee from this action which is contrary to the precepts of Baha’, nay, it is a great wrong, committed only by every persistent sinner. <span data-pg='377' id='pg377'></span> For Thou hast enjoined upon us obedience to kings and rulers!</p>
  
    <p id='1999'>Among the fictions was that the building upon Mt. Carmel was purposed to be a fort, built with perfect solidity and strength, assigned it to be the “illumined city” and made the Holy Tomb, the Sacred Mecca; when in truth that is a building containing six vaults.</p>
  
    <p id='2000'>Among other fictions was, that he has founded a new monarchy (kingdom) and that he has called all the friends to this great wrong. God forbid; God forbid; God forbid! Praise be to Thee! <a data-fnid='164'></a> —this is a great calumny!—that since the Sacred Tomb <a data-fnid='165'></a> has become a visiting center for the world, it shall be a great misfortune to the country and to the public! and that the center of violation is not connected with these affairs, nay rather, he is a Suni, Sanavi, Bekri, and Omari. <a data-fnid='166'></a> That he knows the Blessed Perfection <a data-fnid='167'></a> to be only one of the reformers among the people, and a follower of the Path, and that these affairs were instituted by this oppressed one.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='164'>An expression of astonishment.</aside>

    <aside data-fnid='166'>These expressions are intended to convey the inference that he is orthodox.</aside>
    <aside data-fnid='167'>Baha’o’llah.</aside>
  
    <p id='2001'>In short, an inquisitory body was appointed by the center of the great government—may her glory increase! —and was sent to this land, taking up its abode directly in the home of one of the plaintiffs. The parties who joined in compiling the report and who were co-partners of my brother were sent for and questioned regarding the truth of the report. They amplified the contents of the report, explained them, confirmed them and above all added to them. They were the plaintiffs, <span data-pg='378' id='pg378'></span> the witnesses and the judge. Now that body hath returned to the Capital and every day terrible and frightful news is received.</p>
  
    <p id='2002'>But Abdul-Baha—praise be to God!—is in perfect peace, composure and rest. He is not even disturbed through this calumny and fiction, but rather hath referred all affairs to the pre-ordained decree and in perfect joy and happiness is ready to give up his life, expecting every ordeal.</p>
  
    <p id='2003'>Praise be to God!—the kind friends of God are also in a state of resignation and submissiveness. All are happy, thankful, joyful, and content. But the center of violation presumed that after the shedding of the blood of this oppressed one, or the throwing of him into the Mediterranean Sea, he will become nameless, traceless and forgotten, and that he [himself] would find an arena to gallop in and could win, with the spear of suspicions and fictions, the object of his hopes and desire. In vain! In vain! If there be no permanence to the fragrance of the musk of faithfulness, will any one be attracted by the vile odor of jealousy? If the deer of God be torn asunder by dogs and wolves, no one will run after the blood-thirsty wolf. If the nightingale of significances end his days, no one will listen to the croaking of the raven, nor to the cawing of the crow. What vain imagination is this, and what an ignorant display! Their actions are like unto a mirage in the desert, which the thirsty imagines to be water, but when he reaches it, finds it to be nothing.</p>
  
    <p id='2004'>In sooth, O ye friends of God, make firm your feet and heart, make perfect resolve through the power of <span data-pg='379' id='pg379'></span> confirmation of the Blessed Beauty; engage in the service of the Cause of God and withstand the nations and the peoples with the firmness, the solidity and and the steadfastness of the people of Baha’. Thus may others wonder how these hearts are fountains of trust and mines of the love of His Majesty, the Merciful One. Thus may ye remain unshaken by the painful occurrences in the Holy Land, and may remain firm through the disastrous events. If all the friends oppose (the Cause of God) with sword and one remain (firm), he will be the proclaimer of God, a divine herald, and will stand before all upon the earth.</p>
  
    <p id='2005'>In sooth, you must not mind the events in the Radiant Spot. The Holy Land is ever in danger and the flood of ordeal comes from every side, for the call hath become world-wide and the summons hath spread throughout the earth, and enemies, both the unfamiliar and the familiar, are engaged in their plans, their stratagems and schemes to calumniate; and it is evident that such a place is in danger, for against calumny there is no defence, nay rather, some wandering oppressed souls are imprisoned in a fortress, having no helper, assistant nor shelter from the sword of accusation and the teeth of calumny, save God!</p>
  
    <p id='2006'>Ye must think of this: How many dear friends have hastened to the divine altar; how many blessed souls have sacrificed life; what holy blood was shed; what pure hearts were drowned in blood; how many breasts were offered as targets for the arrows of malice, and how many sanctified bodies were cut to pieces. What is our duty? To be thinking of our own life and to dissimulate and associate with enemies and friends, or <span data-pg='380' id='pg380'></span> should we also follow the righteous and walk in the footprints of those who are great?</p>
  
    <p id='2007'>The numbered days (of life) will vanish away, and the present existence disappear. The garden of being will lose its freshness and fragrance, the orchard of mirth will miss its joy and beauty. The spring of life will change into the autumn of death, the joy of happiness of the palaces will change into the gloomy darkness of the grave. Therefore, it is not worth attachment and the wise person will not set his heart thereon. The wise and great man seeketh heavenly glory and divine might, desireth eternal life and seeketh nearness to the Threshold of God.</p>
  
    <p id='2008'>For in the tavern of the mortal world the bile of the man of God is not removed. He will not rest a moment here and will not stain himself with the attachments of the world. Nay, rather, the friends are the stars of the summit of Providence and the planets of the firmament of Guidance. With perfect strength do they dispel darkness and destroy the foundation of envy and enmity. They wish for the world and its denizens unity and peace; they destroy the basis of war and strife; they seek integrity, faithfulness and friendliness, and are well-wishes even of the evil-disposed enemy. Thus they make this prison of infidelity the sublime mansion of fidelity, and this dungeon of envy a delectable paradise.</p>
  
    <p id='2009'>O ye friends, endeavor with life and heart that this world may become the mirror of the world of the Kingdom; that the earthly kingdom be filled with the bounty of the heavenly; that the voice of the Supreme Concourse may be raised in commendation, and that the <span data-pg='381' id='pg381'></span> traces of the bounty and grace of the Beauty of Abha may envelop the earth!</p>
  
    <p id='2010'>His honor, Ameen <a data-fnid='168'></a> , hath praised highly the honored servants and the maid-servants of the Manifest Light; commending each one separately and eulogizing the firmness and steadfastness of all; that—praise be to God!—the friends and maid-servants of the Merciful in all Persia are in perfect resignation and firm and steadfast, like unto a firm and solid foundation, and in an absolute state of ecstasy and attraction are engaged in spreading the fragrance of the Lord of Lords.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='168'>One of the teachers of the Bahai Revelation in Persia.</aside>
  
    <p id='2011'>Through this news, at this time of great jeopardy, much happiness was realized, for the supreme hope and desire of this oppressed one is the spirituality of the hearts and the radiance of the beings of the friends. When this gift is obtained every ordeal is for him as an abundant bounty and a great shower.</p>
  
    <p id='2012'>O my God! O my God! Thou seest me drowned in the sea of ordeals, seized upon by the fire of infidelity, with tears flowing in the dark night rolling in the bed of sleeplessness, mine eyes expectant to see the dawn of the lights of Faith. And when I am anxious, as the fish whose bowels are inflamed upon the dust, I anticipate the manifestation of Thy bounties from all sides!</p>
  
    <p id='2013'>O Lord! Surround the friends in other regions with Thy great bounties and uplift those who are weak among Thy chosen, through Thy strength and providence, in every remote place!</p>
  
    <p id='2014'>O Lord, verily they are the captives of Thy love and the prisoners of Thy host, the birds of the atmosphere <span data-pg='382' id='pg382'></span> of Thy guidance, the fish of the sea of Thy providence, the stars of the horizon of Thy bounty, the army of the fortress of Thy law, the banners of Thy remembrance, the eyes of Thy mercy, the fountains of Thy grace and the springs of Thy generosity. Therefore, guard them with the eye of kindness, confirm them in promoting Thy Word, strengthen their hearts in Thy love, reinforce their backs in Thy service, make firm their loins in Thy servitude, spread through them Thy fragrances, reveal through them Thy signs, manifest through them Thy proofs, accomplish through them Thy words and perfect through them Thy mercy!</p>

    <aside data-fnid='173'>To the assembly of Zanjan, Persia.</aside>
  
    <p id='2039'>It is the early dawn and the soul-refreshing breeze of the Paradise of Abha is wafting upon all the contingent beings, but it displays the effect only in pure hearts and perfumes only the healthy mind. A seeing eye beholdeth the splendors of the sun and a hearing ear listeneth to the melody of the Supreme Concourse. Although the mercy of the vernal shower and the heavenly outpouring descend upon all the earth, yet only from a virgin soil vegetation groweth while the brackish ground is deprived and unproductive, for the traces of the outpouring are not evident and manifest. Now the holy Fragrances of Abha are diffused in every clime, but only the spiritual souls are attracted and draw benefits. It is hoped by this imprisoned one, from the bounty of the Living Self-Subsistent, that, through the dominating power of the Word of God, the nostrils of the <span data-pg='388' id='pg388'></span> heedless ones becomes opened and partake a share from the fragrances of the Rose-Garden of Mystery.</p>
  
    <p id='2040'>O ye friends of God! The real friends are the skillful physicians and the divine instructions are the antidote of the Merciful One and the remedies of the hearts. They (the believers) heal the nostril affected with rheum, make mindful the negligent ones, give a share to the deprived ones and make hopeful the hopeless ones. In this day if anyone liveth in accord with the heavenly teachings and instructions, he shall become a spiritual physician to the world of humanity and the trumpet of Israfel <a data-fnid='174'></a> to quicken the dead; for the confirmations of the Kingdom of Abha are uninterrupted and the victory of the Supreme Concourse is the associate of every one who is pure in heart. The weak gnat will become the strong royal falcon and the sparrow is transformed into the eagle soaring toward the apex of the Ancient Glory. Therefore, look ye not upon your own capability and merit, nay rather, lay your confidence in the bounty and protection, favor and grace of the Blessed Perfection—may my life be a sacrifice to His beloved ones!—and, mounting upon the charger of magnanimity, rush ye toward the arena of martyrdom, so that ye may win the polo of favors in this vast field of God!</p>
    <aside data-fnid='174'>One of the angels of the “Resurrection day,” mentioned in the Koran.</aside>
  
    <p id='2041'>O ye maid-servants of the Merciful One! The queens of the world went down to the tombs and disapeared and vanished from the face of the earth. There remained for them no fruit, no name, no trace, no fame and no existence. But every one of the maid-servants in the court of Oneness shone forth like unto <span data-pg='389' id='pg389'></span> the brilliant stars from the glorious Ancient Horizon, cast their rays upon centuries and cycles, attained to their utmost desires in the Kingdom of Abha and drank from the wine of meeting (with God) in the Assembly of the Almighty. These souls have taken a share from (the benefits) of being and obtained results.</p>
  
    <p id='2042'>O ye friends of the wronged one! Purify your eyes from beholding [any as] strangers. Do ye not see foreignness, nay rather, know all as friends; for with the observation of strangeness, the practice of love and unity is difficult.</p>
  
    <p id='2043'>In this wonderful age, according to the divine texts, ye must befriend all nations and communities. Ye must not look upon violence, force, evil intentions, persecutions or hostility, nay rather, ye must raise your eyes to the horizon of glory [and see] that each one of these creatures is a sign of the Lord of Signs and [has] stepped upon the arena of existence through divine favor and supreme energy. Thus they are known and not unknown, are friends and not strangers. We must deal with all according to the above criterion.</p>
  
    <p id='2044'>Therefore, the beloved must, with infinite kindness and love, associate and sympathize with both friends and strangers and not look at all upon the merits and capabilities of the persons. Under all circumstances they must show forth genuine love and be not defeated by the intensity of rancor, hatred, quarrel, malice and the grudge of the people. Should they (they people) shoot arrows they (the friends) must administer milk and honey; if they give poison, the believers must impart delicacies; if they cause pain, let the beloved be a <span data-pg='390' id='pg390'></span> remedy; if they strike a blow, let them become the antidote.</p>
  
    <p id='2045'>O my God! O my God! Verily, these are Thy weak servants and Thy submissive, faithful ones and Thy sincere maid-servants who are humbled before Thy illumined Threshold, acknowledging Thy Oneness which hath appeared like unto the appearance of the sun in midday, listening to Thy call from Thy mysterious Kingdom and uttering Thy prayers with hearts overflowing with Thy love and devotion!</p>
  
    <p id='2046'>O my Lord! Pour upon all of them the rain of Thy mercy, [cause to] descend upon every one the showers of Thy bounty from the clouds of Thy munificence, make them graceful plants in Thy divine Rose-garden and suffer these myrtles to become verdant, green and refreshed by the outpouring from the Cloud of Thy Singleness.</p>
  
    <p id='2047'>Verily Thou art the Powerful, the Most High, the Mighty and Omnipotent, and the Creator of the earth and heaven, and verily there is no God but Thee, the Lord of the Manifest Signs! </p>

    <aside data-fnid='175'>To the assembly of Teheran, Persia.</aside>
  
    <p id='2049'>It is a well known fact that, owing to the frequency of disturbances, the work of delivering the Message hath been for a short time discontinued. In consequence, persons travel less frequently to the different parts of the country. It is known and clear that today the unseen divine assistance encompasseth those who deliver the Message. And if the work of delivering <span data-pg='391' id='pg391'></span> the Message be neglected, the assistance shall be entirely cut off, for it is impossible that the friends of God could receive assistance unless they be engaged in delivering the Message. Under all conditions the Message must be delivered, but with wisdom. If it be not possible openly, it must be done quietly. The friends should be engaged in educating the souls and should become instruments in aiding the world of humanity to acquire spiritual joy and fragrance. For example: If every one of the friends (believers) were to establish relations of friendship and right dealings with one of the negligent souls, associate and live with him with perfect kindliness, and meanwhile through good conduct and moral behavior lead him to divine instruction, to heavenly advice and teachings, surely he would gradually arouse that negligent person and would change his ignorance into knowledge.</p>
  
    <p id='2050'>Souls are liable to estrangement. Such methods should be adopted that the estrangement should be first removed, then the Word will have effect.</p>
  
    <p id='2051'>If one of the believers be kind to one of the negligent ones and with perfect love should gradually make him understand the reality of the Cause of God in such a way that the latter should know in what manner the Religion of God hath been founded and what its object is, doubtless he will become changed; excepting abnormal souls who are reduced to the state of ashes and whose hearts are like stones, yea, even harder.</p>
  
    <p id='2052'>If by this method every one of the friends of God were to try to lead one soul to the right path, the number of the believers would be doubled every year. But this should be carried out with perfect wisdom and in <span data-pg='392' id='pg392'></span> such a manner that no harm would ever result therefrom.</p>
  
    <p id='2053'>In the same way those who deliver the Message should travel to all parts of the country. And if delivering the Message should be the cause of disturbance, let them then be engaged in encouraging and educating the friends, in order that those souls receive spiritual attraction and rejoice, seek delight and ecstasy, acquire new life and through the fragrances of sanctity gain vivacity and freshness.</p>
  
    <p id='2054'>The object is this, that in the time of peace and safety this work of delivering the Message should be carried on with the utmost fervor. But when there is no peace and safety, extreme wisdom should be exercised, though no complete cessation of effort is permissible, for in that case the divine assistance shall be entirely cut off.</p>
  
    <p id='2055'>With regard to the formation of benevolent associations, surely this subject should be given due attention. The disciples of His Holiness Christ—may my life be a sacrifice unto Him!—were only eleven persons and they had established a benevolent fund. So the establishment of the fund had that degree of importance. </p>

    <p id='2057'>Verily, I set my forehead on the dust and turn my face toward the Lord of Lords and invoke my Lord with intense fervor and attraction, that He may look upon you with the glances of the eye of His providence, watch over you with the gaze of His protection, unite <span data-pg='393' id='pg393'></span> your hearts, dilate your breasts, harmonize your souls, rejoice you with gladness, exhilarate you with the chalices of salvation, make you steadfast in the divine Cause and that He may enable you to cling to the hem of the Almighty, to hasten toward the place of sacrifice and to be sheltered under the shadow of the Blessed Tree whose roots are planted firm and whose branches are extended to heaven:</p>
  
    <p id='2058'>O my Lord! O my Lord! These are the chosen ones whose faces are illumined with the light of guidance, who found the heavenly table pleasing to their tastes, who submitted willingly to every matter which happened in the land and sought help from the hosts of the Supreme Concourse. Their feet are indeed made firm, their banners hoisted, their deeds righteous and their actions just. O Lord! Make them fragrant plants of Thy paradise, flowers of the garden of nearness, verses of Thy glorious book, words of Thy “Published tablet” unto the people of the world and as falcons soaring on the loftiest summit. Verily Thou art the Beneficent, the Merciful, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Bestower!</p>
  
    <p id='2059'>O my dear friends! Yours was not merely a letter; it was perfumed with amber and diffused a sweet fragrance. Every word thereof was a rose in the rose-garden of the love of God and was a flower, a hyacinth.</p>
  
    <p id='2060'>When the breeze of Providence blows from the direction of gift, the gardens of hearts attain thereby exceeding purity and freshness. Such significances arise from the soul and consciousness and impart joy and fragrance. <span data-pg='394' id='pg394'></span></p>
  
    <p id='2061'>O friends! It is the wish of Abdul-Baha that the friends may establish general unity and not a particular meeting of unity. You must have great consideration for this fact, for during the past cycles though such events (founding of particular, i.e., exclusive unity meetings) were, in the beginning, a means for harmony, they became in the end the cause of trouble.</p>
  
    <p id='2062'>We are all servants of one Threshold, attendants at one Court, waves of one sea, drops of one stream, the dust before one door and plants of one garden. There must arise no trouble to deprive one from that which is the real purpose. The beloved of God must be friendly even with strangers and intimate even with outsiders—how much more with others among the righteous (i.e., believers)!</p>
  
    <p id='2063'>To organize assemblies is praiseworthy and acceptable, but these must be established for certain matters. For example: Assemblages for teaching (the Truth), gatherings for the spread of the fragrances of God, gatherings for the relief of the orphans, gatherings for the protection (i.e., feeding, etc.,) of the poor, assemblages for the spread of learning and, in a word, there must be gatherings for matters which concern the well-being of men, such as organizations of a society of commerce, societies for the expansion of agriculture. To be brief, similar societies are very acceptable and praiseworthy and concern all in general and not a particular number.</p>
  
    <p id='2064'>In a word: That which is conducive to the life (or growth) of the people is acceptable and whatever is the cause of disaffection is blameworthy. I hope all the friends of the East and West shall rest in the same <span data-pg='395' id='pg395'></span> assemblage and adorn one gathering, appearing with all the heavenly attributes and virtues in the world of humanity.</p>
  
    <p id='2065'>O my Lord! O my Lord! Enable me to witness the most great sign and to realize the fulfillment of this hope throughout all regions. Verily Thou art the Bestower, the Beneficent, whose bounties are great!</p>
  
    <p id='2066'>Some of the friends have asked to present themselves in these parts. In these days this does not conform with wisdom. God willing, permission shall be given at some favorable time. </p>

    <p id='2068'>Verily the dark night hath been spreading its wings over all the regions and the face of the heaven and earth was hidden behind the clouds of inky gloom and blackness—wherefore the sights were veiled from beholding the most great signs and inner perceptions were blinded <span data-pg='396' id='pg396'></span> and unable to find the fire of divine guidance; souls were wandering in the desert of error and heedlessness and the possessors of intelligence were lost in the wilderness of amazement and skepticism, crying and weeping as a mother bereft of her babe—bewailing and lamenting like unto a thirsty one in the midst of a vast and boundless Sahara!</p>
  
    <p id='2069'>But through Thy greatest bounty, the glorious dawn broke and the lightning of guidance flashed from the Supreme Horizon upon the face of heaven!

    <p id='2072'>Then those whose ears were unstopped and open rejoiced in listening to the call, while the deaf (or ignorant) were astonished , crying out, “What is the cause of this acclamation and rejoicing?” Then the fluent speakers loosened their tongues in thanksgiving and glorification, while the dumb became as hard and lifeless stones; then the souls were purified, the hearts were attracted, the breasts were dilated, the characters were sanctified, the secret thoughts became manifest and the realities stepped into the arena of existence; they sought illumination, were guided, became ablaze, enflamed and enkindled, called forth and proclaimed, saying:</p>

    <p id='2095'>O ye merciful friends of Abdul-Baha! At this moment a letter hath been received from America containing the good news that that region of the Occident hath become the Orient; that is, in that region the rays of the Sun of Truth have appeared and shone forth with such penetration that the bright light of the morn of guidance hath dawned and every longing one hath attained to the desire of this heart, and that the melody of the Kingdom of Abha ascends continuously to the Supreme Concourse and the soul-refreshing strains of “Ya Baha El-Abha!” reach the ears of the peoples and communities of that country.</p>
  
    <p id='2096'>According to what they have written, they have celebrated the day of the “Birth anniversary” in twenty-four cities by giving public feasts and beautiful receptions. They have spent that day in the utmost joy and happiness, they have sent out general invitations, spread the table of gifts, engaged in the commemoration of the True One and in imparting glad-tidings to each other. Likewise, letters of congratulation and felicitation have been received from these twenty-four cities and assemblies. Consider ye what influence the penetrative power of the Word of God hath displayed in existence and how the universe is stirred and moved <span data-pg='400' id='pg400'></span> through it! How in America on the “Birth anniversary” such feasting and banqueting is prepared! How the remote ones have become the near ones and how the customs and habits of the East are spread abroad! This is the penetrative power of the Word of God and this is the might of the subduing desire of God!</p>
  
    <p id='2097'>O ye friends of God and maid-servants of the Merciful! His honor Ameen <a data-fnid='179'></a> hath mentioned you with the highest praise and commendation, saying that, thank God, the believers in all parts of the cities and towns are the manifestations of bounties and the dawning-places of justice and equity; are mindful, obedient, kind-hearted and steadfast; are engaged in reading the verses and occupied with spreading the signs; are in the utmost ecstasy and exhilaration and intoxicated with the pure wine; are active in praising and adoring the Most Great Name and intimate in paying homage to the Holy Threshold; are living in accord with the divine teachings and exhortations and are in every way endowed with all human excellences and attributes; that they are in the utmost unity and agreement and in great zeal and enthusiasm; are kind to every soul and treat all the communities with exceeding joy and fragrance; that they have sympathy even for the enemies and are faithful friends even to the unjust; that to the outsiders they are as relatives and to the strangers they are a swift-healing antidote instead of a poisonous sting; are the servants of the world of humanity and manifestors of the attributes of the Merciful One! Blessed are they for this testimony, which is expressive of the beauty of their characters and the merit of their <span data-pg='401' id='pg401'></span> virtues! Truly, I say, his honor Ameen is the well-wisher of all. In the day of the Manifestation he was the Ameen (Faithful) of the Blessed perfection <a data-fnid='180'></a> and in the days of the Covenant <a data-fnid='181'></a> he is the confidant of this yearning one. Therefore, his testimony is heard and accepted and his evidence is praised and beloved.</p>

    <aside data-fnid='181'>Abdul-Baha.</aside>
  
    <p id='2098'>O ye beloved of God! According to what is heard, some of the ulemas of the Sheite sect (Persian moslem mullas), as well as some leaders of the Shekhei school, are engaged constantly in instigating revolts and have arisen against the government with enmity and opposition, confusing the affairs of the state more than before.</p>
  
    <p id='2099'>Praise be to God! <a data-fnid='182'></a> What is this heedlessness and ignorance and what is this antagonism and insubordination! Verily, the Persian empire hath been at all times deprived of every bounty on account of the encroaching influence of the ritualistic mullas! Whenever that just government conceived a good intention to introduce reforms and amelioration of conditions, these ignorant leaders raised vehement opposition, protested severely and prevented the introduction of measures which would better conditions and spread culture and progress. One must be just. The intention of His Imperial Majesty is higher and purer than all the other leaders and chiefs, for the sole desire of the throne is the peace and security of the inhabitants and the cultivation and betterment of the conditions of the empire. But alas! they do not give a moment’s rest to the kind Padeshah, in order that he may voluntarily and of his own accord inaugurate reforms as much as may be warranted by circumstances. <span data-pg='402' id='pg402'></span></p>
    <aside data-fnid='182'>An expression of astonishment.</aside>
  
    <p id='2100'>However, the inhabitants of Persia are not the only ones who are afflicted with this ignorance and blindness. The people of the imperial Ottoman government are also in a state of the utmost ignorance and blindness. Diversity of opinions and ignorance of factions do not allow one breath of tranquility to the imperial government, in order that it may adjust internal conditions and rectify foreign relations. Yet, under all these conditions, His Imperial Majesty the Padeshah f the Ottomans is intelligently directing the affairs. The proof and testimony of this assertion is the protection afforded these exiled ones (in Acca) from the rebellious despotism of the enemies. If authority were in the people’s hands or in other hands than those of the government, the conspiracies and seditions of inside and outside enemies would have scattered even the ashes of this imprisoned one to the winds. But the forebearance, intelligence, foresight, far-reaching wisdom and discernment of His Imperial Majesty the Padeshah of the Ottomans have so far protected these exiled ones, notwithstanding the attacks of the calumniators and the party of the slanderers. We are of those who pray for these two just kings and are grateful to these two equitable sovereigns.</p>
  
    <p id='2101'>Praise be unto God! One of the imputations of the enemies is this: That—we seek refuge in God—we deny the validity and truth of the Sun of Guidance, the Lamp of the Supreme Concourse, the messenger of the Almighty, His Highness Mohammed Mostafa—upon Him be greeting and praise!—and that—God forbid! —we have written books in His refutation. Woe unto those who have arisen to spread this great falsehood <span data-pg='403' id='pg403'></span> and calumny! However, all the friends of God who are informed of the mysteries know that this exiled and imprisoned one would readily sacrifice his life at the dust of the Prophet’s feet. Furthermore, the Blessed Perfection—may my life be a sacrifice to His beloved ones—in the book of Ighan, hath established with invincible proofs and clear arguments the prophethood of His Highness the Messenger—may my life be a sacrifice to Him!—and also His Highness the Supreme (the Bab) hath invoked Him (Mohammed) in many supplications. Notwithstanding all these evidences, the unjust ones are crying out and secretly spreading the falsehood that we—God forbid!—are His deniers and the unfaithful friends (nakzeen) acknowledge these erroneous imputations. Praise be to God! If we deny the messengers and prophets of God, what have we to say for ourselves? Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Verily this is a great calumny!</p>
  
    <p id='2102'>To be brief, the aim is this: Though the interference of the ignorant and fanatical leaders the country of Persia is in a state of decadence, although the pure intention of His Imperial Majesty the crowned Shah is for progress. However, ye who are the well-wishers of the government and are sincere, obedient and kind toward it, be ye engaged always in service. Should any one of you enter into the service (or employment) of the government, he must live and act with the utmost truthfulness, righteousness, chastity, uprightness, purity, sanctity, justice and equity. But if—I seek refuge in God—any one betray the least of trusts or neglect and be remiss in the performance of duties which are intrusted to him, or by oppression takes one penny <span data-pg='404' id='pg404'></span> of extortion from the subjects, or seeks after his own personal, selfish aims and ends in the attainment of his own interests, he shall undoubtedly remain deprived of the outpourings of His Highness the Almighty! Beware! Beware! lest ye fall short in that which ye are commanded in this Tablet! </p>

    <p id='2134'>The light of truth hath radiated from the Sun of Divinity to the horizons in such a manner that the East and the West are illumined. But, alas! the blind do not see and the deaf do not hear the divine proclamation. The bats do not perceive the light of the sun and the beetles cannot enjoy the fragrances of a rose-garden.</p>
  
    <p id='2135'>Consider that the horizons of the world were enlightened through the light of the beauty of His Holiness Christ; yet all the people were asleep, blind and sightless, except a few whose eyes were opened and perceived the lights. Now thou shalt thank God that a beam of the light came to thy sight. I ask God that thine inner sight may be illumined so that thou mayest discover the hidden mysteries of the Kingdom of God. If thou become so, thou wilt be an evident light and a divine angel in the celestial dominion; then it dependeth on the divine confirmation, according to thy perseverance. </p>

    <p id='2137'>In the day of Christ all nations were expecting that His Holiness Christ should come from heaven, and He came from heaven, though outwardly He came from <span data-pg='410' id='pg410'></span> the womb of Mary. Hence, He hath said in the Gospels: “No one shall ascend to heaven except the one who hath come from heaven.” Now all the people expect Him to come from heaven.</p>
  
    <p id='2138'>If thou wishest to find the truth, compare the days of the Manifestation of the Beauty of Abha with the days of Christ; consider this is identically like that and the same doubts and oppositions are put forth (by the people).</p>
  
    <p id='2139'>As to the proofs and arguments of the Beauty of Abha, these are manifest like the sun. If thou wishest a discerning eye and seekest for a hearing ear, set thou aside that which thou hast heard from fathers and ancestors, for such things are imitation—and then seek for the truth with the utmost attention until the divine confirmation may reach thee and the matter may be properly disclosed unto thee. </p>

    <p id='2250'>As to thy vision, it is reality itself (it is what hath occurred). Whatever thou hast seen in the realm of vision is interpreted in the contraries and opposites, for laughter in the world of vision is weeping, and weeping, joy and happiness; death is longevity, and dangers, in certain cases, safety itself. Harm (in this wise) is helpfulness, and friendship, enmity and hatred. Therefore, thou shalt not kill the lamb; nay, rather thou shalt be the cause of the spread of His Name; thou shalt share a portion of His eternal life and attain a share of His infinite mercy. The impressions of the heart (the painful feelings of the heart), which were like the blows of a weapon, are interpreted to mean joy and happiness. I hope that thou mayest attain to all these.</p>

    <aside data-fnid='195'>To the New York City Board of Counsel.</aside>
  
    <p id='2264'>The detailed letter which you have written was received and it was read with the greatest attention. From the rose-garden of its significances a perfumed fragrance reached the nostrils and from its suggestions and statements traces of sincerity of intention became manifest.</p>
  
    <p id='2265'>Praise be to God!—that each one of that assembly is like unto a shining lamp, is ignited by the fire of the love of God, hath closed his eyes to the world and the inhabitants thereof, hath burned away the veils of superstitions and hath acquired the treasury of Truth. I have loosened my tongue to thank God for this gift at the Threshold of Oneness and praised and glorified the Incomparable God for His bounty, because He assisted those souls in the service of the Kingdom, and established such an assembly in New York that it will finally become a cause of the guidance of that continent.</p>
  
    <p id='2266'>You have written that there is a difference among the believers concerning the “Second Coming of Christ.” Praise be to God!—time and again this question hath arisen and its answer hath emanated in a clear and irrefutable text from the pen of Abdul-Baha that what is meant in the prophecies by the “Lord of Hosts,” <span data-pg='430' id='pg430'></span> the “Promised Christ” is the Blessed Perfection (Baha’o’llah) and His Highness the Supreme (the Bab). The faith of everyone must resolve around this palpable and evident text.</p>
  
    <p id='2267'>My name is Abdul-Baha, my identity is Abdul-Baha, my qualification is Abdul-Baha, my reality is Abdul-Baha, my praise is Abdul-Baha. Thraldom to the Blessed Perfection is my glorious and refulgent diadem; and servitude to all the human race is my perpetual religion. Through the bounty and favor of the Blessed Perfection, Abdul-Baha is the Ensign of the Most-Great-Peace, which is waving from the Supreme Apex; and through the gift of the Greatest name, he is the Lamp of Universal Salvation, which is shining with the light of the love of God. The Herald of the Kingdom is he, so that he may awaken the people of the East and of the West. The Voice of Friendship, Uprightness, Truth and Reconciliation is he, so as to cause acceleration throughout all regions. No name, no title, no mention, no commendation hath he nor will ever have except Abdul-Baha. This is my longing. This is my supreme apex. This is my greatest yearning. This is my eternal life. This is my everlasting glory! Express ye the same thing which is issued from my pen. This is the duty of all. Consequently the friends of God must assist and help Abdul-Baha in the adoration of the True One; in the servitude to the human race; in the well-being of the human world and in divine love and kindness.</p>
  
    <p id='2268'>O ye friends of God! Through the Appearance of the Blessed Perfection the theories are abrogated and the facts are established. The time of superficiality is <span data-pg='431' id='pg431'></span> gone by and the cycle of reality hath appeared. One must become the incarnation of Servitude, the personification of Love, the embodiment of Spirituality and the mirror of Mercy.</p>
  
    <p id='2269'>The believers must become the cause of life; deliver the people from heedlessness, call the souls to the perfection of humanity, beckon nations to unity and agreement, destroy the foundations of foreignness, make everyone as friends and associates, treat the negligent souls as their own children, and train and educate them with the utmost love—so that the ignorant become wise, the blind become endowed with sight, and the deaf be given hearing.</p>
  
    <p id='2270'>O ye friends of God! Beware! Beware of differences! By differences the Temple of God is razed to its very foundation, and by the blowing of the winds of disagreement the Blessed Tree is prevented from producing any fruit. By the intense cold of the diversity of opinions the rose-garden of Unity is withered, and the fire of the love of God is extinguished!</p>
  
    <p id='2271'>O ye friends of God! Abdul-Baha is the Manifestation of Thraldom and not “Christ.” The servant of the human realm is he, and not a “chief.” Nonexistent is he and not “Existent.” Pure nothingness is he and not “Eternal <a data-fnid='196'></a> .”</p>
    <aside data-fnid='196'>“In the Tablet in which I have stated ’I am not Christ and am not Eternal,’ the meaning is this, that I am not Christ—and not the Eternal Lord! But I am Abdul-Baha. This is its real purport. Undoubtedly those souls who are under the shadow of the Blessed Cause, believing and assured, firm and steadfast, and living in accord with the divine exhortations and advices, all of them are confirmed in the everlasting life.”—Abdul-Baha.</aside>
  
    <p id='2272'>There is no outcome or result to these discussions. We must put aside these disputes and controversies, nay, rather must we consign them to utter oblivion and <span data-pg='432' id='pg432'></span> arise to do that which is indispensable and which is demanded of us in this Day. Controversies are words and not significances, theories and not realities.</p>
  
    <p id='2273'>The quintessence of Truth is this: We must all become united and harmonized in order to illumine this gloomy world, to abolish the foundations of hostility and animosity from among mankind, to perfume the inhabitants of the universe with the holy fragrances of the nature and disposition of the Beauty of Abha, to enlighten the people of the East and West with the light of guidance, to hoist the tent of the love of God and suffer each and all to enter under its protection, to bestow comfort and tranquility to every one under the shade of the Divine Tree, to astonish the enemy by the manifestation of the utmost love, to make the ravenous and bloodthirsty wolves to be gazelles of the meadow of the love of God; to administer the taste of non-resistance to the tyrant, to teach long-suffering and resignation of the martyrs to the murderer, to spread the traces of Oneness, to chant the praises and glorification of the Glorious Lord, to raise the voice of “Ya Baha El-Abha!” to the Supreme Apex and to reach the ears of the inhabitants of the Kingdom with the outcry—“Verily the earth is illumined by the lights of its Lord!” This is reality! This is guidance! This is service! This is the consummation of the perfection of the realm of humanity!</p>
  
    <p id='2274'>O ye believers of God! Each person must summon the people to the Servitude of Abdul-Baha and not the Christhood; and no soul must either publicly or privately utter one word against or in contradiction to the general Teachings, and no one must believe that Abdul-Baha <span data-pg='433' id='pg433'></span> is the “Second Coming of Christ”, nay, rather he must believe that he is the Manifestation of Servitude, the Main-spring of the Unity of the human world, the Herald of the True One with spiritual power throughout all regions, the Commentator of the Book according to the divine text, and the Ransom to each one of the believers of God in the transitory world.</p>

    <p id='2287'>At a time when conditions were most difficult and oppressive and the reception or letters hard and impracticable, your letter was received. Therefore, its reception denoteth that the honorable assembly is confirmed. I hope from the bounties of His Highness the Incomparable One that under all circumstances and conditions ye may become assisted in the service of the Kingdom of God.</p>
  
    <p id='2288'>Ye have written regarding the erection of the Temple and the purchase of the ground, or the finding of a place to be as a home for the gathering of the believers. At this moment that Abdul-Baha is immersed in the ocean of calamities, this news caused him joy and happiness, that—praise be to God!—the friends and the maid-servants of the Merciful are thinking to serve the Kingdom of God.</p>
  
    <p id='2289'>O ye sanctified souls! It is the time of firmness and steadfastness and the period of arising in the service of the Word of God, for the Blessed City <a data-fnid='200'></a> is environed from all directions with the tempestuous waves of tests and trials and the sweeping hurricanes of persecutions <span data-pg='436' id='pg436'></span> and hardships are blowing and roaring high. The joy and happiness of the heart of Abdul-Baha depends upon the stability and constancy of the believers. For they must live and act in accord with the divine advices and exhortations and show forth to each other the power of the perfection of love with infinite accord and unity, so that they may become the embodiment of one existence, the waves of ones sea, the myrtles of one rose-garden, the rays of one sun, the stars of one horizon, the fruits of one tree and the birds of one meadow.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='200'>Acca.</aside>
  
    <p id='2290'>Likewise, they must treat with and behave toward all the governments, nations, communities, kings and subjects with the utmost sincerity, trustworthiness, straightforwardness, love and kindness. Even they must make hopeful a bloodthirsty enemy, show sympathy with the utmost faithfulness and honor to the perfidious unjust, know the ill-wisher as the well-wisher and torment not the sinner with reproaches. Should they become the targets of a thousand arrows of persecution, they must challenge it with love and friendship and treat every one with purity of purpose and kindness.</p>
  
    <p id='2291'>O ye friends of God! Show ye an endeavor that all the nations and communities of the world, even the enemies, put their trust, assurance and hope in you; that if a person falls into errors for a hundred-thousand times he may yet turn his face to you, hopeful that you will forgive his sins; for he must not become hopeless, neither grieved nor despondent. This is the conduct and the manner of the people of Baha’. This is the foundation of the most high pathway! Ye should conform your conduct and manners with the advices of Abdul-Baha. <span data-pg='437' id='pg437'></span></p>
  
    <p id='2292'>Concerning the erection of the Temple: Now all the believers must become united, so that the Temple may be built soon in one place. For should (the believers) undertake (the erection of the Temple) in many places, it will not become completed anywhere; and as in Chicago they have preceded every other place to plan the erection of the Temple, undoubtedly to cooperate and help them is nobler and a necessity. Then, when it is built in one place, it will become erected in many other places. If, for the present, you prepare or establish a home in New York, though by renting it, to become a center for the gathering of the believers of God, it is very acceptable. God willing, in all the states of America in the future there will be erected Temples with infinite architectural beauty, art, with pleasing proportion and handsome and attractive appearances; especially in New York. But for the present, be ye satisfied with a rented place.</p>
  
    <p id='2293'>The utmost happiness was produced by hearing the news of unity and agreement among the believers in New York; for the foundation of progress is union and when this object is attained, the Cause will develop.</p>

Any person whose insight is opened by God seeth the souls in their stations after the disintegration of the bodies. Verily they are living and are subsisting before their Lord and he seeth also the dead souls submerged in the gulfs of mortality. Then know thou verily all the souls are created according to the nature of God and all are in the state of (unconscious) purity at the time of their births. But afterward they differ from one another insofar as they acquire excellencies or defects. Nevertheless, the creatures have different degrees in existence insofar as the creation goes, for capacities are different, but all of them are good and pure (in their essence), then afterward they are polluted and defiled. Although there are different states of creation, yet all of them are beneficial. Glance thou over the temple of man, its members and its parts. Among them there are the eye, ear, nose, mouth, hands and fingers. Notwithstanding the differences between these organs, all of them are useful in their proper spheres. But if one of them is out of order, there is need of a remedy and if the medicine does not heal, then the amputation of that member becomes necessary.</p>
  
    <p id='2375'>Verily I beseech God to make thee confirmed under all circumstances. Do not become despondent, neither be thou sad. Ere long thy Lord shall make thee a sign of guidance among mankind. </p>

Verily this is better for thee under all circumstances! Verily thy Lord is gracious to His servants and He facilitates ere long every straight cause. But thou must submit to and rely upon God under all conditions and He will bestow upon thee that which is conducive to thy well-being. Verily He is merciful and compassionate! For how many an affair was involved in difficulty and then was straightened, and how many a problem was solved by the permission of God.</p>

This material rose, although it is beautiful and fragrant, yet it cannot be compared with the beauty of the friends. Great is the difference between this fragrance and that of the friends, between the scent of this rose and the fragrance of the love of God. That face of thine which attracts the hearts is far more beautiful and better than this rose, for with that beauty is accompanied illumination.</p>

    <p id='2404'>O thou who art firm in the Covenant!</p>
  
    <p id='2405'>Great joy was obtained on learning of the harmony and love of the friends. Communication with the friends of various parts is one of the greatest means for spreading the fragrances.</p>
  
    <p id='2406'>The place adjoining Washington, where, during the summer season, the maid-servant of God, Mrs. ….…., shall go, if it will not cause any disturbance and doth not become a means of talk among the enemies, the gathering of some of the friends there will be favorable. We must be considerate lest it may cause “sensation” among the people, for some people are weak and should be treated very quietly. However, the gathering of some of the friends there will be a cause of enkindling the fire of the love of God and the organization of a Bahai meeting will be harmless.</p>
  
    <p id='2407'>Every week two or three of the Washington friends should go to Baltimore and endeavor to help and encourage the friends there.</p>
  
    <p id='2408'>As to the seven qualifications (of the divinely enlightened soul) of which thou hast asked an explanation, it is as follows:</p>
  
    <p id='2409'>1. KNOWLEDGE. Man must attain the knowledge of God.</p>
  
    <p id='2410'>2. FAITH.</p>
  
    <p id='2411'>3. STEADFASTNESS.</p>
  
    <p id='2412'>4. TRUTHFULNESS. Truthfulness is the foundation of all the virtues of the world of humanity. Without truthfulness, progress and success in all of the worlds of God are impossible for a soul. When this holy attribute is established in man, all the divine qualities will also become realized. <span data-pg='460' id='pg460'></span></p>
  
    <p id='2413'>5. UPRIGHTNESS. And this is one of the greatest divine attainments.</p>
  
    <p id='2414'>6. FIDELITY. This is also a beautiful trait of the heavenly man.</p>
  
    <p id='2415'>7. EVANESCENCE OR HUMILITY. That is to say, man must become evanescent in God. Must forget his own selfish conditions that he may thus arise to the station of sacrifice. It should be to such a degree that if he sleep, it should not be for pleasure, but to rest the body in order to do better, to speak better, to explain more beautifully, to serve the servants of God and to prove the truths. When he remains awake, he should seek to be attentive, serve the Cause of God and sacrifice his own stations for those of God. When he attains to this station, the confirmations of the Holy Spirit will surely reach him, and man with this power can withstand all who inhabit the earth.</p>
  
    <p id='2416'>In regard to children, thou hast written that it is decided to train them in the teachings of God from childhood. This thought is very acceptable.</p>

    <p id='2419'>Thy letter, sent through the maid-servant, ….…., hath been received. Thou hast written concerning the changing of names. A name hath no importance, for a name must needs have a bearer (i.e., deserving a high name). That is to say, consider (people’s) morals and character, then consider the person himself and be attentive (to detect) one’s manners and conduct and consider his faith and assurance. If a person is illumined <span data-pg='461' id='pg461'></span> with the light of the love of God, he is (like unto) the morning star, even though his name be dark; and if he is a captive in the darkness of error, he is gloomy even though his name be that of a shining star. Consequently, be thou intent that thou makest thy face illumined with the light of the love of God, through the divine assistance and favor. This attribute will make thee independent of every name!</p>

    <p id='2428'>In another letter***thou hast expressed sorrow and grief concerning the events in the Holy Land. On the contrary, (these events) must cause joy, happiness and exultation, for this is the day of trial and the occasion for the manifestation of the secrets of the soul and heart. Have the utmost joy about the incidents in the Holy Land and do not consider from any other viewpoint; for the deluge of affliction is surrounding always the Holy Land and the sincere servant of the True One is like unto the enkindled lamp around about which the adverse winds blow. Therefore, you must engage in your own occupation, be familiar in spreading the fragrances of God and characterized in promulgating the Word of God. For instance, if you receive news that the Holy Land is entirely changed, you must not become relaxed at all; nay, rather you must become firmer, more steadfast and more attracted and more engaged in the service of the Kingdom. </p>

    <p id='2471'>This Feast was established by His Highness the Bab, to occur once in nineteen days. Likewise, the Blessed Perfection [Baha’o’llah] hath commanded, encourage and reiterated it. Therefore, it hath the utmost importance. Undoubtedly you must give the greatest attention to its establishment and raise it to the highest point of importance, so that it may become continual and constant. The believers of God must assemble and associate with each other in the utmost love, joy and fragrance. They must conduct themselves (in these Feasts) with the greatest dignity and consideration, chant divine verses, peruse instructive articles, read the Tablets of Abdul-Baha, encourage and inspire each other with love for the whole human race, invoke God with perfect joy and fragrance, sing the verses, glorifications and praises of the Self-subsistent Lord and deliver eloquent speeches. The owner of the house must personally serve the beloved <span data-pg='469' id='pg469'></span> ones. He must seek after the comfort of all and with the utmost humility he must show forth kindness to every one.

Now is the time when we restrict our discussion to the Most Great Luminary of Peace and Salvation in the Age, to talk of the Blessed Perfection [Baha’o’llah] and to voice His exhortations, behests and teachings. Buddha and Confucius were kings in bygone ages who have disappeared. <span data-pg='470' id='pg470'></span> Their sovereignty in this world is ended and their cycle is completed.

    <p id='2564'>O thou who art firm in the Covenant!</p>
  
    <p id='2565'>Thou hast asked regarding the phrase, “He is God!” written above the Tablets. By this Word it is intended that no one hath any access to the Invisible Essence. The way is barred and the road is impassable. In this world all men must turn their faces toward “Him-whom God-shall-Manifest.” He is the “Dawning-place of Divinity” and the “Manifestation of Deity.” He is the “Ultimate Goal,” the “Adored One” of all and the “Worshipped One” of all. Otherwise, whatever flashes through the mind is not that Essence of essences and the Reality of realities; nay, rather it is pure imagination <a data-fnid='222'></a> woven by man and is surrounded, not the surrounding. Consequently, it returns finally to the realm of suppositions and conjectures. </p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='“O God! O thou Attracted of the hearts of the favored…”'></h3>
  
    <p id='2566'>O God! O thou Attracted of the hearts of the favored ones toward the Manifest Horizon!</p>
  
    <p id='2567'>Verily, Thou art witnessing that the fire is ablaze in the breasts, the tears are streaming from the eyes and the period of patience and silence hath come to an end. The eyes of the beloved ones, O my God, are swimming in tears; the hearts of the yearning ones, O my Beloved, are wandering in the wilderness of Thy mercifulness; and the souls of the attracted ones, O my Desires, are afflicted with anguish on account of Thy separation!</p>
  
    <p id='2568'>Verily, they have heard Thy universal proclamation, <span data-pg='486' id='pg486'></span> O my God, and what Thou has revealed in the Koran: “Say! travel ye on earth, so that ye may behold the signs of the mercy of God.” thereupon, after Thy ascension, the people of faithfulness have arisen, traveling to distant lands and hastening to far and remote regions of the world, in order to cry out Thy Name, to remind the souls of the arrival of Thy days, to lead the minds to the fountain of Thy signs, to demonstrate to all the inhabitants of the world Thy proof and Thy religion, to guide the truth seekers to the right path and to indicate the straight highway to the strivers. From among them is Thy servant … who is firm in the Ancient Covenant, fleeing from the people of darkness, drinking from the water of eternal life and intoxicated with the wine which is overflowing from the divine cup. Verily, he hath left his native abode, waved the hand of farewell to his relatives, forsaken ease and comfort, hastened to strange and unknown kingdoms and accepted hardship and adversities while heralding Thy Name, commemorating Thy glorification, attracted to Thy beauty, stirred by the fragrances of Thy holiness, speaking Thy praises, voicing Thy Cause, guiding others to Thee, proving Thy religion, demonstrating Thy irrefutable truth, becoming an answerer to every questioning one and a guide to every one held in error!</p>
  
    <p id='2569'>O my Lord! O my Lord! Verily, he endured every affliction in Thy path and bore patiently every hardship and adversity in Thy love. A breath of rest hath he not breathed, neither hath his sought after any favor, abode or habitation in this world; nay, rather hath he walked in the footsteps of Thy most exalted Word, His <span data-pg='487' id='pg487'></span> Highness Christ, for he hath taken the stars for his lamp, the earth for his bed and the herbs for his food. Notwithstanding this, his cry was raised in the assemblages and his voice was heard in the meetings. The seekers flowed toward him and the thirsty ones hastened to drink from the water of his utterance. O my God! This is no other than through Thy generosity, Thy beneficence, Thy mercy and Thy favors. O my God! Help him by the hosts of the approximate angels, assist him by the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse amid Thy creatures, make him a lamp of guidance in that distant part of the earth and a luminary shining and sparkling from the dawning-place of faithfulness, in order that he may serve Thy holy threshold, falling prostrate upon the ground thanking and praising for Thy bounty, liberality and gifts to him; girding up his loins of endeavor in Thy service and becoming reinforced and empowered in Thy adoration!</p>
  
    <p id='2570'>O my Lord! O my Lord! Assign for him every bounty and suffer him to become the sign of Thy gifts amid Thy people. Then have pity upon me, forgive me, show me Thy mercy and make me a sharer in his services, a partner in his adversities and a companion in his loneliness.</p>
  
    <p id='2571'>Verily Thou art the Confirmer, the Assister, the Mighty, the Generous, the Compassionate and the Merciful! </p>

    <p id='2573'>Your letters have been received. God willing, answer will be given very soon, but as a matter of great importance is on foot (afloat), therefore I write it to <span data-pg='488' id='pg488'></span> you in brief and it is this, that his honor Mr. … must compose a letter of thanks on behalf of the believers of America in general and that letter of thanks should be addressed to a very eminent and lofty personage. (The contents of that letter must be of this nature:) “That excellent news hath reached American countries that His Royal Highness, the noble Prince, hath dealt with utmost justice with the subjects and the people and hath treated all the subjects with perfect equality. He hath protected the rights of all and forbidden the extortions of the tyrants. He is dealing with utmost kindness and affinity and is an asylum for every oppressed one and an open treasury to every indigent one. He decides with justice the case of every pleader and is a refuge and protection to the helpless. Consequently, we in general, who are the well-wishers of the government and Persian nation, with utmost gratification are praising and commending the justice of His Royal Highness, the Prince, and are content and glad; and in order to manifest our thanks we present this petition; and whatever in the line of service is commanded us, we are ready to comply with the most extreme diligence. We ask earnestly from God that the Imperial Government become everlasting, His Imperial Majesty, the just Shah, remain and live long, and His Royal Highness, the Prince, become to every subject a divine gift and that he may become confirmed and helped in all affairs.”</p>
  
    <p id='2574'>Let there be two copies of this petition and the more the believers sign each of these two copies, the better it is. Each person must sign personally. Then (when they are finished) you forward them here. We will <span data-pg='489' id='pg489'></span> write on them the address and forward to their destination. Wisdom does not permit the mentioning of the name of these two distinguished personages; therefore, it is better to be left unknown.</p>
  
    <p id='2575'>His honor Mr. … must compose these two petitions in English with utmost eloquence and perfect style. You, likewise, must translate them and forward them here with the translations.</p>
  
    <p id='2576'>Upon thee be greeting and praise! </p>

    <p id='2577'>O thou who art firm in the Covenant!</p>
  
    <p id='2578'>Now I have found the opportunity to answer the petitions recently received and forward them to you in this mail.</p>
  
    <p id='2579'>Regarding the subject of Persia: Praise be to God! she became the East of the Sun of Truth in this age. The Light of Eternity dawned, the Everlasting Glory unveiled her countenance and the Reality of the Mercifulness became manifest. This is the prosperity of Persia. Undoubtedly she will progress day by day under the shade of the Blessed Tree until her illumination shall penetrate throughout the wide expanse of the earth.</p>
  
    <p id='2580'>Regarding the question of the establishment of the National Assembly: This National Assembly <a data-fnid='223'></a> will not bring any rapid results. Now some of the agitators are harboring evil intentions and do not let agreement and union be realized between the nations and the government. They are instigating the hopeless ones at every moment and sending them to the British Legation, while on the other hand they ask private assistance and protection <span data-pg='490' id='pg490'></span> from the government so that they may procure wealth. Each and all of the clergy are thinking in this line.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='223'>Established Sept. 12, 1906.</aside>
  
    <p id='2581'>However, we have nothing to do with these proceedings and counter-proceedings. We are commanded to quicken the souls, to train the characters, to illumine the realm of man, to guide all the inhabitants of the earth, to create concord and unity among all men and to lead the world of humanity to the Fountain of the Everlasting Glory. The reformation of one empire is not our aim; nay, rather we invoke from God that all the regions of the world be reformed and cultivated; the republic of men become the manifestors of the bounty of the most glorious Lord; the East and the West be brought nearer together; and that Turk and Tajik, Iran and America, India and Arabia, Japan and Persia, China and Germany; in brief, all the nations and peoples of the world become as one soul and one spirit, in order that strife and warfare be entirely removed and the rancor and hostility disappear so that all become as the waves of one ocean, the drops of one sea, the flowers of one rose-garden, the trees of one orchard, the grains of one harvest and the plants of one meadow.</p>
  
    <p id='2582'>Regarding the statement that hath been given out as the saying of His Majesty the Shah: This hath no connection whatever with the Bahais; nay, rather it hath meant the Babis. Mirza Yahya, the son of Mirza Hadi of Doulet Abad, and a few souls of Ezelis <a data-fnid='224'></a> who are living in Teheran and were at one time secret friends of Jamal-ed-Din of Afghan, have allied themselves with the party, which is working against the government, <span data-pg='491' id='pg491'></span> and is engaged in the work of instigating and inciting the people. His Imperial Majesty did mean these souls, that is, the Babis, not the Bahais. But it is an established facts that the Bahais are the well-wishers of the nation and the government; are showing forth obedience and displaying good intentions; are not interfering in political matters; are engaged in the education and spiritualization of characters and are occupied with the training of the ignorant ones.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='224'>Followers of Subi-Ezel who disturbed the Babis by claiming to be the One promised by the Bab.</aside>
  
    <p id='2583'>O thou who art firm in the Covenant! The general historical report about the Cause of God in that country, <a data-fnid='225'></a> that thou hast forwarded to Menshadi, <a data-fnid='226'></a> became very acceptable. Undoubtedly you must, every few months, write a report about the general conditions and attitudes of the Cause of God in America and forward it to Acca, so that we may send it to Persia to be printed and spread among the people.</p>

    <aside data-fnid='226'>One of the well-known Bahais in Egypt.</aside>
  
    <p id='2584'>O thou yearning servant of the Beauty of Abha! In the time that all the ulemas and sages, leaders, merchants and traders, nay, even the public itself from the highest to the lowest have taken refuge in the British Legation and began to complain and clamor that they are oppressed, His Royal Highness Shoa-Us-Saltanah, the son of the Shah, cried in the Assembly of Nobles: “These ulemas and Sheite leaders were always stigmatizing the Bahais, saying, ‘They are the ill-wishers of the government and the corruptors of nations!’ Now consider ye with the eye of justice! Sixty years have rolled by and the Bahais have been the object of the sword of affliction and the target of the arrows of oppression. Thousands of houses have been destroyed, <span data-pg='492' id='pg492'></span> children became captives, women became prisoners, property was pillaged and not even a small children remained safe; yet, notwithstanding all of this, not one single Bahai took refuge under the flag of a foreign power! Now these Sheites, though they have always been treated with the utmost favor and benefit by the government, yet without the slightest reason they went under the protection of a foreign power and brought down such humiliation and dishonor upon the nation and the government! If they presented primarily their petitions to the government, their wishes would be complied with in a better and more effective way. This is the difference between the Sheites and the Bahais!” </p>

    <p id='2585'>O thou who art firm in the Covenant!</p>
  
    <p id='2586'>I have received the eloquent article which thou hast written at the moment of the arrival of the most great glad-tidings regarding the establishment of the National Assembly and the organization of the constitutional and judicial government of Persia according to the evident command of the Book of Akdas, and the spontaneous joy and the genuine sympathy demonstrated by the people of science and discernment in America at hearing this soul-refreshing news, and the utmost happiness to the members of the Legation. I read it and it became the cause of the utmost joy and fragrance.</p>
  
    <p id='2587'>The Constitutional Government, according to the irrefutable text of the Religion of God, is the cause of the glory and prosperity of the nation and the civilization and freedom of the people. However, according to what is known, the hands of the selfish leaders from among the ulemas (Mohammedan clergy) are in this <span data-pg='493' id='pg493'></span> affair. Outwardly they are desiring the establishment of the National Assembly and at every moment they are crying and clamoring (for its immediate realization), but inwardly they are sowing the seeds of corruption and agitation and try to put at naught the noble intention of the government. In the secret of their hearts and souls they do not favor the upbuilding of the National Assembly, the civilization of Persia, the awakening of the people, the advancement of the age, the spreading of knowledge and public instruction. Thieves like to lurk in darkness; fishers desire disturbed water; the bat shuns the rays of the sun; the black beetle dislikes the fragrance of the rose-garden; the ferocious wolf is in expectation of the sleet and snow; and the wine seller sees his advantage in the inebriate, irrational drinker. These leaders of religion also desire to behold the nation thrown into a weltering chaos of ignorance so that the rein of affairs remain in the hands of the arrogant ulemas. They know that if the nation began to adore wisdom, truthfulness, progression and fidelity, it would bring about their (the ulemas) degradation.</p>
  
    <p id='2588'>However, rest ye assured upon the favor and bounty of His Highness the Almighty; for the Imperial throne of Persia is confirmed and the Crown of the Sovereignty of the East is protected,. Undoubtedly the noble purpose of His Imperial Majesty will play an important role in the development of Persia. May God help and send victory from the Supreme Kingdom, the heavenly powers become supporters and the mercy and bestowal of His Highness the Merciful One become the Helpers! Be ye engaged in prayer that with the utmost good-pleasure <span data-pg='494' id='pg494'></span> the nation obey the government, comply with the wise counsels of the attendants of the central dominion, give no attention to the hearsay of the agitators and rise not to quarrel with and to protest against the government like unto the Russian Douma, so as to throw the whole empire, the nation and the kingdom into a sea of anarchy and lawlessness. Much prayer is needed so that God may help and protect.</p>
  
    <p id='2589'>The marks of kindness that thou hast shown to his honor Mr. … became highly acceptable. You must treat the strangers, at all times, in this manner and help, as far as possible, all the nations of the world.</p>
  
    <p id='2590'>O thou who art firm in the Covenant! Truly, I say, thou art firm and have arisen to perform the conditions of firmness. This very matter of his honor Mr. … is a sign of wonder to all men and the greatest proof of the power of the Word of God and the penetration of the servitude of Abdul-Baha. As thou art walking in this road and art steadfast in this path, know thou of a certainty that the assistance of Providence with descend upon thee and the confirmation of the Kingdom unveil herself to thee. </p>

    <p id='2591'>O thou who art firm in the Covenant!</p>
  
    <p id='2592'>An article in the Broadway Magazine of September, 1906, written by G. A. Dobson and published in New York, was read. It is entitled, “The Strangest Religion in New York.” Unquestionably, you get that magazine and read it. The writer complains of the Ottoman government and its treatmet towards the Bahai community. There is no doubt that this article will be read by His Excellency the Turkish Minister or the <span data-pg='495' id='pg495'></span> members of the Legation. The truth is that His Imperial Majesty the Sultan Abdul Hamid Khan hath exercised the utmost justice toward Abdul-Baha. Although the internal and external enemies entered into an alliance, wrote reports full of pure calumnies and baseless impositions, became themslves the complainers and witnesses, a body of examiners came from Constantinople for the investigation of the true situation and that committee of commissioners became united with the outside and inside enemies, ratifying all the impositions and adding to those some more important matters, yet His Imperial Majesty Abdul Hamid Khan—may God assist him! —acted with delilberation until it became known and evident that all these calumnies were founded upon rancor and hositility. Therefore, he hath treated us, until the present time, with the utmost justice and because of this treatment we are exceedingly happy. If there were any other king beside His Imperial Majesty Sultan Abdul Hamid Khan, he would exercise his autority in another way in the face of these unjust imputations and the conspiracies of the external and internal foes. Nevertheless, the justice and equity of the Sultan prevented the attacks of the enemies and the reports of the people of oppositions and falsehood from producing any effect. Therefore, all the friends must pray from their hearts in behalf of their Imperial Majesties the Padeshah of the Ottomans and the Shah of Persia. As in these days His Imperial Majesty Sultan Abdul Hamid Khan is in a state of illness and indisposition, therefore the believers of God, in meetings and assemblages, in private and public, but invoke from the Threshold of Oneness <span data-pg='496' id='pg496'></span> swift recovery for him. The friends and strangers must know and realize that all the believers of God have the utmost love for His Majesty the Padeshah of the Ottoman empire and that they are entreating for him protection and confirmation. </p>

    <p id='2593'>O thou who art firm in the Covenant!</p>
  
    <p id='2594'>The International Congress of Religions was organized this year <a data-fnid='227'></a> in the capital of Japan. Many souls hastened to that empire from different parts of the world, in order that they might talk of and discuss the principles of their own religions, each one longing to convert that assembly to his own religion and establish the validity of his own particular belief. This congress had under discussion the politics of the religions., In truth, it is a political affair and not the attraction of the heart, faith, advancement toward God nor enkindlement with the fire of the love of God. This congress will not produce a lasting effect, for it is essentially politico-religious. What is effective and conducive to the penetration of the Word of God and the attraction of hearts is the fragrances of holiness and the divine glad-tidings, which the members of the congress do not in the least comprehend.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='227'>During 1906.</aside>
  
    <p id='2595'>Consequently, if the believers of God go to that country—not to the congress—and through the power of the Word of God, the breath of the Holy Spirit, the reading of the verses of Oneness and associating with the individual inhabitants of that kingdom, undoubtedly untold and tremendous results will be realized and the sweet fragrance of the rose-garden of mysteries will <span data-pg='497' id='pg497'></span> perfume the nostrils of the people of those regions. It is significantly useful if some of the friends of God put forth and effort and hasten from America to those parts (Japan).</p>
  
    <p id='2596'>O thou servant of God! Unquestionably, through the manifestation of the Infinite Power in this glorious age, wonderful signs will appear in the world and great changes are seen in the present and promised in the future, for the Word of God is like unto the Spirit, and the contingent world like unto the embryo in the womb of the mother. Through the power of the Spirit such various changes and metamorphoses become apparent, transforming them from one form to another. Especially in Persia, through the power of the Word of God, wonderful signs will appear.</p>
  
    <p id='2597'>O thou servant of the True One! Though I had not the opportunity of reading one line of the paper * * * yet I read it with the utmost attention. Truly, I say, it was a superior paper and the details of the reception of the two great ambassadors in the house of the favored and attracted maid-servant of God, Miss …, became known. Such receptions are very acceptable and praiseworthy. You must all show forth the utmost consideration to these two ambassadors, neither do ye fall short in serving them in whatever manner possible.</p>
  
    <p id='2598'>It is very acceptable for you to present to them the excellent praises which the Blessed Perfection hath made in behalf of these two governments, the exhortations which He hath delivered for obedience to them and the prayers He hath written for the confirmation and protection of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. <span data-pg='498' id='pg498'></span> Likewise, the advices and recommendations that this servant (Abdul-Baha, himself) hath written in Tablets to Persia and America; also the irrefutable command that the Blessed Perfection hath given in Tablets that the believers must obey the kings with the utmost sincerity and fidelity, and He hath forbidden them to interfere at all with political problems. He hath even prohibited the believers from discussing political affairs.</p>
  
    <p id='2599'>Convey respectful greeting on my behalf to the favored maid-servant of God, Miss …, the the utmost kindness and announce to her: “These services and self-sacrifices of thine in the Kingdom of God are acceptable.”</p>

O blessed are we!”—and have beheld the reality of things in themselves, have discovered the mysteries of the Kingdom, were released from superstition and doubts, perceived the lights of Truth and became so intoxicated with the cup of the love of God, that, wholly forgetting themselves and the world while dancing, they ran with utmost joy and ecstasy to the city of Martyrdom, sacrificing their minds and their lives upon the altar of Love.</p>
  
    <p id='2621'>But those who were blinded became astonished and on account of these joyous acclamation were bewildered and beginning to cry, “Where is the light?” and said, “We do not behold any light, we do not see any rising sun! It is void of any truth! This is pure imagination!”</p>
  
    <p id='2622'>However, they have hastened bat-like in the darkness below the ground, and according to their own <span data-pg='503' id='pg503'></span> thoughts they have found a little comfort and tranquility. Nevertheless, it is yet the early dawn and the strength of the heat and the rays of the Sun of Truth have not yet made their torrid and complete impression. When it reacheth the zenith, the heat will interpenetrate with such great intensity that it will move and spur to the greatest velocity even the insects below the earth. Alhtough they are not able to behold the light, yet the penetration of the heat will move and agitate all of them.</p>
  
    <p id='2623'>Consequently, O ye friends of God, be ye thankful that in the Day of the Effulgence ye have turned your faces to the Orb of the regions and beheld the Lights! Ye have received a portion from the rays of Truth and are endowed with a share from the Everlasting Outpouring. Therefore, ye must not rest one minute, but thank Him for this bestowal.</p>
  
    <p id='2624'>Be ye not seated and silent! Diffuse the glad-tidings of the Kingdom far and wide to the ears, promulgate the Word of God, and put into practice the advices and covenants of God; that is, arise ye with such qualities and attributes that ye may continually bestow life to the body of the world, and nurse the infants of the universe up to the station of maturity and perfection. Enkindle with all your might in every meeting the light of the love of God, gladden and cheer every heart with the utmost loving-kindness, show forth your love to the strangers just as you show forth to your relations. If a soul is seeking to quarrel, ask ye for reconciliation; if he blame ye, praise [him]; if he give you a deadly poison, bestow ye an all-healing antidote; if he createth death, administer ye eternal life; if he <span data-pg='504' id='pg504'></span> becometh a thorn, change ye into roses and hyacinths. Perchance, though such deeds and words, this darkened world will become illuminated, this terrestrial universe will become transformed into a heavenly realm, and this satanic prison become a divine court; warfare and bloodshed be annihilated, and love and faithfulness hoist the tent of unity upon the apex of the world.</p>
  
    <p id='2625'>These are the results of the divine advices and exhortations, and the epitome of the teachings of the Bahai Cycle. </p>

Thou hast written that they have expelled thee from the church and thy friends are manifesting aversion toward thee. This is the beginning of thy trials. There are greater trials than these. Therefore, be thou not sad, nay rather, be thou happy and full of glad-tidings. There is no harm done if they have expelled thee from the church. Thou hast stepped into the Kingdom of God.

That church is of stone and cement, whereas this Holy of Holies is of overwhelming Light.</p>

I was exceedingly happy on account of the love of the maid-servant of God, Aseyeh, for thee. The advent of the prophets and the revelation of the Holy Books is intended to create love between souls and friendship between the inhabitants of the earth. Real love is impossible unless one turn his face towards God and be attracted to His Beauty. The maid-servants of the Merciful should love each other with heart and soul; for though there be many bodies, the spirit of the faith is one and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is universal. There is one Light but many lamps; there is one Wine but the glasses differ. So thou shouldst love with all thy heart and soul the maid-servants of the Merciful and associate with them in utmost affection in order that thou mayest realize divine happiness and behold the outpouring of mercy.</p>

    <p id='2670'>O thou seeker after Truth!</p>
  
    <p id='2671'>The question of the Trinity, since the time of His Holiness Christ until now, is the belief of the Christians, and to the present time all the learned among them are perplexed and confounded. All have confessed that the question is beyond the grasp of reason, for three cannot become one, nor one three. To unite these is impossible; it is either one or three. If we say the Essence of Divinity is divided, even in some aspects, division is one of the necessities of the contingent world and of generation, but the Ancient is holy (i.e., whole and indivisible). If we say that the Trinity was <span data-pg='513' id='pg513'></span> originally one and was later divided, change and transformation will be necessarily applied to the Essence of Oneness, and change and transformation are necessities of the contingent world and not of the Essence of Divinity. If we say this number is Ancient, three Ancients become necessary, and among the three some are distinguished which are also Ancients. In this wise five Ancients are the result, and among the five are those who are distinguished and thus nine Ancients become necessary, and so on ad infinitium.</p>
  
    <p id='2672'>Thus considered, Trinity is made a necessity, although the falsity of Trinity is evident. Furthermore, the signs of oneness are evident and plain in all existence. If thou shouldst gather all existent beings, thou wouldst be unable to find two alike in all states and qualities; of necessity there is a difference. Thus the signs of oneness are manifest and evident in all things. How much more is the Creator of all things!</p>
  
    <p id='2673'>But there are, in the Gospels, clear expressions indicative of Trinity; among them: “The Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father.” As Christians did not understand the meaning of this expression, their thoughts were scattered.</p>
  
    <p id='2674'>The reality of this question is as follows: Divine Oneness is proven and He revealeth Himself in the Holy Essences. The sun is one sun but manifesteth itself in different mirrors. If thou lookest into the mirror and seest the manifestation of the sun, thou wilt way, the sun is in the mirror and this sun manifest in the mirror is the same sun of the heavens; although two suns, yet in reality they are one. The sun hath not descended from its high and lofty station, it hath not <span data-pg='514' id='pg514'></span> taken up its abode in this mirror, but hath manifested itself therein.</p>
  
    <p id='2675'>The Christ reality was like unto a pure mirror and the Sun of Reality shone upon it from the Holy Horizon. Therefore, it became evident that the sun is one with regard to reality but manifesting itself in all mirrors.</p>

    <p id='2678'>The Supper of the Lord which His Highness the Spirit (Christ) ate with the apostles was a heavenly supper and not one of material bread and water, for material objects have no connection with spiritual objects. As at that time material food was also present, therefore the leaders of the religion of Christ thought that it was material food which was changed into spiritual food.</p>
  
    <p id='2679'>The proof that it was not material food is this: The apostles upon many occasions partook of material food with His Highness Christ, yet the supper of that night became designated as the “Lord’s Supper.” From this designation it is plain and evident that they ate heavenly food at that supper. That heavenly food consisted of the love of God, the knowledge of God, the mysteries of God and the bestowal of God. </p>

    <p id='2727'>The season of seclusion in quiet nooks is the season of winter when the cold and the winds increase. But during the spring, the wafting of gentle breezes, the passing of fragrances from the rose, the state of equilibrium in the atmosphere and the green hue of <span data-pg='521' id='pg521'></span> valleys and prairies, it is best for man to leave solitude and enjoy out-of-door blessings. Thus be thou happy in the commemoration of thy Lord.</p>
  
    <p id='2728'>Go out from the solitary place like unto a shining star blazing on its horizon. This is better for thee in the Kingdom of the Lord of the worlds. Thus, hearken unto the melodies of the birds of holiness, in the garden of fellowship, upon the branches of purity; to the murmuring of its waters, the rustling of the trees, the blowing of its breezes and the cooing of its doves. </p>

    <aside data-fnid='243'>To the Montreal (Canada) assembly.</aside>
  
    <p id='2807'>His honor Mr. … wrote a letter and in that letter he mentioned your names, asking divine favor on your behalf. While reading your names I opened my tongue in thanksgiving in the Threshold of Oneness, that he hath granted such favor and bestowed such providence. He guided the souls and pointed out to them the entrance to the Kingdom. Such confirmation deserveth thanks and praise, and such guidance is the most great bounty of His Highness the One.</p>
  
    <p id='2808'>Likewise, you must be engaged day and night, with all your soul and heart, in thanksgiving and the glorification of His Highness the Desired One who hath created you in such a glorious period, made you the manifestors of guidance in the Day of the Lord, imparted to you the insight and enkindled your souls and spirits with the fire of love. Today the grandeur, the majesty, the splendor and the magnitude of this station is not clear and manifest because it is the time of seed-sowing and <span data-pg='532' id='pg532'></span> the beginning of the planting of trees in the orchard of the Merciful One. When that seed is grown and the tree reacheth the time of its fruition, then many harvests shall be gathered and all regions and kingdoms shall be adorned with its blossoms and fruits.</p>
  
    <p id='2809'>Ere long the Adored One of this providence will become the Beloved of the assemblages of the world and the rays of the Sun of Truth will illumine every house, every place and corner. At that time the greatness and superiority of the friends of God will become evident and demonstrated.</p>
  
    <p id='2810'>Consider ye! In the day of His Highness Christ, the grandeur and majesty of their Holiness the Apostles, was not known. After three-hundred years the loftiness of the station and the exaltation of their attainment became manifest. Ere long the result of the deeds in this cycle of Baha’o’llah will appear and every one of the friends and the maid-servants will be crowned with a diadem whose splendid gems will radiate brilliancy and effulgence throughout cycles and ages.</p>
  
    <p id='2811'>Therefore, O ye servants of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful One, do ye not rest for one moment! Do ye not seek any composure! Do ye not wish for any rest and ease! Endeavor and make ye an effort with all your heart and soul to spread the fragrances of Paradise, to raise the eternal melody of the Kingdom of Abha, to establish the gathering of fellowship, to become assisted with the confirmations of the Holy Spirit; to clothe the temple of existence with a new garment; to bestow eternal life upon the reality of souls; to become a cause of the civilization of the <span data-pg='533' id='pg533'></span> human world; to characterize the bloodthirsty animals with the heavenly attributes and divine commemorations; to pacify the world with peace and salvation, and to adorn man with the favors of His Highness the Merciful One; that perchance ignorance, animosity and strangeness may be removed entirely from among the denizens of the world, and the Banner of Reconciliation, Freedom, Nobleness and Oneness be hoisted; for the chains of existence contain countless links, each connected with the other. This connection is the cause of the appearance of the invisible powers in the world of the visible.</p>
  
    <p id='2812'>O ye real friends! Make ye an effort that this universe may become another universe and this darkened world find a ray of the Sun of Truth and become luminous and refulgent.</p>
  
    <p id='2813'>I entreat God that this favor may be realized and this unending outpouring become manifest and apparent, and the friends of God be confirmed by every bounty. </p>

Service to the sons and the daughters of the Kingdom is the diadem of everlasting glory with which ye have crowned your heads, the garment of eternal sovereignty with which ye have adorned your bodies, and the throne of majesty and grandeur of heaven upon which ye sat. Abdul-Baha found the utmost rejoicing from that feast <span data-pg='534' id='pg534'></span> and he was a host in his heart and soul, praying and entreating at the Threshold of Oneness that the breaths of the Holy Spirit waft, the angels of mercy descend and the confirmations of the Kingdom of Abha surround you upon all sides.</p>

What a happy night that was, and what a blessed feast! It became conducive to the happiness of the people of the Supreme Concourse, and the cause of joy and bliss to the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Abha. I beg of God that He may assist and confirm you so that ye may bring about such feasts. </p>

    <p id='2823'>The letter was received and I became acquainted with its contents.</p>
  
    <p id='2824'>The Cause of Baha’o’llah is the same as the Cause of Christ. It is the same Temple and the same Foundation. Both of these are spiritual springtimes and seasons of the soul-refreshing awakening and the cause of the renovation of the life of mankind. The spring of this year is the same as the spring of last year. The origins and ends are the same. The sun of today is the sun of yesterday. In the coming of Christ, the divine teachings were given in accordance with the infancy of the human race. The teachings of Baha’o’llah have the same basic principles, but are according to the stage of the maturity of the world and the requirements of this illumined age.</p>
  
    <p id='2825'>O thou seeker of the Kingdom! Make thou an effort so that thou mayest partake from the spiritual Supper of the Lord. At that time every difficulty will become easy, and every trouble will be conducive to the tranquility of the heart and soul.</p>
  
    <p id='2826'>I supplicate God that thy spiritual sight be opened so that thou mayest behold the mysteries of the Kingdom <span data-pg='536' id='pg536'></span> and become the cause of ease, adornment, reconciliation, faithfulness and uprightness in the human world. </p>

The souls are dead; thou hast been quickened through the Spirit of Truth. The eyes are blind; thine eyes became bright by beholding the lights. The ears are deaf; thou hast heard the voice of the Merciful One.</p>
  
    <p id='2829'>Thou must express the utmost satisfaction and thanks to Mrs. …, for she hath guided thee and beckoned thee to the everlasting universe. For thee she desired perpetual glory and for thee she asked life eternal.

    <p id='2830'>O thou wooer of Truth and attracted one toward the Kingdom of God!</p>
  
    <p id='2831'>Thy detailed letter was received and its reading produced the utmost joy, for it was a glorious proof of the loftiness of thy aim and the exaltation of thine intention. Praise be to God! that thou art the well-wisher of the human world, art attracted to the Kingdom of Abha and art aspiring for the advancement of the realm of humanity. I hope that, through the instrumentality of these lofty thoughts, attractions of <span data-pg='537' id='pg537'></span> heart and heavenly glad-tidings, thou mayest become so illumined that, through the mildly beaming splendor of the love of God, thou mayest shine and gleam throughout centuries and cycles.</p>
  
    <p id='2832'>Thou hast written that thou art a student in the progressive spiritual school. Happy is thy condition! If the various progressive schools join themselves to the universal university of the Kingdom, such knowledge and sciences will be brought into light that man will see that the potentialities of the “Open Tablet” of existence are infinite; will realize that all the created things are as letters and words; will be instructed in the lessons of the degrees of significances; will perceive the signs of oneness in the primordial atoms of the earth; will hear the voice of the Lord of the Kingdom; will behold the confirmations of the Holy Spirit and will find such ecstasy and joy that, being unable to contain himself in the vast area of existence, he will prepare himself for the journey toward the Kingdom and will hasten to the immensity of the Realm of Might. As soon as a bird if fledged, it cannot keep itself on the ground; nay, rather it soareth up toward the Supreme Apex—except the birds whose feet are tied, whose wings are clipped and feathers broken and who are soiled with water and clay.</p>
  
    <p id='2833'>O thou seeker of Truth! The realm of the Kingdom is a unit. The only difference lies in this: That when the season of spring dawneth, a new and wonderful motion and rejuvenation is witnessed in all the existing things; the mountains and meadows are revived; the trees find freshness and delicacy and are clothed with radiant and bright leaves, blossoms and fruits. In a <span data-pg='538' id='pg538'></span> like manner the preceding Manifestations form an inseparable link with the subsequent dispensations; nay, rather they are identical with each other. Since the world is constantly developing itself, the rays become stronger, the outpouring becometh greater and the sun appeareth in the meridian orbit.</p>
  
    <p id='2834'>O thou yearner after the Kingdom! Each Manifestations is the heart of the world and the proficient Physician of every patient. The world of humanity is sick, but that skilled Physician hath the healing remedy and He bestoweth divine teachings, exhortations and advices which are the remedy of every ailment and the dressing for every wound. Undoubtedly, the wise physician discovereth the needs of the patient at every season and prescribeth medicine. Therefore, when thou wilt compare the teachings of the Beauty of Abha with the requisitions and necessities of the present time, thou wilt conclude that they are to the sick body of the world the swift healing antidote; nay, rather they are the remedy of everlasting health. The prescription of the proficient physicians of the past and the future will not be the same; nay, rather they will be in accord with the ailment of the patient. Although the medicine is changed, yet all of these are for the sole purpose of the healing of the sick. In former dispensations the sick body of the world could not bear the strong and overpowering remedies. That is why His Highness the Christ said: “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when He, the Spirit of the Comforter, who is sent by the Father, is come, He will guide you into all truth.” Therefore, in this age of lights, specific teachings have become universal, <span data-pg='539' id='pg539'></span> in order that the outpouring of the Merciful One environ both the East and the West, the oneness of the Kingdom of humanity become visible and the luminosity of truth enlighten the world of consciousness. The descent of the New Jerusalem is the heavenly religion which secures the prosperity of the human world and is the effulgence of the illumination of the realm of God. In reality Emmanuel was the forerunner of the second coming of His Highness the Christ and the herald of the path of the Kingdom.</p>
  
    <p id='2835'>This is self-evident that the letter is an organic member of the word. This membership denotes subordination; that is, the letter draws its life from the word and hath spiritual relationship with it and is accounted a part of it. The apostles were the Letters and His Highness Christ the Essence of the Word; and the significance of the Word, which is the Everlasting Outpouring, cast a splendor upon those Letters,. Since a Letter is a part of the Word itself, it is intrinsically identical with the Word.</p>
  
    <p id='2836'>I hope that thou shalt arise to perform all that which His Highness Emmanuel hath predicted. Know thou this of a certainty that thou shalt become assisted. The confirmations of the Holy Spirit are descending uninterruptedly. The power of the Word shall penetrate in such wise that the Letter will become the reflective mirror of the Sun of the Word, and the radiation of the lights of the Word shall illumine the whole earth. But the heavenly Jerusalem, which is established upon the Apex of the world and the Holy of Holies of the Almighty, which hath hoisted its banner, comprehendeth and includeth in it all the perfections and teachings of <span data-pg='540' id='pg540'></span> the former dispensations. Likewise, it is the herald of the oneness of the world of humanity, the ensign of universal peace, the spirit of eternal life, the lights of divine perfections, the surrounding bestowal of the realm of existence, the adornment and grandeur of the world of creation and the cause of the tranquility of human-kind.</p>
  
    <p id='2837'>Turn thy attention toward the holy Tablets. Read and reflect upon the Tablets of Ishraghat, Tajalliat, the Words of Paradise, the Glad-tidings, Tarazat and the Book of Akdas. <a data-fnid='246'></a> These divine teachings in this day are the remedy of the ailments of the world of man and the dressing for the wounded body of existence; they are the Spirit of Life, the Ark of Salvation, the Magnet of the Everlasting Glory and the penetrative power in the reality of man! </p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='“O thou dear wise man!…”'></h3>
  
    <p id='2838'>O thou dear wise man!</p>
  
    <p id='2839'>They letter *** was considered. Its contents were in the utmost of beauty and great joy was realized therefrom.</p>
  
    <p id='2840'>Thou hast asked “Is it possible that this new and living Cause is to take the place of the dead religion of England when there hath been organized certain sects who have arrived at high stations of spiritual knowledge and to exalted degrees of merciful powers, and have become distinguished in virtue from all predecessors; notwithstanding this, is it possible that this new Cause will attract the attention of such people to such a degree as to unite their hearts, and gather them under its over-shadowing protection?” <span data-pg='541' id='pg541'></span></p>
  
    <p id='2841'>O thou dear friend! Know thou that the Distinguished Individual of every age is according to the virtues of that age. The Distinguished Personage who was in the former cycle, His power and virtues were according to the former age, but in this brilliant age and divine cycle, the Noble Personage, the Radiant Star, the Distinguished One, will manifest with virtues which will eventually amaze the peoples, for He is in spiritual virtues and divine perfections loftier than all the Individuals; any, rather He is the Source of Divine Benediction and the Center of the Radiant Circle. He is certainly comprehensive. There is no doubt that He will reveal Himself to such a degree as to bring all under His over-shadowing shelter.</p>
  
    <p id='2842'>When thou considerest carefully thou wilt find this order and system to be established in all things. The whole attracted the part, and the center of the circle is the axis of the compass. Consider His Holiness the Spirit (Christ): Since He was the Center of spiritual power and the Origin of divine benediction, although in the beginning He gathered but few under His power, yet later through that conquering power, He ushered all sects under the shadow of the Christian tabernacle. Compare the present with the past, see the great difference. By this thou canst measure and reach the reality and know for a certainty that the difference among the sects of the world is due to the difference of comprehensions. As long as the perceptive powers differ, surely the opinions and thoughts also differ. But if One Great Perceptive Power which comprehendeth all, cometh to the Center, the differing opinions become united, and ideal unity and oneness are revealed. <span data-pg='542' id='pg542'></span></p>
  
    <p id='2843'>For example: When His Holiness, the Spirit (Jesus Christ) appeared, the comprehensions of the creatures, the susceptibilities and minds of the sects then present, such as the Romans, the Greeks, Assyrians and Israelites were different. When the universal power of the Spirit of God appeared in the Center, eventually after three-hundred years, all the differing minds gathered under the protection of One Center. The same spiritual susceptibilities were attained.</p>
  
    <p id='2844'>For the sake of illustration (literally, likeness), I will say: When an army is under the command of generals who have differing opinions, certainly it will disagree in regard to maneuvers and in the order of marching to the battlefields. But when the great commander-in-chief who is expert in the arts of warfare cometh to the front, all the differing opinions will be erased and one opinion will prevail; the commander-in-chief will bring all under his own direction. This is an instance and not a likeness.</p>
  
    <p id='2845'>Now if thou shouldest say, the generals of this army are every one artists in the art of warfare, expert and experienced, why should they obey one person, even though he may have accomplished a great feat—this saying does not deserve attention, for this matter is certain and there is no doubt therein.</p>
  
    <p id='2846'>Likewise the Holy Manifestations, especially the reality of the Greatest Name, the Beauty of Abha, when unveiled amid the assemblage of the world, like unto Joseph of Canaan, in the divine Egypt, will appear with such Beauty and Sweetness as to make the lovers of the world His captives. <span data-pg='543' id='pg543'></span></p>
  
    <p id='2847'>As to the souls who are born into this world radiant entities and who through excessive difficulty are deprived of great benefits and thus leave the world—they are worthy of all sympathy, for in reality this is worthy of regret. It is for this purpose (that is, it is with regard to this wisdom) that the great Manifestations (of God) unveil themselves in this world, bear every difficulty and ordeal—to make these ready souls dawnings of light and confer upon them eternal life. This is the real atonement that His Holiness Christ made—He sacrificed Himself for the life of the world.</p>
  
    <p id='2848'>As to the question that the holy and spiritual souls influence, help and guide the creatures after they have cast off this elemental mould—this is an established truth of the Bahais. Nay even the Holy Manifestations of God extend a great Bounty and an evident Light after their ascent from this world. For His Holiness Christ there was more and greater promotion of the Word, manifestation of divine power, conversion of holy souls, and the giving of eternal life, after [His] martyrdom. Likewise for the Blessed Beauty (Baha’o’llah) there was greater bounty and dawning of light, manifestation of divine power, and effectiveness of the Word after His Ascent; and ere long the Sun of His Reality will encircle the world with its motion, heat, radiation and bounty.</p>
  
    <p id='2849'>Be not sorry on account of the limited extent of the progress of the Bahai Cause in that country <a data-fnid='247'></a> . This is the beginning of the dawn. Consider the Cause of His Holiness Christ, which took three-hundred years to produce great effect. Now sixty years have not passed <span data-pg='544' id='pg544'></span> since the beginning of this Cause, and Its Lights are shed upon all horizons.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='247'>England.</aside>
  
    <p id='2850'>Regarding the Society for healing of which thou art of a member; when it comes under the protection of this Cause, its power will be an hundred fold.</p>
  
    <p id='2851'>Thou hast observed how extensive is the love of the Bahais and that the foundation is love. As the power of love among the Bahais is in the utmost degree and superior to that in other religions, it is even the same in other relations, for the cause of all is Love.</p>
  
    <p id='2852'>As to the question of translating the Books and Tablets of the Blessed Beauty; it will soon be done in all languages with the utmost of eloquence and excellence. When the Tablets of His Holiness (Baha’o’llah) are translated in accordance with the original, with excellence and eloquence, then the Lights of Significances will dawn and brighten all the eyes. Endeavor thou with all thy power to make the translation as the original.</p>
  
    <p id='2853'>The Blessed Beauty went to Haifa many times, and thou hast seen Him. <a data-fnid='248'></a> I hope thou mayest attain the real meeting and that is the witnessing with the eye of insight and not of sight.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='248'>While in Haifa, some years ago, before he became a believer, the recipient of this Tablet saw Baha’o’llah and some of the followers and was attracted to Him, but owing to circumstances had no means of communicating with Him at that time.</aside>
  
    <p id='2854'>The essence of the teachings of His Holiness Baha’o’llah is Universal Love, which comprehendeth all the virtues of the world of humanity, is the cause of eternal life and of the progress of all the individuals of the human race. Soon thou wilt see that these <span data-pg='545' id='pg545'></span> heavenly teachings, like unto the light of reality, will envelope and enlighten the world.</p>
  
    <p id='2855'>The short prayer which thou hast written at the end of thy letter is in reality original, beautiful, sweet and effective. Chant it always. </p>

    <p id='2867'>The letter which thou hast written to … was received and its contents became known. If thou <span data-pg='547' id='pg547'></span> ask my name and title, it is Abdul-Baha and any name beside this is unknown here. Whosoever calleth me by this name, accept from him—otherwise reject.</p>
  
    <p id='2868'>But about the three questions which thou hast asked for thyself: The first is true. Undoubtedly, when a soul engages in commemoration of the True One, he will naturally feel the rest of soul and tranquility of heart.</p>
  
    <p id='2869'>The second question about the supernatural power: Without advancing toward the Kingdom of Abha, it is impossible and inaccessible. But should a soul enter under the shadow of the Blessed Perfection, step into the divine Kingdom, act according to the councils and exhortations of God and practice the New Teachings, unquestionably he will become endowed with a supernatural power.</p>
  
    <p id='2870'>But about thy third question: “Have I been subjected to such troubles and vicissitudes before?” and the indisputable answer, “No!”—this is also true.</p>
  
    <p id='2871'>For any soul who walketh in the path of guidance, there is no doubt he shall endure hardships. Consider thou their Highness the Apostles; likewise the Assembly of Christians, who were sanctified souls; what calamities and persecutions hailed them in the Cause during the first and second century and even up to the third century!</p>
  
    <p id='2872'>Look thou around the world of existence: A little worldly transaction cannot be brought about except through surmounting many an obstacle. How much more important are the objects of the Supreme World! Certainly there existeth troubles, trials, afflictions, persecution, censure and contempt. When thou didst occupy <span data-pg='548' id='pg548'></span> thy time in the past to give out religious exhortations and advices, thou experienced some persecutions and trouble. But thou canst not realize in this present moment what great ordeals are in store and what unbearable calamities, affliction and adversity exist, and that to give up life is the easiest of all those calamities. But the end of all these is bliss, overflowing joy, everlasting exultation, happiness and supreme contentment. it is eternal life, never ending glory, a lordly gift and divine sovereignty!</p>
  
    <p id='2873'>In brief, thou hast asked concerning my desire for thee: I wish, if thou art worldly, to become heavenly; if thou art of the world of possession, become thou celestial; if thou art of the material sphere, become an inhabitant of the realm of Light; hasten from the world of darkness to the world of illumination and become the manifestor of the exhortations, advices and instructions of the Blessed Perfection. This is my greatest desire for thee. </p>

    <p id='2875'>Your letter was received and its contents became known. The new Kingdom hath raised its tents in all regions and hath enveloped East and West, but the blind ones cannot see and the deaf ones cannot hear. In the time of Christ, the doors of the divine Kingdom were opened, but the people, being veiled, were negligent and in a deep sleep. Therefore, they were deprived of the spiritual glory. Now, thank ye God that ye have found the way to the Kingdom of peace and salvation and have heard the call of the True One. <span data-pg='549' id='pg549'></span></p>

    <p id='2878'>O thou dear friend!</p>
  
    <p id='2879'>Although a person of good deeds is acceptable at the Threshold of the Almighty, yet it is first “to know,” and then “to do.” Although a blind man produceth a most wonderful and exquisite art, yet he is deprived of seeing it. Consider how most animals labor for man, draw loads and facilitate travel; yet, as they are ignorant, they receive no reward for this toil and labor. The cloud raineth, roses and hyacinths grow; the plain and meadow, the garden and trees become green and blossom; yet they do not realize the results and outcome of all these. The lamp is lighted, but as it hath not a conscious knowledge of itself, no one hath become glad because of it. Moreover, a soul of excellent deeds and good manners will undoubtedly advance from whatever horizon he beholdeth the lights radiating. Herein lies the difference: By faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds.</p>
  
    <p id='2880'>Thou hast asked concerning reincarnation: Reincarnation as understood by the people, is untrue; but in the Gospel, “return” is referred to, and that is the return of qualities <a data-fnid='250'></a> and not the return of entities. This <span data-pg='550' id='pg550'></span> matter is explained in detail in the Book of Ighan, which is translated and published. Study that Book.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='250'>I.e., the return of the qualities, powers and attributes in another human being.</aside>
  
    <p id='2881'>But the difference between Christ and others is this: Christ was the Spirit, others were bodies; Christ was the Sun, others were mirrors; Christ was the Truth and was bestowing eternal life, others were dead and imparting deadness and negligence.</p>
  
    <p id='2882'>Thou hast asked concerning the spirits of men: They are not at all annihilated—they are immortal. <a data-fnid='251'></a> The spirits of heavenly souls will find eternal life, that is, they will attain the highest and most great stations of perfection; but the spirits of the heedless souls, although they are eternal, yet they are in a world of imperfection, concealment and ignorance. This is a concise answer. Contemplate and meditate upon it, in order that thou mayest comprehend the reality of the mysteries in detail. For instance: No matter how much the mineral has an existence and life, yet in comparison to man, it is entirely non-existent and deprived of life. For where man is translated from life to death, his comparative station will be that of a mineral existence. </p>
    <aside data-fnid='251'>I.e., in the sense of continued existence after the death of the body.</aside>

    <p id='2958'>All the people have formed a god in the world of thought, and that form of their own imagination they worship; when the fact is that the imagined form is finite and the human mind is infinite. <a data-fnid='261'></a> Surely the infinite is greater than the finite, for imagination is accidental (or non-essential) while the mind is essential; surely the essential is greater than the accidental.</p>

Another translation of this paragraph is as follows: “All the people have formed a god in the world of thought and they worship that form of their own imagination, while the fact is that the imagined concept is comprehended by the mind which is comprehensive. Surely that which comprehends is greater than the comprehended, for imagination is accidental (non-essential), while the mind is essential. Surely the essential is greater than the accidental.”</aside>
  
    <p id='2959'>Therefore consider: All the sects and peoples worship their own thought; they create a god in their own minds and acknowledge him to be the creator of all things, when that form is superstition—thus people adore and worship imagination (or illusion).</p>

Within the capacity of comprehension of a produced (or created) reality that Ancient Reality cannot be contained. It is a different world; from it there is no information; arrival thereat is impossible; attainment thereto is prohibited and inaccessible. This much is known: It exists and Its existence is certain and proven—but the condition is unknown.</p>
  
    <p id='2961'>All the philosophers and the doctors knew that It is, but they were perplexed in the comprehension of Its existence and were at last discouraged, and in great <span data-pg='563' id='pg563'></span> despair they left this world. For the comprehension of the condition and mysteries of that Reality of realities and Mystery of mysteries there is need for another power and another sense. That power and sense is not possessed by mankind, therefore they have not found any information. For example: If a man possess the power of hearing, the power of tasting, the power of smelling and the power of feeling, but no power of seeing, he cannot see. Hence, through the powers and senses present in man the realization of the Unseen Reality, which is pure and holy above the reach of doubts, is impossible. Other powers are needed and other senses required. If those powers and senses are obtained, then information can be had; otherwise, not.</p>

    <p id='2969'>Japan hath made wonderful progress in material civilization, but she will become perfect when she also becometh spiritually developed and the power of the Kingdom becometh manifest in her.</p>
  
    <p id='2970'>One will encounter a little difficulty in the beginning of the establishment of the Cause of God in that country, but later it will become very easy, for the inhabitants of Japan are intelligent, sagacious and have the power of rapid assimilation.</p>
  
    <p id='2971'>For the present, a perfect youth like thee is favored by the bounty of the Kingdom and hath attained to the knowledge of the Lord of the Kingdom. Show thou forth an effort that thou mayest finish that which is necessary in the acquisition and study of science and art; then travel thou toward the countries of Japan, so that thou mayest hoist the Ensign of Truth waving from the apex of the Supreme Concourse. Look thou not upon thine own capability; the invisible divine confirmations <span data-pg='565' id='pg565'></span> are great and the protection and providence of the Beauty of Abha is the helper and the assistant. When a drop draws help from the ocean, it is an ocean in itself, and a little seed, through the outpouring of rain, the favor of the sun and the soul-refreshing breeze, will become a tree with the utmost freshness, full of leaves, blossoms and fruits.

    <p id='2977'>“Perfume Thou the East! Illumine Thou the West! Bestow Thou light to the North! Grant Thou life to the South!”</p>
  
    <p id='2978'>This verse hath been revealed from the lips of the Center of the Covenant one year after the departure <a data-fnid='266'></a> of Baha’o’llah. But the nakazeen (not understanding its spiritual purport) wondered and derided. Praise be to God! that now its signs have become manifest, its power evident, and its proof plain.

    <aside data-fnid='266'>Departure, i.e., death—which occurred May 29, 1892.</aside>
  
    <p id='2979'>The Blessed Perfection, in a clear text, hath promised us in the Book: “Verily I behold you from the Horizon of Abha and will make victorious whomsoever will arise in the service of my cause with the hosts of the Supreme Concourse and the cohorts of the favored angels!” Praise be to God! that this victory and confirmation became visible and manifest and hath shone forth from the horizon of the world like unto the sun.</p>
  
    <p id='2980'>Therefore, O ye friends of God! Show ye forth an earnest endeavor and display ye a resolute effort, so that ye may become assisted in the adoration of the Ancient Beauty and the Manifest Light; to be the cause of spreading the light of the Sun of Truth; to infuse into the dead, antiquated body of the world a new spirit; to cast in the fields of the hearts pure seeds; to arise in the service of the Cause; to speak with eloquent <span data-pg='567' id='pg567'></span> tongues; to become candles of guidance in the assemblage of the world; to become shining stars in the horizon of the existent being; to become merciful birds in the rose-garden of oneness; to sing the melodies of realities and significances; to spend every breath of your lives in the most great Cause; and to devote the period of your existence to the service of this conspicuous Light; so that in the end ye may be freed from loss and failure and attain to the inexhaustible treasury of the Kingdom. For the life on man is wholly subject to danger and impermanency. A person cannot put his assurance even in one moment’s continuity. Notwithstanding this, the nations of the world, deceived by the mirage of superstition, imagine themselves secure in the heavenly way. Alas! Alas! Former communities in bygone ages entertained the same perishing thoughts; but by one of those periodical fluctuations they were all hidden under the ground and afflicted with deprivation and loss, except those souls who had become pure evanescence and had arisen with great self-abnegation in the path of God. Such souls shine forth as brilliant stars from the Horizon of the Ancient Glory, and the results which emanated from their lives in succeeding ages and cycles are the proofs of this statement. Therefore, do ye not rest, neither day nor night; seek ye not for composure; talk ye of the mystery of servitude, and seek ye the path of thralldom; so that through the promised confirmations ye may become assisted from the Kingdom of Oneness.</p>
  
    <p id='2981'>O ye friends! Dense and gloomy clouds have covered the horizon of the world, and the darkness of hatred, malignity, persecution, tyranny, and the greatest <span data-pg='568' id='pg568'></span> cruelty is spreading. All the people are drunk with the wine of heedlessness; and blood-thirstiness and rapaciousness are considered the noblest excellencies of the world of men.</p>
  
    <p id='2982'>His Highness the Almighty hath chosen the friends from among the concourse of men and hath especialized them with the most eminent guidance and the highest gift; so that we may with our souls and hearts exert ourselves, sacrifice our lives, be engaged in the guidance of the people and the training of souls; so that the wild beasts may become the gazelles of the meadows of unity; the wolves the sheep of God; the bloodthirsty ones the heavenly angels; the fire of malice be extinguished and the flame of safety in the blessed tabernacle bestow illumination; the odor of the nether realm of infidelity be dispelled and the fragrances of the rose-garden of faithfulness be diffused in all parts; the weak draw light from the Universal Reason and evil souls seek to be purified with the holy and divine Breath. There are needed manifestors for this gift; farmers for this field; gardeners for this rose-garden; fishers for this sea; luminous stars for this heaven; spiritual physicians for these ill ones, and loving guides for these wanderers; so that they may bestow a share to those who are deprived, grant a portion to those who are shareless, give unmeasured treasure to the indigent ones, and show forth the power of proof to the seekers. </p>

    <p id='3003'>O ye beloved ones of Abdul-Baha! This servant longeth to write a special Tablet to each one of the <span data-pg='572' id='pg572'></span> friends of God—but what can be done! For there is neither opportunity nor time. The affairs are like unto the waves, and the requirements are like unto the vernal showers. I do not rest a moment, neither do I have leisure for an instant. Letters are received every day from all the regions and it is impossible and impracticable to answer one among ten; yet there is no other mode than to answer the letters which are the most important, for the urgent affairs must be attended to. Therefore, I request the pardon and ask the forgiveness of the friends, that they may overlook these shortcomings and be content and happy with that which is possible.</p>
  
    <p id='3004'>O ye friends of Abdul-Baha! The East is illumined, the West is perfumed and the world is in motion and acceleration. Such a tumult is visible in the regions; and such a spiritual commotion is perceived in the pillars of the earth! The fame of the grandeur of the Word of God hath reached the ears of the inhabitants of the world, and the voice of the Cause of God holdeth universal sway! It is the time for joy and happiness and the moment of exhileration and ecstasy. One must live in accord with the exhortations and advices of the Blessed Perfection and behave with such deeds and actions as to become conducive to the illumination of the world and the manifestion of mercifulness among the nations.</p>
  
    <p id='3005'>All the denizens of the earth, the communities and the people have taken an axe in their hands to uproot the life-tree of each other; they are blood-thirsty and the instigators of corruption; they are armed to the teeth with destructive implements; each seeketh the <span data-pg='573' id='pg573'></span> death and annihilation of the other. But the heavenly power, the divine energy and the celestial hand of strength, hath raised the canopy of the oneness of the realm of humanity on the pinnacle of the contingent being and hoisted the standard of the most great peace, friendship, love, uprightness and the adoration of truth. The friends are the servants of this canopy and the beloved are the hosts of this standard. Therefore they must with one accord arise to that which is the requirement and the merit of this day, become overflowing with joy and beatitude, perfume the nostrils with the fragrances, sweeten the tastes with the honey and delicacy of love, become the signs of guidance, be the glad-tidings of the Supreme Concourse and the army of the Kingdom of Abha; so that they may destroy the edifice of war and bloodshed, efface the traces of battle and strife from the face of the earth, uproot the tree of foreignness and plant the tree of unity in the rose-garden of the regions, extinguish the fire of hatred and animosity and set in motion the sea of love and affinity, erase the traces of discord from the Tablet of the earth and register thereon the verses of concord, clear the field of existence from the thorns and brambles of hostilities and ill-feeling and adorn it with the hyacinths and anemones of harmony, train and educate the souls and loosen the tongue in the delivery of the instructions and teachings of the Blessed Perfection! </p>

    <p id='3012'>O ye friends of God! According to what is heard, some of the friends have celebrated my birthday in some countries on the fifth of Zamadi-Avval (23rd day of May). Although their intention is no other than good, their aim be to promote the Word of God and to commemorate the True One among the people in this manner, yet, according to the text of the Religion of God and the irrefutable command, the fifth of Zamadi-Avval (May 23rd) is the day of the Declaration of His Highness the Supreme (the Bab)—may my life be a sacrifice to Him! Consequently, they must celebrate and adorn that Blessed Day in the name of the Declaration of that Orb of regions; make rejoicing and happiness, and impart the glad-tidings of heavenly beatitude to each other. For that holy essence was the Herald <span data-pg='576' id='pg576'></span> of the Most Great Name. Therefore, no one must mention that day of the fifth of Zamadi-Avval (May 23rd) except as the Day of the Declaration of His Highness the Bab. This is the unquestionable text of the Religion of God.</p>
  
    <p id='3013'>Regarding the birth of this servant, which also happened on that day, this is a proof of the favors and bounties of God toward this servant.

You must on this account be engaged in rejoicing, happiness and gladness. This is the truth! Beware! Beware! that you avoid that which is mentioned; otherwise, it will cause the utmost grief to the heart of Abdul-Baha.</p>
  
    <p id='3014'>I ask from the inexhaustible bounties of His Highness the Almighty, that the righteous ones become assisted to live in accord with the Religion of God; neither do they deviate a hair’s breadth therefrom; and spread this Tablet throughout all regions, so that all the friends may comprehend the truth and act accordingly. </p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='“O ye beloved of God and maid-servants of the Merciful!…”'></h3>
  
    <p id='3015'>O ye beloved of God and maid-servants of the Merciful!</p>
  
    <p id='3016'>The republic of wise men believes that the difference in minds and opinions is due to the difference of education and the acquisition of ethics. That is, that minds are equal in origin, but education and the acquisition of ethics cause minds to differ and comprehensions to be at variance; that this difference is not in entity but in education and teaching; that there is no individual distinction <span data-pg='577' id='pg577'></span> for any soul. Hence, the members of the human race all possess the capacity of attaining to the highest station, and the proof they adduce therefor is this: “The inhabitants of a country like Africa are all as wandering savages and wild animals; they lack intelligence and knowledge; all are uncivilized; not one civilized and wise man is to be found among them. On the contrary, consider the civilized countries, the inhabitants of which are living in the highest state of culture and ethics, solidarity and inter-dependence; possessing, with few exceptions, acute power of comprehensions and sound mind. Therefore, it is made clear and evident that the superiority and inferiority of minds and comprehensions arises from education and cultivation, or from their lack and absence. A bent branch is straightened by training and the wild fruit of the jungle is made the product of the orchard. An ignorant man by learning becomes knowing, and the world of savagery, through the bounty of a wise educator, is changed into a civilized kingdom. The sick is healed by medication, and the poor man, by learning the arts of commerce, is made rich. The follower, by attaining the virtues of the leader, becomes great, and the lowly man, by the education of the teacher, rises from the nadir of oblivion to the zenith of celebrity.” These are the proofs of the wise men.</p>
  
    <p id='3017'>The prophets also acknowledge this opinion, to wit: That education hath a great effect upon the human race, but they declare that minds and comprehensions are originally different. And this matter is self-evident; it cannot be refuted. We see that certain children of the same age, nativity and race, nay, from the same <span data-pg='578' id='pg578'></span> household, under the tutorship of one teacher, differ in their minds and comprehensions. One advanceth rapidly, another is slow in catching the rays of culture, still another remaineth in the lowest degree of stupidity.</p>
  
    <p id='3018'>No matter how much the shell is educated (or polished), it can never become the radiant pearl. The black stone will not become the world illumining gem. The calocynth <a data-fnid='268'></a> and the thorny cactus can never by training and development become the blessed tree. That is to say, training doth not change the human gem (i.e., human nature or entity), but it produceth a marvelous effect. By this effective power all that is registered latent of virtues and capacities in the human reality will be revealed.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='268'>Cucumis calocynthis.</aside>
  
    <p id='3019'>Cultivation by the farmer maketh of the grain the harvest, and the effort of the gardener maketh of the seed a noble tree. The gentle teacher promoteth the children of the school to the lofty altitude and the bestowal of the trainer placeth the little child upon the throne of ether. Therefore, it is demonstrated and proven that minds are different in the original entity or nature, and that education commandeth a decided and great influence. Were there no educator, all souls would remain savage, and were it not for the teacher, the children would be ignorant creatures.</p>
  
    <p id='3020'>It is for this reason that, in this New Cycle, education and training are recorded in the Book of God as obligatory and not voluntary. That is, it is enjoined upon the father and mother, as a duty, to strive with all effort to train the daughter and the son, to nurse them from the breast of knowledge and to rear them in <span data-pg='579' id='pg579'></span> the bosom of sciences and arts. Should they neglect this matter, they shall, be held responsible and worthy of reproach in the presence of the stern Lord.</p>
  
    <p id='3021'>This is a sin unpardonable, for they have made that poor babe a wanderer in the Sahara of ignorance, unfortunate and tormented; to remain during a lifetime a captive of ignorance and pride, negligent and without discernment. Verily, if that babe depart from this world at the age of infancy, it is sweeter and better. In this sense, death is better than life; deprivation than salvation; non-existence lovelier than existence; the grave better than the spacious, regal home; for in the sight of mankind that child is abased and degraded and in the sight of God weak and defective. In gatherings it is ashamed and humiliated and in the arena of examination subdued and defeated by young and old. What a mistake is this! What an everlasting humiliation!</p>
  
    <p id='3022'>Therefore, the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful must train their children with life and heart and teach them in the school of virtue and perfection. They must not be lax in the matter; they must not be inefficient. Truly, if a babe did not live at all it were better than to let it grow ignorant, for that innocent babe, in later life, would become afflicted with innumerable defects, responsible to and questioned by God, reproached and rejected by the people. What a sin this would be and what an omission!</p>
  
    <p id='3023'>The first duty of the beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful is this: They must strive by all possible means to educate both sexes, male and female; <span data-pg='580' id='pg580'></span> girls like boys; there is no difference whatsoever between them. The ignorance of both is blameworthy, and negligence in both cases is reprovable. “Are they who know and they who do not know equal?” (Koran)</p>
  
    <p id='3024'>The command is decisive concerning both. If it be considered through the eye of reality, the training and culture of daughters is more necessary than that of sons, for these girls will come to the station of motherhood and will mould the lives of the children. The first trainer of the child is the mother. The babe, like unto a green and tender branch, will grow according to the way it is trained. If the training be right, it will grow right, and if crooked, the growth likewise, and unto the end of life it will conduct itself accordingly.</p>
  
    <p id='3025'>Hence, it is firmly established that an untrained and uneducated daughter, on becoming a mother, will be the prime factor in the deprivation, ignorance, negligence and the lack of training of many children.</p>
  
    <p id='3026'>O ye beloved of God and the maid-servants of the Merciful! Teaching and learning, according to the decisive texts of the Blessed Beauty (Baha’o’llah), is a duty. Whosover is indifferent therein depriveth himself of the great bounty.</p>
  
    <p id='3027'>Beware! Beware! that ye fail not in this matter. Endeavor with heart, with life, to train your children, especially the daughters. No excuse is acceptable in this matter.</p>
  
    <p id='3028'>Thus may eternal glory and everlasting supremacy, like unto the mid-day sun, shine forth in the assemblage of the people of Baha’, and the heart of Abdul-Baha become happy and thankful. </p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='“O pure friends of God!…”'></h3> <span data-pg='581' id='pg581'></span>
  
    <p id='3029'>O pure friends of God!</p>
  
    <p id='3030'>Cleanliness and sanctity in all conditions are the characteristics of pure beings and necessities of free souls. The first perfection consists in cleanliness and sanctity and in purity from every defect. When man in all conditions is pure and immaculate, he will become the center of the reflection of the manifest Light. In all his actions and conduct there must first be purity, then beauty and independence. The channel must be cleansed before it is filled with sweet water. The pure eye comprehendeth the sight and the meeting of God; the pure nostril inhaleth the perfumes of the rose-garden of bounty; the pure heart becometh the mirror of the beauty of truth. This is why, in the heavenly Books, the divine counsels and commands have been compared to water. So, in the Koran it is said, “and we have caused a pure water to descend from heaven;” and in the Gospel, “Except a man hath received the baptism of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.” Then it is evident that the divine teachings are the heavenly grace and the showers of the mercy of God, which purify the hearts of men.</p>
  
    <p id='3031'>The meaning is, in all conditions, cleanliness and sanctity, purity and delicacy exalt humanity and make the contingent beings progress. Even when applied to physical things, delicacy causeth the attainment of spirituality, as it is established in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
  
    <p id='3032'>External cleanliness, although it is but a physical thing, hath a great influence upon spirituality. For example, although sound is but the vibrations of the air which affect the tympanum of the ear, and vibrations <span data-pg='582' id='pg582'></span> of the air are but an accident among the accidents which depend upon the air, consider how much marvelous notes or a charming song influence the spirits! A wonderful song giveth wings to the spirit and filleth the heart with exalteth. To return to the subject, the fact of having a pure and spotless body likewise exerciseth an influence upon the spirit of man.</p>
  
    <p id='3033'>Now, see how much purity is approved in the Court of God, that it should be especially mentioned in the Holy Books of the Prophets. So the Holy Books forbid the eating of any unclean thing, or the use of anything which is not pure. Certain prohibitions are absolute and imperative for all: he who commits that which is forbidden is detested by God and excluded from the number of the elect. This applieth to the things forbidden by an absolute prohibition and of which the perpetration is a grave sin; they are so vile that even to mention them is shameful. There are other forbidden things which do not cause an immediate evil and of which the pernicious effect is only gradually produced. They are also abhorred, blamed and rejected by God, but their prohibition is not recorded in an absolute way, although cleanliness and sanctity, spotlessness and purity, the preservation of health and independence are required by these interdictions.</p>
  
    <p id='3034'>One of these last prohibitions is the smoking of tobacco, which is unclean, malodorous, disagreeable and vulgar and of which the gradual harmfulness is universally recognized. All clever physicians have judged, and have also shown by experiment, that one of the constituents of tobacco is a mortal poison and that smokers are exposed to different indispositions and <span data-pg='583' id='pg583'></span> maladies. That is why cleanly people have a marked aversion for its use.</p>
  
    <p id='3035'>His Supreme Highness (the Bab)—may my soul be His sacrifice! —in the beginning of His Cause, openly forbade it and all the friends abandoned its use. But, as it was a time for caution and he who abstained from smoking was ill treated, persecuted and even killed, therefore the friends were obliged, as a matter of prudence, to smoke. Later, the Kitab-el-Akdas was revealed and as the prohibition of tobacco was not clearly stated in it, the friends did not renounce it. But the Blessed Perfection had always a marked aversion for its use. At the beginning of the Cause, for certain reasons, he smoked a little, but later he abandoned it completely, and the holy souls who obeyed him in all circumstances, also entirely gave up smoking. I wish to say that, in the sight of God, the smoking of tobacco is a thing which is blamed and condemned, very unclean, and of which the result is by degrees injurious. Besides it is a cause of expense and of loss of time and it is a harmful habit. So, for those who are firm in the Covenant, it is a thing reprobated by the reason and by tradition, the renouncement of which giveth gradual repose and tranquility, permitteth one to have stainless hands and a clean mouth, and hair which is not pervaded by a bad odor.</p>
  
    <p id='3036'>Without any doubt, the friends of God on receiving this epistle will renounce this injurious by all means, even if it be necessary to do so by degrees. This is my hope.</p>
  
    <p id='3037'>As to the question of opium, disgusting and execrated, I resign myself to God for its punishment. The formal <span data-pg='584' id='pg584'></span> text of the Kitab-el-Akdas forbids and reproves it and, according to reason, its use leads to madness. Experience hath shown that he who giveth himself up to it is completely excluded from the world of humanity. Let us take refuge in God against the perpetration of so shameful a thing, which is the destruction of the foundations of humanity and which causeth a perpetual unhappiness. It taketh possession of the soul of man, killeth the reason, weakeneth the intelligence, maketh a living man dead and extinguisheth the natural heat. It is impossible to imagine anything more pernicious. Happy is he who never mentioneth the word opium! But what is the fate of those who make use of it!</p>
  
    <p id='3038'>O friends of God! Force and violence, constraint and oppression are condemned in this divine cycle, but to prevent the use of opium, all means must be employed, so that the human species may be delivered and freed from this great calamity. Otherwise, alas! for all the negligent before God.</p>
  
    <p id='3039'>O Lord! Give to the people of Baha’ cleanliness and holiness in all conditions, purify and free them from all defilement, deliver them from the use of all that is execrated, liberate them from the chains of habits, so that they may be pure and free, clean and spotless, that they may be worthy servants of the Sacred Threshold and may deserve to enter into relation with God. Deliver them from alcohol and tobacco, and save them from opium, the purveyor of madness! Make them companions of the holy breezes, in order that they may know the pleasures of the wine of the love of God, and that they may attain to the joy and the happiness of attraction to the Kingdom of Abha! <span data-pg='585' id='pg585'></span></p>
  
    <p id='3040'>Hast Thou not said, “All that thou hast in thy cellar will not appease the thirst of my love—bring me, O cup-bearer, of the wine of the spirit, a cup full as the sea!”</p>
  
    <p id='3041'>O friends of God! Experience hath shown how much the renouncing of tobacco, wine and opium, giveth health, strength and intellectual enjoyments, penetration of judgment and physical vigor. There exists today a tribe <a data-fnid='269'></a> which refrains and abstains from tobacco, alcohol and opium and it completely excels all others in power, in bravery, in health, beauty and grace. A single one of these men can withstand ten men of other tribes, and this hath been universally proved; that is to say, generally, the individuals of this tribe are superior to the individuals of the other tribes.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='269'>The Druses.</aside>
  
    <p id='3042'>Therefore strive that the greatest cleanliness and sanctity, which is the great desire of Abdul-Baha, should be resplendent among the Bahais, and that the companions of God should surpass the rest of mankind in all conditions and perfections; that they may be physically and morally superior to others; that through cleanliness and purity, refinement and health, they may be the chief of wise men, and that by their affranchisement, their prudence, and the control of their desires, they may be the princes of the pure, the free and the wise.</p>
  
    <p id='3043'>Upon you be the glory of El-Abha! </p>

    <p id='3052'>O seeker for the Truth!</p>
  
    <p id='3053'>There are two ways of healing sickness, material means and spiritual means. The first is by the use of remedies, of medicines; the second consists in praying to God and in turning to Him. Both means should be used and practiced.</p>
  
    <p id='3054'>Illness caused by physical accident should be treated with medical remedies; those which are due to spiritual causes disappear through spiritual means. Thus an illness caused by affliction, fear, nervous impressions, will be healed by spiritual rather than by physical treatment. Hence, both kinds of remedies should be considered. Moreover, they are not contradictory, and thou shouldst accept the physical remedies as coming from the mercy and favor of God, who hath revealed and made manifest medical science so that His servants may profit from this kind of treatment also. Thou shouldst give equal attention to spiritual treatments, for they produce marvellous effects.</p>
  
    <p id='3055'>Now, if thou wishest to know the divine remedy which will heal man from all sickness and will give him the health of the divine kingdom, know that it is the precepts and teachings of God. Guard them sacredly. </p>
