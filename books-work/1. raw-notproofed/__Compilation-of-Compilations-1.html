<p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS CONCERNING ARTS AND CRAFTS</p>
<p>	I. From the Writings of Baha'u'llah</p>
<p>	1. Blessed are those who have fixed their gaze on the realm of glory
 and have followed the commandments of the Lord of Names. Blessed is he 
who in the days of God will engage in handicrafts. This is a bounty from
 God, for in this Most Great Dispensation it is acceptable in the sight 
of God for man to occupy himself in a trade which relieveth him of 
depending upon charity. The craft of every craftsman is regarded as 
worship.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	2. One of the names of God is the Fashioner. He loveth 
craftsmanship. Therefore any of His servants who manifesteth this 
attribute is acceptable in the sight of this Wronged One. Craftsmanship 
is a book among the books of divine sciences, and a treasure among the 
treasures of His heavenly wisdom. This is a knowledge with meaning, for 
some of the sciences are brought forth by words and come to an end with 
words.<br>
	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	3. God grant that thou wilt exert thine utmost to acquire perfections, as well as proficiency in a craft.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	4. The one true God, exalted be He, loveth to witness handiworks of 
high craftsmanship produced by His loved ones. Blessed art thou, for 
what thy skill hath produced hath reached the presence of thy Lord, the 
Exiled, the Wronged. Please God every one of His friends may be enabled 
to acquire one of the crafts, and be confirmed in adhering to what hath 
been ordained in the Book of God, the All- Glorious, the All-Wise. </p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	5. Teach ye your children so that they may peruse the divine verses 
every morn and eve. God hath prescribed unto every father to educate his
 The<br>
 children, both boys and girls, in the sciences and in morals, and in crafts and professions....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	6. It is incumbent upon the children to exert themselves to the 
utmost in acquiring the art of reading and writing.... Writing skills 
that will provide for urgent needs will be enough for some; and then it 
is better and more fitting that they should spend their time in studying
 those branches of knowledge which are of use.</p>
<p>	As for what the Supreme Pen hath previously set down, the reason is 
that in every art and skill, God loveth the highest perfection.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	7. The fifth Taraz concerneth the protection and preservation of the
 stations of God's servants. One should not ignore the truth of any 
matter, rather should one give expression to that which is right and 
true. The people of Baha should not deny any soul the reward due to him,
 should treat craftsmen with deference, and, unlike the people 
aforetime, should not defile their tongues with abuse.</p>
<p>	In this Day the sun of craftsmanship shineth above the horizon of 
the occident and the river of arts is flowing out of the sea of that 
region. One must speak with fairness and appreciate such bounty....</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed After the Kitab-i-Aqdas" [rev, ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1978) pp. 38-39)</p>
<p>	8. The third Tajalli is concerning arts, crafts and sciences. 
Knowledge is as wings to man's life, and a ladder for his ascent. Its 
acquisition is incumbent upon everyone. The knowledge of such sciences, 
however, should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth, and 
not those which begin with words and end with words. Great indeed is the
 claim of scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world. Unto 
this beareth witness the Mother Book on the day of His return....</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed After the Kitab-i-Aqdas", pp. 51-52)</p>
<p>	9. At the outset of every endeavour, it is incumbent to look to the 
end of it. Of all the arts and sciences, set the children to studying 
those which will result in advantage to man, will ensure his progress 
and elevate his<br>
 rank. Thus the noisome odours of lawlessness will be dispelled, and 
thus through the high endeavours of the nation's leaders, all will live 
cradled, secure and in peace.</p>
<p>	The Great Being saith: The learned of the day must direct the people
 to acquire those branches of knowledge which are of use, that both the 
learned themselves and the generality of mankind may derive benefits 
therefrom.... </p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed After the Kitab-i-Aqdas", pp. 16 &amp; 69)</p>
<p>	10. The purpose of learning should be the promotion of the welfare 
of the people, and this can be achieved through crafts. It hath been 
revealed and is now repeated that the true worth of artists and 
craftsmen should be appreciated, for they advance the affairs of 
mankind. Just as the foundations of religion are made firm through the 
Law of God, the means of livelihood depend upon those who are engaged in
 arts and crafts. True learning is that which is conducive to the 
well-being of the world, not to pride and self-conceit, or to tyranny, 
violence and pillage.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	II. From the Writings and Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha</p>
<p>	11. Every person must have an occupation, a trade or a craft, so 
that he may carry other people's burdens, and not himself be a burden to
 others.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	12. Thou hast written regarding thy meeting with... He hath written 
that he desireth to teach thee one of the crafts and show thee affection
 and consideration. We beseech God that this purpose may be attained, 
and thou wilt learn such a skill, for according to the divine 
ordinances, every person must acquire a craft.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	13. He must study every day from morning till noon, so that he may 
learn how to read and write. From noon till about sunset he should 
acquire a craft. The children must both learn to read and acquire an art
 or skill.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	14. It is necessary for all to learn a craft, through which the people may earn their living. This commandment is universal.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	15. It is the commandment of the Blessed Beauty, may my life be a 
sacrifice at His Threshold, that whosoever engageth in a craft, should 
endeavour to acquire in it utmost proficiency. Should he do so, that 
craft becometh a form of worship.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	16. Another friend asked, "In the Tablets it is stated that we must 
be severed and detached. In another place it is stated that we must 
learn a trade or profession. Do not these two statements contradict each
 other?" 'Abdu'l-Baha replied, "In the Cause of Baha'u'llah, it is 
incumbent upon every soul to acquire a trade and an occupation. For 
example, I know how to weave or make a mat, and you know some other 
trade. This, in itself is an act of worship, provided that it is 
conducted on the basis of utmost honesty and faithfulness.</p>
<p>	And this is the cause of prosperity. Yet, in spite of being so 
occupied, if the heart is not chained and tied to this world, and is not
 troubled by current events, neither hindered by wealth from rendering 
service to mankind, nor grieved because of poverty, - then this is human
 perfection. Otherwise in a state of poverty, to manifest generosity and
 in a state of weakness to claim justice - this can easily be (said, but
 it is not a proof of man's attainments and alertness."</p>
<p>	(From an article written by Dr. Z. Baghdadi entitled "'Abdu'l-Baha 
in America", published in "Star of the West", Vol. 19, No. 7, p. 219)</p>
<p>	17. And further, according to the Divine commandments, every child 
must learn reading and writing, and acquire such branches of knowledge 
as are useful and necessary, as well as learning an art or skill. The 
utmost care must be devoted to these matters; any neglect of them, any 
failure to act on them, is not permissible.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	18. Among the greatest of all great services is the education of children,<br>
 and promotion of the various sciences, crafts and arts. Praised be God,
 ye are now exerting strenuous efforts toward this end. The more ye 
persevere in this most important task, the more will ye witness the 
confirmations of God, to such a degree that ye yourselves will be 
astonished. </p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	19. O ye recipients of the favours of God! In this new and wondrous 
Age, the unshakable foundation is the teaching of sciences and arts. 
According to explicit Holy Texts, every child must be taught crafts and 
arts, to the degree that is needful. Wherefore, in every city and 
village, schools must be established and every child in that city or 
village is to engage in study to the necessary degree.</p>
<p>	It followeth that whatever soul shall offer his aid to bring this 
about will assuredly be accepted at the Heavenly Threshold, and extolled
 by the Company on High.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), Sec. 109, pp. 134-35.)</p>
<p>	20. Thy letter was received. Praise be to God it imparted the good 
news of thy health and safety and indicated that thou art ready to enter
 an agricultural school. This is highly suitable. Strive as much as 
possible to become proficient in the science of agriculture, for in 
accordance with the divine teachings the acquisition of sciences and the
 perfection of arts are considered acts of worship. If a man engageth 
with all his power in the acquisition of a science or in the perfection 
of an art, it is as if he has been worshipping God in churches and 
temples. Thus as thou enterest a school of agriculture and strivest in 
the acquisition of that science thou art day and night engaged in acts 
of worship - acts that are accepted at the threshold of the Almighty. 
What bounty greater than this that science should be considered as an 
act of worship and art as service to the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", 126, pp. 144-45)</p>
<p>	21. O thou servant of the One true God! In this universal 
dispensation man's wondrous craftsmanship is reckoned as worship of the 
Resplendent Beauty.<br>

</p><p>	Consider what a bounty and blessing it is that craftsmanship is 
regarded as worship. In former times, it was believed that such skills 
were tantamount to ignorance, if not a misfortune, hindering man from 
drawing nigh unto God. Now consider how His infinite bestowals and 
abundant favours have changed hell-fire into blissful paradise, and a 
heap of dark dust into a luminous garden.</p>
<p>	It behoveth the craftsmen of the world at each moment to offer a 
thousand tokens of gratitude at the Sacred Threshold, and to exert their
 highest endeavour and diligently pursue their professions so that their
 efforts may produce that which will manifest the greatest beauty and 
perfection before the eyes of all men.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" 127, p. 145</p>
<p>	22. Make every effort to acquire the advanced knowledge of the day, 
and strain every nerve to carry forward the divine civilization. 
Establish schools that are well organized, and promote the fundamentals 
of instruction in the various branches of knowledge through teachers who
 are pure and sanctified, distinguished for their high standards of 
conduct and general excellence, and strong in faith; scholars and 
educators with a thorough knowledge of sciences and arts.</p>
<p>	Included must be promotion of the arts, the discovery of new 
wonders, the expansion of trade, and the development of industry. The 
methods of civilization and the beautification of the country must also 
be encouraged... </p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	23. While the children are yet in their infancy feed them from the 
breast of heavenly grace, foster them in the cradle of all excellence, 
rear them in the embrace of bounty. Give them the advantage of every 
useful kind of knowledge. Let them share in every new and rare and 
wondrous craft and art. Bring them up to work and strive, and accustom 
them to hardship. Teach them to dedicate their lives to matters of great
 import, and inspire them to undertake studies that will benefit 
mankind.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", 102, p. 129)<br>

</p><p>	III. From letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to individual believers unless otherwise cited</p>
<p>	24. In connection with your dear husband, Shoghi Effendi would 
consider it in full and happy accord with the expressed desire of the 
Master that every man should have some permanent work. Much as he 
desires to see you both devote your entire energies to a well thought 
out, progressive and attractive presentation of the Cause - a thing he 
feels we lack lamentably- he would be very pleased to see your husband 
follow what the Master often repeated even to His own immediate family, 
namely the necessity of a profession. Of course you know that He always 
said His had been mat-making.</p>
<p>	(20 September 1929)</p>
<p>	25. He sincerely hopes that as the Cause grows and talented persons 
come under its banner, they will begin to produce in art the divine 
spirit that animates their soul. Every religion has brought with it some
 form of art - let us see what wonders this Cause is going to bring 
along. Such a glorious spirit should also give vent to a glorious art. 
The Temple with all its beauty is only the first ray of an early dawn; 
even more wondrous things are to be achieved in the future.</p>
<p>	(11 December 1931)</p>
<p>	26. Shoghi Effendi was very much interested to learn of the success 
of the "Pageant of the Nations" you produced. He sincerely hopes that 
all those who attended it were inspired by the same spirit that animated
 you while arranging it.</p>
<p>	It is through such presentations that we can arouse the interest of 
the greatest number of people in the spirit of the Cause. The day will 
come when the Cause will spread like wildfire when its spirit and 
teachings will be presented on the stage or in art and literature as a 
whole. Art can better awaken such noble sentiments than cold 
rationalizing, especially among the mass of the people.</p>
<p>	We have to wait only a few years to see how the spirit breathed by 
Baha'u'llah will find expression in the work of the artists. What you 
and some other Baha'is are attempting are only faint rays that precede 
the effulgent light of a glorious morn. We cannot yet value the part the
 Cause is destined to play in the life of society. We have to give it 
time. The<br>
 material this spirit has to mould is too crude and unworthy, but it 
will at last give way and the Cause of Baha'u'llah will reveal itself in
 its full splendour. </p>
<p>	(10 October 1932, cited in "Baha'i News", 73 (May 1933) p. 7)</p>
<p>	27. Although now is only the very beginning of Baha'i art, yet the 
friends who feel they are gifted in such matters should endeavour to 
develop and cultivate their gifts and through their works to reflect, 
however inadequately, the Divine Spirit which Baha'u'llah has breathed 
into the world.</p>
<p>	(4 November 1937)</p>
<p>	28. As regards producing a book of Baha'i songs, your understanding 
that there is no cultural expression which could be called Baha'i at 
this time (distinctive music, literature, art, architecture, etc., being
 the flower of the civilization and not coming at the beginning of a new
 Revelation), is correct. However, that does not mean that we haven't 
Baha'i songs, in other words, songs written by Baha'is on Baha'i 
subjects. There is no objection to getting out a compilation of these, 
but he does not think money should be spent in printing it, in view of 
the state of the National Fund, and the much more important work in the 
teaching field which needs to be undertaken this year. If you can get 
out such a book in a mimeographed form, he feels this would be 
sufficient to meet the needs at this time.</p>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS ON BAHA'I BURIAL</p>
<p>	Extracts from the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	29. It is forbidden you to carry the body more than an hour's 
distance from the town; bury it with tranquillity and cheer in a nearby 
place.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	Question: Regarding the carrying of the dead where it is bidden that
 they should be buried within one hour's distance, does this law apply 
to transportation both by land and sea, or is it otherwise?</p>
<p>	Answer: The law applieth to transportation by land as well as by 
sea, whether it be an hour's distance by boat or train. The purpose is 
the time-limit of one hour, no matter what means of conveyance is 
employed. However, the sooner the burial taketh place, the more fitting 
and preferable.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	30. Briefly the law for the burial of the dead states that it is 
forbidden to carry the body for more than one hour's journey from the 
place of death; that the body should be wrapped in a shroud of silk or 
cotton, and on its finger should be placed a ring bearing the 
inscription "I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from 
all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the 
Compassionate"; and that the coffin should be of crystal, stone or hard 
fine wood. A specific Prayer for the Dead is ordained, to be said before
 interment.[1] It has been explained by 'Abdu'l Baha and the Guardian 
that this law prohibits cremation of the dead. The formal prayer and the
 ring are meant to be used for those who have attained the age of 
maturity. (p. 46)<br>
 [1 See Extract 4]</p>
<p>	("A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy 
Book of Baha'u'llah", (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1973), pp. 62-63)</p>
<p>	31. The Prayer for the Dead is published in Prayers and Meditations 
of Baha'u'llah, No. CLXVII. It is the only Baha'i obligatory prayer 
which is to be recited in congregation; it is to be recited by one 
believer while all present stand. There is no requirement to face the 
Qiblih when reciting this prayer. (p. 7)<br>

</p><p>	("Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas" p. 58)</p>
<p>	Extracts from Letters Written on behalf of the Guardian:</p>
<p>	32. Regarding the Baha'i funeral service: it is extremely simple, as
 it consists only of a congregational prayer to be read before burial. 
This prayer will be made available to the friends when the "Aqdas" is 
translated and published. In the mean time your National Spiritual 
Assembly should take great care lest any uniform procedure or ritual in 
this matter be adopted or imposed upon the friends. The danger in this, 
as in some other cases regarding Baha'i worship, is that a definite 
system of rigid rituals and practices be developed among the believers. 
The utmost simplicity and flexibility should be observed, and a 
selection from the Baha'i Sacred Writings would serve the purpose at the
 present time, provided this selection is not rigidly and uniformly 
adopted on all such occasions.</p>
<p>	(10 January 1936 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	33. Both the Baha'i marriage service and the Baha'i funeral service 
are extremely simple in character, and you must have certainly read in 
the "Baha'i News" the explanation given by the Guardian on these two 
points. As already stated all forms of rigidity and uniformity in such 
matters should be avoided by the believers. What is of vital importance 
is to strictly observe the laws and directions specifically revealed by 
Baha'u'llah. These will be gradually brought to the attention of the 
friends and explained to them by the Guardian. In the mean time great 
care should be taken to prevent the introduction of unnecessary details 
and additions of a man-made nature to the body of the Teachings.</p>
<p>	(19 May 1936 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	34. There is no objection whatsoever to non-Baha'is being present 
when the long prayer for the dead is read, as long as they respect our 
manner of reading it by rising and standing as the Baha'is do on this 
occasion. Nor, indeed, is there any objection to non-Baha'is being 
present during the reading of any Baha'i prayer for the departed. In 
reporting Baha'i marriages it is much better to mention that the 
ceremony was performed by the Assembly, as this is the proper thing to<br>
 do, and an individual only acts for the Assembly on this occasion. As a
 funeral is not a legal ceremony more latitude can be allowed, 
especially as the family of the deceased may want some particular Baha'i
 friend to officiate.</p>
<p>	. . .</p>
<p>	Mr. and Mrs.... are naturally quite free to be buried in their own plot in the Cemetery, if that is what they desire.</p>
<p>	An official Baha'i funeral service should only be given for a 
believer, but there is no objection to the reading of Baha'i prayers, or
 indeed to a Baha'i conducting the funeral service of a non-Baha'i, if 
this has been requested.</p>
<p>	(20 July 1946 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	35. The body may be conveyed by any means to a distance that can be covered in one hour's journey. </p>
<p>	(5 August 1949 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	36. The Guardian thinks the ideal thing would be for the believers to have a Baha'i Cemetery.... </p>
<p>	(5 September 1950 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	37. Regarding the questions which you ask, concerning Baha'i 
burials, etc. At the present time, the Guardian is not stressing these 
matters, as their establishment might divert attention from the supreme 
tasks we have before us. However, the answers are as follows: Under the 
Baha'i teachings it seems clear that the body is not to be embalmed. The
 burial should take place within an hour's travel time from the place of
 death. The preparation for the body for burial is a careful washing, 
and placing in a shroud of white cloth, silk preferably. There is 
nothing in the teachings with regard to turning the body over to 
Scientific Institutions for scientific research, and therefore the 
individual may do as he wishes, until such a time as the Universal House
 of Justice may legislate on this matter, if they ever do. The practice 
in the Orient is to bury the person within 24 hours of the time of 
death, sometimes even sooner, although there is no provision in the 
teachings as to the time limit.</p>
<p>	(2 April 1955 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	38. There is nothing in the Teachings against leaving our bodies
 to medical science. The only thing we should stipulate is that we do 
not wish to be cremated, as it is against our Baha'i Laws.</p>
<p>	As many people make arrangements to leave their bodies to medical 
science for investigation, he suggests that you inquire, either through 
some lawyer friend or through some hospital, how you could do this, and 
then make the necessary provision in your Will, stipulating that you 
wish your body to be of service to mankind in death, and that, being a 
Baha'i, you request that your remains not be cremated and not be taken 
more than an hour's journey from the place you die. The spirit has no 
more connection with the body after it departs, but, as the body was 
once the temple of the spirit, we Baha'is are taught that it must be 
treated with respect.</p>
<p>	(22 March 1957 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Extracts from Letters written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	39. For the burial of the dead the only requirements now binding in 
the West are to bury the body (not to cremate it), not to carry it more 
than a distance of one hour's journey from the place of death, and to 
say the Prayer for the Dead if the deceased is a believer over the age 
of 15.</p>
<p>	(9 June 1974 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Iceland)</p>
<p>	40. You have asked whether it is permissible for the friends to 
chant a prayer collectively. There is a difference between chanting a 
prayer collectively and congregational prayer. The latter is a formal 
prayer usually led by an individual using a prescribed ritual. 
Congregational prayer in this form is forbidden in the Faith except in 
the case of the Prayer for the Dead. While reciting prayers in unison 
and spontaneously joining in the recitation of the Words of God is not 
forbidden, the friends should bear in mind the advice of the beloved 
Guardian on this subject when he stated that: although the friends are 
thus left free to follow their own inclination, ... they should take the
 utmost care that any manner they practice should not acquire too rigid a
 character, and thus develop into an institution. This is a point which 
the friends should<br>
 always bear in mind, lest they deviate from the clear path indicated in the Teachings."[1]<br>
[1 "Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas", No.2 of Notes,  p. 57.]</p>
<p>	(6 February 1975 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	41. The Universal House of Justice advises that the place of death 
may be taken to be the city or town in which the believer passes away, 
and therefore the hour's journey may be calculated from the city limits 
to the place of burial. However, it should be borne in mind that the 
spirit of Baha'u'llah's law is to be buried near where one dies.</p>
<p>	At the present time there are no definite regulations for preparing 
Baha'i cemeteries. However, in a Tablet of the Master's, He emphasizes 
the need for the cemetery to have a beautiful outward appearance and 
states that the graves should not be joined together but that each one 
should have a flower bed around its four sides. He also indicates that 
it would be pleasing if a pool were located in the center of the 
cemetery and beautiful trees were planted around it as well as around 
the cemetery itself.</p>
<p>	(20 February 1978 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Brazil)</p>
<p>	42. The Prayer for the Dead should be recited at the funeral if the 
deceased is 15 years old or more. If there is no one at the funeral able
 to read, it is sufficient to say only that part of the Prayer which 
requires the repetition nineteen times of each of six short verses.</p>
<p>	The body must be placed in the grave in such a position that the feet point towards 'Akka (the Qiblih).</p>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE BAHA'I WRITINGS ON BUDDHA, KRISHNA, ZOROASTER AND RELATED SUBJECTS</p>
<p>	From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	43. Blessed souls whether Moses, Jesus, Zoroaster, Krishna, Buddha, 
Confucius, or Muhammad were the cause of the illumination of the world 
of humanity. How can we deny such irrefutable proof? How can we be blind
 to such light?...</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	44. Thou hast written regarding Buddha and Confucius. Buddha was an 
illustrious personage. Confucius became the cause of civilization, 
advancement and prosperity for the people of China. Now it is not the 
time when we discuss concerning the stations and positions of those who 
are passed away. We must concentrate our attention upon the present. 
What hath transpired in a former time is past. Now is the time when we 
restrict our discussion to the Most Great Luminary of Peace and 
Salvation in this Age, to talk of the Blessed Perfection [Baha'u'llah] 
and to voice His exhortations, behests and teachings. Buddha and 
Confucius were kings in bygone ages who have disappeared. Their 
sovereignty in this world is ended and their cycle is completed. Now the
 Throne of the Kingdom of ABHA is established and the Blessed Perfection
 is sitting upon the Throne of Grandeur. We must raise this Call, 
promulgate the Word of God and live in accord with the teachings and 
advices of the Beauty of ABHA</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. 2 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Society, 1915), pp. 469-70)</p>
<p>	45. There are prophecies concerning this Manifestation in the 
Buddhistic books, but they are in symbols and metaphors, and some 
spiritual conditions are mentioned therein, but the leaders of religion 
do not understand. They think these prophecies are material things; yet 
those signs are foreshadowing spiritual occurrences.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. 3 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Society, 1916), p. 565)<br>

</p><p>	46. Buddha also established a new religion, and Confucius 
renewed morals and ancient virtues, but their institutions have been 
entirely destroyed. The beliefs and rites of the Buddhists and 
Confucianists have not continued in accordance with their fundamental 
teachings. The founder of Buddhism was a wonderful soul. He established 
the Oneness of God, but later the original principles of His doctrines 
gradually disappeared, and ignorant customs and ceremonials arose and 
increased until they finally ended in the worship of statues and images.</p>
<p>	. . .</p>
<p>	So it is with religions; through the passing of time they change 
from their original foundation, the truth of the Religion of God 
entirely departs, and the spirit of it does not stay; heresies appear, 
and it becomes a body without a soul. That is why it is renewed</p>
<p>	.</p>
<p>	The meaning is that the Buddhists and Confucianists now worship 
images and statues. They are entirely heedless of the Oneness of God and
 believe in imaginary gods like the ancient Greeks. But in the beginning
 it was not so; there were different principles and other ordinances.</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), pp. 165-166)</p>
<p>	47. ... Thou hadst written that in the sacred books of the followers
 of Zoroaster it is written that in the latter days, in three separate 
Dispensations, the sun must needs be brought to a standstill. In the 
first Dispensation, it is predicted, the sun will remain motionless for 
ten days; in the second for twice that time; in the third for no less 
than one whole month. The interpretation of this prophecy is this: the 
first Dispensation to which it refers is the Muhammadan Dispensation 
during which the Sun of Truth stood still or ten days. Each day is 
reckoned as one century. The Muhammadan Dispensation must have, 
therefore, lasted no less than one thousand years, which is precisely 
the period that has elapsed from the setting of the Star of the Imamate 
to the advent of the Dispensation proclaimed by the Bab. The second 
Dispensation referred to in this prophecy is the one inaugurated by the 
Bab Himself which began in the year 1260 A.H. and was brought to a close
 in the year 1280 A.H. As to the third Dispensation -- the Revelation 
proclaimed by Baha'u'llah -- inasmuch as the Sun of Truth when attaining
 that station shineth in the plenitude of its meridian splendor its 
duration hath been fixed for a period of one whole month, which is the 
maximum time taken by the sun to pass through a sign of the Zodiac. From
 this thou canst imagine the magnitude of the Baha'i<br>
 cycle -- a cycle that must extend over a period of at least five hundred thousand years.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected 
Letters", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 101-2)</p>
<p>	From the Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	48. ...The real teaching of Buddha is the same as the teaching of 
Jesus Christ. The teachings of all the Prophets are the same in 
character. Now men have changed the teaching. If you look at the present
 practice of the Buddhist religion, you will see that there is little of
 the Reality left. Many worship idols although their teaching forbids 
it.</p>
<p>	Buddha had disciples and he wished to send them out into the world 
to teach, so he asked them questions to see if they were prepared as he 
would have them be. "When you go to the East and to the West," said the 
Buddha, "and the people shut their doors to you and refuse to speak to 
you, what will you do?" -- The disciples answered and said; "We shall be
 very thankful that they do us no harm." -- "Then if they do you harm 
and mock, what will you do?" -- 'We shall be very thankful that they do 
not give us worse treatment." -- "If they throw you into prison?" -- 'We
 shall still be grateful that they do not kill us." -- "What if they 
were to kill you?" the Master asked for the last time. "Still," answered
 the disciples, "we will be thankful, for they cause us to be martyrs. 
What more glorious fate is there than this, to die for the glory of 
God?" And the Buddha said: 'Well done!" The teaching of Buddha was like a
 young and beautiful child, and now it has become as an old and decrepit
 man. Like the aged man it cannot see, it cannot hear, it cannot 
remember anything....</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha in London: Addresses, and Notes of Conversations", 
Commemorative ed. (London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), pp. 63-64)</p>
<p>	49. The Message of Krishna is the message of love. All God's prophets have brought the message of love.... </p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912", 11th ed. (London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1979), p. 35)</p>
<p>	50. A star has the same radiance if it shines from the East or from 
the West. Be free from prejudice, so will you love the Sun of Truth from<br>
 whatsoever point in the horizon it may arise! You will realize that if 
the Divine light of truth shone in Jesus Christ it also shone in Moses 
and in Buddha. The earnest seeker will arrive at this truth....</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912", p. 137)</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	51. To Israel He was neither more nor less than the incarnation of 
the "Everlasting Father," the "Lord of Hosts" come down "with ten 
thousands of saints"; to Christendom Christ returned "in the glory of 
the Father," to Shi'ah Islam the return of the Imam Husayn; to Sunni 
Islam the descent of the "Spirit of God" (Jesus Christ); to the 
Zoroastrians the promised Shah-Bahram; to the Hindus the reincarnation 
of Krishna; to the Buddhists the fifth Buddha.</p>
<p>	. . .</p>
<p>	To His Dispensation the sacred books of the followers of Zoroaster 
had referred as that in which the sun must needs be brought to a 
standstill for no less than one whole month. To Him Zoroaster must have 
alluded when, according to tradition, He foretold that a period of three
 thousand years of conflict and contention must needs precede the advent
 of the World-Savior Shah-Bahram, Who would triumph over Ahriman and 
usher in an era of blessedness and peace.</p>
<p>	He alone is meant by the prophecy attributed to Gautama Buddha 
Himself, that "a Buddha named Maitreye, the Buddha of universal 
fellowship" should, in the fullness of time, arise and reveal "His 
boundless glory." To Him the Bhagavad- Gita of the Hindus had referred 
as the "Most Great Spirit," the "Tenth Avatar," the "Immaculate 
Manifestation of Krishna."</p>
<p>	("God Passes By", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), pp. 94-95)</p>
<p>	From letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to individual believers unless otherwise noted:</p>
<p>	52. Concerning the passage in "The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah" in 
which the Guardian quotes 'Abdu'l-Baha's interpretation of the prophecy 
referring to the times when the sun would stand still in the heavens he 
wishes me to explain that the days referred to in this prophecy have to 
be reckoned differently. In the Sacred Scriptures of various religions 
there<br>
 are to be found frequent references to days, but these have been 
considered as indicating different periods of time, as for instance in 
the Qur'an a day is reckoned as one thousand years. The first ten days 
in the above-mentioned prophecy represent each a century, making thus a 
total of one thousand lunar years. As to the twenty days referring to 
the Babi Dispensation, each of them represents only one lunar year, the 
total of twenty years marking the duration of the Revelation of the Bab.
 The thirty days in the last Dispensation should not be reckoned 
numerically, but should be considered as symbolizing the incomparable 
greatness of the Baha'i Revelation, which, though not the final, is none
 the less thus far the fullest revelation of God to man. &gt;From a 
physical point of view, the thirty days represent the maximum time taken
 by the sun to pass through a sign of the zodiac. They thus represent a 
culminating point in the evolution of this star. So also from a 
spiritual standpoint these thirty days should be viewed as indicating 
the highest, though not the final stage in the spiritual evolution of 
mankind.</p>
<p>	(7 August 1934 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	53. As regards your study of the Hindu religion: The origins of this
 and many other religions that abound in India are not quite known to 
us, and even the Orientalists and the students of religion are not in 
complete accord about the results of their investigations in that field.
 The Baha'i writings also do not refer specifically to any of these 
forms of religion current in India. So, the Guardian feels it impossible
 to give you any definite and detailed information on that subject. He 
would urge you, however, to carry on your studies in that field, 
although its immensity is wellnigh bewildering, with the view of 
bringing the Message to the Hindus. The task of converting this section 
of the Indian population is a most vital obligation, although the 
Guardian is fully aware of the many difficulties that it presents. 
Nevertheless the friends should do their best to make as many converts 
among the Hindus as they possibly can.</p>
<p>	(17 April 1936)</p>
<p>	54. The number nine, which in itself is the number of perfection, is
 considered by the Baha'is as sacred because it is symbolic of the 
perfection of the Baha'i Revelation, which constitutes the ninth in the 
line of existing<br>
 religions, the latest and fullest Revelation which mankind has ever 
known. The eighth is the Religion of the Bab, and the remaining seven 
are: Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism,Judaism, Christianity, Islam and
 the religion of the Sabaeans. These religions are not the only true 
religions that have appeared in the world, but are the only ones which 
are still existing. There have always been divine prophets and 
messengers, to many of whom the Qur'an refers. But the only ones 
existing are those mentioned above.</p>
<p>	(28 July 1936)</p>
<p>	55. The nine religions to which you have referred include both the 
Babi and the Baha'i Dispensations, Baha'u'llah being the ninth Prophet 
in the series. The other Prophets included are Zoroaster, Krishna, 
Moses, the Christ, Muhammad, Buddha, the Prophet of the Sabaeans Whose 
name is unrecorded, the Bab and Baha'u'llah.... Buddha appeared in the 
Adamic cycle....</p>
<p>	(13 July 1938)</p>
<p>	56. Regarding Lao-Tse: the Baha'is do not consider him a prophet, or
 even a secondary prophet or messenger, unlike Buddha or Zoroaster, both
 of Whom were divinely appointed and fully independent Manifestations of
 God.</p>
<p>	As to the religion of the Sabaeans, very little is known about the 
origins of this religion, though we Baha'is are certain of one thing, 
that the founder of it has been a divinely-sent Messenger. The country 
where Sabaeanism became widespread and flourished was Chaldea, and 
Abraham is considered as having been a follower of that Faith.</p>
<p>	(10 November 1939)</p>
<p>	57. With reference to your question concerning the Sabaean and Hindu
 religions: there is nothing in the Teachings that could help us in 
ascertaining which one of these two Faiths is older. Neither history 
seems to be able to provide a definite answer to this question. The 
records concerning the origin of these religions are not sufficiently 
detailed and reliable to offer any conclusive evidence on this point.</p>
<p>	(9 November 1940)<br>

</p><p>	58. Your question concerning Brahma and Krishna: such matters, 
as no reference occurs to them in the Teachings, are left for students 
of history and religion to resolve and clarify. </p>
<p>	(14 April 1941)</p>
<p>	59. Zoroaster lived about a thousand years before Christ. There is 
no exact date in the teachings regarding the beginning of His 
Dispensation. The personages in Zenda- Avesta cannot be absolutely 
relied upon, as the Avesta is not to be regarded as the authentic 
compilation of the writings of the Prophet.</p>
<p>	(30 July 1941 to a National Committee and an individual believer)</p>
<p>	60. Confucius was not a Prophet. It is quite correct to say he is 
the founder of a moral system and a great reformer. The Buddha was a 
Manifestation of God, like Christ, but His followers do not possess His 
authentic writings.</p>
<p>	(26 December 1941 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New) Zealand)</p>
<p>	61. In the Baha'i teachings it states that all the Prophets have 
foretold a Promised One Who is Baha'u'llah. We cannot be sure of the 
authenticity, word for word, of any of the past Holy Scriptures except 
the Qur'an, as they were either not written down during the Prophet's 
lifetime or have been changed in the course of time and the originals 
lost; what we can be sure of is that when Baha'u'llah or the Master 
stated that Zoroaster foretold a Promised One's coming, it is correct. 
The Zoroastrians have no way of contradicting this assertion of ours, as
 they themselves know their scriptures are not in the original form, and
 therefore not absolutely authentic.</p>
<p>	(22 June 1943)</p>
<p>	62. There is no mention in the Baha'i writings of any connection 
between the Near Eastern and Far Eastern Prophets. There are a very few 
references made to Buddha, which you have evidently seen. In "God Passes
 By" you will find that Baha'u'llah is the return of the Fifth Buddha, 
etc., and this is all the information the Guardian has, on this subject 
of Baha'u'llah's fulfilling Buddhistic prophecies, at present.<br>

</p><p>	(24 June 1947)</p>
<p>	63. Regarding your questions: the only reason there is not more 
mention of the Asiatic Prophets is because Their names seem to be lost 
in the mists of ancient history. Buddha is mentioned, and Zoroaster, in 
our Scriptures -- both non- Jewish Prophets or non Semitic Prophets. We 
are taught there always have been Manifestations of God, but we do not 
have any record of Their names.</p>
<p>	(4 October 1950)</p>
<p>	64. We cannot be sure of the authenticity of the scriptures of 
Buddha and Krishna, so we certainly cannot draw any conclusions about 
virgin birth mentioned in them. There is no reference to this subject in
 our teachings, so the Guardian cannot pronounce an opinion.</p>
<p>	There are no dates in our teachings regarding the actual dates of 
the Prophets of the Adamic Cycle, so we cannot give any. Tentatively we 
can accept what historians may consider accurate. Naturally the dates 
referring to Muhammad, the Bab and Baha'u'llah we are sure of.</p>
<p>	As our teachings do not state Zoroaster is the connecting link 
between the Euphrates and the Prophets in India we cannot assert this. 
Abraham and Krishna are two separate individuals, with no connection 
that we know of.</p>
<p>	(25 November 1950)</p>
<p>	65. Regarding the question of days referring in some cases to years,
 and in some cases to centuries in the Tablet to a Zoroastrian follower 
of the Faith: The only answer we can give people who lack the faith to 
accept the words of the Master as being divinely inspired 
interpretations of the truth, is that the language of prophecy has 
always in the past been veiled in meaning, and that allusions are found 
in all the Holy Books which cannot be accepted literally, and have not 
been satisfactorily interpreted until the appearance of this Revelation 
when, we believe, the books of the past and their mysteries have been at
 last unsealed. Could anybody find a more logical interpretation of this
 allusion in the Zoroastrian literature than that given by 'Abdu'l-Baha,
 or one which fits a coherent interpretation of religious history as 
well as the Master's words do?</p>
<p>	(16 April 1951)<br>

</p><p>	66. As there were no followers of the Bab or Baha'u'llah derived
 from the religions of the Far East in Their days, this may be the 
reason that They did not address any Tablets directly to these people. 
Also we must remember that every religion springs from some root, and 
just as Christianity sprang from Judaism, our own religion sprang from 
Islam, and that is why so many of the teachings deduce their proofs from
 Islam.</p>

<p>	Importance and Purpose:</p>
<p>	67. He was very happy to hear of the success of the school, 
especially that it has been the means of bringing to light hitherto 
unsuspected capacities among the friends.... The Summer School has been 
carrying on the divine work of bringing forth jewels from the mine of 
humanity and it is the hope of Shoghi Effendi and the friend here that 
those who have been trained in the Summer School will carry on the work 
in the various localities from which they come...</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 October 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the Green Acre Summer School, published in "Baha'i News" (10 
February 1926), p. 3)</p>
<p>	68. Such gatherings will give a chance to friends from different 
localities to come together and exchange views on the different problems
 of the Cause and also attract new souls to the spirit and teachings of 
the Faith. Not only will their knowledge of the writings deepen but also
 the unity of the Cause will be strengthened and the work of teaching 
enhanced....</p>
<p>	Shoghi Effendi was very glad to hear that so many new souls were 
confirmed there. As we see the suffering around us, caused by the 
prevailing financial crises, we should redouble our energy in bringing 
the message of comfort and peace to those desperate souls, and add to 
our labours that the golden age promised by Baha'u'llah may dawn 
sooner....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 November 1931 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 63 (June 
1932), p. 4)</p>
<p>	69. Shoghi Effendi feels that the real purpose of these Summer 
Schools is to deepen the knowledge of the friends. Lectures are very 
essential for they give a wonderful picture of the subject-matter. But 
it is not sufficient to have a picture; the friends should deepen their 
knowledge and this can be achieved if together with the lectures there 
are study classes and seminar work carried on by the same lecturer.</p>
<p>	The world is undoubtedly facing a great crisis and the social, 
economic and political conditions are becoming daily more complex. 
Should the friends desire to take the lead in reforming the world, they 
should start by educating themselves and understand what the troubles<br>
 and problems really are which baffle the mind of man. It is in these 
Summer Schools that this training should be provided for the friends.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 27 January 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 63 (June 
1932), p. 3)</p>
<p>	70. The Guardian fully agrees with your idea that the permanent 
welfare of the Faith demands the steady development of local Baha'i 
community life. This is the bedrock of Baha'i national growth and 
development. Great emphasis, he feels, should be placed upon Baha'i 
Summer Schools. A greater number of believers and visitors should be 
encouraged to attend them, their scope should, if not too expensive, be 
systematically widened, the atmosphere pervading them must be given a 
distinctive Baha'i character, and the level of their discussions and the
 standard of their studies must be raised. </p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 10 September 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada)</p>
<p>	71. How wonderful it would be if all the friends could arrange to 
spend at least a few days in one of these summer schools and take an 
active part in their development. These centers could attract many souls
 if properly arranged and made interesting; those non-Baha'is who visit 
them will then have some time to get into the spirit of the place and 
make a study of the Cause... We constantly receive letters from people 
who become Baha'is by visiting one of these centers and obtaining the 
Message there. </p>
<p>	(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual 
believer, received about 1 May 1932, quoted in "Baha'i News" 67 (October
 1932), p. 4)</p>
<p>	72. Regarding your Summer School: he is indeed grateful to your 
assembly for the great success that has attended your efforts for the 
formation of this institution, the teaching value of which for England 
cannot be overestimated.... The Guardian would, therefore, urge all the 
believers to persevere in their efforts for raising the standard, both 
intellectual and spiritual, of their Summer School and to heighten its 
prestige in the eyes of the friends, and of the general non-Baha'i 
public outside. The institution of the Summer School constitutes a vital
 and inseparable part of any teaching campaign, and as such ought to be 
given the full importance it deserves in the teaching plans and 
activities of the<br>
 believers. It should be organized in such a way as to attract the 
attention of the non-believers to the Cause and thus become an effective
 medium for teaching. Also it should afford the believers themselves an 
opportunity to deepen their knowledge of the Teachings, through lectures
 and discussions and by means of close and intense community life.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 October 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles)</p>
<p>	73. He has noted with deepest satisfaction indeed that your meetings
 have been well attended this year, and that the programme had been made
 as varied and interesting as possible, and combined, as every Baha'i 
Summer School should, the threefold features of devotion, study and 
recreation. Only through such a harmonious combination of these three 
elements can the institution of the Summer School yield the maximum of 
beneficent results, and fulfil its true function of deepening the 
knowledge, stimulating the zeal, and fostering the spirit of fellowship 
among the believers in every Baha'i community.</p>
<p>	The Guardian cherishes the hope that at the termination of your 
school this summer every one of the attendants will have derived such 
mental and spiritual benefits, and acquired such a fresh enthusiasm to 
serve as will enable him, upon his return to his local community, to 
labour with a determination and vigour that will excite the envy and 
admiration of his fellow-believers, and stimulate them to greater 
heights of consecration to the service of our beloved Cause.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 15 August 1938 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Central States Summer School)</p>
<p>	74. He is truly delighted to know that the attendance at the school 
has been satisfactory, and that the young believers, in particular, have
 been most enthusiastic about it. What he feels now is most essential is
 for the National Spiritual Assembly to make arrangements to have this 
school held regularly every year, so that it may develop into an 
effective, and increasingly vital, instrument for the propagation of the
 Faith, and also for the education and training of Baha'i teachers.</p>
<p>	It is the Guardian's fervent hope that as this Institution expands, 
and fulfils the high hopes you all set upon it, it will be felt 
advisable by the National Spiritual Assembly to consider the 
possibilities of establishing,<br>
 in due time, one or two more of such schools, thus permitting those 
friends, who in view of their limited means are not in a position to 
travel over large distances, to avail themselves of the benefits derived
 from these nascent Baha'i institutions of learning.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 1 December 1938 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	75. What other community has shown the foresight, the organizing 
ability, the enthusiastic eagerness, that have been responsible for the 
establishment and multiplication, throughout its territory, of those 
initial schools which, as time goes by, will, on the one hand, evolve 
into powerful centers of Baha'i learning, and, on the other, provide a 
fertile recruiting ground for the enrichment and consolidation of its 
teaching force?...</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 9)</p>
<p>	76. He ... hopes that from now on you will become a regular 
attendant at all future sessions at Louhelen, or at either one of the 
two remaining Summer Schools now operating in the States. Faithful 
attendance at any of these institutions of Baha'i learning would be 
indeed the best preparation for all prospective Baha'i teachers, and 
should as such be welcomed most heartily by all the believers.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 August 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	77. He is indeed immeasurably delighted to know that thanks to your 
earnest and wise efforts, and to the loving assistance and co-operation 
of the friends, Louhelen Ranch is steadily progressing and is 
increasingly fulfilling those ideal conditions which it should be the 
aim of every Baha'i summer school to create, maintain and enforce, 
namely: close association and fellowship, both social and spiritual, 
among the attendants, intellectual training in the history, principles 
and teachings of the Cause, and the application to one's life of the 
principles of moral conduct as explained and clarified by the Guardian 
himself in his "Advent of Divine Justice".</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 24 August 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)<br>

</p><p>	78. Equally important as a factor in the evolution of the 
Administrative Order has been the remarkable progress achieved, 
particularly in the United States of America, by the institution of the 
summer schools designed to foster the spirit of fellowship in a 
distinctly Baha'i atmosphere, to afford the necessary training for 
Baha'i teachers, and to provide facilities for the study of the history 
and teachings of the Faith, and for a better understanding of its 
relation to other religions and to human society in general. </p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, "God Passes By", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), p. 340)</p>
<p>	79. It is not enough to bring people into the Faith, one must 
educate them and deepen their love for it and their knowledge of its 
teachings, after they declare themselves. As the Baha'is are few in 
number, especially the active teachers, and there is a great deal of 
work to be done, the education of these new believers is often sadly 
neglected, and then results are seen such as the resignations you have 
had recently. In this respect, the summer schools can be of the greatest
 help to the friends, new and old Baha'is alike, for in them they can 
study, and enjoy the feeling of Baha'i companionship which is, alas, 
usually lacking in their home communities, owing to the smallness of 
their numbers.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 July 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)</p>
<p>	Administration:</p>
<p>	80. The Baha'i summer schools were originated in America to meet the
 requirements of the friends. They have been adopted by other Baha'i 
Communities the world over, but there is no reason why they should be 
called "summer schools". There is nothing rigid about the term, it is 
purely descriptive. The Guardian feels that although you can have the 
immediate affairs of your summer schools managed by a convenient Local 
Assembly, they should remain under the direct supervision of the 
National Spiritual Assembly as they are national in character and not 
purely local.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 December 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand)<br>

</p><p>	81. Regarding the summer schools in general: although there is 
no objection to their being under the direct management of a special 
Committee elected for that purpose, they must be generally supervised by
 the National Spiritual Assembly in respect to policy, etc. In other 
words they must be considered as a national and not a purely local 
institution....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 April 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand)</p>
<p>	82. Baha'i summer schools in the United States originated in the 
same informal manner as Yerrinbool; they were (and some still are) the 
property of individual believers who resided on them, but they are 
administered by Committees appointed by the National Spiritual Assembly 
and which usually include, out of courtesy and consideration, the 
owners. The American friends also desired to have many more summer 
schools, but the Guardian has so far not permitted them to add to the 
number, as it dissipates the energy and funds of the believers and would
 at present weaken those already existing.</p>

Teaching Conference, Copenhagen, Denmark, published in "Baha'i News" 236
 (October 1950), p. 1)</p>
<p>	84. As regards the question you asked about a Summer School, there 
is no reason why a property should either be rented or bought for this 
purpose. You can arrange to hold a Summer School in any suitable place 
where the friends can find accommodation, and a hall can be rented for 
its sessions. This is what they have done in England for many years to 
great advantage. It is a simple and economical way of holding the 
School. The<br>
 primary purpose of the School is to deepen the knowledge of the friends
 in the Teachings, to enable them to consort, as Baha'is, with each 
other, and to confirm any contacts who may have attended. The School may
 be held during the winter season or any other time of the year.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 June 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska and an individual 
believer)</p>
<p>	Courses and Curriculum:</p>
<p>	85. ... he sincerely trusts that these summer courses will serve to 
deepen the knowledge and the understanding of the friends and enable 
them to diffuse the teachings of the Faith to the struggling and almost 
hopeless world.</p>
<p>	The wide range of the topics that are to be discussed and studied by
 the friends cover most of the important aspects of the Cause and such a
 plan will undoubtedly give them a broad and a sound knowledge of the 
essentials of the Faith. Special stress, however, should be put on the 
history of the Movement as well as on the guiding principles of Baha'i 
Administration; for on these two points most of the believers are not 
adequately informed. It is, therefore, a great opportunity for them to 
strengthen the basis of their beliefs and to try to deepen their 
understanding of the basis of the present-day Baha'i administrative 
system.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 August 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	86. Definite courses should be given along the different phases of 
the Baha'i Faith and in a manner that will stimulate the students to 
proceed in their studies privately once they return home, for the period
 of a few days is not sufficient to learn everything. They have to be 
taught the habit of studying the Cause constantly, for the more we read 
the Words the more will the truth they contain be revealed to us.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 24 November 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	87. The basic purpose of all Baha'i summer schools, whether in East 
or West, is to give the believers the opportunity to fully acquaint 
themselves, not only by mere study but through whole-hearted and active<br>
 collaboration in various Baha'i activities, with the essentials of the 
Administration and in this way enable them to become efficient and able 
promoters of the Cause. The teaching of the Administration is, 
therefore, an indispensable feature of every Baha'i summer school and 
its special significance can be better understood if we realize the 
great need of every believer today for a more adequate understanding of 
the social principles and laws of the Faith. It is now, when the Cause 
is passing through some of the most difficult stages of its development,
 that the friends should equip themselves with the necessary knowledge 
of the Administration. The Guardian wishes you, therefore, to stress 
again, in all the coming summer schools, this vital point and in this 
way add to the effectiveness and success of your efforts along this 
line.</p>
<p>	Postscript in the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi;</p>
<p>	I certainly advise you to concentrate next year on "The 
Dawn-Breakers" as well as on the needs, the principles and the purpose 
of Baha'i Administration. The Cause in your land is still in its 
formative period. It needs men and women of vision, of capacity and 
understanding....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 September 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to two believers, published in "Baha'i News" 78 (November 1933),
 p. 4)</p>
<p>	88. He feels that in your next summer meetings continued emphasis 
should be laid upon the teaching of the administration, especially in 
its relation to the outside world, so as to impress the non-Baha'i 
attendants at the School with the nature, character and world 
significance of the World Order of Baha'u'llah. The teaching of the 
Administration should, indeed, be considered as forming a permanent and 
vital feature of every Baha'i summer school. For upon its thorough and 
intelligent understanding by the entire community of the believers must 
inevitably depend the effectiveness and continued expansion of Baha'i 
activities throughout the world.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 November 1934 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	89. With regard to the School's programme for the next summer: 
the Guardian would certainly advise, and even urge the friends to make a
 thorough study of the Qur'an, as the knowledge of this Sacred Scripture
 is absolutely indispensable for every believer who wishes to adequately
 understand, and intelligently read the Writings of Baha'u'llah. 
Although there are very few persons among our Western Baha'is who are 
capable of handling such a course in a scholarly way yet, the mere lack 
of such competent teachers should encourage and stimulate the believers 
to get better acquainted with the Sacred Scriptures of Islam. In this 
way, there will gradually appear some distinguished Baha'is who will be 
so well versed in the teaching of Islam as to be able to guide the 
believers in their study of that religion.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 2 December 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the Central States Summer School Committee and an individual 
believer)</p>
<p>	90. As regards the study courses for the next year's session: the 
Guardian wishes you to cover the same subjects, namely the 
Administrative Order and Islam, but feels that these should be studied 
through more detailed and concentrated examination of all their aspects.
 An effort should be made to raise the standard of studies, so as to 
provide the Baha'i student with a thorough knowledge of the Cause that 
would enable him to expound it befittingly to the educated public.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 November 1937 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	91. The course on character building, ... the Guardian feels, is 
particularly important and should be given due emphasis and studied 
carefully and thoroughly, especially by the young believers in 
attendance at the school. These standards of Baha'i conduct, which he 
himself has set forth in his last general epistle, "The Advent of Divine
 Justice", and which it should be the paramount duty of every loyal and 
conscientious believer to endeavour to uphold and promote, deserve 
serious study and meditation, and should constitute the main central 
theme of this year's programme at all the three Baha'i Summer Schools in
 the States.</p>
<p>	Since the purpose of the Summer School is not only to impart 
knowledge of the Teachings, but to infuse in the hearts of all those 
present such spirit as will enable them to translate the ideals of the 
Cause into<br>
 daily deeds of constructive spiritual living, it is more than fitting 
therefore that this year's meetings should be principally devoted to the
 study of Baha'i morals, not only in their theoretical aspect, but first
 and foremost in their relation to the present-day needs and 
requirements of Baha'i community life.</p>
<p>	The principles and methods laid down by the Guardian in his "Advent 
of Divine Justice" on the vital subject of Baha'i ethics should indeed 
prove of valuable inspiration and guidance to all the students and 
friends attending the Summer School classes, and thus prepare them to 
better appreciate the privileges, and more adequately discharge the 
responsibilities, of their citizenship in the World Order of 
Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 May 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	92. ... there is as yet no such thing as a Baha'i curriculum, and 
there are no Baha'i publications exclusively devoted to this subject, 
since the teachings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha do not present a 
definite and detailed educational system, but simply offer certain basic
 principles and set forth a number of teaching ideals that should guide 
future Baha'i educationalists in their efforts to formulate an adequate 
teaching curriculum which would be in full harmony with the spirit of 
the Baha'i Teachings, and would thus meet the requirements and needs of 
the modern age.</p>
<p>	These basic principles are available in the sacred writings of the 
Cause, and should be carefully studied, and gradually incorporated in 
various college and university programmes. But the task of formulating a
 system of education which would be officially recognized by the Cause, 
and enforced as such throughout the Baha'i world is one which [the] 
present-day generation of believers cannot obviously undertake, and 
which has to be gradually accomplished by Baha'i scholars and 
educationalists of the future.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 7 June 1939 written of behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	93. He feels ... that some of the courses are not sufficiently 
Baha'i in nature, but carry the student off into an unnecessary study of
 special techniques -- history, psychology or whatever it may be, which 
however<br>
 valuable these topics may be in training the human mind and fitting the
 individual for contact with others, are a waste of time, in view of the
 very limited period that most of the Baha'is spend at a Baha'i summer 
school.</p>
<p>	The friends should concentrate on deepening their grasp of the 
Teachings, particularly on studying what has already been done, and what
 must be done to fulfil the goals of this World Crusade.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 May 1954 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	94. He thinks the less time spend on such topics as "Current Events 
in the Light of the Baha'i Faith", and "The Baha'i Faith and Modern 
Science", the better. There is no harm in having an evening lecture by a
 qualified speaker once on each of these subjects, but he certainly does
 not feel that much time should be spent on them, for the very simple 
reason that there is so little that can be said on the subject. The 
Baha'is are not scientists, and cannot very well go into details of the 
relation of the Baha'i Faith to modern science; and "Current Events in 
the Light of the Baha'i Faith" is also a topic which can be dealt with 
briefly.</p>
<p>	He feels that the most important thing for the Baha'i Schools all 
over the world at present to do is to strongly impress upon the Baha'i 
attendants the urgency of arising, not only to fulfil pioneer goals and 
to consolidate the work on the home front, which is getting weaker every
 year instead of stronger, but also to bring home to the friends the 
necessity of dispersing.</p>
<p>	The Baha'is must realize that they belong to a world-wide Order, and
 not an American civilization. They must try and introduce the Baha'i 
atmosphere of life and thought into their Summer Schools, rather than 
making the Summer School an episode and a pleasant vacation period, 
during which they learn a little more about the Faith.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 May 1954 written on behalf of the Shoghi 
Effendi to the Green Acre Program Committee of the National Spiritual 
Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	95. Through the intensive study of Baha'i Scriptures and of the 
early history of the Faith; through the organization of courses on the 
teachings and history of Islam; through conferences for the promotion of<br>
 inter-racial amity; through laboratory courses designed to familiarize 
the participants with the processes of the Baha'i Administrative Order; 
through special sessions devoted to Youth and child training; through 
classes in public speaking; through lectures on Comparative Religion; 
through group discussion on the manifold aspects of the Faith; through 
the establishment of libraries; through teaching classes; through 
courses on Baha'i ethics and on Latin America; through the introduction 
of winter school sessions; through forums and devotional gatherings; 
through plays and pageants; through picnics and other recreational 
activities, these schools, open to Baha'is and non-Baha'is alike, have 
set so noble an example as to inspire other Baha'i communities in 
Persia, in the British Isles, in Germany, in Australia, in New Zealand, 
in India, in 'Iraq and in Egypt to undertake the initial measures 
designed to enable them to build along the same lines institutions that 
bid fair to evolve into the Baha'i universities of the future.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, "God Passes By" p. 341)</p>
<p>	Teaching the Public and Attracting Ethnic Minorities:</p>
<p>	96. The Summer Schools provide a splendid setting and environment to
 which the best element among the coloured race should be specially 
attracted. Through such association prejudice can be gradually 
eradicated, and 'Abdu'l-Baha's ardent wish fully realized.</p>
<p>	The Guardian finds it impossible to overestimate the importance and 
urgency of this sacred duty that confronts both the Local and the 
National Assemblies.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 July 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and 
Canada)</p>
<p>	97. The Guardian welcomes your suggestion to extend to various 
groups and clubs in Davison and the adjoining centres, whom you find to 
be well disposed and sympathetic towards the Faith, an invitation to 
attend certain special meetings at the Louhelen Summer School. He will 
pray that this plan you have conceived may result in further 
intensifying the campaign of teaching throughout those regions.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 27 January 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)<br>

</p><p>	98. He hopes your Committee will continue to endeavour in 
raising the standard, both intellectual and spiritual, of the school, 
and make it an attractive centre not only to the believers but 
especially to non-Baha'is. It is, indeed, the teaching value of the 
school which you should particularly emphasize. The courses, lectures 
and general activities conducted by the friends should be arranged in 
such a way as to attract the attention of the outside public to the 
Cause. The Summer School is a high occasion for teaching the Message.</p>
<p>	Through daily association with the believers, non-Baha'is will come 
to see the Cause functioning as an active and living community entirely 
dedicated to the service of what is best and highest in the world. The 
lectures will familiarize them with the principles underlying the New 
World Order, while their participation in the social life of the 
believers will enable them to see the way in which these very same 
principles are put into operation.</p>
<p>	This is the aspect of the Summer School which the Guardian wishes 
your Committee to stress. He is confident that thereby the teaching work
 will receive a powerful impetus.</p>
<p>	As regards the courses, he would advise you to continue laying 
emphasis on the history and teaching of Islam, and in particular on the 
Islamic origins of the Faith.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 October 1936 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	99. He was delighted to hear of the great success your "Winter 
Institute for Baha'i Education" met with. Such progressive activities, 
especially when carried on in co- operation with local people who are 
not Baha'is, do a great deal of good, and not only expand the knowledge 
of the believers themselves but bring the Faith before the public in an 
excellent light....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 9 February 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Phoenix, Arizona)</p>
<p>	Youth Activities:</p>
<p>	100. Indeed it is very important for the Faith, to extend the 
teachings of Baha'u'llah amongst the youth, as it is through their 
activities, that the Cause of our Beloved Master will in future spread 
all over the American continent. They have upon their shoulders all the 
responsibilities for the<br>
 progress of the Movement; it is our duty to rear their spiritual 
feelings, enlighten their hearts with the light of guidance which has 
been shed before us by the Master.</p>
<p>	The Guardian was pleased to learn of the interest and sympathetic 
understanding which are growing amongst these students. He hopes that, 
through your help, you will every year widen the scope of their 
activities and give them fresh opportunities to their sincere endeavours
 to spread the teachings.</p>
<p>	Postscript in the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	I wish to urge the necessity of concentrating, at your next summer 
session, on the systematic study of the early history and principles of 
the Faith, on public speaking, and on a thorough discussion, both 
formally and informally, of various aspects of the Cause. These I regard
 as essential preliminaries to a future intensive campaign of teaching 
in which the rising generation must engage, if the spread of the Cause 
is to be assured in that land. May you succeed in your efforts to attain
 that goal!</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 2 November 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)</p>
<p>	101. He would advise you, however, to devote some more of your time 
to active teaching in public. To that end he would urge you to attend, 
if possible, all the sessions and meetings at the Geyserville Summer 
School, that you may not only deepen your knowledge of the Teachings, 
but also acquire the necessary training for expounding them to the 
public. The ambition of every young Baha'i should be, indeed, to become a
 well-informed and competent teacher. For this very purpose the 
institution of [the] Baha'i Summer School has been established, and its 
importance so strongly and repeatedly emphasized by the Guardian.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 June 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	102. The obligation to teach is essentially the responsibility of 
young believers. Their whole training should therefore be directed in 
such a way as to make them competent teachers. It is for this very 
purpose Baha'i summer schools, which constitute the very basis upon 
which the Baha'i<br>
 universities of the future will be established, should be widely attended by young believers.</p>
<p>	The Guardian would appeal to each and every member of your group to 
do his utmost to be present at least in one of the three summer schools 
now existing in the States. And for those young believers who will be 
travelling abroad during the summer months it is always possible to 
attend the German Baha'i Summer School at Esslingen.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 15 May written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Baha'i Youth Groups in the United States)</p>
<p>	103. Remembering the strong emphasis repeatedly laid by the Guardian
 on the importance of the institution of the summer school, both as a 
centre for the preparation and training of prospective teachers and 
pioneers, and for the commingling and fellowship of various elements in 
the Baha'i Community, the Baha'i Youth, on whom Louhelen Ranch has 
exercised a particular and indeed irresistible appeal, and whose 
sessions they have so frequently and in such large numbers attended, 
have a peculiar responsibility to shoulder in connection with its 
development into that ideal Baha'i University of the future, which 
should be the aim of every existing Baha'i Summer School to establish in
 the fullness of time.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 29 July 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Louhelen School)</p>
<p>	104. As regards the questions you asked him: There is nothing in the
 teachings against dancing, and any arrangements for it at Summer 
Schools, etc., are left to the discretion of the Committee or Assembly 
in charge to make.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 24 February 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Pioneers and Pioneering:</p>
<p>	105. ... it should be the main concern of the teaching bodies in 
charge of the Central and South American teaching campaign to provide 
all such prospective pioneers with the fullest opportunity not only to 
acquire a perfect mastery of Spanish, but in addition to familiarize 
themselves, as thoroughly as possible, with the history, customs, and 
the social and religious background and traditions of the people in 
these Latin<br>
 American countries. The Summer School, one of whose chief aims is to 
train and prepare the believers to become well- qualified and competent 
teachers, offers indeed good prospects of developing into a training 
ground for all prospective Central and South American Baha'i pioneers, 
and it would be therefore most opportune if the Committees in charge of 
our three Summer Schools decide to start classes for the teaching of 
Spanish, and of any such subjects as would be helpful for teaching in 
Spanish-speaking countries.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 29 July 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	106. He was pleased to hear that you were able to attend the Summer 
School at Geyserville this year, as these institutions are of the 
greatest help to the friends and inspire them to carry on their often 
lonely pioneer work with renewed zeal.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 November 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	107. Nor should any occasion be neglected by the pioneers of 
attending, if their personal circumstances permit, either the British or
 German Baha'i summer schools, and of forging such links with these 
institutions as will not only assist them in the discharge of their 
duties, but enable them to initiate, when the time is ripe, an 
institution of a similar character, under the auspices of the European 
Teaching Committee - an institution which will be the forerunner of the 
summer schools that will have to be founded separately by the future 
Assemblies in their respective countries....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 June 1947 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of the West)</p>
<p>	Prospects for the Future:</p>
<p>	108. Shoghi Effendi hopes that your summer school will increasingly 
develop and will become an important centre for the spread of the 
Message. You should try to raise its intellectual as well as its 
spiritual standard and to pave the way for its future development into 
one of the foremost Baha'i universities in the West. Much stress should 
be laid on the thorough study of the history and of the teachings of the
 Cause, and<br>
 particularly of the nature, basis and outstanding features of the Administration....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 1 October 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of Esslingen, Germany)</p>
<p>	109. He was also very pleased to hear that the Summer School is 
becoming an institution of national importance, and that the friends are
 increasingly attending it and realizing its great value in the life of 
the entire Community of believers. In a country such as India it might 
grow to be the first permanent institution of Baha'i learning if the 
believers support it sufficiently and carry out their teaching campaign 
with whole-hearted devotion and zeal; for, with the influx of many new 
Baha'is into the Cause in that country, it should not be difficult to 
evolve it into a Baha'i university as time goes by.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 10 January 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	TEACHING INSTITUTES</p>
<p>	Teaching Institutes:</p>
<p>	110. This is essentially an activity aimed at deepening the 
knowledge of the friends to prepare them for active participation in the
 teaching work. In some countries it may continue to be an activity 
conducted either in local Baha'i Centres or possibly housed in hired 
quarters, like most Summer Schools. However, in other countries, and 
particularly in mass teaching areas, it may have to be a modest 
structure acquired or erected in the rural areas where the majority of 
the believers reside rather than in capital cities, to obviate 
transportation expenses for those attending.</p>
<p>	(From a circular letter dated 14 May 1964 written by the Universal House of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	111. The material to be taught is prepared ahead of time, presented in simple language, and translated into the vernacular.</p>
<p>	. . .</p>
<p>	The subjects taught usually consist of Baha'i History, Laws and 
Teachings and the Administrative Order. Special emphasis is laid upon<br>
 living the Baha'i life, the importance of teaching, prayer, fasting, 
Nineteen Day Feasts, Baha'i elections, and contribution to the Fund.</p>
<p>	(Prepared for inclusion with a letter dated 24 December 1964 written
 by the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of
 Guatemala)</p>
<p>	112. We are happy to note plans for the Institute, but we feel that 
it would not be appropriate to issue a certificate for those who have 
completed the course. Instead, if you can afford it and if you feel it 
would be suitable you might give those who complete the course a 
pamphlet or piece of Baha'i literature with an appropriate inscription.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 July 1965 written by the Universal House of 
Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Indian Ocean)</p>
<p>	113. We have also noted that you intend to give graduation diplomas 
to the friends who attend the institutes. Your desire to acknowledge 
devoted attendance at the institutes is most commendable, but we feel it
 would be preferable in future to give a suitable gift, such as a book, 
rather than a diploma. From experience in other areas of the world we 
have learned that such diplomas sometimes are misused by their 
recipients. For this reason we have discouraged their use.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 27 October 1965 written by the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Guatemala)</p>
<p>	114. Teaching Institutes activities may be carried on in the 
Haziratu'l-Quds as long as necessary, but you should keep in mind the 
goal of eventually acquiring a Teaching Institute elsewhere.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 January 1968 written by the Universal House 
of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Gilbert and Ellice 
Islands)</p>
<p>	115. We greatly appreciate your desire to serve the Cause and at the
 same time honour the beloved Hand of the Cause and wonder whether more 
feasible plans would appeal to you. For instance, you might consider 
establishing a fund to maintain Baha'i tutors in villages, who would 
teach not only reading and writing but the elements of the Faith as 
well. We have always stressed to those National Spiritual Assemblies 
which establish Teaching Institutes that at the present time such an 
Institute is a function and not necessarily a building and there are 
many places where such<br>
 educational work can be pursued if a number of teachers can be 
supported. On the other hand, we have no idea of the size of the 
principal you have in mind for your endowment and wonder whether a very 
simple school where not only children but adult literary classes could 
be held, would meet your intention.</p>

</p><p>	A CHASTE AND HOLY LIFE</p>
<p>	A Compilation Prepared by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	Such a chaste and holy life, with its implications of modesty, 
purity, temperance, decency, and clean-mindedness, involves no less than
 the exercise of moderation in all that pertains to dress, language, 
amusements, and all artistic and literary avocations. It demands daily 
vigilance in the control of one's carnal desires and corrupt 
inclinations. It calls for the abandonment of a frivolous conduct, with 
its excessive attachment to trivial and often misdirected pleasures. It 
requires total abstinence from all alcoholic drinks, from opium, and 
from similar habit-forming drugs. It condemns the prostitution of art 
and of literature, the practices of nudism and of companionate marriage,
 infidelity in marital relationships, and all manner of promiscuity, of 
easy familiarity, and of sexual vices....</p>

<p>	THE BAHA'I STANDARD</p>
<p>	The Nature of Baha'i Law:</p>
<p>	116. They whom God hath endued with insight will readily recognize 
that the precepts laid down by God constitute the highest means for the 
maintenance of order in the world and the security of its peoples....</p>
<p>	O ye peoples of the world! Know assuredly that My commandments are 
the lamps of My loving providence among My servants, and the keys of My 
mercy for My creatures. Thus hath it been sent down from the heaven of 
the Will of your Lord, the Lord of Revelation....</p>
<p>	Say: From My laws the sweet smelling savour of My garment can be 
smelled, and by their aid the standards of victory will be planted upon 
the highest peaks. The Tongue of My power hath, from the heaven of My 
omnipotent glory, addressed to My creation these words: "Observe My 
commandments, for the love of My beauty." Happy is the lover that hath 
inhaled the divine fragrance of his Best-Beloved from these words, laden
 with the perfume of a grace which no tongue can describe. By My life! 
He who hath drunk the choice wine of fairness from the hands of My 
bountiful favour, will circle around My commandments that shine above 
the Dayspring of My creation.</p>
<p>	Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay, 
rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and 
power. To this beareth witness that which the Pen of Revelation hath 
revealed. Meditate upon this, O men of insight!...</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), sec. 155, pp. 331-333)</p>
<p>	117. Just as there are laws governing our physical lives, requiring 
that we must supply our bodies with certain foods, maintain them within a
 certain range of temperatures, and so forth, if we wish to avoid 
physical disabilities, so also there are laws governing our spiritual 
lives. These laws are revealed to mankind in each age by the 
Manifestation of God, and obedience to them is of vital importance if 
each human being, and mankind in general, is to develop properly and 
harmoniously. Moreover, these various aspects are interdependent. If an 
individual violates the spiritual laws for his own development he will 
cause injury not only to<br>
 himself but to the society in which he lives. Similarly, the condition 
of society has a direct effect on the individuals who must live within 
it.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 February 1973 written by the Universal House 
of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies, published in "Messages 
from the Universal House of Justice 1968-1973" (Wilmette: Baha'i 
Publishing Trust, 1976), pp. 105-6)</p>
<p>	118. We have considered your several letters and have noted your 
questions, and your view that many Baha'i youth in ... are confused, and
 are pleading for guidance in simple clear language on how to meet daily
 situations, particularly those involving sex.</p>
<p>	It is neither possible nor desirable for the Universal House of 
Justice to set forth a set of rules covering every situation. Rather is 
it the task of the individual believer to determine, according to his 
own prayerful understanding of the Writings, precisely what his course 
of conduct should be in relation to situations which he encounters in 
his daily life. If he is to fulfil his true mission in life as a 
follower of the Blessed Perfection, he will pattern his life according 
to the Teachings. The believer cannot attain this objective merely by 
living according to a set of rigid regulations. When his life is 
oriented toward service to Baha'u'llah, and when every conscious act is 
performed within this frame of reference, he will not fail to achieve 
the true purpose of his life.</p>
<p>	Therefore, every believer must continually study the sacred Writings
 and the instructions of the beloved Guardian, striving always to attain
 a new and better understanding of their import to him and to his 
society. He should pray fervently for Divine Guidance, wisdom and 
strength to do what is pleasing to God, and to serve Him at all times 
and to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 October 1968 written by the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	119. As to chastity, this is one of the most challenging concepts to
 get across in this very permissive age, but Baha'is must make the 
utmost effort to uphold Baha'i standards, no matter how difficult they 
may seem at first. Such efforts will be made easier if the youth will 
understand that the laws and standards of the Faith are meant to free 
them from untold spiritual<br>
 and moral difficulties in the same way that a proper appreciation of 
the laws of nature enables one to live in harmony with the forces of the
 planet.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 January 1985 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	True Liberty</p>
<p>	120. Consider the pettiness of men's minds. They ask for that which 
injureth them, and cast away the thing that profiteth them....</p>
<p>	Know ye that the embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the animal.
 That which beseemeth man is submission unto such restraints as will 
protect him from his own ignorance, and guard him against the harm of 
the mischief-maker. Liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of 
propriety, and to infringe on the dignity of his station. It debaseth 
him to the level of extreme depravity and wickedness.</p>
<p>	Regard men as a flock of sheep that need a shepherd for their 
protection. This, verily, is the truth, the/certain truth. We approve of
 liberty in certain circumstances, and refuse to sanction it in others. 
We, verily, are the All- Knowing.</p>
<p>	Say: True liberty consisteth in man's submission unto My 
commandments, little as ye know it. Were men to observe that which We 
have sent down unto them from the Heaven of Revelation, they would, of a
 certainty, attain unto perfect liberty. Happy is the man that hath 
apprehended the Purpose of God in whatever He hath revealed from the 
Heaven of His Will, that pervadeth all created things. Say: The liberty 
that profiteth you is to be found nowhere except in complete servitude 
unto God, the Eternal Truth. Whoso hath tasted of its sweetness will 
refuse to barter it for all the dominion of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 159, pp. 335-36)</p>
<p>	121. ...with regard to the peoples who clamour for freedom: the 
moderate freedom which guarantees the welfare of the world of mankind 
and maintains and preserves the universal relationships, is found in its
 fullest power and extension in the teachings of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982, sec. 227, p. 305)<br>

</p><p>	The Baha' Standard of Chastity:</p>
<p>	122. The chosen ones of God ... should not look at the depraved 
condition of the society in which they live, nor at the evidences of 
moral degradation and frivolous conduct which the people around them 
display. They should not content themselves merely with relative 
distinction and excellence. Rather they should fix their gaze upon 
nobler heights by setting the counsels and exhortations of the Pen of 
Glory as their supreme goal. Then it will be readily realized how 
numerous are the stages that still remain to be traversed and how far 
off the desired goal lies -- a goal which is none other than 
exemplifying heavenly morals and virtues.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 October 1924 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihran, translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	123. It must be remembered, however, that the maintenance of such a 
high standard of moral conduct is not to be associated or confused with 
any form of asceticism, or of excessive and bigoted puritanism. The 
standard inculcated by Baha'u'llah, seeks, under no circumstances, to 
deny anyone the legitimate right and privilege to derive the fullest 
advantage and benefit from the manifold joys, beauties, and pleasures 
with which the world has been so plentifully enriched by an All-Loving 
Creator. "Should a man," Baha'u'llah Himself reassures us, "wish to 
adorn himself with the ornaments of the earth, to wear its apparels, or 
partake of the benefits it can bestow, no harm can befall him, if he 
alloweth nothing whatever to intervene between him and God, for God hath
 ordained every good thing, whether created in the heavens or in the 
earth, for such of His servants as truly believe in Him. Eat ye, O 
people, of the good things which God hath allowed you, and deprive not 
yourselves from His wondrous bounties. Render thanks and praise unto 
Him, and be of them that are truly thankful."</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 33)</p>
<p>	124. The Baha'i standard is very high, more particularly when 
compared with the thoroughly rotten morals of the present world. But 
this standard of ours will produce healthier, happier, nobler people, 
and induce stabler marriages....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 October 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	A CHASTE AND HOLY LIFE</p>
<p>	Definition:</p>
<p>	125. Such a chaste and holy life, with its implications of modesty, 
purity, temperance, decency, and clean-mindedness, involves no less than
 the exercise of moderation in all that pertains to dress, language, 
amusements, and all artistic and literary avocations. It demands daily 
vigilance in the control of one's carnal desires and corrupt 
inclinations. It calls for the abandonment of a frivolous conduct, with 
its excessive attachment to trivial and often misdirected pleasures. It 
requires total abstinence from all alcoholic drinks, from opium, and 
from similar habit-forming drugs. It condemns the prostitution of art 
and of literature, the practices of nudism and of companionate marriage,
 infidelity in marital relationships, and all manner of promiscuity, of 
easy familiarity, and of sexual vices. It can tolerate no compromise 
with the theories, the standards, the habits, and the excesses of a 
decadent age. Nay rather it seeks to demonstrate, through the dynamic 
force of its example, the pernicious character of such theories, the 
falsity of such standards, the hollowness of such claims, the perversity
 of such habits, and the sacrilegious character of such excesses.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 30)</p>
<p>	126. He is My true follower who, if he come to a valley of pure 
gold, will pass straight through it aloof as a cloud, and will neither 
turn back, nor pause. Such a man is, assuredly, of Me. From his garment 
the Concourse on high can inhale the fragrance of sanctity.... And if he
 met the fairest and most comely of women, he would not feel his heart 
seduced by the least shadow of desire for her beauty. Such an one, 
indeed, is the creation of spotless chastity. Thus instructeth you the 
Pen of the Ancient of Days, as bidden by your Lord, the Almighty, the 
All-Bountiful.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, sec. 60, p. 118)</p>
<p>	127. Purity and chastity have been, and still are, the most great 
ornaments for the handmaidens of God. God is My Witness! The brightness 
of the light of chastity sheddeth its illumination upon the worlds of 
the spirit, and its fragrance is wafted even unto the Most Exalted 
Paradise....</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 32)<br>

</p><p>	128. Concerning the positive aspects of chastity the Universal 
House of Justice states that the Baha'i Faith recognizes the value of 
the sex impulse and holds that the institution of marriage has been 
established as the channel of its rightful expression. Baha'is do not 
believe that the sex impulse should be suppressed but that it should be 
regulated and controlled.</p>
<p>	Chastity in no way implies withdrawal from human relationships. It 
liberates people from the tyranny of the ubiquity of sex. A person who 
is in control of his sexual impulses is enabled to have profound and 
enduring friendships with many people, both men and women, without ever 
sullying that unique and priceless bond that should unite man and wife.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 May 1979 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Moderation:</p>
<p>	Whatsoever passeth beyond the limits of moderation will cease to 
exert a beneficial influence. Consider for instance such things as 
liberty, civilization and the like. However much men of understanding 
may favourably regard them, they will, if carried to excess, exercise a 
pernicious influence upon men.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 169)</p>
<p>	129. The choice of clothing and the cut of the beard and its 
dressing are left to the discretion of men. But beware, O people, lest 
ye make yourselves the playthings of the ignorant.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab- i-Aqdas", p. 23)</p>
<p>	130. Human utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its 
influence and needeth moderation. As to its influence, this is 
conditional upon refinement which in turn is dependent upon hearts which
 are detached and pure. As to its moderation, this hath to be combined 
with tact and wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures and Tablets.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 172)<br>

</p><p>	131. We have permitted you to listen to music and singing. 
Beware lest such listening cause you to transgress the bounds of decency
 and dignity. Rejoice in the joy of My Most Great Name through which the
 hearts are enchanted and the minds of the well-favoured are attracted.</p>
<p>	("Baha'u'llah, from a Tablet -- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	132. ...In the teachings there is nothing against dancing, but the 
friends should remember that the standard of Baha'u'llah is modesty and 
chastity. The atmosphere of modern dance halls, where so much smoking 
and drinking and promiscuity goes on, is very bad, but decent dances are
 not harmful in themselves. There is certainly no harm in classical 
dancing or learning dancing in school. There is also no harm in taking 
part in dramas. Likewise in cinema acting. The harmful thing, nowadays, 
is not the art itself but the unfortunate corruption which often 
surrounds these arts. As Baha'is we need avoid none of the arts, but 
acts and the atmosphere that sometimes go with these professions we 
should avoid.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 June 1952 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to a National Spiritual Assembly of India, Pakistan and Burma)</p>
<p>	Daily Vigilance of Actions:</p>
<p>	133. Arise, O people, and, by the power of God's might, resolve to 
gain the victory over your own selves, that haply the whole earth may be
 freed and sanctified from its servitude to the gods of its idle fancies
 - gods that have inflicted such loss upon, and are responsible for the 
misery of, their wretched worshippers. These idols form the obstacle 
that impedeth man in his efforts to advance in the path of perfection.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 43, p. 93)</p>
<p>	O SON OF BEING!</p>
<p>	134. Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to a 
reckoning; for death, unheralded, shall come upon thee and thou shalt be
 called to give account for thy deeds.</p>
<p>	("The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah, Arabic no.31, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1985), p. 11)</p>
<p>	135. For desire is a flame that has reduced to ashes uncounted 
lifetime harvests of the learned, a devouring fire that even the vast 
sea of their<br>
 accumulated knowledge could never quench. How often has it happened 
that an individual who was graced with every attribute of humanity and 
wore the jewel of true understanding, nevertheless followed after his 
passions until his excellent qualities passed beyond moderation and he 
was forced into excess. His pure intentions changed to evil ones, his 
attributes were no longer put to uses worthy of them, and the power of 
his desires turned him aside from righteousness and its rewards into 
ways that were dangerous and dark. A good character is in the sight of 
God and His chosen ones and the possessors of insight, the most 
excellent and praiseworthy of all things, but always on condition that 
its centre of emanation should be reason and knowledge and its base 
should be true moderation....</p>
<p>	("The Secret of Divine Civilization", 2nd ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), pp. 59-60)</p>
<p>	Abandonment of Frivolous Conduct:</p>
<p>	O MY FRIEND!</p>
<p>	136. Thou art the day-star of the heavens of My holiness, let not 
the defilement of the world eclipse thy splendour. Rend asunder the veil
 of heedlessness, that from behind the clouds thou mayest emerge 
resplendent and array all things with the apparel of life.</p>
<p>	("The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah", Persian no. 73, p. 47)</p>
<p>	137. Disencumber yourselves of all attachment to this world and the 
vanities thereof. Beware that ye approach them not, inasmuch as they 
prompt you to walk after your own lusts and covetous desires, and hinder
 you from entering the straight and glorious Path.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 128, p. 276)</p>
<p>	138. On page 25[1] of "The Advent of Divine Justice" the beloved 
Guardian is describing the requirements not only of chastity, but of "a 
chaste and holy life" -- both the adjectives are important. One of the 
signs of a decadent society, a sign which is very evident in the world 
today, is an almost frenetic devotion to pleasure and diversion, an 
insatiable thirst for<br>
 amusement, a fanatical devotion to games and sport, a reluctance to 
treat any matter seriously, and a scornful, derisory attitude towards 
virtue and solid worth. Abandonment of "a frivolous conduct" does not 
imply that a Baha'i must be sour-faced or perpetually solemn. Humour, 
happiness,joy are characteristics of a true Baha'i life. Frivolity palls
 and eventually leads to boredom and emptiness, but true happiness and 
joy and humour that are parts of a balanced life that includes serious 
thought, compassion and humble servitude to God, are characteristics 
that enrich life and add to its radiance.<br>

<p>	Shoghi Effendi's choice of words was always significant, and each 
one is important in understanding his guidance. In this particular 
passage, he does not forbid "trivial" pleasures, but he does warn 
against "excessive attachment" to them and indicates that they can often
 be "misdirected". One is reminded of 'Abdu'l-Baha's caution that we 
should not let a pastime become a waste of time.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 May 1979 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Alcohol:</p>
<p>	139. Become ye intoxicated with the wine of the love of God, and not
 with that which deadeneth your minds, O ye that adore Him! Verily, it 
hath been forbidden unto every believer, whether man or woman....</p>
<p>(Baha'u'llah, cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine<br>
Justice", p. 33)</p>
<p>	140. The drinking of wine is, according to the text of the Most Holy
 Book, forbidden; for it is the cause of chronic diseases, weakeneth the
 nerves, and consumeth the mind.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 33)</p>
<p>	Drugs:</p>
<p>	141. As to opium, it is foul and accursed. God protect us from the 
punishment He inflicteth on the user. According to the explicit Text of 
the Most Holy Book, it is forbidden, and its use is utterly condemned. 
Reason showeth that smoking opium is a kind of insanity, and experience 
attesteth that the user is completely cut off from the human kingdom. 
May God protect all against the perpetration of an act so hideous as 
this, an act which layeth in ruins the very foundation of what it is to 
be human,<br>
 and which causeth the user to be dispossessed for ever and ever. For 
opium fasteneth on the soul, so that the user's conscience dieth, his 
mind is blotted away, his perceptions are eroded. It turneth the living 
into the dead. It quencheth the natural heat. No greater harm can be 
conceived than that which opium inflicteth. Fortunate are they who never
 even speak the name of it; then think how wretched is the user.</p>
<p>	("Selection from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha, pp. 148-49)</p>
<p>	142. Regarding hashish, you had pointed out that some Persians have 
become habituated to its use. Gracious God! This is the worst of all 
intoxicants, and its prohibition is explicitly revealed. Its use causeth
 the disintegration of thought and the complete torpor of the soul. How 
could anyone seek this fruit of the infernal tree, and by partaking of 
it, be led to exemplify the qualities of a monster? How could one use 
this forbidden drug, and thus deprive himself of the blessings of the 
All-Merciful?...</p>
<p>	Alcohol consumeth the mind and causeth man to commit acts of 
absurdity, but ... this wicked hashish extinguisheth the mind, freezeth 
the spirit, petrifieth the soul, wasteth the body and leaveth man 
frustrated and lost.</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, from a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	143. Concerning the so-called "spiritual" virtues of the 
hallucinogens, ... spiritual stimulation should come from turning one's 
heart to Baha'u'llah, and not through physical means such as drugs and 
agents.</p>
<p>	From the description given in your letter it appears that 
hallucinogenic agents are a form of intoxicant. As the friends, 
including the youth, are required strictly to abstain from all forms of 
intoxicants, and are further expected conscientiously to obey the civil 
law of their country, it is obvious that they should refrain from using 
these drugs.</p>
<p>	A very great responsibility for the future peace and well- being of 
the world is borne by the youth of today. Let the Baha'i youth by the 
power of the Cause they espouse be the shining example for their 
companions.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 15 April 1965 written by the Universal House of
 Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	144. ... Baha'is should not use hallucinogenic agents, including 
LSD, peyote and similar substances, except when prescribed for medical<br>
 treatment. Neither should they become involved in experiments with such substances.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 January 1967 written by the Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	Baha'i Attitude Toward Sex:</p>
<p>	145. Briefly stated the Baha'i conception of sex is based on the 
belief that chastity should be strictly practiced by both sexes, not 
only because it is in itself highly commendable ethically, but also due 
to its being the only way to a happy and successful marital life. Sex 
relationships of any form, outside marriage, are not permissible 
therefore, and whoso violates this rule will not only be responsible to 
God, but will incur the necessary punishment from society.</p>
<p>	The Baha'i Faith recognizes the value of the sex impulse, but 
condemns its illegitimate and improper expression such as free love, 
companionate marriage and others, all of which it considers positively 
harmful to man and to the society in which he lives. The proper use of 
the sex instinct is the natural right of every individual, and it is 
precisely for this very purpose that the institution of marriage has 
been established. The Baha'is do not believe in the suppression of the 
sex impulse but in its regulation and control.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 September 1938 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	146. Concerning your question whether there are any legitimate forms
 of expression of the sex instinct outside of marriage; according to the
 Baha'i Teachings no sexual act can be considered lawful unless 
performed between lawfully married persons. Outside of marital life 
there can be no lawful or healthy use of the sex impulse. The Baha'i 
youth should, on the one hand, be taught the lesson of self- control 
which, when exercised, undoubtedly has a salutary effect on the 
development of character and of personality in general, and on the other
 should be advised, nay even encouraged, to contract marriage while 
still young and in full possession of their physical vigour. Economic 
factors, no doubt, are often a serious hindrance to early marriage, but 
in most cases are only an excuse, and as such should not be 
overstressed.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 13 December 1940 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	147. Chastity implies both before and after marriage an 
unsullied, chaste sex life. Before marriage absolutely chaste, after 
marriage absolutely faithful to one's chosen companion. Faithful in all 
sexual acts, faithful in word and in deed.</p>
<p>	The world today is submerged, amongst other things, in an 
over-exaggeration of the importance of physical love, and a dearth of 
spiritual values. In as far as possible the believers should try to 
realize this and rise above the level of their fellow-men who are, 
typical of all decadent periods in history, placing so much 
over-emphasis on the purely physical side of mating. Outside of their 
normal, legitimate married life they should seek to establish bonds of 
comradeship and love which are eternal and founded on the spiritual life
 of man, not on his physical life. This is one of the many fields in 
which it is incumbent on the Baha'is to set the example and lead the way
 to a true human standard of life, when the soul of man is exalted and 
his body but the tool for his enlightened spirit. Needless to say this 
does not preclude the living of a perfectly normal sex life in its 
legitimate channel of marriage.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 September 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Immoral Practices are Condemned:</p>
<p>	148. Ye are forbidden to commit adultery, sodomy and lechery. Avoid 
them, O concourse of the faithful. By the righteousness of God! Ye have 
been called into being to purge the world from the defilement of evil 
passions. This is what the Lord of all mankind hath enjoined upon you, 
could ye but perceive it. He who relateth himself to the All-Merciful 
and committeth satanic deeds, verily he is not of Me. Unto this beareth 
witness every atom, pebble, tree and fruit, and beyond them this 
ever-proclaiming, truthful and trustworthy Tongue.</p>
<p>	(Baha'u'llah, from a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	149. When we realize that Baha'u'llah says adultery retards the 
progress of the soul in the afterlife -- so grievous is it -- and that 
drinking destroys the mind, and not to so much as approach it, we see 
how clear are our teachings on these subjects.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 September 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	150. Amongst the many other evils afflicting society in this 
spiritual low-water mark in history is the question of immorality, and 
overemphasis of sex. Homosexuality, according to the Writings of 
Baha'u'llah, is spiritually condemned. This does not mean that people so
 afflicted must not be helped and advised and sympathized with. It does 
mean that we do not believe that it is a permissible way of life; which,
 alas, is all too often the accepted attitude nowadays.</p>
<p>	We must struggle against the evils in society by spiritual means, 
and by medical and social ones as well. We must be tolerant but 
uncompromising, understanding but immovable in our point of view.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 May 1954 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	151. A number of sexual problems, such as homosexuality and 
transsexuality can well have medical aspects, and in such cases recourse
 should certainly be had to the best medical assistance. But it is clear
 from the teaching of Baha'u'llah that homosexuality is not a condition 
to which a person should be reconciled, but is a distortion of his or 
her nature which should be controlled and overcome. This may require a 
hard struggle, but so also can be the struggle of a heterosexual person 
to control his or her desires. The exercise of self-control in this, as 
in so very many other aspects of life, has a beneficial effect on the 
progress of the soul. It should, moreover, be borne in mind that 
although to be married is highly desirable, and Baha'u'llah has strongly
 recommended it, it is not the central purpose of life. If a person has 
to wait a considerable period before finding a spouse, or if ultimately,
 he or she must remain single, it does not mean that he or she is 
thereby unable to fulfil his or her life's purpose.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 February 1973 written by the Universal House 
of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies, published in "Messages 
from the Universal House of Justice 1968-1973", pp. 110-11)</p>
<p>	152. Your letter asking for direct or indirect references in the 
Writings of the Faith to rape or sexual assault was referred to the 
Research Department, and we have been asked to convey to you the 
following comments.<br>

</p><p>	"Lechery" is clearly forbidden by Baha'u'llah (see "Epistle to 
the Son of the Wolf", p. 49) and Shoghi Effendi has stated that a 
"chaste and holy life", according to the teachings of the Faith, implies
 a condemnation of "all manner" of "sexual vices".</p>
<p>	(See "Advent of Divine Justice", p. 25.)[1]<br>
 [1  On page 25 in the 1956 U.S. Edition; on page 30 in the 1984 U.S. edition.]</p>
<p>	As to the contents of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, one of the provisions of 
that Most Holy Book is "not to indulge one's passions" (see "Synopsis 
and Codification of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 
50). Furthermore, reference should be made to one of the "prohibitions" 
mentioned on page 47 of the "Synopsis", namely "adultery". This word so 
appears in this book because entries in a synopsis should by necessity 
be brief, and by the original word used by Baha'u'llah in the Aqdas, 
i.e., "zina", adultery is generally and mainly intended. However, this 
by no means covers all the meanings of the concept of "zina" in legal 
language used in Arabic and Persian. One of the forms of "zina" -- i.e.,
 when the illicit sexual intercourse is performed through force or 
violence -- is rape or sexual assault.</p>
<p>	As to the punishments for such acts as rape, these will be determined in the future by the Universal House of Justice.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 June 1982 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Application of the Principle of a Chaste and Holy Life:</p>
<p>	153. ... [absolute chastity] is mainly and directly concerned with 
the Baha'i youth, who can contribute so decisively to the virility, the 
purity, and the driving force of the life of the Baha'i community, and 
upon whom must depend the future orientation of its destiny, and the 
complete unfoldment of the potentialities with which God has endowed 
it....</p>
<p>	As to a chaste and holy life it should be regarded as no less 
essential a factor that must contribute its proper share to the 
strengthening and vitalization of the Baha'i community, upon which must 
in turn depend the success of any Baha'i plan or enterprise.... All of 
them, be they men or women, must, at this threatening hour when the 
lights of religion are fading out, and its restraints are one by one 
being abolished, pause to<br>
 examine themselves, scrutinize their conduct, and with characteristic 
resolution arise to purge the life of their community of every trace of 
moral laxity that might stain the name, or impair the integrity, of so 
holy and precious a Faith.</p>
<p>	A chaste and holy life must be made the controlling principle in the
 behaviour and conduct of all Baha'is, both in their social relations 
with the members of their own community, and in their contact with the 
world at large. It must adorn and reinforce the ceaseless labours and 
meritorious exertions of those whose enviable position is to propagate 
the Message, and to administer the affairs, of the Faith of Baha'u'llah.
 It must be upheld, in all its integrity and implications, in every 
phase of the life of those who fill the ranks of that Faith, whether in 
their homes, their travels, their clubs, their societies, their 
entertainments, their schools, and their universities. It must be 
accorded special consideration in the conduct of the social activities 
of every Baha'i summer school and any other occasions on which Baha'i 
community life is organized and fostered. It must be closely and 
continually identified with the mission of the Baha'i youth, both as an 
element in the life of the Baha'i community, and as a factor in the 
future progress and orientation of the youth of their own country.</p>
<p>	("The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 22; pp. 29-30)</p>
<p>	THE POWER OF EXAMPLE</p>
<p>	A Praiseworthy Character:</p>
<p>	154. Whoso ariseth, in this Day, to aid Our Cause, and summoneth to 
his assistance the hosts of a praiseworthy character and upright 
conduct, the influence flowing from such an action will, most certainly,
 be diffused throughout the whole world.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, sec. 131, p. 287)</p>
<p>	155. A Baha'i is known by the attributes manifested by him, not by 
his name: he is recognized by his character, not by his person.</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, from a Tablet- translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	156. ...by upholding Baha'i law in the face of all difficulties 
we not only strengthen our own characters but influence those around us.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 February 1973 written by the Universal House 
of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies, published in "Messages 
from the Universal House of Justice 1968-1973", p. 107)</p>
<p>	The Importance of Deeds:</p>
<p>	O SON OF MY HANDMAID!</p>
<p>	157. Guidance hath ever been given bywords, and now it is given by 
deeds. Every one must show forth deeds that are pure and holy, for words
 are the property of all alike, whereas such deeds as these belong only 
to Our loved ones. Strive then with heart and soul to distinguish 
yourselves by your deeds. In this wise We counsel you in this holy and 
resplendent tablet.</p>
<p>("The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah", Persian no. 76, pp. 48-49)</p>
<p>	158. One righteous act is endowed with a potency that can so elevate
 the dust as to cause it to pass beyond the heaven of heavens. It can 
tear every bond asunder, and hath the power to restore the force that 
hath spent itself and vanished....</p>
<p>	Be pure, O people of God, be pure; be righteous, be righteous....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 131, p. 287)</p>
<p>	159. The Guardian has urged, over and over again, the paramount 
necessity for Baha'i Youth to exemplify the Teachings, most particularly
 the moral aspect of them. If they are not distinguished for their high 
conduct they cannot expect other young people to take the Cause very 
seriously.</p>
<p>	He heartily agrees with you that unless we practise the Teachings we
 cannot possibly expect the Faith to grow, because the fundamental 
purpose of all religions -- including our own -- is to bring man nearer 
to God, and to change his character, which is of the utmost importance. 
Too much emphasis is often laid on the social and economic aspects of 
the Teachings; but the moral aspect cannot be over- emphasized.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 September 1946 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	The Effect of Example:</p>
<p>	160. The betterment of the world can be accomplished through pure and goodly deeds, through commendable and seemly conduct....</p>
<p>	(Baha'u'llah, cited in "The Advent of Divine Justice", pp. 24-25)</p>
<p>	161. Let your acts be a guide unto all mankind, for the professions 
of most men, be they high or low, differ from their conduct. It is 
through your deeds that ye can distinguish yourselves from others. 
Through them the brightness of your light can be shed upon the whole 
earth. Happy is the man that heedeth My counsel, and keepeth the 
precepts prescribed by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All- Wise.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 139, p. 305)</p>
<p>	162. These are the days for rendering the divine Cause victorious 
and effective aid! The victory of God's Faith is dependent upon 
teaching; and teaching is conditional upon righteous actions and goodly 
deeds and conduct. The foundation-stone of a life lived in the way of 
God is the pursuit of moral excellence and the acquisition of a 
character endowed with qualities that are well-pleasing in His sight. 
The Baha'is should adorn themselves with this holy raiment; with this 
mighty sword they should conquer the citadels of men's hearts. People 
have grown weary and impatient of rhetoric and discourse, of preaching 
and sermonizing. In this day, the one thing that can deliver the world 
from its travail and attract the hearts of its peoples is deeds, not 
words; example, not precept; saintly virtues, not statements and 
charters issued by governments and nations on socio-political affairs. 
In all matters, great or small, word must be the complement of deed, and
 deed the companion of word: each must supplement, support and reinforce
 the other. It is in this respect that the Baha'is must seek 
distinction...</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 December 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is in Bombay - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	163. It is primarily through the potency of noble deeds and 
character, rather than by the power of exposition and proofs, that the 
friends of God should demonstrate to the world that what has been 
promised by God is bound to happen, that it is already taking place and 
that the divine glad- tidings are clear, evident and complete. For 
unless some illustrious<br>
 souls step forth into the arena of service and shine out resplendent in
 the assemblage of men, the task of vindicating the truth of this Cause 
before the eyes of enlightened people would be formidable indeed. 
However, if the friends become embodiments of virtue and good character,
 words and arguments will be superfluous. Their very deeds will well 
serve as eloquent testimony, and their noble conduct will ensure the 
preservation, integrity and glory of the Cause of God.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 December 1923 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the Baha'is of the East - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	164. There is no doubt that the standard of spotless chastity 
inculcated by Baha'u'llah in His teachings can be attained by the 
friends only when they stand forth firmly and courageously as 
uncompromising adherents of the Baha'i way of life, fully conscious that
 they represent teachings which are the very antithesis of the corrosive
 forces which are so tragically destroying the fabric of man's moral 
values. The present trend in modern society and its conflict with our 
challenging principles of moral conduct, far from influencing the 
believers to compromise their resolve to adhere undeviatingly to the 
standards of purity and chastity set forth for them by their Faith, must
 stimulate them to discharge their sacred obligations with determination
 and thus combat the evil forces undermining the foundations of 
individual morality.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 May 1966 written by the Universal House of Justice to two believers)</p>
<p>	165. It is the challenging task of the Baha'is to obey the law of 
God in their own lives, and gradually to win the rest of mankind to its 
acceptance.</p>
<p>	In considering the effect of obedience to the laws on individual 
lives, one must remember that the purpose of this life is to prepare the
 soul for the next. Here one must learn to control and direct one's 
animal impulses, not to be a slave to them. Life in this world is a 
succession of tests and achievements, of falling short and of making new
 spiritual advances. Sometimes the course may seem very hard, but one 
can witness, again and again, that the soul who steadfastly obeys the 
law of Baha'u'llah, however hard it may seem, grows spiritually, while 
the one who compromises with the law for the sake of his own apparent 
happiness is seen to have been following a chimera: he does not attain 
the happiness<br>
 he sought, he retards his spiritual advance and often brings new problems upon himself.</p>

<p>	CONSERVATION OF THE EARTH'S RESOURCES</p>
<p>	1. FOUNDATION PRINCIPLES</p>
<p>	The approach of the world-wide Baha'i community to the conservation 
and protection of the earth's resources is based on a number of 
fundamental principles derived from the Baha'i Writings. These include:</p>
<p>	1.1 NATURE AS A REFLECTION OF THE DIVINE</p>
<p>	Nature is held in high regard. Baha'u'llah states that the 
contemplation of nature creates an awareness of the "signs"[1] and 
"tokens"[2] of God and constitutes proof of His existence. Thus:</p>
<p>	...whatever I behold I readily discover that it maketh Thee known 
unto me, and it remindeth me of Thy signs, and of Thy tokens, and of Thy
 testimonies. By Thy glory! Every time I lift up mine eyes unto Thy 
heaven, I call to mind Thy highness and Thy loftiness, and Thine 
incomparable glory and greatness; and every time I turn my gaze to Thine
 earth, I am made to recognize the evidences of Thy power and the tokens
 of Thy bounty. And when I behold the sea, I find that it speaketh to me
 of Thy majesty, and of the potency of Thy might, and of Thy sovereignty
 and Thy grandeur. And at whatever time I contemplate the mountains, I 
am led to discover the ensigns of Thy victory and the standards of Thine
 omnipotence.[3]</p>
<p>	Nature reflects the "names and attributes of God".[4] It is the 
expression of "God's Will ... in ... the contingent world".[5] 
Baha'u'llah writes:</p>
<p>       Say: Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name,<br>
       the Maker, Creator. Its manifestations are diversified<br>
       by varying causes, and in this diversity there are signs<br>
       for men of discernment. Nature is God's Will and is its<br>
       expression in and through the contingent world. It is a<br>
       dispensation of Providence ordained by the Ordainer, the<br>
       All-Wise.[6]</p>
<p>	1.2 THE EARTH ONE COUNTRY</p>
<p>	Baha'u'llah expounds a world view which acknowledges that the "earth
 is but one country, and mankind its citizens"[7] and He calls for the<br>
 promotion of "the best interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth".[8]</p>
<p>	'Abdu'l-Baha draws attention to the increasing interdependence of 
the world and the fact that "self- sufficiency"[9] is no longer 
possible. He envisages that the trend towards a united world will 
increase and will manifest itself in the form of "unity of thought in 
world undertakings"[10] and in other important realms of existence. One 
critical area for unified action is that of preserving the resources of 
the planet.</p>
<p>	1.3 MAN'S STATION AND Responsibility</p>
<p>	'Abdu'l-Baha indicates that man, "by reason of the ideal and 
heavenly force latent and manifest in him",[11] occupies a station that 
is "higher and nobler"[12] than nature, that "man is ruler over nature's
 sphere and province".[13]</p>
<p>    It is evident, therefore, that man is ruler over nature's<br>
    sphere and province. Nature is inert; man is progressive.<br>
    Nature has no consciousness; man is endowed with it.<br>
    Nature is without volition and acts perforce, whereas man<br>
    possesses a mighty will. Nature is incapable of<br>
    discovering mysteries or realities, whereas man is<br>
    especially fitted to do so. Nature is not in touch with<br>
    the realm of God; man is attuned to its evidences. Nature<br>
    is uninformed of God; man is conscious of Him. Man<br>
    acquires divine virtues; nature is denied them. Man can<br>
    voluntarily discontinue vices; nature has no power to<br>
    modify the influence of its instincts. Altogether it is<br>
    evident that man is more noble and superior, that in him<br>
    there is an ideal power surpassing nature. He has<br>
    consciousness, volition, memory, intelligent power,<br>
    divine attributes and virtues of which nature is<br>
    completely deprived and bereft; therefore, man is higher<br>
    and nobler by reason of the ideal and heavenly force<br>
    latent and manifest in him.[14]</p>
<p>	Man, possessed of an inner faculty which plants and animals do not 
have, a power which enables him to discover the secrets of nature and 
gain mastery over the environment, has a special responsibility to use 
his God-given powers for positive ends. The Universal House of Justice 
indicates that "the proper exercise of this responsibility is the key to
 whether his inventive genius produces beneficial results, or creates 
havoc in the material world".[15]<br>

</p><p>	1.4 APPROACH TOWARD THE PHYSICAL WORLD -INTERACTION OF SPIRITUAL AND MATERIAL</p>
<p>	'Abdu'l-Baha stresses that the development of the physical world and
 the happiness of mankind are dependent on both the "call of 
civilization, of the progress of the material world"[16] and the 
"soul-stirring call of God, Whose spiritual teachings are safeguards of 
the everlasting glory, the eternal happiness and illumination of the 
world of humanity".[17] He states:</p>
<p>     However, until material achievements, physical<br>
   accomplishments and human virtues are reinforced by<br>
   spiritual perfections, luminous qualities and<br>
   characteristics of mercy, no fruit or result shall issue<br>
   therefrom, nor will the happiness of the world of<br>
   humanity, which is the ultimate aim, be attained. For<br>
   although, on the one hand, material achievements and the<br>
   development of the physical world produce prosperity,<br>
   which exquisitely manifests its intended aims, on the<br>
   other hand dangers, severe calamities and violent<br>
   afflictions are imminent.</p>
<p>     Consequently, when thou lookest at the orderly pattern<br>
   of kingdoms, cities and villages, with the attractiveness<br>
   of their adornments, the freshness of their natural<br>
   resources, the refinement of their appliances, the ease<br>
   of their means of travel, the extent of knowledge<br>
   available about the world of nature, the great<br>
   inventions, the colossal enterprises, the noble<br>
   discoveries and scientific researches, thou wouldst<br>
   conclude that civilization conduceth to the happiness and<br>
   the progress of the human world. Yet shouldst thou turn<br>
   thine eye to the discovery of destructive and infernal<br>
   machines, to the development of forces of demolition and<br>
   the invention of fiery implements, which uproot the tree<br>
   of life, it would become evident and manifest unto thee<br>
   that civilization is conjoined with barbarism. Progress<br>
   and barbarism go hand in hand, unless material<br>
   civilization be confirmed by Divine Guidance, by the<br>
   revelations of the All-Merciful and by godly virtues, and<br>
   be reinforced by spiritual conduct, by the ideals of the<br>
   Kingdom and by the outpourings of the Realm of Might....</p>
<p>     Therefore, this civilization and material progress<br>
   should be combined with the Most Great Guidance so that<br>
   this nether world may become the scene of the appearance<br>
   of the bestowals of the<br>
 Kingdom, and physical<br>
   achievements may be conjoined with   the effulgences of<br>
   the Merciful. This in order that the beauty and perfection<br>
   of the world of man may be unveiled and be manifested before<br>
   all in the utmost grace and splendour. Thus everlasting glory<br>
   and happiness shall be revealed.[18]</p>
<p>	Baha'u'llah describes the fate of those whose lives demonstrate a 
heedlessness of spiritual values and a failure to act in conformity with
 such values. He comments:</p>
<p>    ...ye walk on My earth complacent and self-satisfied,<br>
    heedless that My earth is weary of you and everything<br>
    within it shunneth you....[19]</p>
<p>	Shoghi Effendi asserts that man's negligence contributes to the 
decline of the "present-day Order"[20] and impacts on the environment in
 a practical way:</p>
<p>     The violent derangement of the world's equilibrium; the<br>
   trembling that will seize the limbs of mankind; the<br>
   radical transformation of human society; the rolling up<br>
   of the present-day Order; the fundamental changes<br>
   affecting the structure of government; ... the<br>
   development of infernal engines of war; the burning of<br>
   cities; the contamination of the atmosphere of the earth<br>
    -- these stand out as the signs and portents that must<br>
   either herald or accompany the retributive calamity<br>
   which, as decreed by Him Who is the Judge and Redeemer<br>
   of mankind, must, sooner or later, afflict a society<br>
   which, for the most part, and for over a century, has<br>
   turned a deaf ear to the Voice of God's Messenger in this<br>
   day -- a calamity which must purge the human race of the<br>
   dross of its age-long corruptions, and weld its component<br>
   parts into a firmly knit world-embracing Fellowship -- a<br>
   Fellowship destined, in the fullness of time, to be<br>
   incorporated in the framework, and to be galvanized by<br>
   the spiritualizing influences, of a mysteriously<br>
   expanding, divinely appointed Order, and to flower, in<br>
   the course of future Dispensations, into a Civilization,<br>
   the like of which mankind has, at no stage in its<br>
   evolution, witnessed.[21]</p>
<p>	2. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MAN AND NATURE</p>
<p>	The relationship between man and nature is very complex. An 
appreciation of the dimensions of this subject requires consideration of
 some of the characteristics of nature described in the Baha'i Writings 
and<br>
 an awareness of certain values and attitudes that guide individual behaviour and the establishment of priorities.</p>
<p>	2.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF NATURE</p>
<p>    2.1.1 A Unified System</p>
<p>	'Abdu'l-Baha indicates that the "temple of the world"[22] has been 
"fashioned after the image and likeness of the human body".[23] He 
explains that:</p>
<p>     By this is meant that even as the human body in this<br>
     world, which is outwardly composed of different limbs and<br>
     organs, is in reality a closely integrated, coherent<br>
     entity, similarly the structure of the physical world is<br>
     like unto a single being whose limbs and members are<br>
     inseparably linked together.</p>
<p>     Were one to observe with an eye that discovereth the<br>
   realities of all things, it would become clear that the<br>
   greatest relationship that bindeth the world of being<br>
   together lieth in the range of created things themselves,<br>
   and that co-operation, mutual aid and reciprocity are<br>
   essential characteristics in the unified body of the<br>
   world of being, inasmuch as all created things are<br>
   closely related together and each is influenced by the<br>
   other or deriveth benefit therefrom, either directly or<br>
   indirectly.</p>
<p>     Consider for instance how one group of created things<br>
   constituteth the vegetable kingdom, and another the<br>
   animal kingdom. Each of these two maketh use of certain<br>
   elements in the air on which its own life dependeth,<br>
   while each increaseth the quantity of such elements as<br>
   are essential for the life of the other. In other words,<br>
   the growth and development of the vegetable world is<br>
   impossible without the existence of the animal kingdom,<br>
   and the maintenance of animal life is inconceivable<br>
   without the co-operation of the vegetable kingdom. Of<br>
   like kind are the relationships that exist among all<br>
   created things. Hence it was stated that co-operation and<br>
   reciprocity are essential properties which are inherent<br>
   in the unified system of the world of existence, and<br>
   without which the entire creation would be reduced to<br>
   nothingness.[24]<br>

</p><p>	In another passage 'Abdu'l-Baha describes the interconnectedness
 of "every part of the universe"[25] and the importance of maintaining 
balance in the system:</p>
<p>    Reflect upon the inner realities of the universe, the<br>
    secret wisdoms involved, the enigmas, the inter-<br>
    relationships, the rules that govern all. For every part<br>
    of the universe is connected with every other part by<br>
    ties that are very powerful and admit of no imbalance,<br>
    nor any slackening whatever....[26]</p>
<p>    2.1.2 Subject to Law and Organization</p>
<p>	'Abdu'l-Baha states that "The phenomenal world is entirely subject 
to the rule and control of natural law."[27] He contrasts nature's 
"absolute organization"[28] and its lack of "intelligence"[29] and 
"will"[30] with man's ability to "[command] the forces of Nature"[31] 
through discovery of "the constitution of things":[32]</p>
<p>     This Nature is subjected to an absolute organization,<br>
   to determined laws, to a complete order and a finished<br>
   design, from which it will never depart to such a degree,<br>
   indeed, that if you look carefully and with keen sight,<br>
   from the smallest invisible atom up to such large bodies<br>
   of the world of existence as the globe of the sun or the<br>
   other great stars and luminous spheres, whether you<br>
   regard their arrangement, their composition, their form<br>
   or their movement, you will find that all are in the<br>
   highest degree of organization and are under one law from<br>
   which they will never depart.</p>
<p>     But when you look at Nature itself, you see that it has<br>
   no intelligence, no will. For instance, the nature of<br>
   fire is to burn; it burns without will or intelligence.<br>
   The nature of water is fluidity; it flows without will<br>
   or intelligence. The nature of the sun is radiance; it<br>
   shines without will or intelligence. The nature of vapour<br>
   is to ascend; it ascends without will or intelligence.<br>
   Thus it is clear that the natural movements of all things<br>
   are compelled; there are no voluntary movements except<br>
   those of animals and, above all, those of man. Man is<br>
   able to resist and to oppose Nature because he discovers<br>
   the constitution of things, and through this he commands<br>
   the forces of Nature; all the inventions he has made are<br>
   due to his discovery of the constitution of things. For<br>
   example, he invented the telegraph, which<br>
 is the means<br>
   of communication between the East and the West. It is evident,<br>
   then, that man rules over Nature.</p>
<p>     Now, when you behold in existence such organizations,<br>
   arrangements and laws, can you say that all these are the<br>
   effect of Nature, though Nature has neither intelligence<br>
   nor perception? If not, it becomes evident that this<br>
   Nature, which has neither perception nor intelligence,<br>
   is in the grasp of Almighty God, Who is the Ruler of the<br>
   world of Nature; whatever He wishes, He causes Nature to<br>
   manifest.[33]</p>
<p>     2.1.3 Change and Motion</p>
<p>     Change is a law governing the whole of physical<br>
   creation. It is seen in the passage of the seasons.</p>
<p>	'Abdu'l-Baha writes:</p>
<p>     The earth is in motion and growth; the mountains, hills<br>
   and prairies are green and pleasant; the bounty is<br>
   overflowing; the mercy universal; the rain is descending<br>
   from the cloud of mercy; the brilliant Sun is shining;<br>
   the full moon is ornamenting the horizon of ether;<br>
     The great ocean-tide is flooding every little stream;<br>
   the gifts are successive; the favours consecutive; and<br>
   the refreshing breeze is blowing, wafting the fragrant<br>
   perfume of the blossoms. Boundless treasure is in the<br>
   hand of the King of Kings! Lift the hem of thy garment<br>
   in order to receive it.[34]</p>
<p>    Soon the whole world, as in springtime, will change its<br>
    garb. The turning and falling of the autumn leaves is<br>
    past; the bleakness of the winter time is over. The new<br>
    year hath appeared and the spiritual springtime is at<br>
    hand.  The black earth is becoming a verdant garden; the<br>
    deserts and mountains are teeming with red flowers; from<br>
    the borders of the wilderness the tall grasses are<br>
    standing like advance guards before the cypress and<br>
    jessamine trees; while the birds are singing among the<br>
    rose branches like the angels in the highest heavens,<br>
    announcing the glad-tidings of the approach of that<br>
    spiritual spring, and the sweet music of their voices is<br>
    causing the real essence of all things to move and<br>
    quiver.[35]</p>
<p>	'Abdu'l-Baha states that "absolute repose does not exist in 
nature",[36] that "movement is essential to existence".[37] In relation 
to existence He describes the processes of "composition and 
decomposition":[38]<br>

</p><p>   ...consider the phenomenon of composition and<br>
   decomposition, of existence and non-existence. Every<br>
   created thing in the contingent world is made up of many<br>
   and varied atoms, and its existence is dependent on the<br>
   composition of these. In other words, through the divine<br>
   creative power a conjunction of simple elements taketh<br>
   place so that from this composition a distinct organism<br>
   is produced. The existence of all things is based upon<br>
   this principle. But when the order is deranged,<br>
   decomposition is produced and disintegration setteth in,<br>
   then that thing ceaseth to exist. That is, the<br>
   annihilation of all things is caused by decomposition and<br>
   disintegration. Therefore attraction and composition<br>
   between the various elements is the means of life, and<br>
   discord, decomposition and division produce death. Thus<br>
   the cohesive and attractive forces in all things lead to<br>
   the appearance of fruitful results and effects, while<br>
   estrangement and alienation of things lead to disturbance<br>
   and annihilation. Through affinity and attraction all<br>
   living things like plants, animals and men come into<br>
   existence, while division and discord bring about<br>
   decomposition and destruction.[39]</p>
<p>	He also explains that, in the physical world, the course of evolution is in the direction of increasing levels of complexity:</p>
<p>     In the physical creation, evolution is from one degree<br>
   of perfection to another. The mineral passes with its<br>
   mineral perfections to the vegetable; the vegetable, with<br>
   its perfections, passes to the animal world, and so on<br>
   to that of humanity....[40]</p>
<p>	2.1.4 Diversity</p>
<p>	'Abdu'l-Baha describes diversity as "the essence of perfection and 
the cause of the appearance of the bestowals"[41] of God, and He states:</p>
<p>     Consider the flowers of a garden: though differing in<br>
   kind, colour, form and shape, yet, inasmuch as they are<br>
   refreshed by the waters of one spring, revived by the<br>
   breath of one wind, invigorated by the rays of one sun,<br>
   this diversity increaseth their charm, and addeth unto<br>
   their beauty. Thus when that unifying force, the<br>
   penetrating influence of the Word of God, taketh effect,<br>
   the difference of customs, manners, habits, ideas,<br>
   opinions and dispositions embellisheth the world of<br>
   humanity. This diversity, this difference is like the<br>
   naturally created dissimilarity and variety of the<br>

   limbs and organs of the human body, for each one contributeth<br>
   to the beauty, efficiency and perfection of the whole....</p>
<p>     How unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers and<br>
   plants, the leaves and blossoms, the fruits, the branches<br>
   and the trees of that garden were all of the same shape<br>
   and colour! Diversity of hues, form and shape, enricheth<br>
   and adorneth the garden, and heighteneth the effect<br>
   thereof...[42]</p>
<p>	The extent of the diversity of the "world of created beings"[43] is underlined in the following passage:</p>
<p>   ... the forms and organisms of phenomenal being and<br>
   existence in each of the kingdoms of the universe are<br>
   myriad and numberless. The vegetable plane or kingdom,<br>
   for instance, has its infinite variety of types and<br>
   material structures of plant life -- each distinct and<br>
   different within itself, no two exactly alike in<br>
   composition and detail  -- for there are no repetitions in<br>
   nature, and the augmentative virtue cannot be confined<br>
   to any given image or shape. Each leaf has its own<br>
   particular identity -- so to speak, its own individuality<br>
   as a leaf....[44]</p>
<p>	2.1.5 Serves the Human World</p>
<p>   'Abdu'l-Baha describes the "causes and circumstances"[45]<br>
   of the "perfection"[46] of the mineral, vegetable and<br>
   animal worlds, and He distinguishes this from their "real<br>
   prosperity"[47] which conduces to the honour of the<br>
   various kingdoms. The honour and exaltation of every<br>
   existing being depends upon causes and circumstances.</p>
<p>     The excellency, the adornment and the perfection of the<br>
   earth is to be verdant and fertile through the bounty of<br>
   the clouds of springtime. Plants grow; flowers and<br>
   fragrant herbs spring up; fruit-bearing trees become full<br>
   of blossoms and bring forth fresh and new fruit. Gardens<br>
   become beautiful, and meadows adorned; mountains and<br>
   plains are clad in a green robe, and gardens, fields,<br>
   villages and cities are decorated. This is the prosperity<br>
   of the mineral world.</p>
<p>     The height of exaltation and the perfection of the<br>
   vegetable world is that a tree should grow on the bank<br>
   of a stream of fresh water, that a gentle breeze should<br>
   blow on it, that the warmth of the sun should shine on<br>
   it, that a gardener should attend to its cultivation,<br>

   and that day by day it should develop and yield fruit. But<br>
   its real prosperity is to progress into the animal and human<br>
   world, and replace that which has been exhausted in the<br>
   bodies of animals and men.</p>
<p>	The exaltation of the animal world is to possess perfect members, 
organs and powers, and to have all its needs supplied. This is its chief
 glory, its honour and exaltation. So the supreme happiness of an animal
 is to have possession of a green and fertile meadow, perfectly pure 
flowing water, and a lovely, verdant forest. If these things are 
provided for it, no greater prosperity can be imagined. For example, if a
 bird builds its nest in a green and fruitful forest, in a beautiful 
high place, upon a strong tree, and at the top of a lofty branch, and if
 it finds all it needs of seeds and water, this is its perfect 
prosperity.</p>
<p>	But real prosperity for the animal consists in passing from the 
animal world to the human world, like the microscopic beings that, 
through the water and air, enter into man and are assimilated, and 
replace that which has been consumed in his body. This is the great 
honour and prosperity for the animal world; no greater honour can be 
conceived for it.[48]</p>
<p>	2.1.6 Imperfection of Nature</p>
<p>	Two views of nature are contrasted -- one which holds that the 
"world of nature is complete",[49] and one that declares that it is 
"incomplete"[50] because "it has need of intelligence and 
education".[51] 'Abdu'l-Baha states that the "mineral, vegetable, animal
 and human worlds are all in need of an educator":[52]</p>
<p>    The materialists hold to the opinion that the world of<br>
    nature is complete. The divine philosophers declare that<br>
    the world of nature is incomplete. There is a wide<br>
    difference between the two. The materialists call<br>
    attention to the perfection of nature, the sun, moon and<br>
    stars, the trees in their adornment, the whole earth and<br>
    the sea -- even unimportant phenomena revealing the most<br>
    perfect symmetry. The divine philosophers deny this<br>
    seeming perfection and completeness in nature's kingdom,<br>
    even though admitting the beauty of its scenes and<br>
    aspects and acknowledging the irresistible cosmic forces<br>
    which control the colossal suns and planets. They hold<br>
    that while nature seems perfect, it is, nevertheless,<br>
    imperfect because<br>
 it has need of intelligence and<br>
    education. In proof of this they say that man, though he<br>
    be a very god in the realm of material creation, is himself<br>
    in need of an educator. Man undeveloped by education is savage,<br>
    animalistic, brutal. Laws and regulations, schools,<br>
    colleges and universities have for their purpose the<br>
    training of man and his uplift from the dark borderland<br>
    of the animal kingdom....[53]</p>
<p>	When we consider existence, we see that the mineral, vegetable, animal and human worlds are all in need of an educator.</p>
<p>	If the earth is not cultivated, it becomes a jungle where useless 
weeds grow; but if a cultivator comes and tills the ground, it produces 
crops which nourish living creatures. It is evident, therefore, that the
 soil needs the cultivation of the farmer. Consider the trees: if they 
remain without a cultivator, they will be fruitless, and without fruit 
they are useless; but if they receive the care of a gardener, these same
 barren trees become fruitful, and through cultivation, fertilization 
and engrafting the trees which had bitter fruits yield sweet fruits....</p>
<p>	The same is true with respect to animals: notice that when the 
animal is trained it becomes domestic, and also that man, if he is left 
without education, becomes bestial, and, moreover, if left under the 
rule of nature, becomes lower than an animal, whereas if he is educated 
he becomes an angel....[54]</p>
<p>	2.2 ATTITUDES AND VALUES</p>
<p>	The Baha'i Writings articulate certain spiritual values and 
attitudes that guide the relationship of man toward nature. These 
include:</p>
<p>  2.2.1  Appreciation</p>
<p>	An awareness of the fact that the earth is the "source"[55] of man's
 "prosperity"[56] is tempered by the realization that "the honour and 
exaltation of man must be something more than material riches".[57] 
Thus: Every man of discernment, while walking upon the earth, feeleth 
indeed abashed, inasmuch as he is fully aware that the thing which is 
the source of his prosperity, his wealth, his might, his exaltation, his
 advancement and power is, as ordained by God, the very earth which is 
trodden beneath the feet of all men. There can be no doubt that whoever 
is cognizant of this truth, is cleansed and sanctified from all pride, 
arrogance, and vainglory....[58]<br>

</p><p>   What is it of which ye can rightly boast? Is it on your<br>
   food and your drink that ye pride yourselves, on the<br>
   riches ye lay up in your treasuries, on the diversity and<br>
   the cost of the ornaments with which ye deck yourselves?<br>
   If true glory were to consist in the possession of such<br>
   perishable things, then the earth on which ye walk must<br>
   needs vaunt itself over you, because it supplieth you,<br>
   and bestoweth upon you, these very things, by the decree<br>
   of the Almighty. In its bowels are contained, according<br>
   to what God hath ordained, all that ye possess. From it,<br>
   as a sign of His mercy, ye derive your riches. Behold<br>
   then your state, the thing in which ye glory! Would that<br>
   ye could perceive it![59]</p>
<p>   Then it is clear that the honour and exaltation of man<br>
   must be something more than material riches. Material<br>
   comforts are only a branch, but the root of the<br>
   exaltation of man is the good attributes and virtues<br>
   which are the adornments of his reality. These are the<br>
   divine appearances, the heavenly bounties, the sublime<br>
   emotions, the love and knowledge of God; universal<br>
   wisdom, intellectual perception, scientific discoveries,<br>
   justice, equity, truthfulness, benevolence, natural<br>
   courage and innate fortitude; the respect for rights and<br>
   the keeping of agreements and covenants; rectitude in all<br>
   circumstances; serving the truth under all conditions;<br>
   the sacrifice of one's life for the good of all people;<br>
   kindness and esteem for all nations; obedience to the<br>
   teachings of God; service in the Divine Kingdom; the<br>
   guidance of the people, and the education of the nations<br>
   and races. This is the prosperity of the human world!<br>
   This is the exaltation of man in the world! This is<br>
   eternal life and heavenly honour![60]</p>
<p>	2.2.2 Moderation</p>
<p>	The Baha'i Writings encourage detachment from "this world and the 
vanities thereof",[61] since "attachment"[62] distracts the individual 
from awareness of God. This does not, however, constitute a form of 
asceticism or imply a rejection of life's pleasures. Baha'u'llah 
explains:</p>
<p>    Should a man wish to adorn himself with the ornaments of<br>
    the earth, to wear its apparels, or partake of the<br>
    benefits it can bestow, no harm can befall him, if he<br>
    alloweth nothing whatever to intervene between him and<br>
    God, for God hath ordained every good thing, whether </p>
 created in the heavens or in the earth, for such<br>
    of His servants as truly believe in Him. Eat ye, O people,<br>
    of the good things which God hath allowed you, and deprive<br>
    not yourselves from His wondrous bounties. Render thanks<br>
    and praise unto Him, and be of them that are truly<br>
    thankful.[63]
<p>	The standard is one of moderation:</p>
<p>    In all matters moderation is desirable. If a thing is<br>
    carried to excess, it will prove a source of evil....[64]</p>
<p>	2.2.3 Kindness to Animals</p>
<p>	Baha'u'llah calls for man to "show kindness to animals"[65] and He 
warns against "hunting to excess".[66] In relation to the former, 
'Abdu'l-Baha writes:</p>
<p>     Briefly, it is not only their fellow human beings that<br>
   the beloved of God must treat with mercy and compassion,<br>
   rather must they show forth the utmost loving-kindness<br>
   to every living creature. For in all physical respects,<br>
   and where the animal spirit is concerned, the selfsame<br>
   feelings are shared by animal and man. Man hath not<br>
   grasped this truth, however, and he believeth that<br>
   physical sensations are confined to human beings,<br>
   wherefore is he unjust to the animals, and cruel.</p>
<p>     And yet in truth, what difference is there when it<br>
   cometh to physical sensations? The feelings are one and<br>
   the same, whether ye inflict pain on man or on beast.<br>
   There is no difference here whatever. And indeed ye do<br>
   worse to harm an animal, for man hath a language, he can<br>
   lodge a complaint, he can cry out and moan; if injured<br>
   he can have recourse to the authorities and these will<br>
   protect him from his aggressor. But the hapless beast is<br>
   mute, able neither to express its hurt nor take its case<br>
   to the authorities. If a man inflict a thousand ills upon<br>
   a beast, it can neither ward him off with speech nor hale<br>
   him into court. Therefore is it essential that ye show<br>
   forth the utmost consideration to the animal, and that<br>
   ye be even kinder to him than to your fellow-man.</p>
<p>     Train your children from their earliest days to be<br>
   infinitely tender and loving to animals. If an animal be<br>
   sick, let the children try to heal it, if it be hungry,<br>
   let them feed it, if thirsty, let them quench its thirst,<br>
   if weary, let them see that it rests.<br>

</p><p>     Most human beings are sinners, but the beasts are<br>
   innocent. Surely those without sin should receive the<br>
   most kindness and love  -- all except animals which are<br>
   harmful... But to blessed animals the utmost kindness<br>
   must be shown, the more the better. Tenderness and<br>
   loving-kindness are basic principles of God's heavenly<br>
   Kingdom. Ye should most carefully bear this matter in<br>
   mind.[67]</p>
<p>	The Baha'i Writings also assert that the consumption of meat is not a prerequisite to health:</p>
<p>     Regarding the eating of animal flesh and abstinence<br>
   therefrom, ... he [man] is not in need of meat, nor is<br>
   he obliged to eat it. Even without eating meat he would<br>
   live with the utmost vigour and energy.... Truly, the<br>
   killing of animals and the eating of their meat is<br>
   somewhat contrary to pity and compassion, and if one can<br>
   content oneself with cereals, fruit, oil and nuts, such<br>
   as pistachios, almonds and so on, it would undoubtedly<br>
   be better and more pleasing.[68]</p>
<p>	2.2.4 Development of Nature</p>
<p>	In the Baha'i view, physical creation is dynamic and evolving from 
"one degree of perfection to another".[69] It is, however, 
"incomplete",[70] since it lacks "intelligence and education".[71] It 
stands in need of development by man in order to create not only a 
higher degree of order and beauty, which are standards upheld in the 
Baha'i teachings, but also to increase its fertility and productivity. 
In relation to the creation of order and beauty in the realm of nature 
'Abdu'l-Baha writes:</p>
<p>     Nature is the material world. When we look upon it, we<br>
   see that it is dark and imperfect. For instance, if we<br>
   allow a piece of land to remain in its natural condition,<br>
   we will find it covered with thorns and thistles; useless<br>
   weeds and wild vegetation will flourish upon it, and it<br>
   will become like a jungle. The trees will be fruitless,<br>
   lacking beauty and symmetry...[72]</p>
<p>     And if, as thou passest by fields and plantations, thou<br>
   observest that the plants, flowers and sweet-smelling<br>
   herbs are growing luxuriantly together, forming a pattern<br>
   of unity, this is an evidence of the fact that that<br>
   plantation and garden is flourishing under the care of<br>
   a skilful gardener. But when thou seest it in a state of<br>
   disorder and irregularity thou inferrest that it hath<br>
   lacked the training of an efficient farmer and thus hath<br>
   produced weeds and tares.[73]<br>

</p><p>	'Abdu'l-Baha also mentions the contribution of cultivation as a 
means of increasing the fertility of the earth and its productivity. He 
states:</p>
<p>     If we should relegate this plot of ground to its natural<br>
     state, allow it to return to its original condition, it<br>
     would become a field of thorns and useless weeds, but by<br>
     cultivation it will become fertile soil, yielding a<br>
     harvest. Deprived of cultivation, the mountain slopes<br>
     would be jungles and forests without fruitful trees. The<br>
     gardens bring forth fruits and flowers in proportion to<br>
     the care and tillage bestowed upon them by the<br>
     gardener....[74]</p>
<p>     A grain of wheat, when cultivated by the farmer, will<br>
     yield a whole harvest, and a seed, through the gardener's<br>
     care, will grow into a great tree....[75]</p>
<p>     While the world of nature stands in need of development,<br>
     man's approach to such development must be tempered by<br>
     moderation, a commitment to protecting the "heritage [of]<br>
     future generations",[76] and an awareness of the sanctity<br>
     of nature that pervades the Writings of the Baha'i Faith.<br>
     For example, Baha'u'llah states: Blessed is the spot, and<br>
     the house, and the place, and the city, and the heart,<br>
     and the mountain, and the refuge, and the cave, and the<br>
     valley, and the land, and the sea, and the island, and<br>
     the meadow where mention of God hath been made, and His<br>
     praise glorified.[77]</p>
<p>	2.2.5 Importance of Agriculture</p>
<p>	Baha'u'llah states that "Special regard must be paid to 
agriculture."[78] He characterizes it as an activity which is "conducive
 to the advancement of mankind and to the reconstruction of the 
world".[79] 'Abdu'l-Baha asserts that The fundamental basis of the 
community is agriculture,- -tillage of the soil....[80]</p>
<p>	He describes agriculture as "a noble science"[81] whose practice is 
an "act of worship",[82] and He encourages both women and men to engage 
in "agricultural sciences".[83] He indicates that should an individual 
"become proficient in this field, he will become a means of providing 
for the comfort of untold numbers of people".[84]</p>
<p>	In relation to the economic and social development of the nations, 
the Universal House of Justice underlines the importance of "agriculture
 and the preservation of the ecological balance of the world".[85]<br>

</p><p>	2.2.6 Use of Science</p>
<p>	Science is described as "the governor of nature and its mysteries, 
the one agency by which man explores the institutions of material 
creation":[86]</p>
<p>    ...man through the exercise of his scientific, intellectual<br>
    power ... can modify, change and control nature according<br>
    to his own wishes and uses. Science, so to speak, is the<br>
    breaker of the laws of nature.</p>
<p>         Consider, for example, that man according to natural law<br>
    should dwell upon the surface of the earth. By overcoming this law<br>
    and restriction, however, he sails in ships over the ocean,<br>
    mounts to the zenith in airplanes and sinks to the depths<br>
    of the sea in submarines. This is against the fiat of nature<br>
    and a violation of her sovereignty and dominion. Nature's<br>
    laws and methods, the hidden secrets and mysteries of the universe,<br>
    human inventions and discoveries, all our scientific acquisitions<br>
    should naturally remain concealed and unknown, but man through his<br>
    intellectual acumen searches them out of the plane of the invisible,<br>
    draws them into the plane of the visible, exposes and explains them.<br>
    For instance, one of the mysteries of nature is electricity.<br>
    According to nature this force, this energy, should remain latent<br>
    and hidden, but man scientifically breaks through the very laws<br>
    of nature, arrests it and even imprisons it for his use.</p>
<p>       In brief, man through the possession of this ideal endowment<br>
    of scientific investigation is the most noble product of<br>
    creation, the governor of nature....[87]</p>
<p>	'Abdu'l-Baha links scientific endeavour with the implementation of a noble goal. He states:</p>
<p>         This endowment is the most praiseworthy power of man, for<br>
    through its employment and exercise the betterment of the<br>
    human race is accomplished, the development of the virtues of<br>
    mankind is made possible and the spirit and mysteries of God<br>
    become manifest....[88]</p>
<p>	And He enumerates the general principle that ...any agency whatever,
 though it be the instrument of mankind's greatest good, is capable of 
misuse. Its proper use or abuse depends on the varying degrees of 
enlightenment, capacity, faith, honesty, devotion and highmindedness of 
the leaders of public opinion.[89]<br>

</p><p>	3. PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>	A number of issues pertinent to the protection of the environment 
are addressed in the Writings of the Baha'i Faith. Several of these are 
set out below.</p>
<p>	3.1 PRESERVATION OF RESOURCES</p>
<p>	Shoghi Effendi links the preservation and reclamation of the earth's
 resources with both the "protection of the] physical world and [the] 
heritage [of] future generations".[90] He affirms that the work of such 
groups as the Men of the Trees and the World Forestry Charter is 
"essentially humanitarian",[91] and he applauds their "noble 
objective"[92] of reclaiming the "desert areas [of] Africa".[93]</p>
<p>	It is interesting to note that among the "powers and duties"[94] of 
the Universal House of Justice are "the advancement and betterment of 
the world"[95] and "the development of countries".[96]</p>
<p>	3.2 CONTROL OF NATURAL RESOURCES</p>
<p>	The Baha'i Writings envisage that the protection, exploration, and 
exploitation of the earth's "unimaginably vast resources"[97] must, 
inevitably, in the long term, come under the jurisdiction of a "world 
federal system".[98] Such a system, based on recognition of the "unity 
of the human race",[99] will not only exercise "unchallengeable 
authority"[100] over the earth's resources, but it will also ensure 
economic and social justice. Shoghi Effendi writes:</p>
<p>   The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Baha'u'llah,<br>
   implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in<br>
   which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely<br>
   and permanently united, and in which the autonomy of its<br>
   state members and the personal freedom and initiative of<br>
   the individuals that compose them are definitely and<br>
   completely safeguarded.... In such a world society,<br>
   science and religion, the two most potent forces in human<br>
   life, will be reconciled, will co-operate, and will<br>
   harmoniously develop.... The economic resources of the<br>
   world will be organized, its sources of raw materials<br>
   will be tapped and fully utilized, its markets will be<br>
   co-ordinated and developed, and the distribution of its<br>
   products will be equitably regulated.<br>

</p><p>     National rivalries, hatreds, and intrigues will cease,<br>
   and racial animosity and prejudice will be replaced by<br>
   racial amity, understanding and co-operation. The causes<br>
   of religious strife will be permanently removed, economic<br>
   barriers and restrictions will be completely abolished,<br>
   and the inordinate distinction between classes will be<br>
   obliterated. Destitution on the one hand, and gross<br>
   accumulation of ownership on the other, will disappear.<br>
   The enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war, whether<br>
   economic or political, will be consecrated to such ends<br>
   as will extend the range of human inventions and<br>
   technical development, to the increase of the<br>
   productivity of mankind, to the extermination of disease,<br>
   to the extension of scientific research, to the raising<br>
   of the standard of physical health, to the sharpening and<br>
   refinement of the human brain, to the exploitation of the<br>
   unused and unsuspected resources of the planet, to the<br>
   prolongation of human life, and to the furtherance of any<br>
   other agency that can stimulate the intellectual, the<br>
   moral, and spiritual life of the entire human race.</p>
<p>     A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and<br>
   exercising unchallengeable authority over its<br>
   unimaginably vast resources, blending and embodying the<br>
   ideals of both the East and the West, liberated from the<br>
   curse of war and its miseries, and bent on the<br>
   exploitation of all the available sources of energy on<br>
   the surface of the planet, a system in which Force is<br>
   made the servant of Justice, whose life is sustained by<br>
   its universal recognition of one God and by its<br>
   allegiance to one common Revelation -- such is the goal<br>
   towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces<br>
   of life, is moving.[101]</p>
<p>	3.3 APPROACHES TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>	The conservation and protection of the environment must be addressed
 on the individual and societal levels. Shoghi Effendi, in a letter 
written on his behalf, states:</p>
<p>      We cannot segregate the human heart from the<br>
    environment outside us and say that once one of these is<br>
    reformed everything will be improved. Man is organic with<br>
    the world. His inner life moulds the environment and is<br>
    itself also deeply affected by it. The one acts upon the<br>
    other and every abiding change in the life of man is the<br>
    result of these mutual reactions.<br>

</p><p>      No movement in the world directs its attention upon<br>
    both these aspects of human life and has full measures<br>
    for their improvement, save the teachings of Baha'u'llah.<br>
    And this is its distinctive feature. If we desire<br>
    therefore the good of the world we should strive to<br>
    spread those teachings and also practise them in our own<br>
    life. Through them will the human heart be changed, and<br>
    also our social environment provides the atmosphere in<br>
    which we can grow spiritually and reflect in full the<br>
    light of God shining through the revelation of<br>
    Baha'u'llah.[102]</p>
<p>	And, with regard to the solution of the world's problems, he indicates that:</p>
<p>	We need a change of heart, a reframing of all our conceptions and a 
new orientation of our activities. The inward life of man as well as his
 outward environment have to be reshaped if human salvation is to be 
secured.[103]</p>
<p>	On a governmental level, the Universal House of Justice calls for 
"global cooperation of the family of nations in devising and adopting 
measures designed to preserve the ecological balance this earth was 
given by its Creator".[104] The House of Justice asserts:</p>
<p>	Until such time as the nations of the world understand and follow 
the admonitions of Baha'u'llah to whole-heartedly work together in 
looking after the best interests of all humankind, and unite in the 
search for ways and means to meet the many environmental problems 
besetting our planet, the House of Justice feels that little progress 
will be made towards their solution....[105]</p>
<p>	The Universal House of Justice sets out the role of the individual 
Baha'i and of Baha'i communities in relation to saving "the wildlife and
 natural condition of the world" [106] as follows:</p>
<p>	...the best way in which you can help to save the wildlife and 
natural condition of the world is to exert every effort to bring the 
Message of Baha'u'llah to the attention of your fellow-men and to win 
their allegiance to His Cause.</p>
<p>	As the hearts of men are changed, and they begin to work in unity in
 the light of Baha'u'llah's teachings, they can begin to implement many 
practical improvements to the condition of the world. This is already 
beginning in the efforts at social and economic development in those 
areas where large Baha'i communities have been founded.<br>

</p><p>	Of course, you can also assist those with whom you come into 
contact who have an interest in improving the environment, but the 
fundamental solution is the one that Baha'u'llah has brought.[107]</p>
<p>	In addition to addressing the issue on a fundamental spiritual 
level, collaboration with individuals and groups interested in improving
 the environment is encouraged. The Baha'i communities are called upon 
to make the conservation of the environment an integral part of their 
ongoing activities by</p>
<p>	...assisting in endeavours to conserve the environment in ways which blend with the rhythm of life of our community...[108]</p>
<p>	4. PROSPECT FOR THE FUTURE</p>
<p>	'Abdu'l-Baha sketches the following picture of the future state of life on earth:</p>
<p>      The Lord of all mankind hath fashioned this human realm<br>
    to be a Garden of Eden, an earthly paradise. If, as it<br>
    must, it findeth the way to harmony and peace, to love<br>
    and mutual trust, it will become a true abode of bliss,<br>
    a place of manifold blessings and unending delights.<br>
    Therein shall be revealed the excellence of humankind,<br>
    therein shall the rays of the Sun of Truth shine forth<br>
    on every hand.[109]<br>

</p><p>	CONSULTATION: A COMPILATION</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Baha'u'llah</p>
<p>	166. The Great Being saith: The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined
 with the two luminaries of consultation and compassion. Take ye counsel
 together in all matters, inasmuch as consultation is the lamp of 
guidance which leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 168)</p>
<p>	167. Say: no man can attain his true station except through his 
justice. No power can exist except through unity. No welfare and no 
well-being can be attained except through consultation.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	168. Consultation bestoweth greater awareness and transmuteth 
conjecture into certitude. It is a shining light which, in a dark world,
 leadeth the way and guideth. For everything there is and will continue 
to be a station of perfection and maturity. The maturity of the gift of 
understanding is made manifest through consultation.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	169. Such matters should be determined through consultation, and 
whatever emergeth from the consultation of those chosen, that indeed is 
the command of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	170. In all things it is necessary to consult. This matter should be
 forcibly stressed by thee, so that consultation may be observed by all.
 The intent of what hath been revealed from the Pen of the Most High is 
that consultation may be fully carried out among the friends, inasmuch 
as it is and will always be a cause of awareness and of awakening and a 
source of good and well-being.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	171. It behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among 
men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all 
that dwell on earth. It<br>
 is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for 
the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard 
their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly. Thus 
hath the Lord your God commanded you. Beware lest ye put away that which
 is clearly revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, O ye that perceive.</p>
<p>	(Cited in a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i 
Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932" [rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i
 Publishing Trust, 1977), p. 21)</p>
<p>	172. If in the first group of people who have gathered, unanimity is
 not achieved, new people shall be added, after which a group equal in 
number to the Greatest Name[1] or fewer or greater shall be chosen from 
their midst by lots; whereupon the consultation shall be renewed; 
whatever is the result shall be obeyed. If the second time opinions 
again differ, repeat the process a third time. This time obey the 
majority vote. Verily He directeth whom He willeth to the straight 
Path.[2]<br>
 [1 Nine]<br>
 [2 173."This statement appears in 'Questions and Answers',described by 
Shoghi Effendi as an appendix to the 'Kitab-i-Aqdas'. It was revealed 
before Spiritual Assemblies had been established and was in answer to a 
question about the Baha'i teaching on consultation. The emergence of 
Spiritual Assemblies, to which the friends may always turn, in no way 
prohibits them from following, if they wish, the procedure outlined in 
the above passage when they desire to consult on their personal 
problems. The quotation clearly indicates Baha'u'llah's preference for 
unanimity."<br>
(From a letter dated 28 February 1978 written on behalf of<br>
the Universal House of Justice to all National Spiritual<br>
Assemblies)]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic and Persian)</p>
<p>	From the Writings and Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	174. ...lt is incumbent upon every one not to take any step without 
consulting the Spiritual Assembly, and they must assuredly obey with 
heart and soul its bidding and be submissive unto it, that things may be
 properly ordered and well arranged. Otherwise every person will act 
independently and after his own judgment, will follow his own desire, 
and do harm to the Cause.</p>
<p>	(Cited in a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i 
Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932, p. 21)<br>

</p><p>	175. The prime requisites for them that take counsel together 
are purity of motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save 
God, attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst
 His loved ones, patience and long-suffering in difficulties and 
servitude to His exalted Threshold. Should they be graciously aided to 
acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of Baha shall 
be vouchsafed to them.... The members thereof must take counsel together
 in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. 
This can be attained when every member expresseth with absolute freedom 
his own opinion and setteth forth his argument. Should any one oppose, 
he must on no account feel hurt for not until matters are fully 
discussed can the right way be revealed. The shining spark of truth 
cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions. If after 
discussion, a decision be carried unanimously, well and good; but if the
 Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a majority of voices 
must prevail.</p>
<p>	(Cited in a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i 
Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 21-22)</p>
<p>	176. ... The first condition is absolute love and harmony amongst 
the members of the assembly. They must be wholly free from estrangement 
and must manifest in themselves the Unity of God, for they are the waves
 of one sea, the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays 
of one sun, the trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. Should 
harmony of thought and absolute unity be non-existent, that gathering 
shall be dispersed and that assembly be brought to naught. The second 
condition: They must when coming together turn their faces to the 
Kingdom on High and ask aid from the Realm of Glory. They must then 
proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care and moderation
 to express their views. They must in every matter search out the truth 
and not insist upon their own opinion, for stubbornness and persistence 
in one's views will lead ultimately to discord and wrangling and the 
truth will remain hidden. The honored members must with all freedom 
express their own thoughts, and it is in no wise permissible for one to 
belittle the thought of another, nay, he must with moderation set forth 
the truth, and should differences of opinion arise a majority of voices 
must prevail, and all must obey and submit to the majority. It is again 
not permitted that any one of the honored members object to or censure, 
whether in or out of the meeting, any decision arrived at previously 
though that decision be not right, for such criticism would prevent any 
decision from being enforced. In short, whatsoever thing is arranged in 
harmony and with love and purity of motive, its result is light, and 
should the least trace of<br>
 estrangement prevail the result shall be darkness upon darkness.... If 
this be so regarded, that assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it 
shall lead to coolness and alienation that proceed from the Evil One....
 Should they endeavor to fulfil these conditions the Grace of the Holy 
Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto them, and that assembly shall become the
 center of the Divine blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall 
come to their aid, and they shall day by day receive a new effusion of 
Spirit.</p>
<p>	(Cited in a letter dated 5 March 1922 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i 
Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", pp. 22-23)</p>
<p>	177. One consecrated soul is preferable to a thousand other souls. 
If a small number of people gather lovingly together, with absolute 
purity and sanctity, with their hearts free of the world, experiencing 
the emotions of the Kingdom and the powerful magnetic forces of the 
Divine, and being at one in their happy fellowship, that gathering will 
exert its influence over all the earth. The nature of that band of 
people, the words they speak, the deeds they do, will unleash the 
bestowals of Heaven, and provide a foretaste of eternal bliss. The hosts
 of the Company on high will defend them, and the angels of the Abha 
Paradise, in continuous succession, will come down to their aid.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 39, p. 81)</p>
<p>	178. If they agree upon a subject, even though it be wrong, it is 
better than to disagree and be in the right, for this difference will 
produce the demolition of the divine foundation. Though one of the 
parties may be in the right and they disagree that will be the cause of a
 thousand wrongs, but if they agree and both parties are in the wrong, 
as it is in unity the truth will be revealed and the wrong made right.</p>
<p>	("Baha'i World Faith: Selected Writings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1976), p. 411)</p>
<p>	179. The question of consultation is of the utmost importance, and 
is one of the most potent instruments conducive to the tranquillity and 
felicity of the people. For example, when a believer is uncertain about 
his affairs, or when he seeketh to pursue a project or trade, the 
friends should gather<br>
 together and devise a solution for him. He, in his turn, should act 
accordingly. Likewise in larger issues, when a problem ariseth, or a 
difficulty occurreth, the wise should gather, consult, and devise a 
solution. They should then rely upon the one true God, and surrender to 
His Providence, in whatever way it may be revealed, for divine 
confirmations will undoubtedly assist. Consultation, therefore, is one 
of the explicit ordinances of the Lord of mankind.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	180. Man must consult on all matters, whether major or minor, so 
that he may become cognizant of what is good. Consultation giveth him 
insight into things and enableth him to delve into questions which are 
unknown. The light of truth shineth from the faces of those who engage 
in consultation. Such consultation causeth the living waters to flow in 
the meadows of man's reality, the rays of ancient glory to shine upon 
him, and the tree of his being to be adorned with wondrous fruit. The 
members who are consulting, however, should behave in the utmost love, 
harmony and sincerity towards each other. The principle of consultation 
is one of the most fundamental elements of the divine edifice. Even in 
their ordinary affairs the individual members of society should consult.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	181. Every one of the friends should highly praise the other and 
each should regard himself as evanescent and as naught in the presence 
of others. All matters should be consulted upon in the meeting and 
whatever is the majority vote should be carried out. I swear by the one 
true God, it is better that all should agree on a wrong decision, than 
for one right vote to be singled out, inasmuch as single votes can be 
sources of dissension, which lead to ruin. Whereas, if in one case they 
take a wrong decision, in a hundred other cases they will adopt right 
decisions, and concord and unity are preserved. This will offset any 
deficiency, and will eventually lead to the righting of the wrong.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	182. The purpose of consultation is to show that the views of 
several individuals are assuredly preferable to one man, even as the 
power of a number of men is of course greater than the power of one man.
 Thus<br>
 consultation is acceptable in the presence of the Almighty, and hath 
been enjoined upon the believers, so that they may confer upon ordinary 
and personal matters, as well as on affairs which are general in nature 
and universal.</p>
<p>	For instance, when a man hath a project to accomplish, should he 
consult with some of his brethren, that which is agreeable will of 
course be investigated and unveiled to his eyes, and the truth will be 
disclosed. Likewise on a higher level, should the people of a village 
consult one another about their affairs, the right solution will 
certainly be revealed. In like manner, the members of each profession, 
such as in industry, should consult , and those in commerce should 
similarly consult on business affairs. In short, consultation is 
desirable and acceptable in all things and on all issues.</p>
<p>	(Cited in letter dated 15 February 1922 written by Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia)</p>
<p>	183. Regarding thy question about consultation of a father with his 
son, or a son with his father, in matters of trade and commerce, 
consultation is one of the fundamental elements of the foundation of the
 Law of God. Such consultation is assuredly acceptable, whether between 
father and son, or with others. There is nothing better than this. Man 
must consult in all things for this will lead him to the depths of each 
problem and enable him to find the right solution.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	184. The honoured members of the Spiritual Assembly should exert 
their efforts so that no differences may occur, and if such differences 
do occur, they should not reach the point of causing conflict, hatred 
and antagonism, which lead to threats. When you notice that a stage has 
been reached when enmity and threats are about to occur, you should 
immediately postpone discussion of the subject, until wranglings, 
disputations, and loud talk vanish, and a propitious time is at hand.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	185. Settle all things, both great and small, by consultation. 
Without prior consultation, take no important step in your own personal 
affairs. Concern yourselves with one another. Help along one another's 
projects<br>
 and plans. Grieve over one another. Let none in the whole country go in
 need. Befriend one another until ye become as a single body, one and 
all...[1]<br>
 [1 Cf "Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev.ed.] (Haifa Baha'i World Centre, 1982), Sec. 102, pp. 128-29.]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	185/1. Every meeting which is organized for the purpose of unity and
 concord will be conducive to changing strangers into friends, enemies 
into associates, and 'Abdu'l-Baha will be present in His heart and soul 
with that meeting.</p>
<p>	(Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas" vol.2 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Society, 1915), p. 553)</p>
<p>	186. In this Cause consultation is of vital importance, but 
spiritual conference and not the mere voicing of personal views is 
intended. In France I was present at a session of the senate, but the 
experience was not impressive. Parliamentary procedure should have for 
its object the attainment of the light of truth upon questions presented
 and not furnish a battleground for opposition and self- opinion. 
Antagonism and contradiction are unfortunate and always destructive to 
truth. In the parliamentary meeting mentioned, altercation and useless 
quibbling were frequent; the result, mostly confusion and turmoil; even 
in one instance a physical encounter took place between two members. It 
was not consultation but comedy.</p>
<p>	The purpose is to emphasize the statement that consultation must 
have for its object the investigation of truth. He who expresses an 
opinion should not voice it as correct and right but set it forth as a 
contribution to the consensus of opinion; for the light of reality 
becomes apparent when two opinions coincide. A spark is produced when 
flint and steel come together. Man should weigh his opinions with the 
utmost serenity, calmness and composure. Before expressing his own views
 he should carefully consider the views already advanced by others. If 
he finds that a previously expressed opinion is more true and worthy, he
 should accept it immediately and not willfully hold to an opinion of 
his own. By this excellent method he endeavors to arrive at unity and 
truth. Opposition and division are deplorable. It is better then to have
 the opinion of a wise,<br>
 sagacious man; otherwise, contradiction and altercation, in which 
varied and divergent views are presented, will make it necessary for a 
judicial body to render decision upon the question. Even a majority 
opinion or consensus may be incorrect. A thousand people may hold to one
 view and be mistaken, whereas one sagacious person may be right. 
Therefore, true consultation is spiritual conference in the attitude and
 atmosphere of love. Members must love each other in the spirit of 
fellowship in order that good results may be forthcoming. Love and 
fellowship are the foundation.</p>
<p>	The most memorable instance of spiritual consultation was the 
meeting of the disciples of Jesus Christ upon the mount after His 
ascension. They said, "Jesus Christ has been crucified, and we have no 
longer association and intercourse with Him in His physical body; 
therefore, we must be loyal and faithful to Him, we must be grateful and
 appreciate Him, for He has raised us from the dead, He made us wise, He
 has given us eternal life. What shall we do to be faithful to Him?" And
 so they held council. One of them said, "We must detach ourselves from 
the chains and fetters of the world; otherwise, we cannot be faithful." 
The others replied, "That is so." Another said, "Either we must be 
married and faithful to our wives and children or serve our Lord free 
from these ties. We cannot be occupied with the care and provision for 
families and at the same time herald the Kingdom in the wilderness. 
Therefore, let those who are unmarried remain so, and those who have 
married provide means of sustenance and comfort for their families and 
then go forth to spread the message of glad-tidings." There were no 
dissenting voices; all agreed, saying, "That is right." A third disciple
 said, "To perform worthy deeds in the Kingdom we must be further 
self-sacrificing. From now on we should forego ease and bodily comfort, 
accept every difficulty, forget self and teach the Cause of God." This 
found acceptance and approval by all the others. Finally a fourth 
disciple said, "There is still another aspect to our faith and unity. 
For Jesus' sake we shall be beaten, imprisoned and exiled. They may kill
 us. Let us receive this lesson now. Let us realize and resolve that 
though we are beaten, banished, cursed, spat upon and led forth to be 
killed, we shall accept all this joyfully, loving those who hate and 
wound us." All the disciples replied, "Surely we will -- it is agreed; 
this is right." Then they descended from the summit of the mountain, and
 each went forth in a different direction upon his divine mission.<br>

</p><p>	This was true consultation. This was spiritual consultation and 
not the mere voicing of personal views in parliamentary opposition and 
debate.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912, 
2nd ed (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 72-73)</p>
<p>	187. The first duty of the members is to effect their own unity and 
harmony, in order to obtain good results. If there be no unity, or the 
Committee becomes the cause of inharmony, undoubtedly, it is better that
 it does not exist....</p>
<p>	Therefore, when the unity of the members of the Committee is 
established, their second duty is to read the verses and communes, to be
 in a state of commemoration and mindfulness, that they may see each 
other as if in the presence of God.</p>
<p>	(Published in "Star of the West", vol 8, no. 9 (20 August 1917), p. 114)</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	188. Let us also bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God 
is not dictatorial authority, but humble fellowship, not arbitrary 
power, but the spirit of frank and loving consultation. Nothing short of
 the spirit of a true Baha'i can hope to reconcile the principles of 
mercy and justice, of freedom and submission, of the sanctity of the 
right of the individual and of self-surrender, of vigilance, discretion 
and prudence on the one hand and fellowship, candour and courage on the 
other.</p>
<p>	(23 February 1924 to the Baha'is of America, published in "Baha'i Administration, pp. 63-64)</p>
<p>	189. The duties of those whom the friends have freely and 
conscientiously elected as their representatives are no less vital and 
binding than the obligations of those who have chosen them. Their 
function is not to dictate, but to consult, and consult not only among 
themselves, but as much as possible with the friends whom they 
represent. They must regard themselves in no other light but that of 
chosen instruments for a more efficient and dignified presentation of 
the Cause of God. They should never be led to suppose that they are the 
central ornaments of the body of the Cause, intrinsically superior to 
others in capacity or merit, and sole<br>
 promoters of its teachings and principles. They should approach their 
task with extreme humility, and endeavour by their open-mindedness, 
their high sense of justice and duty, their candour, their modesty, 
their entire devotion to the welfare and interests of the friends, the 
Cause, and humanity, to win not only the confidence and the genuine 
support and respect of those whom they should serve, but also their 
esteem and real affection. They must at all times avoid the spirit of 
exclusiveness, the atmosphere of secrecy, free themselves from a 
domineering attitude, and banish all forms of prejudice and passion from
 their deliberations. They should, within the limits of wise discretion,
 take the friends into their confidence, acquaint them with their plans,
 share with them their problems and anxieties, and seek their advice and
 counsel. And when they are called upon to arrive at a certain decision,
 they should, after dispassionate, anxious, and cordial consultation, 
turn to God in prayer, and with earnestness and conviction and courage 
record their vote and abide by the voice of the majority, which we are 
told by our Master to be the voice of truth, never to be challenged, and
 always to be whole-heartedly enforced. To this voice the friends must 
heartily respond, and regard it as the only means that can ensure the 
protection and advancement of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(23 February 1924 to the Baha'is of America, published in Baha'i Administration, p. 64)</p>
<p>	190. Not infrequently, nay oftentimes, the most lowly, untutored, 
and inexperienced among the friends will, by the sheer inspiring force 
of selfless and ardent devotion, contribute a distinct and memorable 
share to a highly involved discussion in any given assembly.</p>
<p>	(29 January 1925 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration", p. 79)</p>
<p>	191. Indeed it has ever been the cherished desire of our Master 
'Abdu'l-Baha that the friends in their councils, local as well as 
national, should by their candour, their honesty of purpose, their 
singleness of mind, and the thoroughness of their discussions achieve 
unanimity in all things.</p>
<p>	(29 January 1925 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration", p. 80)<br>

</p><p>	192. Consultation, frank and unfettered, is the bedrock of this unique Order.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 18
 November 1933 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	From Letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi[1]:<br>
 [1 To individual believers unless otherwise indicated.]</p>
<p>	193. Concerning the attendance of certain individuals at the meeting
 of the Assemblies and at the invitation of that body: This Shoghi 
Effendi considers to be as expert advice, which is absolutely necessary 
for good administration. The members of the Assembly are not supposed to
 know everything on every subject, so they can invite a person, versed 
in that question, to attend their meetings and explain his views. But 
naturally he will have no right to vote.</p>
<p>	(23 October 1926 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British 
Isles, published in "Unfolding Destiny: The Messages from the Guardian 
of the Baha'i Faith to the Baha'i Community of the British Isles" 
(London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1981), p. 59)</p>
<p>	194. We are often told by the Master that under such circumstances 
we should consult our friends, especially the Assemblies, and seek their
 advice. It would be nice if you should follow that advice and take some
 of the friends into your confidence. Maybe God's will is best attained 
through consultation.</p>
<p>	(12 November 1930)</p>
<p>	195. With proper consultation some method is sure to be found. There
 is no need to wait until an Assembly is constituted to start 
consulting. The view of two earnest souls is always better than one.</p>
<p>	(16 June 1932)</p>
<p>	196. The principle of consultation, which constitutes one of the 
basic laws of the Administration, should be applied to all Baha'i 
activities which affect the collective interests of the Faith, for it is
 through cooperation and continual exchange of thoughts and views that 
the Cause can best<br>
 safeguard and foster its interests. Individual initiative, personal 
ability and resourcefulness, though indispensable, are, unless supported
 and enriched by the collective experiences and wisdom of the group, 
utterly incapable of achieving such a tremendous task.</p>
<p>	(30 August 1933)</p>
<p>	197. The believers should have confidence in the directions and 
orders of their Assembly, even though they may not be convinced of their
 justice or right. Once the Assembly, through a majority vote of its 
members, comes to a decision the friends should readily obey it. 
Specially those dissenting members within the Assembly whose opinion is 
contrary to that of the majority of their fellow-members should set a 
good example before the community by sacrificing their personal views 
for the sake of obeying the principle of majority vote that underlies 
the functioning of all Baha'i Assemblies.</p>
<p>	But before the majority of the Assembly comes to a decision, it is 
not only the right but the sacred obligation of every member to express 
freely and openly his views, without being afraid of displeasing or 
alienating any of his fellow- members. In view of this important 
administrative principle of frank and open consultation, the Guardian 
would advise you to give up the method of asking other members to voice 
your opinion and suggestions. This indirect way of expressing your views
 to the Assembly not only creates an atmosphere of secrecy which is most
 alien to the spirit of the Cause, but would also lead to many 
misunderstandings and complications. The Assembly members must have the 
courage of their convictions, but must also express whole-hearted and 
unqualified obedience to the well-considered judgement and directions of
 the majority of their fellow-members.</p>
<p>	(28 October 1935)</p>
<p>	198. Through the clash of personal opinions, as 'Abdu'l-Baha has 
stated, the spark of truth is often ignited, and Divine guidance 
revealed. The friends should therefore not feel discouraged at the 
differences of opinion that may prevail among the members of an 
Assembly, for these, as experience has shown, and as the Master's words 
attest, fulfil a valuable function in all Assembly deliberations. But 
once the opinion of the majority has been ascertained, all the members 
should automatically and<br>
 unreservedly obey it, and faithfully carry it out. Patience and 
restraint, however, should at all times characterize the discussions and
 deliberations of the elected representatives of the local community, 
and no fruitless and hair-splitting discussions indulged in, under any 
circumstances.</p>
<p>	(18 April 1939)</p>
<p>	199. In your last question, concerning cases when those needed for 
consultation are not available and a person is uncertain on the course 
to be followed in an important matter, you ask whether it is permissible
 for him to resort to the practice of "istikharihn[1] using the 
Kitab-i-Aqdas. The Guardian has stated that in such cases what is 
necessary and essential is for the person to turn his heart wholly to 
God and to beseech aid from the Source of Grace and inspiration and 
nothing else. If it is possible to postpone the decision it would be 
preferable and more proper to do so, until the means for consultation 
are made available.<br>
 [1 This is a process of divination, such as is done through 
bibliomancy, when a Holy Book is opened at random and guidance is sought
 for one's problem by reading passages of the Book on the opened page.]</p>
<p>	(23 April 1941- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	200. The remedy to Assembly inharmony cannot be in the resignation 
or abstinence of any of its members. It must learn, in spite of 
disturbing elements, to continue to function as a whole, otherwise the 
whole system would become discredited through the introduction of 
exceptions to the rule.</p>
<p>	The believers, loving the Cause above all else and putting its 
interests first, must be ready to bear the hardships entailed, of 
whatever nature they may be. Only through such persistence and 
self-sacrifice can we ever hope to preserve on the one hand our divine 
institutions intact, and on the other force ourselves to become nobler, 
better instruments to serve this glorious Faith.</p>
<p>	(20 November 1941)</p>
<p>	201. The questions you ask in your letter about individual guidance 
have two aspects, one might say. It is good that people should turn to 
God and beseech His aid in solving their problems and guiding their 
acts, indeed<br>
 every day of their lives, if they feel the desire to do so. But they 
cannot possibly impose what they feel to be their guidance on anyone 
else, let alone on Assemblies or Committees, as Baha'u'llah has 
expressly laid down the law of consultation and never indicated that 
anything else superseded it.</p>
<p>	(25 January 1943)</p>
<p>	202. The Guardian advises that you should refer to other doctors, and follow the majority vote.[1]<br>
 [1 This advice was given by the Guardian in a case when the inquirer 
sought the Guardian's counsel, since one doctor's view was that an 
operation was needed, while another doctor did not consider such an 
operation necessary.]</p>
<p>	(14 February 1945 - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	203. You have pointed out that on consultative bodies it may 
sometimes happen that in a given case the view of one of the members is 
better and has greater merit than that of the others, but these members 
are not prepared to accept such a view. The Guardian stated that it is 
necessary and imperative to consult frankly and with pure motives before
 arriving at a decision. Once the decision is taken, it is incumbent 
upon all to follow the majority view, and to enforce and put it into 
effect, even if the decision is a wrong one.</p>
<p>(1 February 1946 - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	204. We all have a right to our opinions, we are bound to think 
differently; but a Baha'i must accept the majority decision of his 
Assembly, realizing that acceptance and harmony -- even if a mistake has
 been made -- are the really important things, and when we serve the 
Cause properly, in the Baha'i way, God will right any wrongs done in the
 end.</p>
<p>	...Baha'is are not required to vote on an Assembly against their 
consciences. It is better if they submit to the majority view and make 
it unanimous. But they are not forced to. What they must do, however, is
 to abide by the majority decision, as this is what becomes effective. 
They must not go around undermining the Assembly by saying they 
disagreed with the majority. In other words, they must put the Cause 
first and not their own opinions. He (a Spiritual Assembly member) can 
ask the Assembly to reconsider a matter, but he has no right to force 
them or<br>
 create inharmony because they won't change. Unanimous votes are 
preferable, but certainly cannot be forced upon Assembly members by 
artificial methods such as are used by other societies.</p>
<p>	(19 October 1947)</p>
<p>	205. The Baha'is must learn to forget personalities and to overcome 
the desire -- so natural in people -- to take sides and fight about it. 
They must also learn to really make use of the great principle of 
consultation.</p>
<p>	(30 June 1949 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and 
Austria, published in "The Light of Divine Guidance: The Messages from 
the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith to the Baha'is of Germany and Austria" 
[vol 1], (Hofheim-Langenhain: Baha'i- Verlag 1982), p. 152)</p>
<p>	206. There are no dissenting votes in the Cause. When the majority 
of an Assembly decides a matter the minority, we are told by the Master,
 should accept this. To insist on having one's dissenting vote recorded 
is not good, and achieves no constructive end.</p>
<p>	(19 March 1950)</p>
<p>	207. The Guardian regrets that, in the light of the Master's 
statement that the deliberations of Assemblies must be secret and 
confidential, it is not possible to have a non- Assembly member in the 
National Spiritual Assembly meeting. You must always remember that, in 
matters of principle, there can be no deviation; in America it may be 
possible for you to find a wholly trustworthy believer; but if your 
Assembly is permitted to have non-Assembly secretaries present, then the
 same privilege must be accorded oriental and Latin American Assemblies;
 and can these other countries be assured of finding people of the 
calibre you have found? Highly personal subjects, damaging to the honour
 and happiness of others, are often taken up by National Assemblies, and
 the danger that confidence will be betrayed is already great enough 
with the 9 chosen representatives of the whole Community, let alone 
introducing non-Assembly members. You will just have to make your 
minutes a little more compact and sacrifice, if necessary, a certain 
amount of efficiency in order to follow this very important principle.</p>
<p>	(5 July 1950 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)<br>

</p><p>	From Letters written by the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	208. Although Local Spiritual Assemblies are primarily responsible 
for counseling believers regarding personal problems, there may be 
times, when in the judgement of the National or Local Assembly, it would
 be preferable to assign counselling or advisory duties to individuals 
or committees. This is within the discretion of the Assembly.</p>
<p>	(27 March 1966 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Bolivia)</p>
<p>	209. It is important to realise that the spirit of Baha'i 
consultation is very different from that current in the decision-making 
processes of non-Baha'i bodies.</p>
<p>	The ideal of Baha'i consultation is to arrive at a unanimous 
decision. When this is not possible a vote must be taken. In the words 
of the beloved Guardian: "...when they are called upon to arrive at a 
certain decision, they should, after dispassionate, anxious and cordial 
consultation, turn to God in prayer, and with earnestness and conviction
 and courage record their vote and abide by the voice of the majority, 
which we are told by the Master to be the voice of truth, never to be 
challenged, and always to be whole-heartedly enforced".</p>
<p>	As soon as a decision is reached it becomes the decision of the 
whole Assembly, not merely of those members who happened to be among the
 majority.</p>
<p>	When it is proposed to put a matter to the vote, a member of the 
Assembly may feel that there are additional facts or views which must be
 sought before he can make up his mind and intelligently vote on the 
proposition. He should express this feeling to the Assembly, and it is 
for the Assembly to decide whether or not further consultation is needed
 before voting.</p>
<p>	Whenever it is decided to vote on a proposition all that is required
 is to ascertain how many of the members are in favour of it; if this is
 a majority of those present, the motion is carried; if it is a 
minority, the motion is defeated. Thus the whole question of 
"abstaining" does not arise in Baha'i voting. A member who does not vote
 in favour of a proposition is, in effect, voting against it, even if at
 that moment he himself feels that he has been unable to make up his 
mind on the matter.</p>
<p>	(6 March 1970 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)<br>

</p><p>	210. Your letter of 14 February 1973 enquiring about the uses of Baha'i consultation has been received.</p>
<p>	This is, of course, a matter in which rigidity should be avoided.</p>
<p>	When a believer has a problem concerning which he must make a 
decision, he has several courses open to him. If it is a matter that 
affects the interests of the Faith he should consult with the 
appropriate Assembly or committee, but individuals have many problems 
which are purely personal and there is no obligation upon them to take 
such problems to the institutions of the Faith; indeed, when the needs 
of the teaching work are of such urgency it is better if the friends 
will not burden their Assemblies with personal problems that they can 
solve by themselves.</p>
<p>	A Baha'i who has a problem may wish to make his own decision upon it
 after prayer and after weighing all the aspects of it in his own mind; 
he may prefer to seek the counsel of individual friends or of 
professional counselors such as his doctor or lawyer so that he can 
consider such advice when making his decision; or in a case where 
several people are involved, such as a family situation, he may want to 
gather together those who are affected so that they may arrive at a 
collective decision. There is also no objection whatever to a Baha'i's 
asking a group of people to consult together on a problem facing him.</p>
<p>	It should be borne in mind that all consultation is aimed at 
arriving at a solution to a problem and is quite different from the sort
 of group baring of the soul that is popular in some circles these days 
and which borders on the kind of confession that is forbidden in the 
faith. On the subject of confession the Guardian's secretary wrote on 
his behalf to an individual believer: 'We are forbidden to confess to 
any person, as do the Catholics to their priests, our sins and 
shortcomings, or to do so in public, as some religious sects do. 
However, if we spontaneously desire to acknowledge we have been wrong in
 something, or that we have some fault of character, and ask another 
person's forgiveness or pardon, we are quite free to do so. The Guardian
 wants to point out, however, that we are not obliged to do so. It rests
 entirely with the individual."</p>
<p>	(19 March 1973 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)<br>

</p><p>	From a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	211. The statement which you quote[1] in the second paragraph of 
your letter is taken from a Tablet of 'Abdu'l- Baha which was addressed 
by Him to the friends in Tihran at a time when, without the knowledge 
and permission of the Spiritual Assembly and contrary to government 
regulations, one of the friends undertook to print the Kitab-i-Aqdas. 
The instructions of 'Abdu'l-Baha which you quote were issued on that 
occasion and in that context.<br>
 [1 See extract number 8.]</p>
<p>	The Universal House of Justice has pointed out that when Shoghi 
Effendi enumerates the functions of a Local Spiritual Assembly in 
"Baha'i Administration" page 37, he indicates that the local matters to 
be referred to the Local Spiritual Assembly are those "pertaining to the
 Cause". This does not mean, of course, that personal problems may not 
be referred to Baha'i Assemblies. The Local Spiritual Assembly, however,
 is not the only institution or agency to which the friends may turn for
 consultation on personal matters. Such consultation could be held with 
members of one's family, with friends, or with experts. For example in 
one of His Tablets 'Abdu'l-Baha envisages the possibility of experts in 
one profession conferring together.</p>

</p><p>	THE COVENANT</p>
<p>	December 1987</p>
<p>	Materials assembled by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	A Covenant in the religious sense is a binding agreement between God
 and man, whereby God requires of man certain behaviour in return for 
which He guarantees certain blessings, or whereby He gives man certain 
bounties in return for which He takes from those who accept them an 
undertaking to behave in a certain way. There is, for example, the 
Greater Covenant which every Manifestation of God makes with His 
followers, promising that in the fulness of time a new Manifestation 
will be sent, and taking from them the undertaking to accept Him when 
this occurs. There is also the Lesser Covenant that a Manifestation of 
God makes with His followers that they will accept His appointed 
successor after Him. If they do so, the Faith can remain united and 
pure. If not, the Faith becomes divided and its force spent. It is a 
Covenant of this kind that Baha'u'llah made with His followers regarding
 'Abdu'l-Baha and that 'Abdu'l-Baha perpetuated through the 
Administrative Order...</p>
<p>	(23 March 1975, from a letter written by the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	I. A Covenant: "...a binding agreement between God and man..."</p>
<p>	212. The first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the 
recognition of Him Who is the Day Spring of His Revelation and the 
Fountain of His laws, Who representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom 
of His Cause and the world of creation. Whoso achieveth this duty hath 
attained unto all good... It behoveth every one who reacheth this most 
sublime station, this summit of transcendent glory, to observe every 
ordinance of Him Who is the Desire of the world. These twin duties are 
inseparable. Neither is acceptable without the other....</p>
<p>	They whom God hath endued with insight will readily recognize that 
the precepts laid down by God constitute the highest means for the 
maintenance of order in the world and the security of its! peoples.... 
Hasten to drink your fill, O men of understanding They that have 
violated the Covenant of God by breaking His commandments, and have 
turned back on their heels, these have erred grievously in the sight of 
God, the All-Possessing, the Most High.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, 2nd rev. ed (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), Sec. 155, pp. 330-31)</p>
<p>	213. Follow not, therefore, your earthly desires, and violate not 
the Covenant of God, nor break your pledge to Him. With firm 
determination, with the whole affection of your heart, and with the full
 force of your words, turn ye unto Him, and walk not in the ways of the 
foolish.... Break not the bond that uniteth you with your Creator, and 
be not of those that have erred and strayed from His ways....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, Sec. 153, p. 328)</p>
<p>	214. Great is thy blessedness inasmuch as thou hast been faithful to
 the Covenant of God and His Testament... Dedicate thyself to the 
service of the Cause of thy Lord, cherish His remembrance in thy heart 
and celebrate His praise in such wise that every wayward and heedless 
soul may thereby be roused from slumber.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988, p. 262)<br>

</p><p>	215. ...ye must conduct yourselves in such a manner that ye may 
stand out distinguished and brilliant as the sun among other souls. 
Should any one of you enter a city, he should become a centre of 
attraction by reason of his sincerity, his faithfulness and love, his 
honesty and fidelity, his truthfulness and loving-kindness towards all 
the peoples of the world, so that the people of that city may cry out 
and say: "This man is unquestionably a Baha'i, for his manners, his 
behaviour, his conduct, his morals, his nature, and disposition reflect 
the attributes of the Baha'is." Not until ye attain this station can ye 
be said to have been faithful to the Covenant and Testament of God. For 
He hath, through irrefutable Texts, entered into a binding Covenant with
 us all, requiring us to act in accordance with His sacred instructions 
and counsels.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 71)</p>
<p>	II. "...the Greater Covenant which every Manifestation of God makes with His followers..."</p>
<p>	The Pattern:</p>
<p>	216. The Lord of the universe hath never raised up a prophet nor 
hath He sent down a Book unless He hath established His covenant with 
all men, calling for their acceptance of the next Revelation and of the 
next Book; inasmuch as the outpourings of His bounty are ceaseless and 
without limit.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab", [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p.87)</p>
<p>	217. Abraham, on Him be peace, made a covenant concerning Moses and 
gave the glad-tidings of His coming. Moses made a covenant concerning 
the promised Christ, and announced the good news of His advent to the 
world. Christ made a covenant concerning the Paraclete and gave the 
tidings of His coming. The Prophet Muhammad made a covenant concerning 
the Bab, and the Bab was the One promised by Muhammad, for Muhammad gave
 the tidings of His coming. The Bab made a Covenant concerning the 
Blessed Beauty, Baha'u'llah, and gave the glad-tidings of His coming for
 the Blessed Beauty was the One promised by the Bab. Baha'u'llah made a 
covenant concerning a Promised One Who will<br>
 become manifest after one thousand or thousands of years. That 
Manifestation is Baha'u'llah's Promised One, and will appear after a 
thousand or thousands of years. He, moreover, with His Supreme Pen, 
entered into a great Covenant and Testament with all the Baha'is whereby
 they were all commanded to follow the Centre of the Covenant after His 
ascension, and depart, not even to a hair's breadth, from obeying Him.</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, from a Tablet - translated from the Persian, 
published in "Baha'i World Faith" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 
1976), p. 358)</p>
<p>	The advent of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	218. This is the Day, O my Lord, which Thou didst announce unto all 
mankind as the Day whereon Thou wouldst reveal Thy Self, and shed Thy 
radiance, and shine brightly over all Thy creatures. Thou hast, 
moreover, entered into a covenant with them, in Thy Books, and Thy 
Scriptures, and Thy Scrolls, and Thy Tablets, concerning Him Who is the 
Day-Spring of Thy Revelation, and hast appointed the Bayan to be the 
Herald of this Most Great and all-glorious Manifestation, and this most 
resplendent and most sublime Appearance.</p>
<p>	("Prayers and Meditations by Baha'u'llah" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1979), p. 275)</p>
<p>	The Covenant of Baha'u'llah concerning the next Manifestation:</p>
<p>	219. Verily God will raise up Him Whom God shall make manifest, and 
after Him Whomsoever He willeth, even as He hath raised up prophets 
before the Point of the Bayan. He in truth hath power over all things.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab", p. 144)</p>
<p>	220. Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from God, ere the 
expiration of a full thousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying 
imposter.... Should a man appear, ere the lapse of a full thousand years
 -- each year consisting of twelve months according to the Qur'an, and 
of nineteen months of nineteen days each, according to the Bayan -- and 
if such a man reveal to your eyes all the signs of God, unhesitatingly 
reject him!</p>
<p>	(Baha'u'llah, cited in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah - Selected 
Letters", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 132)<br>

</p><p>	221. Centuries, nay, countless ages, must pass away ere the 
Day-Star of Truth shineth again in its mid-summer splendor, or appeareth
 once more in the radiance of its vernal glory... Concerning the 
Manifestations that will come down in the future "in the shadows of the 
clouds," know, verily, that in so far as their relation to the Source of
 their inspiration is concerned, they are under the shadow of the 
Ancient Beauty. In their relation, however, to the age in which they 
appear, each and every one of them "doeth whatsoever He willeth."</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, cited in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah - Selected Letters", p. 167)</p>
<p>	III. The Letter Covenant: "...that Baha'u'llah made with His followers regarding 'Abdu'l-Baha..."</p>
<p>	Appointment:</p>
<p>	222. It is incumbent upon the Aghsan, the Afnan and My kindred to 
turn, one and all, their faces towards the Most Mighty Branch. Consider 
that which We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book: "When the ocean of My
 presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your 
faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this 
Ancient Root." The object of this sacred verse is none other except the 
Most Mighty Branch ('Abdu'l-Baha). Thus have We graciously revealed unto
 you our potent Will, and I am verily the Gracious, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>	(Baha'u'llah, cited in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah - Selected Letters, p. 134)</p>
<p>	223. In accordance with the explicit text of the Kitab-i- Aqdas 
Baha'u'llah hath made the Center of the Covenant the Interpreter of His 
Word -- a Covenant so firm and mighty that from the beginning of time 
until the present day no religious Dispensation hath produced its like.</p>
<p>('Abdu'l-Baha, cited in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah -<br>
Selected Letters" p. 136)</p>
<p>	224. Today, the most important affair is firmness in the Covenant, because firmness in the Covenant wards off differences.<br>

</p><p>	. . .Baha'u'llah covenanted, not that I ('Abdu'l-Baha) am the 
Promised One, but that 'Abdu'l-Baha is the Expounder of the Book and the
 Centre of His Covenant, and that the Promised One of Baha'u'llah will 
appear after one thousand or thousands of years. This is the Covenant 
which Baha'u'llah made. If a person shall deviate, he is not acceptable 
at the Threshold of Baha'u'llah. In case of differences, 'Abdu'l-Baha 
must be consulted. They must revolve around his good pleasure. After 
'Abdu'l-Baha, whenever the Universal House of Justice is organized it 
will ward off differences.</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, cited in "Star of the West", vol. 4, no. 14 (November 1913), p. 237-38)</p>
<p>	225. Inasmuch as great differences and divergences of denominational
 belief had arisen throughout the past, every man with a new idea 
attributing it to God, Baha'u'llah desired that there should not be any 
ground or reason for disagreement among the Baha'is. Therefore, with His
 own pen He wrote the Book of His Covenant, addressing His relations and
 all people of the world, saying, "Verily, I have appointed One Who is 
the Center of My Covenant. All must obey Him; all must turn to Him; He 
is the Expounder of My Book, and He is informed of My purpose. All must 
turn to Him. Whatsoever He says is correct, for, verily, He knoweth the 
texts of My Book. Other than He, no one doth know My Book." The purpose 
of this statement is that there should never be discord and divergence 
among the Baha'is but that they should always be unified and agreed.... 
Therefore, whosoever obeys the Center of the Covenant appointed by 
Baha'u'llah has obeyed Baha'u'llah, and whosoever disobeys Him has 
disobeyed Baha'u'llah....</p>
<p>	Beware! Beware! lest anyone should speak from the authority of his 
own thoughts or create a new thing out of himself. Beware! Beware! 
According to the explicit Covenant of Baha'u'llah you should care 
nothing at all for such a person. Baha'u'llah shuns such souls.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912, 
2nd ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 322-23)</p>
<p>	226. He is, and should for all time be regarded, first and foremost,
 as the Center and Pivot of Baha'u'llah's peerless and all-enfolding 
Covenant,<br>
 His most exalted handiwork, the stainless Mirror of His light, the 
perfect Exemplar of His teachings, the unerring Interpreter of His Word,
 the embodiment of every Baha'i ideal, the incarnation of every Baha'i 
virtue, the Most Mighty Branch sprung from the Ancient Root, the Limb of
 the Law of God, the Being "round Whom all names revolve," the 
Mainspring of the Oneness of Humanity, the Ensign of the Most Great 
Peace, the Moon of the Central Orb of this most holy Dispensation -- 
styles and titles that are implicit and find their truest, their highest
 and fairest expression in the magic name 'Abdu'l-Baha. He is, above and
 beyond these appellations, the "Mystery of God" -- an expression by 
which Baha'u'llah Himself has chosen to designate Him, and which, while 
it does not by any means justify us to assign to Him the station of 
Prophethood, indicates how in the person of 'Abdu'l-Baha the 
incompatible characteristics of a human nature and superhuman knowledge 
and perfection have been blended and are completely harmonized.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter of 8 February 1934, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah - Selected Letters", p. 134)</p>
<p>	227. Baha'u'llah, the Revealer of God's Word in this Day, the Source
 of Authority, the Fountainhead of Justice, the Creator of a new World 
Order, the Establisher of the Most Great Peace, the Inspirer and Founder
 of a world civilization, the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Unifier and 
Redeemer of all mankind, has proclaimed the advent of God's Kingdom on 
earth, has formulated its laws and ordinances, enunciated its 
principles, and ordained its institutions. To direct and canalize the 
forces released by His Revelation He instituted His Covenant, whose 
power has preserved the integrity of His Faith, maintained its unity and
 stimulated its world-wide expansion throughout the successive 
ministries of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi. It continues to fulfil 
its life-giving purpose through the agency of the Universal House of 
Justice whose fundamental object, as one of the twin successors of 
Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, is to ensure the continuity of that 
divinely-appointed authority which flows from the Source of the Faith, 
to safeguard the unity of its followers, and to maintain the integrity 
and flexibility of its teachings.</p>
<p>	(Universal House of Justice, "The Constitution of the Universal House of Justice" (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1972), pp. 3-4)<br>

</p><p>	Uniqueness of Baha'u'llah's Covenant:</p>
<p>	228. As to the most great characteristic of the revelation of 
Baha'u'llah, a specific teaching not given by any of the Prophets of the
 past: It is the ordination and appointment of the Center of the 
Covenant. By this appointment and provision He has safeguarded and 
protected the religion of God against differences and schisms, making it
 impossible for anyone to create a new sect or faction of belief.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
pp. 455-56)</p>
<p>	229. To direct and canalize these forces let loose by this 
Heaven-sent process, and to insure their harmonious and continuous 
operation after His ascension, an instrument divinely ordained, invested
 with indisputable authority, organically linked with the Author of the 
Revelation Himself, was clearly indispensable. That instrument 
Baha'u'llah had expressly provided through the institution of the 
Covenant, an institution which he had firmly established prior to His 
ascension. This same Covenant He had anticipated in His Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
had alluded to it as He bade His last farewell to the members of His 
family, who had been summoned to His bed-side, in the days immediately 
preceding His ascension, and had incorporated it in a special document 
which He designated as "the Book of My Covenant," and which He 
entrusted, during His last illness, to His eldest son 'Abdu'l-Baha.</p>
<p>	Written entirely in His own hand ... this unique and epoch- making 
Document, designated by Baha'u'llah as His "Most Great Tablet," and 
alluded to by Him as the "Crimson Book" in His "Epistle to the Son of 
the Wolf," can find no parallel in the Scriptures of any previous 
Dispensation, not excluding that of the Bab Himself. For nowhere in the 
books pertaining to any of the world's religious systems, not even among
 the writings of the Author of the Babi Revelation, do we find any 
single document establishing a Covenant endowed with an authority 
comparable to the Covenant which Baha'u'llah had Himself instituted.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, "God Passes By" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1974), pp. 237-38)</p>
<p>	230. ...There is, though, a great difference between this and 
previous Dispensations, for Baha'u'llah has written that this is "the 
Day which shall<br>
 not be followed by night" ("God Passes By", p. 245). He has given us 
His Covenant which provides for a continuing centre of divine guidance 
in the world. The Baha'i Faith has not lacked for ambitious men who 
would seize the reins of authority and distort the Faith for their own 
ends, but in every case they have broken themselves and dashed their 
hopes on the rock of the Covenant.</p>

<p>	IV. The Lesser Covenant: "...that 'Abdu'l-Baha perpetuated through the Administrative Order..."</p>
<p>	Twin Successors:</p>
<p>	231. O my loving friends! After the passing away of this wronged 
one, it is incumbent upon the Aghsan (Branches),the Afnan (Twigs) of the
 Sacred Lote-Tree, the Hands (pillars) of the Cause of God and the loved
 ones of the Abha Beauty to turn unto Shoghi Effendi -- the youthful 
branch branched from the two hallowed and sacred Lote-Trees and the 
fruit grown from the union of the two offshoots of the Tree of Holiness,
 -- as he is the sign of God, the chosen branch, the guardian of the 
Cause of God, he unto whom all the Aghsan, the Afnan, the Hands of the 
Cause of God and His loved ones must turn. He is the expounder of the 
words of God and after him will succeed the first-born of his lineal 
descendents.</p>
<p>	("The Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1968), p. 11)</p>
<p>	232. And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath 
ordained as the source of all good and freed from all error, it must be 
elected by universal suffrage, that is, by the believers. Its members 
must be manifestations of the fear of God and day-springs of knowledge 
and understanding, must be steadfast in God's faith and the well-wishers
 of all mankind.</p>
<p>	("The Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 14)</p>
<p>	233. Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn and all that is not
 expressly recorded therein must be referred to the Universal House of<br>
 Justice. That which this body, whether unanimously or by a majority 
doth carry, that is verily the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself.</p>
<p>	("The Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l- Baha", p. 19)</p>
<p>	234. They [Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha] have also, in unequivocal 
and emphatic language, appointed those twin institutions of the House of
 Justice and of the Guardianship as their chosen Successors, destined to
 apply the principles, promulgate the laws, protect the institutions, 
adapt loyally and intelligently the Faith to the requirements of 
progressive society, and consummate the incorruptible inheritance which 
the Founders of the Faith have bequeathed to the world.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter of 21 March 1930, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah - Selected Letters", pp. 19-20)</p>
<p>	235. ...under the Covenant of God, Shoghi Effendi was, during his 
ministry as Guardian of the Cause, the point of authority in the Faith 
to which all were to turn... The same thing applies to the position 
occupied by the Universal House of Justice in its relationship to the 
friends.</p>
<p>	(9 November 1981, from a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	Authority:</p>
<p>	236. The sacred and youthful branch, the guardian of the Cause of 
God as well as the Universal House of Justice, to be universally elected
 and established, are both under the care and protection of the Abha 
Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of His Holiness, the 
Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they 
decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not 
obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled 
against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with 
them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed 
with God; whoso denieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him 
hath disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth
 aside from him hath in truth deviated, separated himself and turned 
aside from God.</p>
<p>	("The Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 11)<br>

</p><p>	237. ...it is made indubitably clear and evident that the 
Guardian of the Faith has been made the Interpreter of the Word and that
 the Universal House of Justice has been invested with the function of 
legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the teachings. The 
interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own sphere, is as
 authoritative and binding as the enactments of the International House 
of Justice, whose exclusive right and prerogative is to pronounce upon 
and deliver the final judgment on such laws and ordinances as 
Baha'u'llah has not expressly revealed. Neither can, nor will ever, 
infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the other. Neither 
will seek to curtail the specific and undoubted authority with which 
both have been divinely invested.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter of 8 February 1934, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah - Selected Letters" pp. 149-50)</p>
<p>	238. In the conduct of the administrative affairs of the Faith, in 
the enactment of the legislation necessary to supplement the laws of the
 Kitab-i-Aqdas, the members of the Universal House of Justice, it should
 be borne in mind, are not, as Baha'u'llah's utterances clearly imply, 
responsible to those whom they represent, nor are they allowed to be 
governed by the feelings, the general opinion, and even the convictions 
of the mass of the faithful, or of those who directly elect them. They 
are to follow, in a prayerful attitude, the dictates and promptings of 
their conscience. They may, indeed they must, acquaint themselves with 
the conditions prevailing among the community, must weigh 
dispassionately in their minds the merits of any case presented for 
their consideration, but must reserve for themselves the right of an 
unfettered decision. "God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He 
willeth," is Baha'u'llah's incontrovertible assurance. They, and not the
 body of those who either directly or indirectly elect them, have thus 
been made the recipients of the divine guidance which is at once the 
life-blood and ultimate safeguard of this Revelation....</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter of 8 February 1934, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah - Selected Letters", p. 153)<br>

</p><p>	The passing of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	239. At the time of our beloved Shoghi Effendi's death it was 
evident, from the circumstances and from the explicit requirements of 
the Holy Texts[1], that it had been impossible for him to appoint a 
successor in accordance with the provisions of the Will and Testament of
 'Abdu'l-Baha....<br>
 [1 Shoghi Effendi had no children and all the surviving Aghsan had broken the Covenant.]</p>
<p>	(The Universal House of Justice, from a letter dated 9 March 1965, 
published in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages 1963-1968" p. 44)</p>
<p>	240. After prayerful and careful study of the Holy Texts bearing 
upon the question of the appointment of the successor to Shoghi Effendi 
as Guardian of the Cause of God, and after prolonged consultation which 
included consideration of the views of the Hands of the Cause of God 
residing in the Holy Land, the Universal House of Justice finds that 
there is no way to appoint or to legislate to make it possible to 
appoint a second Guardian to succeed Shoghi Effendi.</p>
<p>	(The Universal House of Justice, from a letter dated 6 October 1963,
 published in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages 1963-1968, p. 11)</p>
<p>	The Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	241. The Covenant of Baha'u'llah is unbroken, its all- encompassing 
power inviolate. The two unique features which distinguish it from all 
religious covenants of the past are unchanged and operative. The 
revealed Word, in its original purity, amplified by the divinely guided 
interpretations of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi, remains immutable, 
unadulterated by any man-made creeds or dogmas, unwarrantable 
inferences, or unauthorized interpretations. The channel of Divine 
guidance, providing flexibility in all the affairs of mankind, remains 
open through that institution which was founded by Baha'u'llah and 
endowed by Him with supreme authority and unfailing guidance, and of 
which the Master wrote: "Unto this body all things must be referred." 
How clearly we can see the truth of Baha'u'llah's assertion: "The Hand 
of Omnipotence hath established His Revelation upon an enduring 
foundation. Storms of human strife are powerless to undermine its basis,
 nor will men's fanciful theories succeed in damaging its structure."</p>
<p>	(The Universal House of Justice, from a letter dated October 1963, 
published in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages 1963-1968, p. 13)<br>

</p><p>	242. The Universal House of Justice, which the Guardian said 
would be regarded by posterity as "the last refuge of a tottering 
civilization," is now, in the absence of the Guardian, the sole 
infallibly guided institution in the world to which all must turn, and 
on it rests the responsibility for ensuring the unity and progress of 
the Cause of God in accordance with the revealed Word.</p>
<p>	(The Universal House of Justice, from a letter dated 27 May 1966, 
published in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages 1963-1968", p. 90)</p>
<p>	243. The infallibility of the Universal House of Justice, operating 
within its ordained sphere, has not been made dependent upon the 
presence in its membership of the Guardian of the Cause....</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	However, quite apart from his function as a member and sacred head 
for life of the Universal House of Justice, the Guardian, functioning 
within his own sphere, had the right and duty "to define the sphere of 
the legislative action" of the Universal House of Justice. In other 
words, he had the authority to state whether a matter was or was not 
already covered by the Sacred Texts and therefore whether it was within 
the authority of the Universal House of Justice to legislate upon it....
 The question therefore arises: In the absence of the Guardian, is the 
Universal House of Justice in danger of straying outside its proper 
sphere and thus falling into error? Here we must remember three things: 
First, Shoghi Effendi, during the thirty-six years of his Guardianship, 
has already made innumerable such definitions, supplementing those made 
by 'Abdu'l-Baha and by Baha'u'llah Himself. As already announced to the 
friends, a careful study of the Writings and interpretations on any 
subject on which the House of Justice proposes to legislate always 
precedes its act of legislation. Second, the Universal House of Justice,
 itself assured of Divine guidance, is well aware of the absence of the 
Guardian and will approach all matters of legislation only when certain 
of its sphere of jurisdiction, a sphere which the Guardian has 
confidently described as "clearly defined." Third, we must not forget 
the Guardian's written statement about these two institutions: "Neither 
can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of 
the other."</p>
<p>	(The Universal House of Justice, from a letter dated 27 May 1966, 
published in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages 1963-1968", pp. 82-84)<br>

</p><p>	244. The Universal House of Justice, beyond its function as the 
enactor of legislation, has been invested with the more general 
functions of protecting and administering the Cause, solving obscure 
questions and deciding upon matters that have caused difference....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 7 December 1969, published in "Messages from 
the Universal House of Justice: 1968-1973" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing 
Trust, 1976), pp. 38-39)</p>
<p>	245. Upon the Universal House of Justice, in the words of the 
Guardian, "has been conferred the exclusive right of legislating on 
matters not expressly revealed in the Baha'i Writings." Its 
pronouncements, which are susceptible of amendment or abrogation by the 
House of Justice itself, serve to supplement and apply the Law of God. 
Although not invested with the function of interpretation, the House of 
Justice is in a position to do everything necessary to establish the 
World Order of Baha'u'llah on this earth. Unity of doctrine is 
maintained by the existence of the authentic texts of Scripture and the 
voluminous interpretations of 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi, together 
with the absolute prohibition against anyone propounding "authoritative"
 or "inspired" interpretations or usurping the function of Guardian. 
Unity of administration is assured by the authority of the Universal 
House of Justice.</p>
<p>	(The Universal House of Justice, from a letter dated 9 March 1965, 
published in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages 1963-1968", pp. 52-53)</p>
<p>	246. In the Baha'i Faith there are two authoritative centers 
appointed to which the believers must turn, for in reality the 
Interpreter of the Word is an extension of that center which is the Word
 itself. The Book is the record of the utterance of Baha'u'llah, while 
the divinely inspired Interpreter is the living Mouth of that Book -- it
 is he and he alone who can authoritatively state what the Book means. 
Thus one center is the Book with its Interpreter, and the other is the 
Universal House of Justice guided by God to decide on whatever is not 
explicitly revealed in the Book. This pattern of centers and their 
relationships is apparent at every stage in the unfoldment of the Cause.
 In the Kitab-i-Aqdas Baha'u'llah tells the believers to refer after His
 passing to the Book, and to "Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath 
branched from this Ancient Root." In the Kitab-i-'Ahdi (the Book of 
Baha'u'llah's Covenant), He makes it<br>
 clear that this reference is to 'Abdu'l-Baha. In the Aqdas Baha'u'llah 
also ordains the institution of the Universal House of Justice, and 
confers upon it the powers necessary for it to discharge its ordained 
functions. The Master in His Will and Testament explicitly institutes 
the Guardianship, which Shoghi Effendi states was clearly anticipated in
 the verses of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, reaffirms and elucidates the authority
 of the Universal House of Justice, and refers the believers once again 
to the Book: "Unto the Most Holy Book everyone must turn and all that is
 not expressly recorded therein must be referred to the Universal House 
of Justice," and at the very end of the Will He says: "All must seek 
guidance and turn unto the Center of the Cause and the House of Justice.
 And he that turneth unto whatsoever else is indeed in grievous error."</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 7 December 1969, published in "Messages from the Universal House of Justice: 1968-1973", pp. 42-43)</p>
<p>	V. Response to the Lesser Covenant that "...the Faith can remain united and pure."</p>
<p>	247. ...the power of the Covenant will protect the Cause of 
Baha'u'llah from the doubts of the people of error. It is the fortified 
fortress of the Cause of God and the firm pillar of the religion of God.
 Today no power can conserve the oneness of the Baha'i world save the 
Covenant of God; otherwise differences like unto a most great tempest 
will encompass the Baha'i world. It is evident that the axis of the 
oneness of the world of humanity is the power of the Covenant and 
nothing else.... Therefore, in the beginning the believers must make 
their steps firm in the Covenant so that the confirmations of 
Baha'u'llah may encircle them from all sides, the cohorts of the Supreme
 Concourse may become their supporters and helpers, and the exhortations
 and advices of 'Abdu'l-Baha, like unto the pictures engraved on stone, 
may remain permanent and ineffaceable in the tablets of all hearts.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of the Divine Plan Revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the North 
American Baha'is" rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1977), p.
 49)</p>
<p>	248. Walk, therefore, with a sure step and engage with the utmost 
assurance and confidence in the promulgation of the divine fragrances, 
the glorification of the Word of God and firmness in the Covenant. Rest<br>
 ye assured that if a soul ariseth in the utmost perseverance and 
raiseth the Call of the Kingdom and resolutely promulgateth the 
Covenant, be he an insignificant ant he shall be enabled to drive away 
the formidable elephant from the arena, and if he be a feeble moth he 
shall cut to pieces the plumage of the rapacious vulture.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 209)</p>
<p>	249. The progress of the Cause of God gathers increasing momentum 
and we may with confidence look forward to the day when this Community, 
in God's good time, shall have traversed the stages predicated for it by
 its Guardian, and shall have raised on this tormented planet the fair 
mansions of God's Own Kingdom wherein humanity may find surcease from 
its self-induced confusion and chaos and ruin, and the hatreds and 
violence of this time shall be transmuted into an abiding sense of world
 brotherhood and peace. All this shall be accomplished within the 
Covenant of the everlasting Father, the Covenant of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(The Universal House of Justice, Ridvan Message 1973 to the Baha'is of the World)</p>
<p>	250. The Baha'is must cling firmly to the knowledge that the Cause 
is safely in God's hands, that the Covenant of Baha'u'llah is 
incorruptible and that they can have complete confidence in the ability 
of the Universal House of Justice to function "under the care and 
protection of the Abha Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance 
of His Holiness, the Exalted One"....</p>
<p>	(28 May 1975, from a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	VI. The power of the Covenant:</p>
<p>	251. Today the pulsating power in the arteries of the body of the 
world is the spirit of the Covenant -- the spirit which is the cause of 
life. Whosoever is vivified with this spirit, the freshness and beauty 
of life become manifest in him, he is baptized with the Holy Spirit, he 
is born again, is freed from oppression and tyranny, from heedlessness 
and harshness which deaden the spirit, and attains to everlasting life.<br>
 Praise thou God that thou art firm in the Covenant and the Testament 
and art turning thy face to the Luminary of the world, His Highness 
Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, cited in "Star of the West, vol. 14, No. 7 (October 1923), p. 225)</p>
<p>	252. It is indubitably clear, that the pivot of the oneness of 
mankind is nothing else but the power of the Covenant.... The power of 
the Covenant is as the heat of the sun which quickeneth and promoteth 
the development of all created things on earth. The light of the 
Covenant, in like manner, is the educator of the minds, the spirits, the
 hearts and souls of men.</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, cited in "God Passes By", pp. 238-39)</p>
<p>	253. Today, the Lord of Hosts is the defender of the Covenant, the 
forces of the Kingdom protect it, heavenly souls tender their services, 
and heavenly angels promulgate and spread it broadcast. If it is 
considered with insight, it will be seen that all the forces of the 
universe, in the last analysis serve the Covenant.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p 228)</p>
<p>	254. No power can eliminate misunderstandings except that of the 
Covenant. The power of the Covenant is all-embracing, and resolveth all 
difficulties, for the Pen of Glory hath explicitly declared that 
whatever misunderstanding may arise should be referred to the Centre of 
the Covenant....</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, from a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	255. Were it not for the protecting power of the Covenant to guard 
the impregnable fort of the Cause of God, there would arise among the 
Baha'is, in one day, a thousand different sects as was the case in 
former ages. But in this Blessed Dispensation, for the sake of the 
permanency of the Cause of God and the avoidance of dissension amongst 
the people of God, the Blessed Beauty (may my soul be a sacrifice unto 
Him), has through the Supreme Pen written the Covenant and the 
Testament...</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, cited in "Baha'i World Faith", pp. 357-58)<br>

</p><p>	256. Launched through these very acts[1] into the troublesome 
seas of ceaseless tribulation, piloted by the mighty arm of 'Abdu'l-Baha
 and manned by the bold initiative and abundant vitality of a band of 
sorely-tried disciples, the Ark of Baha'u'llah's Covenant has, ever 
since those days, been steadily pursuing its course contemptuous of the 
storms of bitter misfortune that have raged, and which must continue to 
assail it, as it forges ahead towards the promised haven of undisturbed 
security and peace.<br>
 [1 Events associated with the introduction of the Faith in the West]</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter dated 21 April 1933, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah - Selected Letters", p. 84)</p>
<p>	257. The Covenant is the "axis of the oneness of the world of 
humanity" because it preserves the unity and integrity of the Faith 
itself and protects it from being disrupted by individuals who are 
convinced that only their understanding of the Teachings is the right 
one -- a fate that has overcome all past Revelations. The Covenant is, 
moreover, embedded in the Writings of Baha'u'llah Himself. Thus, as you 
clearly see, to accept Baha'u'llah is to accept His Covenant; to reject 
His Covenant is to reject Him.</p>

<p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH:</p>
<p>	258. In the beginning of every Revelation adversities have prevailed, which later on have been turned into great prosperity.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 82)</p>
<p>	259. Consider the former generations. Witness how every time the Day
 Star of Divine bounty hath shed the light of His Revelation upon the 
world, the people of His Day have arisen against Him, and repudiated His
 truth. They who were regarded as the leaders of men have invariably 
striven to hinder their followers from turning unto Him Who is the Ocean
 of God's limitless bounty.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	Thou hast known how grievously the Prophets of God, His Messengers 
and Chosen Ones, have been afflicted. Meditate a while on the motive and
 reason which have been responsible for such a persecution. At no time, 
in no Dispensation, have the Prophets of God escaped the blasphemy of 
their enemies, the cruelty of their oppressors, the denunciation of the 
learned of their age, who appeared in the guise of uprightness and 
piety. Day and night they passed through such agonies as none can ever 
measure, except the knowledge of the one true God, exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), sec. 23, pp. 56-58)</p>
<p>	260. Know ye that trials and tribulations have, from time 
immemorial, been the lot of the chosen Ones of God and His beloved, and 
such of His servants as are detached from all else but Him, they whom 
neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of the 
Almighty, they that speak not till He hath spoken, and act according to 
His commandment. Such is God's method carried into effect of old, and 
such will it remain in the future....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 64, p. 129)<br>

</p><p>	261. By My life! Mine heart groaneth and mine eyes weep sore for
 the Cause of God and for them that understand not what they say and 
imagine what they cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 100, p. 203)</p>
<p>	262. And if a nightingale[1] soar upward from the clay of self and 
dwell in the rose bower of the heart, and in Arabian melodies and sweet 
Iranian songs recount the mysteries of God -- a single word of which 
quickeneth to fresh, new life the bodies of the dead, and bestoweth the 
Holy Spirit upon the moldering bones of this existence -- thou wilt 
behold a thousand claws of envy, a myriad beaks of rancor hunting after 
Him and with all their power intent upon His death.<br>
 [1 This refers to Baha'u'llah's own Manifestation.]</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	O My friend! Many a hound pursueth this gazelle of the desert of 
oneness; many a talon claweth at this thrush of the eternal garden. 
Pitiless ravens do lie in wait for this bird of the heavens of God, and 
the huntsman of envy stalketh this deer of the meadow of love.</p>
<p>	("The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1986), p. 20; p. 41)</p>
<p>	263. It is clear and evident that whenever the Manifestations of 
Holiness were revealed, the divines of their day have hindered the 
people from attaining unto the way of truth. To this testify the records
 of all the scriptures and heavenly books. Not one Prophet of God was 
made manifest Who did not fall a victim to the relentless hate, to the 
denunciation, denial, and execration of the clerics of His day!...</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	We foresee that in every city people will arise to suppress the 
Blessed Beauty, that the companions of that Lord of being and ultimate 
Desire of all men will flee from the face of the oppressor and seek 
refuge from him in the wilderness, whilst others will resign themselves

<p>	264. The prestige of the Faith of God has immensely increased. Its 
greatness is now manifest. The day is approaching when it will have cast
 a tremendous tumult in men's hearts. Rejoice, therefore, O denizens of 
America, rejoice with exceeding gladness!</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected 
Letters", rev. ed. (Wilmette:Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 79)</p>
<p>	265. In these days the Cause of God, the world over, is fast growing
 in power and, day by day, is spreading further and further to the 
utmost bounds of the earth. Its enemies, therefore, from all the 
kindreds and peoples of the world, are growing aggressive, malevolent, 
envious and bitterly hostile. It is incumbent upon the loved ones of God
 to exercise the greatest care and prudence in all things, whether great
 or small, to take counsel together and unitedly resist the onslaught of
 the stirrers up of strife and the movers of mischief...</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 194, p. 233)</p>
<p>	266. O thou exalted bough of the divine Lote-Tree! ...When thou art 
disdained and rejected by the wicked doers be not cast down; and at the 
power and stiff-neckedness of the presumptuous be neither vexed nor sick
 at heart; for such is the way of heedless souls, from time out of mind.
 "O the misery of men! No Messenger cometh unto them but they laugh Him 
to scorn!"[1]<br>
 [1 Qur'an 36:29]</p>
<p>	Indeed, the attacks and the obstructiveness of the ignorant but 
cause the Word of God to be exalted, and spread His signs and tokens far
 and wide. Were it not for this opposition by the disdainful, this 
obduracy of the slanderers, this shouting from the pulpits, this crying 
and wailing of great and small alike, these accusations of unbelief 
levelled by the ignorant, this uproar from the foolish -- how could news
 of the advent of the Primal Point and the bright dawning of the 
Day-star of Baha ever have reached to east and west? How else could the 
planet have been rocked from pole to pole? How else could Persia have 
become the focal<br>
 point of scattering splendours, and Asia Minor the radiating heart of 
the beauty of the Lord? However else could the flame of the 
Manifestation have spread into the south? By what means could the cries 
of God have been heard in the far north? How else could His summons have
 been heard in the continents of America and of Africa the dark? How 
else could the cockcrow of Heaven have penetrated those ears? How else 
could the sweet parrots of India have come upon this sugar, or 
nightingales have lifted up their warblings out of the land of 'Iraq? 
What else could set the east and west to dancing, how else could this 
Consecrated Spot become the throne of the Beauty of God? How else could 
Sinai behold this burning brightness, how could the Advent's flame adorn
 that mount? How else could the Holy Land be made the footstool of God's
 beauty, and the holy vale of Towa[1] become the site of excellence and 
grace, the sacred spot where Moses put off His shoes? How could the 
breaths of heaven be carried across the Vale of Holiness, how could the 
sweet- scented, airy streams that blow out of the Abha gardens ever be 
perceived by those that dwell on the Verdant Isle? How else could the 
pledges of the Prophets, the joyous tidings of the holy Seers of old, 
the stirring promises given unto this Sacred Place by the Manifestations
 of God, ever have been fulfilled? All these blessings and bestowals, 
the very means of proclaiming the Faith, have come about through the 
scorn of the ignorant, the opposition of the foolish, the stubbornness 
of the dull-witted, the violence of the aggressor. Had it not been for 
these things, the news of the Bab's advent would not, to this day, have 
reached even into lands hard by. Wherefore we should never grieve over 
the blindness of the unwitting, the attacks of the foolish, the 
hostility of the low and base, the heedlessness of the divines, the 
charges of infidelity brought against us by the empty of mind. Such too 
was their way in ages past, nor would it be thus if they were of those 
who know; but they are benighted, and they come not close to 
understanding what is told them.[2]<br>
 [1 Qur'an 20:12. Also referred to as the "Sacred Vale".]<br>

<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 195, pp. 234-36)</p>
<p>	267 ...the friends in the West will unquestionably have their share 
of the calamities befalling the friends in the East. It is inevitable 
that, walking<br>
 the pathway of Baha'u'llah, they too will become targets for persecution by the oppressors.</p>
<p>	Now ye, as well, must certainly become my partners to some slight 
degree, and accept your share of tests and sorrows. But these episodes 
shall pass away, while that abiding glory and eternal life shall remain 
unchanged forever. Moreover, these afflictions shall be the cause of 
great advancement.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 196, pp. 238-39)</p>
<p>	268. This day the powers of all the leaders of religion are directed
 towards the dispersion of the congregation of the All-Merciful, and the
 shattering of the Divine Edifice. The hosts of the world, whether 
material, cultural or political are from every side launching their 
assault, for the Cause is great, very great. Its greatness is, in this 
day, clear and manifest to men's eyes. It is therefore incumbent upon 
all who have come within the shade of the protecting wing of God's 
gracious providence to evince, by His divine and merciful assistance, 
such conspicuous steadfastness and firmness as will arrest the gaze and 
astound the minds of all.</p>
<p>	At the time of the ascension of the Spirit (Jesus Christ), the 
company of those who accepted the new Revelation numbered no more than a
 few souls. So intense was the alarm and perturbation to which that 
event gave rise that, for a time, these souls were quite overcome by 
their agitation and confusion. Then, a few days later, a woman by the 
name of Mary Magdalene arose, and, by her own example, instilled into 
them a constancy and firmness which enabled them to arise for the 
propagation of the Word of God. Although to outward seeming they were no
 more than fishermen and dyers, yet, through the holy confirmations of 
the Cause of God, they carried the divine fragrances far and wide, 
sweetening the breaths of all who inhaled their fragrance and bringing 
new life to every understanding heart.</p>
<p>	Take courage, then, O ye trusted friends of God, from the appearance
 of this mighty and all-swaying power, which was like unto a spirit that
 permeated the body of the world, making it vibrant with its pulse, and 
causing the pillars of idolatry to shake and tremble.</p>
<p>	(The first three sentences are from Shoghi Effendi's translation 
cited in "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 6. The remainder of the 
extract is newly translated.)<br>

</p><p>	269. ...a large multitude of people will arise against you, 
showing oppression, expressing contumely and derision, shunning your 
society, and heaping upon you ridicule. However, the Heavenly Father 
will illumine you to such an extent that, like unto the rays of the sun,
 you shall scatter the dark clouds of superstition, shine gloriously in 
the midst of Heaven and illumine the face of the earth. You must make 
firm the feet at the time when these trials transpire, and demonstrate 
forbearance and patience. You must withstand them with the utmost love 
and kindness; consider their oppression and persecution as the caprice 
of children, and do not give any importance to whatever they do. For at 
the end the illumination of the Kingdom will overwhelm the darkness of 
the world and the exaltation and grandeur of your station will become 
apparent and manifest... Rest ye assured.</p>
<p>	(Cited in "Baha'i News" ["Star of the West"], vol. 1, no. 10 (8 September 1910), pp. 1-2)</p>
<p>	270. Erelong the wicked-doers in that land will arise to heap 
denunciations upon the true believers, and vent their spite upon the 
company of the faithful. Each day they will inflict a galling wound, 
each hour a stunning blow. Rebuking the friends for the love they bear 
Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l- Baha, they will consider justified their 
denunciations, their scorn and malice, and spare no effort to do the 
friends whatever injury it lieth within their power to inflict. Such 
conduct is at one with the modes and practices of the people aforetime: 
in bygone centuries, in the days of the appearance of the holy 
Manifestations, the people acted in just this manner; and now, in these 
days, it is inevitable that they will repeat such actions, nay, act with
 greater perversity than before... Hence it is certain that thou wilt be
 afflicted with adversities, tests and injuries for the sake of the 
Blessed Beauty; yet these afflictions shall be the purest bounties and 
bestowals, and a token of thy acceptance at the Divine Threshold.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	271. But after I leave, some people may arise in opposition, heaping
 persecutions upon you in their bitterness, and in the newspapers there 
may be articles published against the Cause. Rest ye in the assurance of
 firmness. Be well poised and serene, remembering that this is only as 
the harmless twittering of sparrows and that it will soon pass away....<br>
 Therefore, my purpose is to warn and strengthen you against 
accusations, criticisms, revilings and derision in newspaper articles or
 other publications. Be not disturbed by them. They are the very 
confirmation of the Cause, the very source of upbuilding to the 
Movement. May God confirm the day when a score of ministers of the 
churches may arise and with bared heads cry at the top of their voices 
that the Baha'is are misguided. I would like to see that day, for that 
is the time when the Cause of God will spread. Baha'u'llah has 
pronounced such as these the couriers of the Cause. They will proclaim 
from pulpits that the Baha'is are fools, that they are a wicked and 
unrighteous people, but be ye steadfast and unwavering in the Cause of 
God. They will spread the message of Baha'u'llah.</p>

<p>	272. I am however assured and sustained by the conviction, never 
dimmed in my mind, that whatsoever comes to pass in the Cause of God, 
however disquieting, in its immediate effects, is fraught with infinite 
Wisdom and tends ultimately to promote its interests in the world. 
Indeed, our experiences of the distant past, as well as of recent 
events, are too numerous and varied to permit of any misgiving or doubt 
as to the truth of this basic principle- -a principle which throughout 
the vicissitudes of our sacred mission in this world we must never 
disregard or forget.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	True, the Cause as every other movement has its own obstacles, 
complications and unforeseen difficulties, but unlike any other human 
organization it inspires a spirit of Faith and Devotion which can never 
fail to induce us to make sincere and renewed efforts to face these 
difficulties and smooth any differences that may and must arise.</p>

</p><p>	273. On one hand the remarkable revelations of the Beloved's 
Will and Testament, so amazing in all its aspects, so emphatic in its 
injunctions, have challenged and perplexed the keenest minds, whilst the
 ever-increasing confusion of the world, threatened as never before with
 disruptive forces, fierce rivalries, fresh commotions and grave 
disorder, have wellnigh overwhelmed the heart and damped the zeal of 
even the most enthusiastic believer in the destiny of mankind.</p>
<p>	And yet, how often we seem to forget the clear and repeated warnings
 of Our beloved Master, Who, in particular during the concluding years 
of His mission on earth, laid stress on the "severe mental tests" that 
would inevitably sweep over His loved ones of the West - tests that 
would purge, purify and prepare them for their noble mission in life.</p>

<p>	274. That the Cause of God should in the days to come witness many a
 challenging hour and pass through critical stages in preparation for 
the glories of its promised ascendancy in the New World has been time 
and again undeniably affirmed by our departed Master, and is abundantly 
proved to us all by its heroic past and turbulent history....</p>

<p>	275. We cannot believe that as the Movement grows in strength, in 
authority and in influence, the perplexities and the sufferings it has 
had to contend with in the past will correspondingly decrease and 
vanish. Nay, as it grows from strength to strength, the fanatical 
defendants of the strongholds of Orthodoxy, whatever be their 
denomination, realizing the penetrating influence of this growing Faith,
 will arise and strain every nerve to extinguish its light and discredit
 its name....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 February 1927 to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 
123)</p>
<p>	276. For let every earnest upholder of the Cause of Baha'u'llah 
realize that the storms which this struggling Faith of God must needs 
encounter, as the process of the disintegration of society advances, 
shall be fiercer than<br>
 any which it has already experienced. Let him be aware that so soon as 
the full measure of the stupendous claim of the Faith of Baha'u'llah 
becomes to be recognized by those time- honoured and powerful 
strongholds of orthodoxy, whose deliberate aim is to maintain their 
stranglehold over the thoughts and consciences of men, that this infant 
Faith will have to contend with enemies more powerful and more insidious
 than the cruellest torture-mongers and the most fanatical clerics who 
have afflicted it in the past. What foes may not in the course of the 
convulsions that shall seize a dying civilization be brought into 
existence, who will reinforce the indignities which have already been 
heaped upon it!</p>
<p>	We have only to refer to the warnings uttered by 'Abdu'l- Baha in 
order to realize the extent and character of the forces that are 
destined to contest with God's holy Faith. In the darkest moments of His
 life, under 'Abdu'l Hamid's regime, when He stood ready to be deported 
to the most inhospitable regions of Northern Africa, and at a time when 
the auspicious light of the Baha'i Revelation had only begun to break 
upon the West, He in His parting message to the cousin of the Bab, 
uttered these prophetic and ominous words: "HOW GREAT, HOW VERY GREAT IS
 THE CAUSE! HOW VERY FIERCE THE ONSLAUGHT OF ALL THE PEOPLES AND 
KINDREDS OF THE EARTH! ERE LONG SHALL THE CLAMOUR OF THE MULTITUDE 
THROUGHOUT AFRICA, THROUGHOUT AMERICA, THE CRY OF THE EUROPEAN AND OF 
THE TURK, THE GROANING OF INDIA AND CHINA, BE HEARD FROM FAR AND NEAR. 
ONE AND ALL THEY SHALL ARISE WITH ALL THEIR POWER TO RESIST HIS CAUSE. 
THEN SHALL THE KNIGHTS OF THE LORD, ASSISTED BY HIS GRACE FROM ON HIGH, 
STRENGTHENED BY FAITH, AIDED BY THE POWER OF UNDERSTANDING, AND 
REINFORCED BY THE LEGIONS OF THE COVENANT, ARISE AND MAKE MANIFEST THE 
TRUTH OF THE VERSE: 'BEHOLD THE CONFUSION THAT HATH BEFALLEN THE TRIBES 
OF THE DEFEATED!"'</p>
<p>	Stupendous as is the struggle which His words foreshadow, they also 
testify to the complete victory which the upholders of the Greatest Name
 are destined eventually to achieve. Peoples, nations, adherents of 
divers faiths, will jointly and successively arise to shatter its unity,
 to sap its force, and to degrade its holy name. They will assail not 
only the spirit which it<br>
 inculcates, but the administration which is the channel, the 
instrument, the embodiment of that spirit. For as the authority with 
which Baha'u'llah has invested the future Baha'i Commonwealth becomes 
more and more apparent, the fiercer shall be the challenge which from 
every quarter will be thrown at the verities it enshrines.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 21 March 1930 to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters, pp. 
17-18)</p>
<p>	277. The separation that has set in between the institutions of the 
Baha'i Faith and the Islamic ecclesiastical organizations that oppose it
 -- a movement that has originated in Egypt and is now spreading 
steadily throughout the Middle East, and will in time communicate its 
influence to the West -- imposes upon every loyal upholder of the Cause 
the obligation of refraining from any word or action that might 
prejudice the position which our enemies have, in recent years and of 
their own accord, proclaimed and established. This historic development,
 the beginnings of which could neither be recognized nor even 
anticipated in the years immediately preceding 'Abdu'l-Baha's passing, 
may be said to have signalized the Formative Period of our Faith and to 
have paved the way for the consolidation of its Administrative Order. As
 this movement gains momentum, as it receives added impetus from the 
attitude and future action of the civil authorities in Persia, it will 
inevitably manifest its repercussions in the West and will rouse the 
leaders of the Church and finally the civil authorities to challenge the
 claims and eventually to recognize the independent status of the 
Religion of Baha'u'llah.... Our adversaries in the East have initiated 
the struggle. Our future opponents in the West will, in their turn, 
arise and carry it a stage further. Ours is the duty, in anticipation of
 this inevitable contest, to uphold unequivocally and with undivided 
loyalty the integrity of our Faith and demonstrate the distinguishing 
features of its divinely appointed institutions.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 15 June 1935 to the National Spiritual Assembly
 of the United States and Canada, published in "Messages to America:

4-5)<br>

</p><p>	278. That the forces of irreligion, of a purely materialistic 
philosophy, of unconcealed paganism have been unloosed, are now 
spreading, and, by consolidating themselves, are beginning to invade 
some of the most powerful Christian institutions of the western world, 
no unbiased observer can fail to admit. That these institutions are 
becoming increasingly restive, that a few among them are already dimly 
aware of the pervasive influence of the Cause of Baha'u'llah, that they 
will, as their inherent strength deteriorates and their discipline 
relaxes, regard with deepening dismay the rise of His New World Order, 
and will gradually determine to assail it, that such an opposition will 
in turn accelerate their decline, few, if any, among those who are 
attentively watching the progress of His Faith would be inclined to 
question.</p>
<p>	This menace of secularism that has attacked Islam and is undermining
 its remaining institutions, that has invaded Persia, has penetrated 
into India, and raised its triumphant head in Turkey, has already 
manifested itself in both Europe and America, and is, in varying 
degrees, and under various forms and designations, challenging the basis
 of every established religion...</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 March 1936 to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", pp. 
180-81)</p>
<p>	279. Pregnant indeed are the years looming ahead of us all. The twin
 processes of internal disintegration and external chaos are being 
accelerated every day and are inexorably moving towards a climax.... The
 Community of the Most Great Name, the leaven that must leaven the lump,
 the chosen remnant that must survive the rolling up of the old, 
discredited, tottering Order and assist in the unfoldment of a new one 
in its stead, is standing ready, alert, clear- visioned, and 
resolute.... Fierce and manifold will be the assaults with which 
governments, races, classes and religions, jealous of its rising 
prestige and fearful of its consolidating strength, will seek to silence
 its voice and sap its foundations. Unmoved by the relative obscurity 
that surrounds it at the present time, and undaunted by the forces that 
will be arrayed against it in the future, this community, I cannot but 
feel confident, will, no matter how afflictive the agonies of a 
travailing age, pursue its destiny, undeflected in its course,<br>
 undimmed in its serenity, unyielding in its resolve, unshaken in its convictions.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 5 July 1938 to the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the United States and Canada, published in "Messages to America: 
Selected Letters and Cablegrams Addressed to the Baha'is of North 
America, 1932-1946"), pp. 13-14)</p>
<p>	280. How can the beginnings of a world upheaval, unleashing forces 
that are so gravely deranging the social, the religious, the political, 
and the economic equilibrium of organized society, throwing into chaos 
and confusion political systems, racial doctrines, social conceptions, 
cultural standards, religious associations, and trade relationships -- 
how can such agitations, on a scale so vast, so unprecedented, fail to 
produce any repercussions on the institutions of a Faith of such tender 
age whose teachings have a direct and vital bearing on each of these 
spheres of human life and conduct? Little wonder, therefore, if they who
 are holding aloft the banner of so pervasive a Faith, so challenging a 
Cause, find themselves affected by the impact of these world-shaking 
forces. Little wonder if they find that in the midst of this whirlpool 
of contending passions their freedom has been curtailed, their tenets 
contemned, their institutions assaulted, their motives maligned, their 
authority jeopardized, their claim rejected.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	Nor should any of the manifold opportunities, of a totally different
 order, be allowed to pass unnoticed which the evolution of the Faith 
itself, whether at its world center, or in the North American continent,
 or even in the most outlying regions of the earth, must create, calling
 once again upon the American believers to play a part, no less 
conspicuous than the share they have previously had in their collective 
contributions to the propagation of the Cause of Baha'u'llah. I can only
 for the moment cite at random certain of these opportunities which 
stand out preeminently, in any attempt to survey the possibilities of 
the future:</p>
<p>	... the deliverance of Baha'i communities from the fetters of 
religious orthodoxy in such Islamic countries as Persia, 'Iraq, and 
Egypt, and the consequent recognition, by the civil authorities in those
 states, of the independent status and religious character of Baha'i 
National and Local Assemblies; the precautionary and defensive measures 
to be devised, coordinated,<br>
 and carried out to counteract the full force of the inescapable attacks
 which organized efforts of ecclesiastical organizations of various 
denominations will progressively launch and relentlessly pursue; and, 
last but not least, the multitudinous issues that must be faced, the 
obstacles that must be overcome, and the responsibilities that must be 
assumed, to enable a sore-tried Faith to pass through the successive 
stages of unmitigated obscurity, of active repression, and of complete 
emancipation, leading in turn to its being acknowledged as an 
independent Faith, enjoying the status of full equality with its sister 
religions, to be followed by its establishment and recognition as a 
State religion, which in turn must give way to its assumption of the 
rights and prerogatives associated with the Baha'i state, functioning in
 the plenitude of its powers, a stage which must ultimately culminate in
 the emergence of the worldwide Baha'i Commonwealth, animated wholly by 
the spirit, and operating solely in direct conformity with the laws and 
principles of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	In the conduct of this twofold crusade the valiant warriors 
struggling in the name and for the Cause of Baha'u'llah must, of 
necessity, encounter stiff resistance, and suffer many a setback. Their 
own instincts, no less than the fury of conservative forces, the 
opposition of vested interests, and the objections of a corrupt and 
pleasure-seeking generation, must be reckoned with, resolutely resisted,
 and completely overcome. As their defensive measures for the impending 
struggle are organized and extended, storms of abuse and ridicule, and 
campaigns of condemnation and misrepresentation, may be unloosed against
 them. Their Faith, they may soon find, has been assaulted, their 
motives misconstrued, their aims defamed, their aspirations derided, 
their institutions scorned, their influence belittled, their authority 
undermined, and their Cause, at times, deserted by a few who will either
 be incapable of appreciating the nature of their ideals, or unwilling 
to bear the brunt of the mounting criticisms which such a contest is 
sure to involve. "Because of 'Abdu'l-Baha," the beloved Master has 
prophesied, many a test will be visited upon you. Troubles will befall 
you, and suffering afflict you."</p>
<p>	Let not, however, the invincible army of Baha'u'llah, who in the 
West, and at one of its potential storm-centers is to fight, in His name
 and for<br>
 His sake, one of its fiercest and most glorious battles, be afraid of 
any criticism that might be directed against it. Let it not be deterred 
by any condemnation with which the tongue of the slanderer may seek to 
debase its motives. Let it not recoil before the threatening advance of 
the forces of fanaticism, of orthodoxy, of corruption, and of prejudice 
that may be leagued against it. The voice of criticism is a voice that 
indirectly reinforces the proclamation of its Cause. Unpopularity but 
serves to throw into greater relief the contrast between it and its 
adversaries, while ostracism is itself the magnetic power that must 
eventually win over to its camp the most vociferous and inveterate 
amongst its foes....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 December 1938 to the Baha'is of the United 
States and Canada, published in "The Advent of Divine Justice, pp. 2-3; 
pp. 14-15; pp. 41-42)</p>
<p>	281. Nor should a survey of the outstanding features of so blessed 
and fruitful a ministry omit mention of the prophecies which the 
unerring pen of the appointed Center of Baha'u'llah's Covenant has 
recorded! These foreshadow the fierceness of the onslaught that the 
resistless march of the Faith must provoke in the West, in India and in 
the Far East when it meets the time-honored sacerdotal orders of the 
Christian, the Buddhist and Hindu religions. They foreshadow the turmoil
 which its emancipation from the fetters of religious orthodoxy will 
cast in the American, the European, the Asiatic and African 
continents....</p>

<p>	282. No matter how long the period that separates them from ultimate
 victory; however arduous the task; however formidable the exertions 
demanded of them; however dark the days which mankind, perplexed and 
sorely-tried, must, in its hour of travail, traverse; however severe the
 tests with which they who are to redeem its fortunes will be 
confronted; however afflictive the darts which their present enemies, as
 well as those whom Providence, will, through His mysterious 
dispensations raise up from within or from without, may rain upon them, 
however grievous the ordeal of temporary separation from the heart and 
nerve-center of their Faith which future unforeseeable disturbances may 
impose upon them, I adjure them, by the precious blood that flowed in 
such great profusion, by the lives of the unnumbered saints and heroes 
who were immolated,<br>
 by the supreme, the glorious sacrifice of the Prophet-Herald of our 
Faith, by the tribulations which its Founder, Himself, willingly 
underwent, so that His Cause might live, His Order might redeem a 
shattered world and its glory might suffuse the entire planet - I adjure
 them, as this solemn hour draws nigh, to resolve never to flinch, never
 to hesitate, never to relax, until each and every objective in the 
Plans to be proclaimed, at a later date, has been fully consummated.</p>

 efficacious weapons their own hands have slowly and laboriously forged

organized forces of superstition, of corruption and of unbelief; placing

America 1947-1957" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), p. 120)</p>
<p>	284. The administrative problems which face you are divers and 
complex. The opposition which a nascent Faith must needs meet, 
particularly from the leaders of religious orthodoxy in the Islamic 
countries of the North, will, as the institutions of that Faith 
multiply, become more apparent and grow in severity....</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 2 
July 1956 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of 
North West Africa)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF SHOGHI EFFENDI:</p>
<p>	285. For the history of the Cause, particularly in Persia, is a 
clear illustration of the truth that such persecutions invariably serve 
to<br>
 strengthen the believers in their faith, by stimulating the spiritual 
powers latent in their hearts, and by awakening in them a new and deeper
 consciousness of their duties and responsibilities towards the Faith. 
Indeed, the mere progress of the Cause, by provoking the hatreds and 
jealousies of peoples and nations, creates for itself such difficulties 
and obstacles as only its divine spirit can overcome. 'Abdu'l-Baha has 
emphatically stated that the enmity and opposition of the world will 
increase in direct proportion to the extension and progress of the 
Faith. The greater the zeal of the believers and the more striking the 
effect of their achievements, the fiercer will be the opposition of the 
enemy.</p>
<p>	(20 January 1935 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	286. He is, indeed, fully alive to the difficulties which the 
friends, not only in your centre but all around the world, are daily 
encountering in their attempt to establish and perfect the 
administrative machinery of the Faith. These difficulties and obstacles,
 however, he considers to be inevitable, inherent as they are in the 
very process through which the Cause of Baha'u'llah is destined to 
develop and to eventually establish its ascendancy in the world. Not 
only are such difficulties inevitable, but they should be viewed, 
indeed, as constituting a God-given test whereby the friends can, and 
will assuredly, enrich and perfect the spiritual and moral energies 
latent in them, and in this way help in establishing that Divine 
civilization promised to them by God.</p>
<p>	Trials and sufferings, Baha'u'llah has repeatedly warned us in His 
Tablets, are even as the oil that feeds the lamp. The Cause cannot 
reveal its full splendour unless and until it encounters and 
successfully overcomes the very obstacles that every now and then stand 
in its way, and for some time appear to threaten its very foundations. 
Such obstacles, tests and trials are indeed blessings in disguise, and 
as such are bound to help in promoting the Faith.</p>
<p>	(31 July 1935 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	287. ...though he has been made truly grieved to learn of the 
continued and malignant opposition which the enemies of the Cause in 
..., and particularly the clerical element, are directing against the 
believers in that centre. He wishes you, however, to urge the friends 
not to feel in the least disheartened or discouraged, but to pursue with
 renewed determination,<br>
 unity and vigour their sacred task of spreading and establishing the 
Faith, confident in the glorious future awaiting them. The greater the 
number of persecutions, and the more intense they become in character, 
the deeper their faith should be in the unique mission entrusted to them
 by Baha'u'llah, and the greater their zeal to help in hastening is 
complete fulfilment.</p>
<p>	This Cause, as every Divine Cause, cannot be effectively established
 unless it encounters and valiantly triumphs over the forces of 
opposition with which it is assailed. The history of the Faith is in 
itself a sufficient proof of that. Trials and persecutions have always 
been, and will continue to be, the lot of the chosen ones of God. But 
these they should consider as blessings in disguise, as through them 
their faith will be quickened, purified and strengthened. Baha'u'llah 
compares such afflictive trials to the oil which feeds the lamp of the 
Cause of God.</p>
<p>	The friends should, therefore, not assume an attitude of mere 
resignation in the face of persecutions. They should rather welcome 
them, and utilize them as [a] means for their own spiritual uplift and 
also for the promotion of the Cause. As the Faith grows stronger and 
attracts the serious attention and consideration of the world outside, 
the friends must expect a similar, if not a greater, increase in the 
forces of opposition which from every direction, both secular and 
religious, will be massed to undermine the very basis of its existence. 
The final outcome of such a struggle, which will be surely gigantic, is 
clear to us believers. A Faith born of God and guided by His Divine and 
all-pervasive spirit cannot but finally triumph and firmly establish 
itself, no matter how persistent and insidious the forces with which it 
has to contend. The friends should be confident, and act with the utmost
 wisdom and moderation, and should particularly abstain from any 
provocative act. The future is surely theirs.</p>
<p>	(24 June 1936 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	288. His fears are rather for those friends who, due to their 
insufficient realization of the divine power that mysteriously operates 
in the Faith, are prone to look at such developments as constituting the
 death-knell of the Cause. In his communications to the ... friends 
during the last few weeks he has always stressed the fact, and he wishes
 you to do the same in all your conversations and correspondence with 
them, that the Cause is bound sooner or later to suffer from all kinds 
of attacks and persecutions,<br>
 that these in fact constitute the life-blood of its institutions, and 
as such constitute an inseparable and intrinsic part of its development 
and growth. Trials and tribulations, as Baha'u'llah says, are the oil 
that feed the lamp of the Cause, and are indeed blessings in disguise. 
The friends should therefore be confident that all these attacks to 
which the Cause is now subjected in ... are a necessary part of the 
development of the Cause, and that their outcome would be beneficial to 
its best interests.</p>
<p>	(31 August 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	289. Later on, when the very progress of the Cause on the one hand, 
and the corresponding decline in ecclesiastical organizations on the 
other will inevitably incite Christian ecclesiastical leaders to 
vehemently oppose and undermine the Faith, the believers will then have a
 real chance to defend and vindicate the Cause....</p>
<p>	(25 May 1938 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	290. It seems both strange and pitiful that the Church and clergy 
should always, in every age, be the most bitter opponents of the very 
Truth they are continually admonishing their followers to be prepared to
 receive! They have become so violently attached to the form that the 
substance itself eludes them!</p>
<p>	However, such denunciations as those your minister made publicly 
against you and the Baha'i Faith can do no harm to the Cause at all; on 
the contrary they only serve to spread its name abroad and mark it as an
 independent religion.</p>
<p>	(7 February 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	291. It is too bad that some of the Friends have left the Faith due 
to the pressure of the Church leaders. Of course, it was inevitable that
 Church leaders would oppose us. The Master has predicted that this 
would occur; and likewise the very nature of events whereby the Faith 
grows and develops taking members away from the Church will cause a 
reaction of the Church against us. We must bear in mind that every 
attack from the religious leaders in the past has been a means for the 
development of the<br>
 Faith itself because those who listen to the attacks can't help but be affected by the purity and sincerity of the Faith.</p>
<p>	(19 June 1957 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN BY THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE:</p>
<p>	292. The marvellous victories won in the name of Baha'u'llah, ... 
and the triumphs increasingly being achieved by His dedicated and ardent
 lovers in every land, will no doubt serve to rouse the internal and 
external enemies of the Faith to fresh attempts to attack the Faith and 
dampen the enthusiasm of is supporters...</p>
<p>	...the progressive unfoldment and onward march of the Faith of God 
are bound to raise up adversaries, indubitably foreshadowing the 
world-wide opposition which is to come, and unequivocally giving the 
assurance of ultimate victory.</p>
<p>	We feel strongly that ... the time has come for them [the friends] 
to clearly grasp the inevitability of the critical contests which lie 
ahead, give you their full support in repelling with confidence and 
determination "the darts" which will be levelled against them by "their 
present enemies, as well as those whom Providence will, through His 
mysterious dispensations raise up from within or from without," and aid 
and enable the Faith of God to scale loftier heights, win more signal 
triumphs, and traverse more vital stages in is predestined course to 
complete victory and world-wide ascendancy.</p>
<p>	(26 November 1974 to all National Spiritual Assemblies)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE:</p>
<p>	293. ...the Universal House of Justice instructs us to say that it 
is to be expected that books will be written against the Faith 
attempting to distort is teachings, to denigrate is accomplishments, to 
vilify is Founders and leaders and to destroy is very foundations. The 
friends should not be unduly exercised when these books appear and 
certainly no issue should be made of them.</p>
<p>	(30 March 1976 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Hong Kong)<br>

</p><p>	294. As your teaching and proclamation work progresses there is 
bound to be more and more confrontation with the older religious 
institutions in ..., and it is the kind of staunchness evinced by ... 
which will bring respect to the Cause and attract the confirmations of 
Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(7 June 1981 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Ireland)</p>
<p>	295. ...ln these days Baha'is can expect the flame of fanaticism to 
be kindled among the enemies of the Faith in Muslim countries. In 
meeting attacks the friends should learn to combine the spirit of 
steadfastness and courage with love and wisdom. They should avoid 
argument and conflict and conduct themselves in such manner that they do
 not provoke retaliation. This includes the use of discretion in their 
teaching activities.</p>
<p>	(22 August 1983 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Bangladesh)</p>
<p>	296. Given the rise in most parts of the world of religious bigotry 
and fundamentalism, it may be timely for your National Assembly to try 
to arm the Baha'is against such attacks as appear in this book,[1] which
 is so typical of the approach of Christian churches. Sooner or later, 
as you know, these churches will rise against the Cause.<br>
 [1 "A Guide to Cults and New Religions", John Boykin]</p>
<p>	You are therefore requested to consider asking a qualified person or
 group of persons to prepare suitable materials, perhaps for a booklet, 
which the friends may use in dealing with misrepresentations of the 
Baha'i Teachings by Christians.</p>

<p>	Say: Tribulation is a horizon unto My Revelation. The day star of 
grace shineth above it, and sheddeth a light which neither the clouds of
 men's idle fancy nor the vain imaginations of the aggressor can 
obscure.</p>
<p>	Follow thou the footsteps of thy Lord, and remember His servants 
even as He doth remember thee, undeterred by either the clamor of the<br>
 heedless ones or the sword of the enemy.... Spread abroad the sweet 
savors of thy Lord, and hesitate not, though it be for less than a 
moment, in the service of His Cause. The day is approaching when the 
victory of thy Lord, the Ever- Forgiving, the Most Bountiful, will be 
proclaimed.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 17, pp. 42-43)</p>
<p>	298. Behold how in this Dispensation the worthless and foolish have 
fondly imagined that by such instruments as massacre, plunder and 
banishment they can extinguish the Lamp which the Hand of Divine power 
hath lit, or eclipse the Day Star of everlasting splendor. How utterly 
unaware they seem to be of the truth that such adversity is the oil that
 feedeth the flame of this Lamp! Such is God's transforming power. He 
changeth whatsoever He willeth; He verily hath power over all things....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, sec. 29, p. 72)</p>
<p>	299. Say: The fierce gales and whirlwinds of the world and its 
peoples can never shake the foundation upon which the rocklike stability
 of My chosen ones is based. Gracious God! What could have prompted 
these people to enslave and imprison the loved ones of Him Who is the 
Eternal Truth? ... The day, however, is approaching when the faithful 
will behold the Day Star of justice shining in its full splendor from 
the Day Spring of glory. Thus instructeth thee the Lord of all being in 
this, His grievous Prison.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", sec. 162, pp. 341-342)</p>

<p>	301. Should they attempt to conceal His light on the continent, He 
will assuredly rear His head in the midmost heart of the ocean and, 
raising His voice, proclaim: "I am the lifegiver of the world!" ... And 
if they cast Him into a darksome pit, they will find Him seated on 
earth's loftiest heights calling aloud to all mankind: "Lo, the Desire 
of the world is come in His majesty, His sovereignty, His transcendent 
dominion!" And if He be buried beneath the depths of the earth, His 
Spirit soaring to the apex<br>
 of heaven shall peal the summons: "Behold ye the coming of the Glory; 
witness ye the Kingdom of God, the most Holy, the Gracious, the 
All-Powerful!..."</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", p. 108)</p>
<p>	302. At this moment We call to remembrance Our loved ones and bring 
them the joyous tidings of God's unfailing grace and of the things that 
have been provided for them in My lucid Book. Ye have tolerated the 
censure of the enemies for the sake of My love and have steadfastly 
endured in My Path the grievous cruelties which the ungodly have 
inflicted upon you. Unto this I Myself bear witness, and I am the All- 
Knowing. How vast the number of places that have been ennobled with your
 blood for the sake of God. How numerous the cities wherein the voice of
 your lamentation hath been raised and the wailing of your anguish 
uplifted. How many the prisons into which ye have been cast by the hosts
 of tyranny. Know ye of a certainty that He will render you victorious, 
will exalt you among the peoples of the world and will demonstrate your 
high rank before the gaze of all nations. Surely He will not suffer the 
reward of His favoured ones to be lost.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988), pp. 246-47)</p>
<p>	303. Verily God rendereth His Cause victorious at one time through 
the aid of His enemies and at another by virtue of the assistance of His
 chosen ones. Concerning those pure and blessed souls, Our Pen of Glory 
hath revealed that which excelleth the whole world, its treasures and 
whatsoever existeth therein. Erelong shall the heedless and the doers of
 wickedness be repaid for that which their hands have wrought.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	304. Whatsoever occurreth in the world of being is light for His 
loved ones and fire for the people of sedition and strife. Even if all 
the losses of the world were to be sustained by one of the friends of 
God, he would still profit thereby, whereas true loss would be borne by 
such as are wayward,<br>
 ignorant and contemptuous. Although the author[1] of the following 
saying had intended it otherwise, yet We find it pertinent to the 
operation of God's immutable Will:<br>
 [1 Sa'di, Muslihu'd-Din of Shiraz (d. 691 A.H./1292 A.D.),famed author of the "Gulistan" and other poetical works.]</p>
<p>	"Even or odd, thou shalt win the wager." The friends of God shall 
win and profit under all conditions, and shall attain true wealth. In 
fire they remain cold, and from water they emerge dry. Their affairs are
 at variance with the affairs of men. Gain is their lot, whatever the 
deal. To this testifieth every wise one with a discerning eye, and every
 fair-minded one with a hearing ear.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS AND UTTERANCES OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA</p>
<p>	305. The friends of God are supported by the Kingdom on high and 
they win their victories through the massed armies of the most great 
guidance. Thus for them every difficulty will be made smooth, every 
problem will most easily be solved.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha, p. 279)</p>
<p>	306. Soon will the Western regions become as radiant as the horizons
 of the East, and the Sun of Truth shine forth with a refulgence that 
will cause the darkness of error to fade away and vanish. Great is the 
multitude who will rise up to oppose you, who will oppress you, heap 
blame upon you, rejoice at your misfortunes, account you people to be 
shunned, and visit injury upon you; yet shall your heavenly Father 
confer upon you such spiritual illumination that ye shall become even as
 the rays of the sun which, as they chase away the sombre clouds, break 
forth to flood the surface of the earth with light. It is incumbent upon
 you, whensoever these tests may overtake you, to stand firm, and to be 
patient and enduring. Instead of repaying like with like, ye should 
requite opposition with the utmost benevolence and loving-kindness, and 
on no account attach importance to cruelties and injuries, but rather 
regard them as the wanton acts of children. For ultimately the radiance 
of the Kingdom will overwhelm the darkness of the world of being, and 
the holy, exalted character of your aims will become unmistakably 
apparent. Nothing shall<br>
 remain concealed: the olive oil, though stored within the deepest 
vault, shall one day burn in brightness from the lamp atop the beacon. 
The small shall be made great, and the powerless shall be given 
strength; they that are of tender age shall become the children of the 
Kingdom, and those that have gone astray shall be guided to their 
heavenly home.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	307. Thou hadst written concerning the growth in stature of the 
Cause of God in thy country. There is no doubt that the Faith of God 
will progress from day to day in that land, for it will be aided by the 
strengthening power of the Holy Spirit and the confirmation of the Word 
of God. Nor is there any doubt that members of the Christian clergy will
 rise up against it in implacable hostility, wishing to injure and 
oppress you, and seeking to assail you with doubts; for the spread of 
the Cause of God will lead to the waning of their fortunes -- as the 
fortunes of the Pharisees had waned before them -- and entail the loss 
of the dignity and standing that they now enjoy amongst men.</p>
<p>	Reflect upon the time of Jesus and the deeds wrought by the Jewish 
divines and Pharisees. Such deeds will, in this day, be repeated at the 
hands of these Christian clergymen. Be not perturbed, however; be firm 
and constant, for it is certain that a company of souls shall, with 
infinite love, arise to enter into the Kingdom of God. These souls shall
 recompense you for the vexations, the humiliations, and disdain to 
which you are subjected by the clergy: to the injuries inflicted by 
these latter they shall respond with acts of kindness, until eventually,
 as the experience of former times hath shown, the children of the 
Kingdom shall gain the ascendancy, and victory shall be theirs. Rest ye 
confident of this.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	308. All who stand up in the cause of God will be persecuted and 
misunderstood. It hath ever been so, and will ever be. Let neither enemy
 nor friend disturb your composure, destroy your happiness, deter your 
accomplishment. Rely wholly upon God. Then will persecution and slander 
make you the more radiant. The designs of your enemies will rebound upon
 them. They, not you, will suffer.</p>
<p>	Oppression is the wind that doth fan the fire of the Love of God. 
Welcome persecution and bitterness. A soldier may bear arms, but until<br>
 he hath faced the enemy in battle he hath not earned his place in the 
king's army. Let nothing defeat you. God is your helper. God is 
invincible. Be firm in the Heavenly Covenant. Pray for strength. It will
 be given to you, no matter how difficult the conditions.</p>
<p>	("Star of the West", vol. 4, no. 5 (5 June 1913), p. 88 - revised translation)</p>
<p>	309. And now, if you act in accordance with the teachings of 
Baha'u'llah, you may rest assured that you will be aided and confirmed. 
You will be rendered victorious in all that you undertake, and all the 
inhabitants of the earth will be unable to withstand you. You are 
conquerors, because the power of the Holy Spirit assisteth you. Above 
and beyond all physical and phenomenal forces, the Holy Spirit itself 
shall aid you.</p>

<p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF SHOGHI EFENDI:</p>
<p>	310. If, in days to come, that land[1] should be overtaken by 
diverse afflictions and calamities; if, to the rigours of the present 
times there should be added the outbreak of widespread civil upheavals; 
if the country's already dark horizons should become still gloomier and 
more foreboding, you should neither be filled with trepidation and 
despondency, nor allow yourselves to be deflected, though it be to the 
extent of a hair's breadth, from that sound and well-considered course 
that you have been following up till now -- from continuing, in other 
words, your persistent, tireless, and unremitting labours to increase 
the number of the Baha'i administrative institutions, to strengthen 
their foundations, to enhance the fair name that they enjoy, and to 
consolidate the respect and standing in which they are held. The release
 of this innocent and wronged community from the bonds of captivity, and
 its deliverance from the clutches of the enemy and oppressor, cannot 
but be accompanied by general commotions and disturbances; likewise the 
attainment by the people of Baha to a position in which they will enjoy 
true honour, comfort and tranquillity must inevitably encounter the 
hostility and resistance, the clamorous opposition and tumultuous 
protests of all those who harbour enmity and rancour towards them. If, 
therefore,the troubled waters of the sea of adversity should grow yet 
more<br>
 turbulent, if the storm of tribulation should increase in vehemence and
 assail that sore-tried community from all six sides with fresh 
disasters, then know unhesitatingly and with unwavering conviction, that
 the hour of deliverance, the appointed time when the promises of old 
are to reach their glorious fulfilment, has drawn nigh, and that the 
means for the accomplishment of supreme and overwhelming victory by the 
hard-pressed followers of the Greatest Name in that land have all been 
readied and prepared. Fixity of purpose and unfaltering resolution are 
the qualities that must needs be manifested by the people of Baha if 
they are successfully to traverse these last remaining stages, and 
witness, at the highest levels, and in a manner that will fill them with
 astonishment, the realization of their profoundest hopes and of their 
most deeply cherished desires. Such is the way of God -- "and no change 
canst thou find in the way of God".[2]<br>

<p>	(From a letter dated 11 January 1928 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	311. ...it behooves us, while expectantly watching from a distance 
the moving spectacle of the struggling Faith of Baha'u'llah, to seek 
abiding solace and strength from the reflection that whatever befalls 
this Cause, however grievous and humiliating the visitations that from 
time to time may seem to afflict the organic life or interfere with the 
functions of the administrative machinery of the Baha'i Faith, such 
calamities cannot but each eventually prove to be a blessing in disguise
 designed, by a Wisdom inscrutable to us all, to establish and 
consolidate the sovereignty of Baha'u'llah on this earth.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 1 January 1929 to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 
164)</p>
<p>	312. Numerous and powerful have been the forces that have schemed, 
both from within and from without, in lands both far and near, to quench
 its light and abolish its holy name. Some have apostatized from its 
principles, and betrayed ignominiously its cause. Others have hurled 
against it the fiercest anathemas which the embittered leaders of any 
ecclesiastical institution are able to pronounce. Still others have 
heaped<br>
 upon it the afflictions and humiliations which sovereign authority can alone, in the plentitude of its power, inflict.</p>
<p>	The utmost its avowed and secret enemies could hope to achieve was 
to retard its growth and obscure momentarily its purpose. What they 
actually accomplished was to purge and purify its life, to stir it to 
still greater depths, to galvanize its soul, to prune its institutions, 
and cement its unity. A schism, a permanent cleavage in the vast body of
 its adherents, they could never create.</p>
<p>	They who betrayed its cause, its lukewarm and faint-hearted 
supporters, withered away and dropped as dead leaves, powerless to cloud
 its radiance or to imperil its structure. Its most implacable 
adversaries, they who assailed it from without, were hurled from power, 
and, in the most astonishing fashion, met their doom. Persia had been 
the first to repress and oppose it. Its monarchs had miserably fallen, 
their dynasty had collapsed, their name was execrated, the hierarchy 
that had been their ally and had propped their declining state, had been
 utterly discredited. Turkey, which had thrice banished its Founder and 
inflicted on Him cruel and lifelong imprisonment, had passed through one
 of the severest ordeals and far-reaching revolutions that its history 
has recorded, had shrunk from one of the most powerful empires to a tiny
 Asiatic republic, its Sultanate obliterated, its dynasty overthrown, 
its Caliphate, the mightiest institution of Islam, abolished.</p>
<p>	Meanwhile the Faith that had been the object of such monstrous 
betrayals, and the target for such woeful assaults, was going from 
strength to strength, was forging ahead, undaunted and undivided by the 
injuries it had received. In the midst of trials it had inspired its 
loyal followers with a resolution that no obstacle, however formidable, 
could undermine. It had lighted in their hearts a faith that no 
misfortune, however black, could quench. It had infused into their 
hearts a hope that no force, however determined, could shatter.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 March 1936 to the Baha'is of the West, 
published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters" pp.

<p>	313. ...every apparent trial with which the unfathomable wisdom of 
the Almighty deems it necessary to afflict His chosen community serves 
only to demonstrate afresh its essential solidarity and to consolidate 
its inward strength...<br>
 For such demonstrations of the interpositions of an ever- watchful 
Providence they who stand identified with the Community of the Most 
Great Name must feel eternally grateful. From every fresh token of His 
unfailing blessing on the one hand, and of His visitation on the other, 
they cannot but derive immense hope and courage....</p>
<p>	Though small in numbers, and circumscribed as yet in your 
experiences, powers, and resources, yet the Force which energizes your 
mission is limitless in its range and incalculable in its potency. 
Though the enemies which every acceleration in the progress of your 
mission must raise up be fierce, numerous, and unrelenting, yet the 
invisible Hosts which, if you persevere, must, as promised, rush forth 
to your aid, will, in the end, enable you to vanquish their hopes and 
annihilate their forces. Though the ultimate blessings that must crown 
the consummation of your mission be undoubted, and the Divine promises 
given you firm and irrevocable, yet the measure of the goodly reward 
which every one of you is to reap must depend on the extent to which 
your daily exertions will have contributed to the expansion of that 
mission and the hastening of its triumph.</p>

States and Canada, published in "The Advent of Divine Justice" p. 2; p.

<p>	314. Dear friends! Manifold, various, and at times extremely 
perilous, have been the tragic crises which the blind hatred, the 
unbounded presumption, the incredible folly, the abject perfidy, the 
vaulting ambition of the enemy have intermittently engendered within the
 pale of the Faith. From some of its most powerful and renowned 
votaries, at the hands of its once trusted and ablest propagators, 
champions, and administrators, from the ranks of its most revered and 
highly-placed trustees whether as companions, amanuenses, or appointed 
lieutenants of the Herald of the Faith, of its Author, and of the Centre
 of His Covenant, from even those who were numbered among the kindred of
 the Manifestation, not excluding the brother, the sons and daughters of
 Baha'u'llah, and the nominee of the Bab Himself, a Faith, of such 
tender age, and enshrining so priceless a promise, has sustained blows 
as dire and treacherous as any recorded in the world's religious 
history.<br>

</p><p>	From the record of its tumultuous history, almost every page of 
which portrays a fresh crisis, is laden with the description of a new 
calamity, recounts the tale of a base betrayal, and is stained with the 
account of unspeakable atrocities, there emerges, clear and 
incontrovertible, the supreme truth that with every fresh outbreak of 
hostility to the Faith, whether from within or from without, a 
corresponding measure of outpouring grace, sustaining its defenders and 
confounding its adversaries, has been providentially released, 
communicating a fresh impulse to the onward march of the Faith, while 
this impetus, in its turn, would, through its manifestations, provoke 
fresh hostility in quarters heretofore unaware of its challenging 
implications -- this increased hostility being accompanied by a still 
more arresting revelation of Divine Power and a more abundant effusion 
of celestial grace, which, by enabling the upholders of that Faith to 
register still more brilliant victories, would thereby generate issues 
of still more vital import and raise up still more formidable enemies 
against a Cause that cannot but in the end resolve those issues and 
crush the resistance of those enemies, through a still more glorious 
unfoldment of its inherent power.</p>
<p>	The resistless march of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, viewed in this 
light, and propelled by the stimulating influences which the unwisdom of
 its enemies and the force latent within itself both engender, resolves 
itself into a series of rhythmic pulsations, precipitated, on the one 
hand, through the explosive outbursts of its foes, and the vibrations of
 Divine Power, on the other, which speed it, with ever-increasing 
momentum, along that predestined course traced for it by the Hand of the
 Almighty. As opposition to the Faith, from whatever source it may 
spring, whatever form it may assume, however violent its outbursts, is 
admittedly the motive-power that galvanizes, on the one hand, the souls 
of its valiant defenders, and taps for them, on the other, fresh springs
 of that Divine and inexhaustible Energy, we who are called upon to 
represent, defend, and promote its interests, should, far from regarding
 any manifestation of hostility as an evidence of the weakening of the 
pillars of the Faith, acclaim it as both a God-sent gift and a God-sent 
opportunity which, if we remain undaunted, we can utilize for the 
furtherance of His Faith and the routing and complete elimination of its
 adversaries.</p>
<p>	The Heroic Age of the Faith, born in anguish, nursed in adversity, 
and terminating in trials as woeful as those that greeted its birth, has
 been<br>
 succeeded by that Formative Period which is to witness the gradual 
crystallization of those creative energies which the Faith has released,
 and the consequent emergence of that World Order for which those forces
 were made to operate.</p>
<p>	Fierce and relentless will be the opposition which this 
crystallization and emergence must provoke. The alarm it must and will 
awaken, the envy it will certainly arouse, the misrepresentations to 
which it will remorselessly be subjected, the set-backs it must, sooner 
or later, sustain, the commotions to which it must eventually give rise,
 the fruits it must in the end garner, the blessings it must inevitably 
bestow and the glorious, the Golden Age it must irresistibly usher in, 
are just beginning to be faintly perceived, and will, as the old Order 
crumbles beneath the weight of so stupendous a Revelation, become 
increasingly apparent and arresting.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 August 1941 to the Baha'is of America, 
published in "Messages to America: Selected Letters and Cablegrams 
Addressed to the Baha'is of North America, 1932-1946, pp. 50-52)</p>
<p>	315. We can discover a no less distinct gradation in the character 
of the opposition it has had to encounter ... an opposition which, now, 
through the rise of a divinely appointed Order in the Christian West, 
and its initial impact on civil and ecclesiastical institutions, bids 
fair to include among its supporters established governments and systems
 associated with the most ancient, the most deeply entrenched sacerdotal
 hierarchies in Christendom. We can, at the same time, recognize, 
through the haze of an ever- widening hostility, the progress, painful 
yet persistent, of certain communities within its pale through the 
stages of obscurity, of proscription, of emancipation, and of 
recognition -- stages that must needs culminate in the course of 
succeeding centuries, in the establishment of the Faith, and the 
founding, in the plenitude of its power and authority, of the 
world-embracing Baha'i Commonwealth....</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	Despite the blows leveled at its nascent strength, whether by the 
wielders of temporal and spiritual authority from without, or by 
black-hearted foes from within, the Faith of Baha'u'llah had, far from 
breaking or bending, gone from strength to strength, from victory to 
victory. Indeed its history, if read aright, may be said to resolve 
itself into<br>
 a series of pulsations, of alternating crises and triumphs, leading it ever nearer to its divinely appointed destiny....</p>
<p>	The tribulations attending the progressive unfoldment of the Faith 
of Baha'u'llah have indeed been such as to exceed in gravity those from 
which the religions of the past have suffered. Unlike those religions, 
however, these tribulations have failed utterly to impair its unity, or 
to create, even temporarily, a breach in the ranks of its adherents. It 
has not only survived these ordeals, but has emerged, purified and 
inviolate, endowed with greater capacity to face and surmount any crisis
 which its resistless march may engender in the future.</p>
<p>	Whatever may befall this infant Faith of God in future decades or in
 succeeding centuries, whatever the sorrows, dangers and tribulations 
which the next stage in its world- wide development may engender, from 
whatever quarter the assaults to be launched by its present or future 
adversaries may be unleashed against it, however great the reverses and 
setbacks it may suffer, we, who have been privileged to apprehend, to 
the degree our finite minds can fathom, the significance of these 
marvelous phenomena associated with its rise and establishment, can 
harbor no doubt that what it has already achieved in the first hundred 
years of its life provides sufficient guarantee that it will continue to
 forge ahead, capturing loftier heights, tearing down every obstacle, 
opening up new horizons and winning still mightier victories until its 
glorious mission, stretching into the dim ranges of time that lie ahead,
 is totally fulfilled.</p>
<p>	("God Passes By", Foreward p. xvii; p. 409; p.410; p. 412)</p>
<p>	316. Such reflections, far from engendering in our minds and hearts 
the slightest trace of perplexity, of discouragement or doubt, should 
reinforce the basis of our convictions, demonstrate to us the 
incorruptibility, the strange workings and the invincibility of a Faith 
which, despite the assaults which malignant and redoubtable enemies from
 the ranks of kings, princes and ecclesiastics have repeatedly launched 
against it, and the violent internal tests that have shaken it for more 
than a century, and the relative obscurity of its champions, and the 
unpropitiousness of the times and the perversity of the generations 
contemporaneous with its rise and growth, has gone from strength to 
strength, has preserved its unity and integrity, has diffused its light 
over<br>
 five continents, reared the institutions of its Administrative Order 
and spread its ramifications to the four corners of the earth, and 
launched its systematic campaigns in both the Western and Eastern 
Hemispheres.</p>
<p>	For such benefits, for such an arresting and majestic vindication of
 the undefeatable powers inherent in our precious Faith, we can but bow 
our heads in humility, awe and thanksgiving, renew our pledge of fealty 
to it, and, each covenanting in his own heart, resolve to prove faithful
 to that pledge, and persevere to the very end, until our earthly share 
of servitude to so transcendent and priceless a Cause has been totally 
and completely fulfilled.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 15 June 1946 to the Baha'is of America, 
published "Messages to America: Selected Letters and Cablegrams 
Addressed to the Baha'is of North America, 1932-1946", p. 104)</p>
<p>	317. Indeed this fresh ordeal that has, in pursuance of the 
mysterious dispensations of Providence, afflicted the Faith, at this 
unexpected hour, far from dealing a fatal blow to its institutions or 
existence, should be regarded as a blessing in disguise, not a 
"calamity" but a "providence" of God, not a devastating flood but a 
"gentle rain" on a "green pasture," a "wick" and "oil" unto the "lamp" 
of His Faith, a "nurture" for His Cause, "water for that which has been 
planted in the hearts of men," a "crown set on the head" of His 
Messenger for this Day.[1]<br>
 [1 "The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah", Arabic no. 51, rev. ed. 
(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1985), p. 15 "Epistle to the Son of 
the Wolf, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988), p. 1]</p>
<p>	Whatever its outcome, this sudden commotion that has seized the 
Baha'i world, that has revived the hopes and emboldened the host of the 
adversaries of the Faith intent on quenching its light and obliterating 
it from the face of the earth, has served as a trumpet call in the 
sounding of which the press of the world, the cries of its vociferous 
enemies, the public remonstrances of both men of good will and those in 
authority have joined, proclaiming far and wide its existence, 
publicizing its history, defending its verities, unveiling its truths, 
demonstrating the character of its institutions and advertising its aims
 and purposes.<br>
 For though the newly launched World Spiritual Crusade -- constituting 
at best only the Minor Plan in the execution of the Almighty's design 
for the redemption of mankind -- has, as a result of this turmoil 
paralyzing temporarily the vast majority of the organized followers of 
Baha'u'llah within His birthplace, suffered a severe setback, yet the 
over-all Plan of God, moving mysteriously and in contrast to the orderly
 and well-known processes of a clearly devised Plan, has received an 
impetus the force of which only posterity can adequately assess.</p>
<p>	(In a letter dated 20 August 1954 to the Baha'is of the United 
States, published in "Citadel of Faith: Messages to America 1947-1957", 
pp. 139-40)</p>
<p>	318. However severe their trials, and disheartening the present 
situation may appear, they must remember that the Faith to which they 
owe allegiance has weathered, not so very long ago, storms of a far 
greater severity that seemed, at times, capable of engulfing and of 
obliterating its nascent institutions. The newly planted sapling of a 
divinely conceived administrative order, having driven deep its roots in
 German soil, bent momentarily under the hurricane which so violently 
swept over it, and no sooner had the tempest spent its force than it 
righted itself, and, growing with a fresh vigour, put forth branches and
 offshoots that now overshadow the entire land, and even stretch out as 
far as the heart of Austria.</p>
<p>	The experience of so miraculous a recovery from so devastating an 
ordeal should, alone, prove sufficient to infuse an invigorating spirit 
into those who have been subjected to it, as well as into the new 
generation who are still close enough to those events to appreciate its 
extreme violence, such as will not only enable them to withstand 
onslaughts of still greater severity, but impel them, both young and 
old, men and women alike, to struggle, with redoubled vigour and deeper 
consecration, to meet the pressing and the manifold requirements of the 
present hour.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 14
 August 1957 written on his behalf to a National Spiritual Assembly, in 
"The Light of Divine Guidance, vol. 1 (Hofheim-Langenhain: Baha'i-Verlag
 GmbH, 1982), pp. 303-304)<br>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF SHOGHI EFFENDI:</p>
<p>	319. There is always an important difference between friends and 
tested friends. No matter how precious the first type may be, the future
 of the Cause rests upon the latter. Up to the present the German 
friends were considered as loving Baha'is, from now on they can be 
ranked as tested ones.</p>
<p>	In every country where such difficulties arise, they generally end 
with added energy and more intensive service of the Cause....</p>
<p>	(4 April 1930 to an individual believer, published in "The Light of Divine Guidance", vol. 1, pp. 34-35)</p>
<p>	320. The friends . . . should not feel bewildered, for they have the
 assurance of Baha'u'llah that whatever the nature and character of the 
forces of opposition facing His Cause, its eventual triumph is 
indubitably certain.</p>
<p>	(30 August 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	321. Let them know, however, for a certainty that the onslaught of 
both the disbeliever and the oppressor will become a means of 
promulgating this Divine Cause, of proclaiming the Word of God and of 
consolidating the foundations of His holy Faith; and that its enemies 
will ultimately be completely overwhelmed, that the Cause of God will 
emerge victorious, and that His Word will reign supreme.</p>
<p>	(21 October 1946 to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	322. He very deeply appreciates your Assembly's assurance of its 
abiding loyalty to him and to the Master's Will and Testament. As you 
can well imagine this disaffection of the Master's Family has been a 
very sad and heavy blow to him; but, although for many years he shielded
 them with his silence, in the end he was forced to speak out in order 
to protect the Faith. For a hundred years our beloved Cause has suffered
 from these internal afflictions, and the way the believers, generation 
after generation, have met this test with steadfast faith, loyalty and 
devotion, is one of the signs that this is the Cause of God, divinely 
protected through the Covenants of Baha'u'llah and the Master.</p>
<p>	(30 June 1949 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and 
Austria, published in "The Light of Divine Guidance", vol. 1, p. 149)<br>

</p><p>	323. He urges you not to be discouraged or depressed, but rest 
assured that Baha'u'llah will assist you. Every set- back this Cause 
receives is invariably a means of ensuring a future victory, for God 
will never permit His Faith to be put out or uprooted.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 January 1950 to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Panama)</p>
<p>	324. Although this may temporarily prove an embarrassment to your 
work, and a set-back, there is no doubt that it signalizes a step 
forward in the advance of the Faith; for we know that our beloved Faith 
must eventually clash with the entrenched orthodoxies of the past; and 
that this conflict cannot but lead to greater victories, and to ultimate
 emancipation, recognition and ascendancy.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 April 1951 to two believers)</p>
<p>	325. The Faith is moving at a tremendous rate, and with tremendous 
force at the present time. Certainly if it is suppressed in one place, 
the power of the Cause is such that it must rise with greater strength 
in another place; and thus the persecutions of the Persian Baha'is have 
caused the Faith to surge ahead in Africa. This certainly must be a 
solace to the suffering of the Baha'is of Persia.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 September 1955 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN BY THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE:</p>
<p>	326. It should not be surmised that the events which have taken 
place in all corners of the globe, including the sacred land of Iran, 
have occurred as isolated incidents without any aim and purpose. 
According to the words of our beloved Guardian, "The invisible hand is 
at work and the convulsions taking place on earth are a prelude to the 
proclamation of the Cause of God". This is but one of the mysterious 
forces of this supreme Revelation which is causing the limbs of mankind 
to quake and those who are drunk with pride and negligence to be 
thunderstruck and shaken....</p>
<p>	In such an afflicted time, when mankind is bewildered and the wisest
 of men are perplexed as to the remedy, the people of Baha, who have 
confidence in His unfailing grace and divine guidance, are assured that 
each of these tormenting trials has a cause, a purpose, and a definite<br>
 result, and all are essential instruments for the establishment of the 
immutable Will of God on earth. In other words, on the one hand humanity
 is struck by the scourge of His chastisement which will inevitably 
bring together the scattered and vanquished tribes of the earth; and on 
the other, the weak few whom He has nurtured under the protection of His
 loving guidance are, in this Formative Age and period of transition, 
continuing to build amidst these tumultuous waves an impregnable 
stronghold which will be the sole remaining refuge for those lost 
multitudes. Therefore, the dear friends of God who have such a broad and
 clear vision before them are not perturbed by such events, nor are they
 panic-stricken by such thundering sounds, nor will they face such 
convulsions with fear and trepidation, nor will they be deterred, even 
for a moment, from fulfilling their sacred responsibilities.</p>
<p>	(10 February 1980 to the Iranian believers resident in other countries throughout the world)</p>
<p>	327. The inveterate enemies of the Faith imagine that their 
persecutions will disrupt the foundations of the Faith and tarnish its 
glory. Alas! Alas for their ignorance and folly! These acts of 
oppression, far from weakening the resolve of the friends, have always 
served to inflame their zeal and galvanize their beings. In the words of
 'Abdu'l-Baha, "...they thought that violence and interference would 
cause extinction and silence and lead to suppression and oblivion; 
whereas interference in matters of conscience causes stability and 
firmness and attracts the attention of men's sight and souls, which fact
 has received experimental proof many times and often."</p>
<p>	Every drop of blood shed by the valiant martyrs, every sigh heaved 
by the silent victims of oppression, every supplication for divine 
assistance offered by the faithful, has released, and will continue 
mysteriously to release, forces over which no antagonist of the Faith 
has any control, and which, as marshalled by an All-Watchful Providence,
 have served to noise abroad the name and fame of the Faith to the 
masses of humanity in all continents, millions of whom had previously 
been totally ignorant of the existence of the Faith or had but a 
superficial, and oft- times erroneous, understanding of its teachings 
and history.</p>
<p>	The current persecution has resulted in bringing the name and 
character of our beloved Faith to the attention of the world as never<br>
 before in its history. As a direct result of the protests sent by the 
world-wide community of the Most Great Name to the rulers in Iran, of 
the representations made to the media when those protests were ignored, 
of direct approach by Baha'i institutions at national and international 
level to governments, communities of nations, international agencies and
 the United Nations itself, the Faith of Baha'u'llah has not only been 
given sympathetic attention in the world's councils, but also its merits
 and violated rights have been discussed and resolutions of protest sent
 to the Iranian authorities by sovereign governments, singly and in 
unison. The world's leading newspapers, followed by the local press, 
have presented sympathetic accounts of the Faith to millions of readers,
 while television and radio stations are increasingly making the 
persecutions in Iran the subject of their programmes. Commercial 
publishing houses are beginning to commission books about the Faith.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	Indeed, this new wave of persecution sweeping the Cradle of the 
Faith may well be seen as a blessing in disguise, a "providence" whose 
"calamity" is, as always, borne heroically by the beloved Persian 
community. It may be regarded as the latest move in God's Major Plan, 
another trumpet blast to awaken the heedless from their slumber and a 
golden opportunity offered to the Baha'is to demonstrate once again 
their unity and fellowship before the eyes of a declining and skeptical 
world, to proclaim with full force the Message of Baha'u'llah to high 
and low alike, to establish the reverence of our Faith for Islam and its
 Prophet, to assert the principles of non-interference in political 
activities and obedience to government which stand at the very core of 
our Faith, and to provide comfort and solace to the breasts of the 
serene sufferers and steadfast heroes in the forefront of a persecuted 
community....</p>
<p>	(26 January 1982 to the Baha'is of the World)</p>
<p>	328. Shoghi Effendi perceived in the organic life of the Cause a 
dialectic of victory and crisis. The unprecedented triumphs, generated 
by the adamantine steadfastness of the Iranian friends, will inevitably 
provoke opposition to test and increase our strength. Let every Baha'i 
in the world be assured that whatever may befall this growing Faith of 
God is but incontrovertible evidence of the loving care with which the 
King of Glory and His martyred Herald, through the incomparable Centre 
of His<br>
 Covenant and our beloved Guardian, are preparing His humble followers for ultimate and magnificent triumph....</p>
<p>	(2 January 1986 to the Baha'is of the World)</p>
<p>	329. The opening of that Plan coincided with the recrudescence of 
savage persecution of the Baha'i community in Iran, a deliberate effort 
to eliminate the Cause of God from the land of its birth. The heroic 
steadfastness of the Persian friends has been the mainspring of 
tremendous international attention focussed on the Cause, eventually 
bringing it to the agenda of the General Assembly of the United Nations,
 and, together with world-wide publicity in all the media, accomplishing
 its emergence from the obscurity which characterized and sheltered the 
first period of its life. This dramatic process impelled the Universal 
House of Justice to address a Statement on Peace to the Peoples of the 
World and arrange for its delivery to Heads of State and the generality 
of the rulers.</p>

<p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH:</p>
<p>	330. ..."Say: O people of God! Beware lest the powers of the earth 
alarm you, or the might of the nations weaken you, or the tumult of the 
people of discord deter you, or the exponents of earthly glory sadden 
you. Be ye as a mountain in the Cause of your Lord, the Almighty, the 
All-Glorious, the Unconstrained." "Say: Beware, O people of Baha, lest 
the strong ones of the earth rob you of your strength, or they who rule 
the world fill you with fear. Put your trust in God, and commit your 
affairs to His keeping. He, verily, will, through the power of truth, 
render you victorious, and He, verily, is powerful to do what He 
willeth, and in His grasp are the reins of omnipotent might."</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi "The Advent of Divine Justice", p. 82)</p>
<p>	331. It is incumbent upon all men, each according to his ability, to
 refute the arguments of those that have attacked the Faith of God. Thus
 hath it been decreed by Him Who is the All-Powerful, the Almighty. He 
that<br>
 wisheth to promote the Cause of the one true God, let him promote it 
through his pen and tongue, rather than have recourse to sword or 
violence.... If any man were to arise to defend, in his writings, the 
Cause of God against its assailants, such a man, however inconsiderable 
his share, shall be so honored in the world to come that the Concourse 
on high would envy his glory. No pen can depict the loftiness of his 
station, neither can any tongue describe its splendor. For whosoever 
standeth firm and steadfast in this holy, this glorious, and exalted 
Revelation, such power shall be given him as to enable him to face and 
withstand all that is in heaven and on earth. Of this God is Himself a 
witness.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah" sec. 154, pp.329-30)</p>
<p>	332. We exhort the men of the House of Justice and command them to 
ensure the protection and safeguarding of men, women and children. It is
 incumbent upon them to have the utmost regard for the interests of the 
people at all times and under all conditions. Blessed is the ruler who 
succoureth the captive, and the rich one who careth for the poor, and 
the just one who secureth from the wrong doer the rights of the 
downtrodden, and happy the trustee who observeth that which the 
Ordainer, the Ancient of Days hath prescribed unto him.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas" pp. 69-70)</p>
<p>	333. And likewise, He saith: "Say to them that are of a fearful 
heart: be strong, fear not, behold your God."[1] This blessed verse is a
 proof of the greatness of the Revelation, and of the greatness of the 
Cause, inasmuch as the blast of the trumpet must needs spread confusion 
throughout the world, and fear and trembling amongst all men. Well is it
 with him who hath been illumined with the light of trust and 
detachment. The tribulations of that Day will not hinder or alarm him. 
Thus hath the Tongue of Utterance spoken, as bidden by Him Who is the 
All-Merciful. He, verily, is the Strong, the All-Powerful, the 
All-Subduing, the Almighty....<br>
 [1 Isaiah 35:4]</p>
<p>	("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf", p. 147)<br>

</p><p>	334. You should exhort all the friends to patience, to 
acquiescence, and to tranquillity, saying: O ye loved ones of God in 
that land! Ye are glorified in all the worlds of God because of your 
relationship to Him Who is the Eternal Truth, but in your lives on this 
earthly plane, which pass away as a fleeting moment, ye are afflicted 
with abasement. For the sake of the one true God, ye have been reviled 
and persecuted, ye have been imprisoned, and surrendered your lives in 
His path. Ye should not, however, by reason of the tyrannical acts of 
some heedless souls, transgress the limits of God's commandments by 
contending with anyone.</p>
<p>	Whatever hath befallen you, hath been for the sake of God. This is 
the truth, and in this there is no doubt. You should, therefore, leave 
all your affairs in His Hands, place your trust in Him, and rely upon 
Him. He will assuredly not forsake you. In this, likewise, there is no 
doubt. No father will surrender his sons to devouring beasts; no 
shepherd will leave his flock to ravening wolves. He will most certainly
 do his utmost to protect his own.</p>
<p>	If, however, for a few days, in compliance with God's all- 
encompassing wisdom, outward affairs should run their course contrary to
 one's cherished desire, this is of no consequence and should not 
matter. Our intent is that all the friends should fix their gaze on the 
Supreme Horizon, and cling to that which hath been revealed in the 
Tablets. They should strictly avoid sedition, and refrain from treading 
the path of dissension and strife. They should champion their one true 
God, exalted be He, through the hosts of forbearance, of submission, of 
an upright character, of goodly deeds, and of the choicest and most 
refined words.</p>

<p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE Writings OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA:</p>
<p>	335. O army of God! When calamity striketh, be ye patient and 
composed. However afflictive your sufferings may be, stay ye 
undisturbed, and with perfect confidence in the abounding grace of God, 
brave ye the tempest of tribulations and fiery ordeals.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha, p. 74)<br>

</p><p>	336. Wherefore must the loved ones of God, laboriously, with the
 waters of their striving, tend and nourish and foster this tree of 
hope. In whatsoever land they dwell, let them with a whole heart 
befriend and be companions to those who are either close to them, or far
 removed. Let them, with qualities like unto those of heaven, promote 
the institutions and the religion of God. Let them never lose heart, 
never be despondent, never feel afflicted. The more antagonism they 
meet, the more let them show their own good faith; the more torments and
 calamities they have to face, the more generously let them pass round 
the bounteous cup. Such is the spirit which will become the life of the 
world, such is the spreading light at its heart: and he who may be and 
do other than this is not worthy to serve at the Holy Threshold of the 
Lord.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 258)</p>
<p>	337. O ye beloved of the Lord! The greatest of all things is the 
protection of the True Faith of God, the preservation of His Law, the 
safeguarding of His Cause and service unto His Word....</p>
<p>	My supreme obligation, however, of necessity, prompteth me to guard 
and preserve the Cause of God. Thus, with the greatest regret, I counsel
 you saying: Guard ye the Cause of God, protect His law and have the 
utmost fear of discord. This is the foundation of the belief of the 
people of Baha (may my life be offered up for them)...</p>

France, Switzerland, Italy, Japan and Australasia, published in "Baha'i 
Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 38)</p>
<p>	339. As the Movement grows in prestige, fame and influence, as the 
ambitions, malice and ill-will of strangers and enemies correspondingly 
wax greater, it becomes increasingly important for every individual and<br>
 Spiritual Assembly to be on their guard lest they fall innocent victims
 of the evil designs of the malevolent, the self-seeking and greedy.</p>
<p>	Touching the publication of articles and pamphlets bearing on the 
controversial and political issues of the day, I desire to remind my 
dearly-beloved fellow-workers that at the present stage when the Cause 
is still in its infancy, any minute and detailed analysis by the friends
 of subjects that are in the forefront of general discussion would often
 be misconstrued in certain quarters and give rise to suspicions and 
misunderstandings that would react unfavorably on the Cause. They would 
tend to create a misconception of the real object, the true mission, and
 the fundamental character of the Baha'i Faith. We should, while 
endeavoring to uphold loyally and expound conscientiously our social and
 moral principles in all their essence and purity, in all their bearings
 upon the divers phases of human society, insure that no direct 
reference or particular criticism in our exposition of the fundamentals 
of the Faith would tend to antagonize any existing institution, or help 
to identify a purely spiritual movement with the base clamorings and 
contentions of warring sects, factions and nations. We should strive in 
all our utterances to combine the discretion and noble reticence of the 
wise with the frankness and passionate loyalty of the ardent advocate of
 an inspiring Faith. While refusing to utter the word that would 
needlessly alienate or estrange any individual, government or people, we
 should fearlessly and unhesitatingly uphold and assert in their 
entirety such truths the knowledge of which we believe is vitally and 
urgently needed for the good and betterment of mankind.</p>
<p>	(10 January 1926 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932", p. 102)</p>
<p>	340. We can prove ourselves worthy of our Cause only if in our 
individual conduct and corporate life we sedulously imitate the example 
of our beloved Master, Whom the terrors of tyranny, the storms of 
incessant abuse, the oppressiveness of humiliation, never caused to 
deviate a hair's breadth from the revealed Law of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(12 April 1927 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932", p. 132)<br>

</p><p>	341. Be moreover assured beyond all shadow of doubt that no 
matter how strenuously the enemies of God's Faith may exert themselves 
to extinguish its fire, they will but cause its flame to burn the more 
fiercely, its light to shine the more brightly, and its heat to grow the
 more intense. People of wisdom and discernment, who are closely but 
unobtrusively surveying the progress of the Faith, and are resolved to 
subject it to the most careful examination and research, will be neither
 shaken nor swayed by these absurd and baseless claims, these scurrilous
 publications and self- contradictory pronouncements. So far from being 
blinded by such propaganda to the verities of the Cause, they will 
rather be moved by it to pursue their investigations and inquiries with 
greater meticulousness and enthusiasm than before; to make themselves 
thoroughly familiar with the teachings, principles and aspirations of 
the followers of Baha'u'llah; and even, through the grace and guidance 
of an Almighty and Omniscient Lord, to arise in time of need for the 
defence and protection of the Cause; to put to rout the hosts of 
suspicion, doubt and misconception; to raze to its foundations the 
edifice of calumny and falsehood; and to demonstrate and establish, 
before the eyes of all the world, the sacred, exalted and indomitable 
reality of the resistless Faith of God. These various distressful 
occurrences, contrived and instigated by the enemies and ill-wishers of 
the Cause -- their insidious rumours, their defamatory reports, their 
flagrant and unprincipled attacks- -should be viewed as dispositions and
 instrumentalities of Providence, designed to hasten the advent of that 
promised day, that mighty and compelling victory, and that perspicuous 
triumph, which have been so clearly foretold in the scriptures, and so 
explicitly and emphatically set forth by the Pen of the Most High.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated August 1927 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	342. The permanence and stability achieved by any association, group
 or nation is a result of -- and dependent upon -- the soundness and 
worth of the principles upon which it bases the running of its affairs 
and the direction of its activities. The guiding principles of the 
Baha'is are: honesty, love, charity and trustworthiness; the setting of 
the common good above private interest; and the practice of godliness, 
virtue and moderation. Ultimately, then, their preservation and 
happiness are<br>
 assured. Whatever misfortunes they may encounter, wrought by the wiles 
of the schemer and ill-wisher, shall all pass away like waves, and 
hardship shall be succeeded by joy. The friends are under the protection
 of the resistless power and inscrutable providence of God. There is no 
doubt that every blessed soul who brings his life into harmony with this
 all- swaying power shall give lustre to his works and win an ample 
recompense. The actions of those who choose to set themselves against it
 should provoke not antipathy on our part, but prayers for their 
guidance. Such was the way of the Baha'is in days gone by, and so must 
it be, now and for always.</p>
<p>	(18 December 1928 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	343. Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether by word 
or by deed, with the political pursuits of their respective nations, 
with the policies of their governments and the schemes and programs of 
parties and factions. In such controversies they should assign no blame,
 take no side, further no design, and identify themselves with no system
 prejudicial to the best interests of that world-wide Fellowship which 
it is their aim to guard and foster. Let them beware lest they allow 
themselves to become the tools of unscrupulous politicians, or to be 
entrapped by the treacherous devices of the plotters and the perfidious 
among their countrymen. Let them so shape their lives and regulate their
 conduct that no charge of secrecy, of fraud, of bribery or of 
intimidation may, however ill-founded, be brought against them. Let them
 rise above all particularism and partisanship, above the vain disputes,
 the petty calculations, the transient passions that agitate the face, 
and engage the attention, of a changing world. It is their duty to 
strive to distinguish, as clearly as they possibly can, and if needed 
with the aid of their elected representatives, such posts and functions 
as are either diplomatic or political from those that are purely 
administrative in character, and which under no circumstances are 
affected by the changes and chances that political activities and party 
government, in every land, must necessarily involve. Let them affirm 
their unyielding determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly, for 
the way of Baha'u'llah, to avoid the entanglements and bickerings 
inseparable from the pursuits of the politician, and to<br>
 become worthy agencies of that Divine Polity which incarnates God's immutable Purpose for all men.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	As the number of the Baha'i communities in various parts of the 
world multiplies and their power, as a social force, becomes 
increasingly apparent, they will no doubt find themselves increasingly 
subjected to the pressure which men of authority and influence, in the 
political domain, will exercise in the hope of obtaining the support 
they require for the advancement of their aims. These communities will, 
moreover, feel a growing need of the good-will and the assistance of 
their respective governments in their efforts to widen the scope, and to
 consolidate the foundations, of the institutions committed to their 
charge. Let them beware lest, in their eagerness to further the aims of 
their beloved Cause, they should be led unwittingly to bargain with 
their Faith, to compromise with their essential principles, or to 
sacrifice, in return for any material advantage which their institutions
 may derive, the integrity of their spiritual ideals. Let them proclaim 
that in whatever country they reside, and however advanced their 
institutions, or profound their desire to enforce the laws, and apply 
the principles, enunciated by Baha'u'llah, they will, unhesitatingly, 
subordinate the operation of such laws and the application of such 
principles to the requirements and legal enactments of their respective 
governments. Theirs is not the purpose, while endeavoring to conduct and
 perfect the administrative affairs of their Faith, to violate, under 
any circumstances, the provisions of their country's constitution, much 
less to allow the machinery of their administration to supersede the 
government of their respective countries.</p>
<p>	It should also be borne in mind that the very extension of the 
activities in which we are engaged, and the variety of the communities 
which labor under divers forms of government, so essentially different 
in their standards, policies, and methods, make it absolutely essential 
for all those who are the declared members of any one of these 
communities to avoid any action that might, by arousing the suspicion or
 exciting the antagonism of any one government, involve their brethren 
in fresh persecutions or complicate the nature of their task. How else, 
might I ask, could such a far-flung Faith, which transcends political 
and social boundaries, which includes within its pale so great a variety
 of races and nations, which will have to rely increasingly, as it 
forges ahead, on the<br>
 good-will and support of the diversified and contending governments of 
the earth -- how else could such a Faith succeed in preserving its 
unity, in safeguarding its interests, and in ensuring the steady and 
peaceful development of its institutions?</p>
<p>	Such an attitude, however, is not dictated by considerations of 
selfish expediency, but is actuated, first and foremost, by the broad 
principle that the followers of Baha'u'llah will, under no 
circumstances, suffer themselves to be involved, whether as individuals 
or in their collective capacities, in matters that would entail the 
slightest departure from the fundamental verities and ideals of their 
Faith. Neither the charges which the uninformed and the malicious may be
 led to bring against them, nor the allurements of honors and rewards, 
will ever induce them to surrender their trust or to deviate from their 
path. Let their words proclaim, and their conduct testify, that they who
 follow Baha'u'llah, in whatever land they reside, are actuated by no 
selfish ambition, that they neither thirst for power, nor mind any wave 
of unpopularity, of distrust or criticism, which a strict adherence to 
their standards might provoke.</p>
<p>	(21 March 1932 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: 
Selected Letters, pp. 6467)</p>
<p>	344. Such a rectitude of conduct must manifest itself, with 
ever-increasing potency, in every verdict which the elected 
representatives of the Baha'i community, in whatever capacity they may 
find themselves, may be called upon to pronounce. It must be constantly 
reflected in the business dealings of all its members, in their domestic
 lives, in all manner of employment, and in any service they may, in the
 future, render their government or people. It must be exemplified in 
the conduct of all Baha'i electors, when exercising their sacred rights 
and functions. It must characterize the attitude of every loyal believer
 towards nonacceptance of political posts, nonidentification with 
political parties, nonparticipation in political controversies, and 
nonmembership in political organizations and ecclesiastical 
institutions.... </p>
<p>	It must be demonstrated in the impartiality of every defender of the
 Faith against its enemies, in his fair-mindedness in recognizing any 
merits that enemy may possess, and in his honesty in discharging any 
obligations he may have towards him....<br>

</p><p>	...</p>
<p>	No greater demonstration can be given to the peoples of both 
continents of the youthful vitality and the vibrant power animating the 
life, and the institutions of the nascent Faith of Baha'u'llah than an 
intelligent, persistent, and effective participation of the Baha'i 
youth, of every race, nationality, and class, in both the teaching and 
administrative spheres of Baha'i activity. Through such a participation 
the critics and enemies of the Faith, watching with varying degrees of 
skepticism and resentment, the evolutionary processes of the Cause of 
God and its institutions, can best be convinced of the indubitable truth
 that such a Cause is intensely alive, is sound to its very core, and 
its destinies in safe keeping....</p>

published in "The Advent of Divine Justice, pp. 26-27;pp. 69-70)</p>
<p>	345. Obstacles, varied and numerous, will no doubt arise to impede 
the onward march of this community [Australia]. Reverses may temporarily
 dim the radiance of its mission. The forces of religious orthodoxy may 
well, at a future date, be leagued against it. The exponents of theories
 and doctrines fundamentally opposed to its religious tenets and social 
principles may challenge its infant strength with persistence and 
severity. The Administrative Order -- the Ark destined to preserve its 
integrity and carry it to safety- -must without delay, without 
exception, claim the attention of the members of this community, its 
ideals must be continually cherished in their hearts, its purposes 
studied and kept constantly before their eyes, its requirements 
wholeheartedly met, its laws scrupulously upheld, its institutions 
unstintingly supported, its glorious mission noised abroad, and its 
spirit made the sole motivating purpose of their lives.</p>

<p>	346. The strife and bloodshed, with their attendant misery, sorrow 
and confusion, that have afflicted the entire subcontinent of India, in 
recent months, have caused me the gravest concern. The disorders, 
following in<br>
 the wake of this great crisis in the life of its people, constitute a 
challenge, which the community of the steadfast followers of Baha'u'llah
 in that land must resolutely face, and demonstrate in meeting it the 
quality of their faith, the depth of their devotion, the strength of 
their unity, the solidity of their institutions and the heroic character
 of their resolve. They must neither feel alarmed, nor falter or 
hesitate in the execution of their Plan. Shielded by the institutions 
which their hands have reared, abiding securely in the strong-hold of 
their love for Baha'u'llah and their devotion to His Faith, pursuing 
with unrelaxing vigilance and singleness of purpose the course set by 
the Plan they themselves have inaugurated, heartened by the initial 
success already achieved since that Plan was set in motion, they, 
however much buffeted by present circumstances, and no matter how 
perilous the path they now tread, must press forward, unafraid of 
persecution, scorn or calumny, towards the shining goals they have set 
themselves to attain.</p>

<p>	EXTRACT'S FROM LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF SHOGHI EFFENDI:</p>
<p>	348. Undoubtedly, as the influence of God's Faith becomes more 
pervasive, the number of those who wish to obstruct its progress will 
also grow; new and increasingly formidable adversaries will come to the 
fore; and mischief-makers, appearing under various extraordinary guises,
 will seek surreptitiously to goad to action all those who harbour 
resentment or bear ill will towards this Cause, and will raise aloft the
 standards of sedition. Under these circumstances it is essential for 
the friends on the one hand to be alert and watchful, and on the other 
to arouse the vigilance and strengthen the allegiance of their fellow- 
believers, to guard the integrity of the Word of God, and to maintain 
harmony and unity amongst His loved ones. Herein lies the supreme duty 
of the friends of God, and the highest means by which they can render 
service to His Cause.</p>
<p>	(24 May 1927 to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	349. In the face of such distressing conditions you should realize, 
more keenly than ever, your supreme obligation of protecting the body of
 the Cause from any further injuries and attacks, and of adhering 
scrupulously and intelligently to the spirit and the principles of the 
Administration....</p>
<p>	(12 July 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	350. The matter of refuting attacks and criticisms directed against 
the Cause through the press is, he feels, one which devolves on the 
National Spiritual Assembly to consider. This body, whether directly or 
through the agency of its committees, should decide as to the 
advisability of answering any such attacks, and also should carefully 
examine and pass upon any statements which the friends wish to send to 
the press to this effect. Only through such supervision and control of 
all Baha'i press activities can the friends hope to avoid confusion and 
misunderstanding<br>
 in their own minds and in the mind of the general public whom they can reach through the press.</p>
<p>	(28 September 1928 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	351. It is incumbent upon the friends to confront these difficulties
 with constancy and firmness, thankfulness and patience, unity and 
solidarity; to endure with fortitude these consecutive disasters; to 
traverse successfully these last remaining stages in their destined 
course; and to become neither restive nor disheartened on account of the
 hardships and exertions, the injustice and oppression that they are 
constrained to undergo. Let them at all times keep in mind the following
 clear and solemn warning recorded by the pen of the Centre of the 
Covenant and, with a tranquil heart, a radiant spirit, a steadfast 
purpose and a high resolve, watchfully anticipate the unfoldment and 
fulfilment of the Master's utterance:</p>
<p>    Beware the weeping of the wronged and orphaned children<br>
    and the sighing of the victims of oppression, lest their<br>
    tears should turn to floods and their breaths should turn<br>
    to fire.</p>
<p>	The violent disturbances, the afflictive trials and overwhelming 
dangers which now beset the froward band of ill-wishers, mischief- 
makers and oppressors from every stratum of society, whether in your own
 or neighbouring countries, and which have assailed their peoples, kings
 and subjects, governments and citizens alike on every hand, are the 
results of those grievous trespasses and violations wrought in that land
 by the hand of the tyrant and the aggressor. Now, after the passage of a
 century, the baleful outcome of those deeds has become apparent and 
their evil consequences revealed for all to see. The day is fast 
approaching when the hosts of hatred and iniquity will be called to 
answer for their deeds: erelong shall they be seized by the agents of 
the retributive anger of an All- Powerful and All-Compelling God.</p>
<p>	In counselling the friends, and conveying condolences to the victims
 of this latest outrage, your Assembly should urge them to cleave now as
 never before to the firm cord of God's holy ordinances and teachings, 
never to deviate by so much as a hair's breadth from the Straight Path; 
and to bide the advent of that day when it shall please Him to 
accomplish<br>
 His foreordained decree. He, verily, is the Protector of the wronged 
ones, and He, verily, is the Succourer of all those who stand fast and 
firm.</p>
<p>	(2 July 1942 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Persian - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	352. The Cause of God must be protected from the enemies of the 
Faith, and from those who sow seeds of doubt in the hearts of the 
believers, and the greatest of all protections is knowledge...</p>
<p>	(11 May 1948 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and 
Austria, published in "The Light of Divine Guidance, vol. 1, p. 134)</p>
<p>	353. ...the believers need to be deepened in their knowledge and 
appreciation of the Covenants of both Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. This
 is the stronghold of the Faith of every Baha'i, and that which enables 
him to withstand every test and the attacks of the enemies outside the 
Faith, and the far more dangerous, insidious, lukewarm people inside the
 Faith who have no real attachment to the Covenant, and consequently 
uphold the intellectual aspect of the teachings while at the same time 
undermining the spiritual foundation upon which the whole Cause of God 
rests.</p>
<p>	(15 April 1949 to an individual believer, published in "The Light of Divine Guidance", vol. 2, p. 84)</p>
<p>	354. Attacks by missionaries, and others, such as that by Elder, 
should most certainly be vigorously defended publicly by your Assembly 
and Local Assemblies as well.</p>
<p>	(18 August 1949 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	EXTRACT FROM LETTER WRITTEN BY THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE:</p>
<p>	355. The need to protect the Faith from the attacks of its enemies 
is not generally appreciated by the friends because such attacks, 
particularly in the West, have so far been intermittent. However, we 
know that these attacks will increase and will become concerted and 
universal. The writings of our Faith clearly foreshadow not only an 
intensification of the machinations of internal enemies, but a rise in 
the hostility and opposition of its external enemies, whether religious 
or secular, as our<br>
 beloved Faith pursues its onward march towards ultimate victory. 
Therefore, in the light of the warnings of Shoghi Effendi, the Auxiliary
 Boards for Protection should keep "constantly" a "watchful eye" on 
those "who are known to be enemies or to have been put out of the 
Faith", discreetly "investigate" their activities, warn intelligently 
the friends of the opposition inevitably to come, explain how each 
crisis in God's Faith has always proved to be a blessing in disguise, 
prepare them for the "dire contests" which are "destined to range the 
Army of Light against the forces of darkness", and, when the influence 
of the enemies spreads and reaches their fold, the members of these 
Auxiliary Boards should be alert to their schemes to "dampen the zeal 
and sap the loyalty" of the believers and, by adopting "wise and 
effective measures",[1] counteract these schemes and arrest the spread 
of their influence. Above all, the members of the Protection Boards 
should concentrate on deepening the friends' knowledge of the Covenant 
and increasing their love and loyalty to it, on clearly and frankly 
answering, in conformity with the teachings, whatever questions may 
trouble any of the believers, on fostering the spiritual profundity and 
strength of their faith and certitude, and on promoting whatever will 
increase the spirit of loving unity in Baha'i communities.<br>
 [1 "Messages to the Baha'i World, 1950-1957", p. 123]</p>
<p>	The primary tasks of the Propagation Boards, however, are to direct 
the believers' attention to the goals of whatever plans have been placed
 before them, to stimulate and assist them to promote the teaching work 
in the fields of proclamation, expansion, consolidation and pioneering, 
to encourage contributions to the funds, and to act as standard-bearers 
of the teachers of the Faith, leading them to new achievements in the 
diffusion of God's Message to their fellow human beings....</p>
<p>	It should, furthermore, be remembered that these self-same functions
 are being carried out by the Assemblies, national and local, and their 
committees, which have at this time the great responsibility for 
actually executing the teaching plans and for administering, 
consolidating and protecting the Baha'i communities. The Auxiliary Board
 members should thus watch carefully that their work reinforces and 
complements that of the administrative institutions.</p>
<p>	(10 October 1976 to the International Teaching Centre)<br>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE:</p>
<p>	356. One of the vital functions of the Protection Boards is the 
deepening of the friends' knowledge of the Covenant and increasing their
 love and loyalty to it, and fostering the spirit of love and unity 
within the Baha'i community.</p>
<p>	It is the duty of Local and National Spiritual Assemblies to refer 
to the Auxiliary Board members for protection matters which may involve 
not only possible Covenant-breaking, but also problems of disunity 
within the community, the removal of voting rights or any other matters 
in which you feel the guidance and advice of the Protection Boards may 
be helpful to the institutions of the Faith. The Auxiliary Board members
 of course keep the Continental Board of Counsellors informed and the 
Counsellors then take whatever steps they feel are called for.</p>
<p>	You are free at any time to refer to the Continental Board of 
Counsellors and the Auxiliary Board members for protection any matters 
about which you are not clear involving the security of the Faith in 
your area and you will always find them willing to assist you in dealing
 with such problems.</p>
<p>	(1 October 1979 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Venezuela)</p>
<p>	357. Hostility to the Faith is something all Baha'is can expect; how
 we react to it is of great importance. You are urged to avoid 
confrontation and dissension; these would tend to increase the 
antagonism. Maintain a dignified and friendly attitude and, in order to 
put forward well-founded reasoning where indicated, make a point of 
becoming better informed about issues affecting Christianity and the 
Baha'i Faith.</p>
<p>	(12 September 1985 to the National Spiritual Assembly of St. Vincent)</p>
<p>	358. ...as the Faith becomes known, we can expect opposition and 
persecution. Nevertheless, in our presentations and relationships we 
should always try to build bridges so that our beautiful Teachings can 
be understood and accepted, and the power which they have to establish 
unity amongst men will be exemplified.</p>
<p>	(18 December 1985 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Tuvalu)</p>
<p>	Revised July 1990<br>

</p><p>	THE IMPORTANCE OF DEEPENING OUR KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE FAITH</p>
<p>	359. Recite ye the verses of God every morning and evening. Whoso 
reciteth them not hath truly failed to fulfil his pledge to the Covenant
 of God and His Testament, and whoso in this day turneth away therefrom 
hath indeed turned away from God since time immemorial. Fear ye God, O 
concourse of My servants!</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Aqdas" - provisional translation from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	360. Were any man to taste the sweetness of the words which the lips
 of the All-Merciful have willed to utter, he would, though the 
treasures of the earth be in his possession, renounce them one and all, 
that he might vindicate the truth of even one of His commandments, 
shining above the Dayspring of His bountiful care and loving-kindness.</p>
<p>	("A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy 
Book of Baha'u'llah" (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1973), p. 12)</p>
<p>	361. Whoso hath inhaled the sweet fragrance of the All- Merciful, 
and recognized the Source of this utterance, will welcome with his own 
eyes the shafts of the enemy, that he may establish the truth of the 
laws of God amongst men. Well is it with him that hath turned thereunto,
 and apprehended the meaning of His decisive decree.</p>
<p>	("A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy Book of Baha'u'llah", p. 12-13)</p>
<p>	362. Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words, that ye may 
unravel its secrets, and discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid 
in its depths. Take heed that ye do not vacillate in your determination 
to embrace the truth of this Cause -- a Cause through which the 
potentialities of the might of God have been revealed, and His 
sovereignty established. With faces beaming with joy, hasten ye unto 
Him. This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal 
in the future. Let him that seeketh,<br>
 attain it; and as to him that hath refused to seek it -- verily, God is Self-Sufficient, above any need of His creatures.</p>
<p>	("A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy Book of Baha'u'llah, p. 27-28)</p>
<p>	363. Peruse ye every day the verses revealed by God. Blessed is the 
man who reciteth them and reflecteth upon them. He truly is of them with
 whom it shall be well.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	364. Gather ye together with the utmost joy and fellowship and 
recite the verses revealed by the merciful Lord. By so doing the doors 
to true knowledge will be opened to your inner beings, and ye will then 
feel your souls endowed with steadfastness and your hearts filled with 
radiant joy.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	365. Peruse My verses with joy and radiance. Verily they will 
attract you unto God and will enable you to detach yourselves from aught
 else save Him. Thus have ye been admonished in God's Holy Writ and in 
this resplendent Tablet.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	366. Whoso hath searched the depths of the oceans that lie hid 
within these exalted words, and fathomed their import, can be said to 
have discovered a glimmer of the unspeakable glory with which this 
mighty, this sublime, and most holy Revelation hath been endowed....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), p. 10)</p>
<p>	367. Know thou that, according to what thy Lord, the Lord of all 
men, hath decreed in His Book, the favors vouchsafed by Him unto mankind
 have been, and will ever remain, limitless in their range. First and 
foremost among these favors, which the Almighty hath confessed upon man,
 is the gift of understanding. His purpose in conferring such a gift is 
none other except to enable His creature to know and recognize the one 
true God -- exalted be His glory. This gift giveth man the power to<br>
 discern the truth in all things, leadeth him to that which is right, and helpeth him to discover the secrets of creation....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", p. 194)</p>
<p>	368. It is incumbent upon every man of insight and understanding to 
strive to translate that which hath been written into reality and 
action....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", p. 250)</p>
<p>	369. From the exalted source, and out of the essence of His favor 
and bounty He hath entrusted every created thing with a sign of His 
knowledge, so that none of His creatures may be deprived of its share in
 expressing, each according to its capacity and rank, this knowledge. 
This sign is the mirror of His beauty in the world of creation. The 
greater the effort exerted for the refinement of this sublime and noble 
mirror, the more faithfully will it be made to reflect the glory of the 
names and attributes of God, and reveal the wonders of His signs and 
knowledge....</p>
<p>	There can be no doubt whatever that, in consequence of the efforts 
which every man may consciously exert and as a result of the exertion of
 his own spiritual faculties, this mirror can be so cleansed from the 
dross of earthly defilements and purged from satanic fancies as to be 
able to draw nigh unto the meads of eternal holiness and attain the 
courts of everlasting fellowship....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", p. 262)</p>
<p>	370. Intone, O My servant, the verses of God that have been received
 by thee, as intoned by them who have drawn nigh unto Him, that the 
sweetness of thy melody may kindle thine own soul, and attract the 
hearts of all men. Whoso reciteth, in the privacy of his chamber, the 
verses revealed by God, the scattering angels of the Almighty shall 
scatter abroad the fragrance of the words uttered by his mouth, and 
shall cause the heart of every righteous man to throb. Though he may, at
 first, remain unaware of its effect, yet the virtue of the grace 
vouchsafed unto him must needs sooner or later exercise its influence 
upon his soul. Thus have the mysteries of the Revelation of God been 
decreed by virtue of the Will of Him Who is the Source of power and 
wisdom.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", p. 295)<br>

</p><p>	371. O My servant! My holy, My divinely ordained Revelation may 
be likened unto an ocean in whose depths are concealed innumerable 
pearls of great price, of surpassing luster. It is the duty of every 
seeker to bestir himself and strive to attain the shores of this ocean, 
so that he may, in proportion to the eagerness of his search and the 
efforts he hath exerted, partake of such benefits as have been pre- 
ordained in God's irrevocable and hidden Tablets....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah" p. 326)</p>
<p>	372. O My servants! Through the might of God and His power, and out 
of the treasury of His knowledge and wisdom, I have brought forth and 
revealed unto you the pearls that lay concealed in the depths of His 
everlasting ocean. I have summoned the Maids of Heaven to emerge from 
behind the veil of concealment, and have clothed them with these words 
of Mine -- words of consummate power and wisdom. I have, moreover, with 
the hand of divine power, unsealed the choice wine of My Revelation, and
 have wafted its holy, its hidden, and musk-laden fragrance upon all 
created things. Who else but yourselves is to be blamed if ye choose to 
remain unendowed with so great an outpouring of God's transcendent and 
all-encompassing grace, with so bright a revelation of His resplendent 
mercy?...</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah" pp. 327-28)</p>
<p>	373. Were any man to ponder in his heart that which the Pen of the 
Most High hath revealed and to taste of its sweetness, he would, of a 
certainty, find himself emptied and delivered from his own desires, and 
utterly subservient to the Will of the Almighty. Happy is the man that 
hath attained so high a station, and hath not deprived himself of so 
bountiful a grace.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah" p. 343)</p>
<p>	374. Now is the moment in which to cleanse thyself with the waters 
of detachment that have flowed out from the Supreme Pen, and to ponder, 
wholly for the sake of God, those things which, time and again, have 
been sent down or manifested, and then to strive, as much as lieth in 
thee, to quench, through the power of wisdom and the force of thy 
utterance, the fire of enmity and hatred which smouldereth in the hearts
 of the peoples<br>
 of the world. The Divine Messengers have been sent down, and their 
Books were revealed, for the purpose of promoting the knowledge of God, 
and of furthering unity and fellowship amongst men....</p>
<p>	("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988), p. 12)</p>
<p>	375. Know thou that he is truly learned who hath acknowledged My 
Revelation, and drunk from the Ocean of My knowledge, and soared in the 
atmosphere of My love, and cast away all else besides Me, and taken firm
 hold on that which hath been sent down from the Kingdom of My wondrous 
utterance. He, verily, is even as an eye unto mankind, and as the spirit
 of life unto the body of all creation. Glorified be the All-Merciful 
Who hath enlightened him, and caused him to arise and serve His great 
and mighty Cause. Verily, such a man is blessed by the Concourse on 
high, and by them who dwell within the Tabernacle of Grandeur, who have 
quaffed My sealed Wine in My Name, the Omnipotent, the All Powerful....</p>
<p>	("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf ' p. 83)</p>
<p>	376. Incline your ears to the words of this unlettered One, 
wherewith He summoneth you unto God, the Ever-Abiding. Better is this 
for you than all the treasures of the earth, could ye but comprehend 
it....</p>
<p>	("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf", p. 129)</p>
<p>	377. With fixed and steady gaze, born of the unerring eye of God, 
scan for a while the horizon of divine knowledge, and contemplate those 
words of perfection which the Eternal hath revealed, that haply the 
mysteries of divine wisdom, hidden ere now beneath the veil of glory and
 treasured within the tabernacle of His grace, may be made manifest unto
 you....</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Iqan", 2nd. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983) pp. 16-17)</p>
<p>	378. Inasmuch as it hath been clearly shown that only those who are 
initiated into the divine mysteries can comprehend the melodies uttered 
by the Bird of Heaven, it is therefore incumbent upon every one to seek 
enlightenment from the illumined in heart and from the Treasuries of 
divine mysteries regarding the intricacies of God's Faith and the 
abstruse allusions in the utterances of the Daysprings of Holiness. Thus
 will these mysteries be unravelled, not by the aid of acquired 
learning, but solely<br>
 through the assistance of God and the outpourings of His grace. "Ask 
ye, therefore, of them that have the custody of the Scriptures, if ye 
know it not."[1]<br>
 [1 Qur'an 16:43]</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Iqan", p. 191-92)</p>
<p>	379. The understanding of His words and the comprehension of the 
utterances of the Birds of Heaven are in no wise dependent upon human 
learning. They depend solely upon purity of heart, chastity of soul, and
 freedom of spirit....</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Iqan", p. 211)</p>
<p>	380. O brother, we should open our eyes, meditate upon His Word, and
 seek the sheltering shadow of the Manifestations of God, that perchance
 we may be warned by the unmistakable counsels of the Book, and give 
heed to the admonitions recorded in the holy Tablets; that we may not 
cavil at the Revealer of the verses, that we may resign ourselves wholly
 to His Cause, and embrace wholeheartedly His law, that haply we may 
enter the court of His mercy, and dwell upon the shore of His grace. He,
 verily, is merciful, and forgiving towards His servants.</p>
<p>	("Kitab i-Iqan", p. 217)</p>
<p>	381. The wine of renunciation must needs be quaffed, the lofty 
heights of detachment must needs be attained, and the meditation 
referred to in the words "One hour's reflection is preferable to seventy
 years of pious worship" must needs be observed, so that the secret of 
the wretched behaviour of the people might be discovered, those people 
who, despite the love and yearning for truth which they profess, curse 
the followers of Truth when once He hath been made manifest. To this 
truth the above-mentioned tradition beareth witness....</p>
<p>	("The Kitab-i-Iqan", p. 238)</p>
<p>	382. Meditate upon that which hath streamed forth from the heaven of
 the Will of thy Lord, He Who is the Source of all grace, that thou 
mayest grasp the intended meaning which is enshrined in the sacred 
depths of the Holy Writings.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", 1st 
pocket-sized ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988), p. 143)<br>

</p><p>	383. The sanctified souls should ponder and meditate in their 
hearts regarding the methods of teaching. From the texts of the 
wondrous, heavenly Scriptures they should memorize phrases and passages 
bearing on various instances, so that in the course of their speech they
 may recite divine verses whenever the occasion demandeth it, inasmuch 
as these holy verses are the most potent elixir, the greatest and 
mightiest talisman. So potent is their influence that the hearer will 
have no cause for vacillation. I swear by My life! This Revelation is 
endowed with such a power that it will act as the lodestone for all 
nations and kindreds of the earth. Should one pause to meditate 
attentively he would recognize that no place is there, nor can there be,
 for anyone to flee to.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 200)</p>
<p>	384. Inspire then my soul, O my God, with Thy wondrous remembrance, 
that I may glorify Thy name. Number me not with them who read Thy words 
and fail to find Thy hidden gift which, as decreed by Thee, is contained
 therein, and which quickeneth the souls of Thy creatures and the hearts
 of Thy servants....</p>
<p>	("Prayers and Meditations by Baha'u'llah" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), p. 83)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA:</p>
<p>	385. And from amongst all creatures He hath singled out man, to 
grant him His most wondrous gift, and hath made him to attain the 
bounties of the Company on High. That most precious of gifts is 
attainment unto His unfailing guidance, that the inner reality of 
humankind should become as a niche to hold this lamp; and when the 
scattering splendours of this light do beat against the bright glass of 
the heart, the heart's purity maketh the beams to blaze out even 
stronger than before, and to shine in glory on the minds and souls of 
men. The attainment of the most great guidance is dependent upon 
knowledge and wisdom, and on being informed as to the mysteries of the 
Holy Words. Wherefore must the loved ones of God, be they young or old, 
be they men or women, each one according to his capabilities, strive to 
acquire the various branches of knowledge, and to increase his<br>
 understanding of the mysteries of the Holy Books, and his skill in marshalling the divine proofs and evidences.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	386. When your hearts are wholly attracted to the one true God you 
will acquire divine knowledge, will become attentive to the proofs and 
testimonies and will commit to memory the glad-tidings concerning the 
Manifestation of the Beauty of the All-Merciful, as mentioned in the 
heavenly Scriptures. Then ye shall behold how wondrous are His 
confirmations and how gracious is His assistance.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	387. It is imperative to acquire the knowledge of divine proofs and 
evidences, and to acquaint oneself with convincing testimonies which 
demonstrate the revelation of God's resplendent Light. The study group 
thou didst organize hath imparted much joy and happiness to the heart of
 'Abdu'l-Baha. Thou must exert much effort and show forth perseverance 
and constancy that, God willing, through the reviving breaths of His 
mercy, souls may be so educated as to become like radiant candles 
shining in the assemblage of divine knowledge and understanding. This 
matter is highly important. It is binding on every one and must be 
regarded as an obligation....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	388. In truth thou art now rendering a great service to the basic 
foundations of the Cause of God, inasmuch as the cornerstone of its 
structure is the promotion of His Faith, the awakening of the people, 
the diffusion of the divine teachings and the education of mankind; and 
all this dependeth on instructing the friends in the teaching work. I 
beseech God that within a short time thou mayest be able to acquaint the
 children of the Abha Paradise with the divine mysteries and truths and 
to rend asunder the veils of idle imaginings, that each one of them may 
become a fluent speaker and be able to guide many others to the Cause of
 God. Then will the outpourings of the heavenly bounties become manifest
 and the invisible hosts of the Kingdom, armed with conclusive proofs 
and evidences, will conquer the realms of the inner realities and 
domains of<br>
 the hearts of men, even as a single seed developing into seven ears of grain.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	389. In this day there is nothing more important than the 
instruction and study of clear proofs and convincing, heavenly 
arguments, for therein lie the source of life and the path of 
salvation....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	390. The method of instruction which ye have established, beginning 
with proofs of the existence of God and the oneness of God, the mission 
of the Prophets and Messengers and Their teachings, and the wonders of 
the universe, is highly suitable. Keep on with this. It is certain that 
the confirmations of God will attend you. It is also highly praiseworthy
 to memorize the Tablets, divine verses and sacred traditions. Ye will 
surely exert every effort in teaching, and in furthering understanding.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	391. Whatever meeting is held to celebrate the memory of the Abha 
Beauty and to listen to the recital of the divine utterances is indeed a
 rose-garden of the Kingdom; that gathering is strengthened by the 
reviving breaths of holiness that waft from the unseen world, inasmuch 
as the outpourings of divine grace are the light of that gathering and 
in it the effulgent splendours of His mercy are made manifest. I beseech
 God that those radiant faces may be enabled to shine resplendent in the
 assemblage of the realm of holiness and that those enraptured beings 
may be gathered together in the heaven of His mercifulness, that they 
may chant the verses of divine unity amidst the celestial concourse, 
sing the melody of His praise and glorification in the Abha Kingdom, 
raise the voice of jubilation in the realm on high and the cry of 
exultation and ecstasy in the Abha Paradise.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	392. There is no doubt that thou art assiduously engaged in serving 
the Cause, giving eloquent talks at the meetings of the friends, and 
elucidating divine mysteries. These exertions will cause the outpourings<br>
 of His invisible assistance to descend, and, as a magnet, will attract 
divine bounties. I earnestly hope that through the vitalizing breath of 
the Holy Spirit thou mayest be strengthened day by day, and be empowered
 to deliver more eloquent addresses.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	393. ...the Bab hath said: "Should a tiny ant desire in this day to 
be possessed of such power as to be able to unravel the abstrusest and 
most bewildering passages of the Qur'an, its wish will no doubt be 
fulfilled, inasmuch as the mystery of eternal might vibrates within the 
innermost being of all created things."[1] If so helpless a creature can
 be endowed with so subtle a capacity, how much more efficacious must be
 the power released through the liberal effusions of the grace of 
Baha'u'llah!... Wherefore, O ye illumined youth, strive by night and by 
day to unravel the mysteries of the mind and spirit, and to grasp the 
secrets of the Day of God. Inform yourselves of the evidences that the 
Most Great Name hath dawned....<br>
 [1 Cf. "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters" [rev. ed.] (Wilmette:  Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 126-27.]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	394. If it were possible that in every city a few of the awakened 
ones, when opportunity offered, could hold a meeting, and therein 
habitually present the proofs and arguments of God, this would do much 
to expand the consciousness of men; provided, however, that the 
discourse be kept to this one theme.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	395. It behoveth us one and all to recite day and night both the 
Persian and Arabic Hidden Words, to pray fervently and supplicate 
tearfully that we may be enabled to conduct ourselves in accordance with
 these divine counsels. These holy Words have not been revealed to be 
heard but to be practiced.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	396. We should memorize the Hidden Words, follow the 
exhortations of the Incomparable Lord, and conduct ourselves in a manner
 which befitteth our servitude at the threshold of the one true God.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	397. Be thou assured in thyself that if thou dost conduct thyself in
 accordance with the Hidden Words revealed in Persian and in Arabic, 
thou shalt become a torch of the fire of the love of God, an embodiment 
of humility, of lowliness, of evanescence and of selflessness.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	398. The Hidden Words is a treasury of divine mysteries. When thou 
ponderest its contents, the doors of the mysteries will open.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	399. Praise thou God that at last, through the divine teachings, 
thou hast obtained both sight and insight to the highest degree, and 
hast become firmly rooted in certitude and faith. It is my hope that 
others as well will achieve illumined eyes and hearing ears, and attain 
to everlasting life...</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 30)</p>
<p>	400. Read ye The Hidden Words, ponder the inner meanings thereof, 
act in accord therewith. Read, with close attention, the Tablets of 
Tarazat (Ornaments), Kalimat (Words of Paradise), Tajalliyat 
(Effulgences), Ishraqat (Splendours), and Bisharat (Glad Tidings), and 
rise up as ye are bidden in the heavenly teachings. Thus may each one of
 you be even as a candle casting its light, the centre of attraction 
wherever people come together; and from you, as from a bed of flowers, 
may sweet scents be shed.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 35-36)</p>
<p>	401. Direct thine attention to the holy Tablets; read thou the 
Ishraqat, Tajalliyat, the Words of Paradise, the Glad Tidings, the 
Tarazat, the Most Holy Book. Then wilt thou see that today these 
heavenly Teachings are the remedy for a sick and suffering world, and a 
healing balm for the sores on the body of mankind. They are the spirit 
of life, the ark of salvation,<br>
 the magnet to draw down eternal glory, the dynamic power to motivate the inner self of man.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 61)</p>
<p>	402. We hear that the Tablets of Ishraqat (Splendours), Tarazat 
(Ornaments), Bisharat (Glad Tidings), Tajalliyat (Effulgences), and 
Kalimat (Words of Paradise) have been translated and published in those 
regions. In these Tablets will ye have a model of how to be and how to 
live.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 79)</p>
<p>	403. Whatsoever gathering is arranged with the utmost love, and 
where those who attend are turning their faces toward the Kingdom of 
God, and where the discourse is of the Teachings of God, and the effect 
of which is to cause those present to advance -- that gathering is the 
Lord's, and that festive table hath come down from heaven.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 89)</p>
<p>	404. Whensoever a company of people shall gather in a meeting place,
 shall engage in glorifying God, and shall speak with one another of the
 mysteries of God, beyond any doubt the breathings of the Holy Spirit 
will blow gently over them, and each shall receive a share thereof.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 94)</p>
<p>	405. O thou true friend! Read, in the school of God, the lessons of 
the spirit, and learn from love's Teacher the innermost truths. Seek out
 the secrets of Heaven, and tell of the overflowing grace and favour of 
God.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 110)</p>
<p>	406. There are certain pillars which have been established as the 
unshakable supports of the Faith of God. The mightiest of these is 
learning and the use of the mind, the expansion of consciousness, and 
insight into the realities of the universe and the hidden mysteries of 
Almighty God.</p>
<p>	(Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 126)<br>

</p><p>	407. Thou didst ask as to acquiring knowledge: read thou the 
Books and Tablets of God, and the articles written to demonstrate the 
truth of this Faith. Included among them are the Iqan, which hath been 
translated into English, the works of Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, and those of 
some others among the believers. In the days to come a great number of 
holy Tablets and other sacred writings will be translated, and thou 
shouldst read these as well. Likewise, ask thou of God that the magnet 
of His love should draw unto thee the knowledge of Him. Once a soul 
becometh holy in all things, purified, sanctified, the gates of the 
knowledge of God will open wide before his eyes.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha' p. 190-191)</p>
<p>	408. It is incumbent upon you to ponder in your hearts and meditate 
upon His words, and humbly to call upon Him, and to put away self in His
 heavenly Cause. These are the things that will make of you signs of 
guidance unto all mankind, and brilliant stars shining down from the 
all-highest horizon, and towering trees in the Abha Paradise.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha' p. 241)</p>
<p>	409. O maid-servant of God! Chant the Words of God and, pondering 
over their meaning, transform them into actions! I ask God to cause thee
 to attain a high station in the Kingdom of Life forever and ever.</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, "Tablets of Abdul Baha Abbas" vol I (Chicago: Bahai Publishing Committee, 1930), p. 85)</p>
<p>	410. Hold meetings and read and chant the heavenly teachings, so 
that city may be illumined with the light of reality and that country 
become a veritable paradise by the strength of the Holy Spirit, for this
 cycle is the cycle of the Glorious Lord and the melody of oneness and 
solidarity of the world of mankind must reach the ears of the East and 
West.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas' vol. 3 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1930), p. 631)<br>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE UTTERANCES OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA:</p>
<p>	411. Both before and after putting off this material form, there is 
progress in perfection but not in state. So beings are consummated in 
perfect man. There is no other being higher than a perfect man. But man 
when he has reached this state can still make progress in perfections 
but not in state because there is no state higher than that of a perfect
 man to which he can transfer himself. He only progresses in the state 
of humanity, for the human perfections are infinite. Thus, however 
learned a man may be, we can imagine one more learned.</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", 1st pocket-sized ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 237)</p>
<p>	412. The principles of the Teachings of Baha'u'llah should be 
carefully studied, one by one, until they are realized and understood by
 mind and heart -- so will you become strong followers of the light, 
truly spiritual, heavenly soldiers of God, acquiring and spreading the 
true civilization in Persia, in Europe, and in the whole world.</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912", 11th ed. (London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1979), p. 22)</p>
<p>	413. The Spirit breathing through the Holy Scriptures is food for 
all who hunger. God Who has given the revelation to His Prophets will 
surely give of His abundance daily bread to all those who ask Him 
faithfully.</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912", p. 57)</p>
<p>	414. God sent His Prophets into the world to teach and enlighten 
man, to explain to him the mystery of the Power of the Holy Spirit, to 
enable him to reflect the light, and so in his turn, to be the source of
 guidance to others. The Heavenly Books, the Bible, the Qur'an, and the 
other Holy Writings have been given by God as guides into the paths of 
Divine virtue, love, justice and peace. Therefore I say unto you that ye
 should strive to follow the counsels of these Blessed Books, and so 
order your lives that ye may, following the examples set before you, 
become yourselves the saints of the Most High!</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912", p. 61-62)<br>

</p><p>	415. Seek with all your hearts this Heavenly Light, so that you 
may be enabled to understand the realities, that you may know the secret
 things of God, that the hidden ways may be made plain before your eyes.</p>
<p>	This light may be likened unto a mirror, and as a mirror reflects 
all that is before it, so this Light shows to the eyes of our spirits 
all that exists in God's Kingdom and causes the realities of things to 
be made visible. By the help of this effulgent Light all the spiritual 
interpretation of the Holy Writings has been made plain, the hidden 
things of God's Universe have become manifest, and we have been enabled 
to comprehend the Divine purposes for man. I pray that God in His mercy 
may illumine your hearts and souls with His glorious Light, then shall 
each one of you shine as a radiant star in the dark places of the world.</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912" p. 69-70)</p>
<p>	416. I counsel you that you study earnestly the teachings of 
Baha'u'llah, so that, God helping you, you may in deed and truth become 
Baha'is.</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912" p. 96)</p>
<p>	417. Baha'u'llah says there is a sign (from God) in every 
phenomenon: the sign of the intellect is contemplation and the sign of 
contemplation is silence, because it is impossible for a man to do two 
things at one time -- he cannot both speak and meditate.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	You cannot apply the name "man" to any being void of this faculty of
 meditation; without it he would be a mere animal, lower than the 
beasts. Through the faculty of meditation man attains to eternal life; 
through it he receives the breath of the Holy Spirit -- the bestowal of 
the Spirit is given in reflection and meditation.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	Meditation is the key for opening the doors of mysteries. In that 
state man abstracts himself: in that state man withdraws himself from 
all outside objects; in that subjective mood he is immersed in the ocean
 of spiritual life and can unfold the secrets of 
things-in-themselves....</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912" p. 175-6)<br>

</p><p>	418. Praise be to God! you have heard the call of the Kingdom. 
Your eyes are opened; you have turned to God. Your purpose is the 
good-pleasure of God, the understanding of the mysteries of the heart 
and investigation of the realities. Day and night you must strive that 
you may attain to the significances of the heavenly kingdom, perceive 
the signs of divinity, acquire certainty of knowledge and realize that 
this world has a creator, a vivifier, a provider, an architect, -- 
knowing this through proofs and evidences and not through 
susceptibilities, -- nay, rather, through decisive arguments and real 
vision; that is to say, visualizing it as clearly as the outer eye 
beholds the sun. In this way may you behold the presence of God and 
attain to the knowledge of the holy, divine Manifestations.</p>
<p>	("Foundations of World Unity", (Wilmette, Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1972), p. 65)</p>
<p>	419. I have been informed that the purpose of your class meeting is 
to study the significances and mysteries of the Holy Scriptures and 
understand the meaning of the divine Testaments. It is a cause of great 
happiness to me that you are turning unto the Kingdom of God, that you 
desire to approach the presence of God and to become informed of the 
realities and precepts of God. It is my hope that you may put forth your
 most earnest endeavor to accomplish this end, that you may attain 
knowledge of the mysteries hidden therein. Be not satisfied with words, 
but seek to understand the spiritual meanings hidden in the heart of the
 words....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
2nd. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 458-9)</p>
<p>	420. May your souls be illumined by the light of the Words of God, 
and may you become repositories of the mysteries of God, for no comfort 
is greater and no happiness is sweeter than spiritual comprehension of 
the divine teachings. If a man understands the real meaning of a poet's 
verses such as those of Shakespeare, he is pleased and rejoiced. How 
much greater his joy and pleasure when he perceives the reality of the 
Holy Scriptures and becomes informed of the mysteries of the Kingdom!<br>

</p><p>	I pray that the divine blessings may descend upon you day by 
day, that your hearts may be opened to perceive the inner significances 
of the Word of God....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
p. 460)</p>
<p>	421. ...Divine things are too deep to be expressed by common words. 
The heavenly teachings are expressed in parable in order to be 
understood and preserved for ages to come. When the spiritually minded 
dive deeply into the ocean of their meaning they bring to the surface 
the pearls of their inner significance. There is no greater pleasure 
than to study God's Word with a spiritual mind.</p>
<p>	("'Abdu'l-Baha in London: Addresses, and Notes of Conversations", 
Commemorative ed. (London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), p. 80)</p>
<p>	422. It is very good to memorize the logical points and the proofs 
of the Holy Books. Those proofs and evidences which establish the fact 
that Baha'u'llah is the fulfillment of the Promises of the Holy Books. 
These proofs ought to be collected and memorized. As soon as someone 
will ask you -- What are your proofs? -- you may cry out at the top of 
your voice and say: 'Here they are!'</p>
<p>	("Star of the West" Vol 3, No. I 1, p. 4)</p>
<p>	423. ... (Live thou in accord with the teachings of Baha'u'llah. Do 
not only read them. There is a vast difference between the soul who 
merely reads the words of Baha'u'llah and the one who tries to live 
them. Read thou "The Hidden Words". Ponder over their meanings and 
embody the behests into thy life....</p>
<p>	("Star of the West" Vol. 7, No. 18, p. 178)</p>
<p>	424. The cause of God is like unto a college. The believers are like
 unto the students. The college is founded for the sake of the 
acquirements of science, arts and literature. If the sciences are not 
therein and the scholars are not educated the object of the college is 
not achieved. The students must show the results of their study in their
 deportment and deeds; otherwise they have wasted their lives. Now the 
friends must so live and conduct themselves as to bring greater glory 
and results to the religion of<br>
 God. To them the cause of God must be a dynamic force transforming the 
lives of men and not a question of meetings, committees, futile 
discussions, unnecessary debates and political wire-pulling.</p>
<p>	("Star of the West" Vol. 7, No. 18, p. 178)</p>
<p>	425. The first thing to do is to acquire a thirst for Spirituality, 
then Live the Life! Live the Life! Live the Life! The way to acquire 
this thirst is to meditate upon the future life. Study the Holy Words, 
read your Bible, read the Holy Books, especially study the Holy 
Utterances of Baha'u'llah; Prayer and Meditation, take much time for 
these two. Then will you know this Great Thirst, and then only can you 
begin to Live the Life!</p>
<p>	("Star of the West" Vol. 19, No. 3, p. 69)</p>
<p>	426. Knowledge is love. Study, listen to exhortations, think, try to
 understand the wisdom and greatness of God. The soil must be fertilized
 before the seed can be sown.</p>
<p>	("Star of the West" Vol. 20, No. 10, p. 314)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN BY SHOGHI EFFENDI:</p>
<p>	427. Praise be to God that the spirit of the Holy Writings and 
Tablets which have been revealed in this wondrous Dispensation 
concerning matters of major or minor importance, whether essential or 
otherwise, related to the sciences and the arts, to natural philosophy, 
literature, politics or economics, have so permeated the world that 
since the inception of the world in the course of past Dispensations and
 bygone ages nothing like it has ever been seen or heard. Indeed if an 
avowed follower of Baha'u'llah were to immerse himself in, and fathom 
the depths of, the ocean of these heavenly teachings, and with utmost 
care and attention deduce from each of them the subtle mysteries and 
consummate wisdom that lie enshrined therein, such a person's life, 
materially, intellectually and spiritually, will be safe from toil and 
trouble, and unaffected by setbacks and perils, or any sadness or 
despondency.</p>
<p>	(13 January 1923 to the Baha'is of Adhirbayjan)<br>

</p><p>	428. Now surely, if ever, is the time for us, the chosen ones of
 Baha'u'llah and the bearers of His Message to the world, to endeavour, 
by day and by night, to deepen, first and foremost, the Spirit of His 
Cause in our own individual lives, and then labour, and labour 
incessantly to exemplify in all our dealings with our fellow-men that 
noble Spirit of which His beloved Son, 'Abdu'l-Baha, has been all the 
days of His life a true and unique exponent....</p>
<p>	Let us, with a pure heart, with humility and earnestness, turn 
afresh to His counsels and exhortations, and seek from that Source of 
Celestial Potency all the guidance, the Spirit, the power which we shall
 need for the fulfilment of our mission in this life.</p>
<p>	(12 March 1923 to the Baha'is of America, Australasia, France, 
Germany, British Isles, Italy, Japan and Switzerland, published in 
"Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932" [rev. ed.], 
(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), p. 35)</p>
<p>	429. What you have undertaken to achieve, under the guidance and 
instruction, of that valiant and indefatigable servant of the Abha</p>
<p>	Threshold, my well-beloved brother Dr. Bagdadi, is highly 
praiseworthy and of supreme importance. Never flinch in your great 
enterprise. Deepen your knowledge of the Cause. Strive to extend the 
sphere of your activities and seek to understand and promote the harmony
 that must exist between true science and Divine Revelation. I will 
never fail to pray for you. I have great hopes in the ultimate triumph 
of the task before you.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 23
 January 1924 written on his behalf to the Baha'i Youth of Chicago, 11. 
U.S.A.)</p>
<p>	430. If you read the utterances of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l- Baha 
with selflessness and care and concentrate upon them, you will discover 
truths unknown to you before and will obtain an insight into the 
problems that have baffled the great thinkers of the world. God in His 
essence can not be comprehended nor assume bodily form. We can only 
approach Him through the knowledge of His Manifestations. I pray that 
you may drink deep at the fountain-head of Their Sacred Teachings. I 
assure you of my prayers for your recovery and success.</p>
<p>	(In the hand writing of Shoghi Effendi appended to a letter dated 30
 January 1925 written on his behalf to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	431. The Baha'i youth must be taught how to teach the Cause of 
God. Their knowledge of the fundamentals of the Faith must be deepened 
and the standard of their education in science and literature enhanced. 
They must become thoroughly familiar with the language used and the 
example set by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His public addresses throughout the West.
 They must also be acquainted with those essential prerequisites of 
teaching as recorded in the Holy Books and Tablets.</p>
<p>	(9 June 1925 to the Local Spiritual Assemblies of the East - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	432. I strongly urge you to devote, while you are pursuing your 
studies, as much time as you possibly can to a thorough study of the 
history and Teachings of our Beloved Cause. This is the prerequisite of a
 future successful career of service to the Baha'i Faith in which I hope
 and pray you will distinguish yourself in the days to come.</p>
<p>	(In the hand writing of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 18 May 1926 written on his behalf to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	433. I will pray for you that you may be inspired to do whatever is 
His will and pleasure, that your vision may be clarified, your heart 
emptied of every vain desire, and your mind purified from whatsoever 
hinders you from grasping the truths that underlie the Faith. Study the 
Teachings profoundly that the light of Divine Guidance may illumine your
 path and remove every obstacle from your way.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 26
 April 1927 written on his behalf to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	434. The youthful and eager workers for the Cause in Montreal occupy
 a warm place in my heart. I will remember their hopes, their plans, 
their activities in my hours of prayer at the Holy Shrine. I urge them 
to study profoundly the revealed utterances of Baha'u'llah and the 
discourses of 'Abdu'l-Baha and not to rely unduly on the representation 
and interpretation of the Teachings given by Baha'i speakers and 
teachers. May the Almighty sustain you and guide you in your work.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 20
 March 1929 written on his behalf to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	435. Ours is the duty to ponder these things in our heart, to 
strive to widen our vision, and to deepen our comprehension of this 
Cause, and to arise, resolutely and unreservedly, to play our part, 
however small, in this greatest drama of the world's spiritual history.</p>
<p>	(21 March 1930 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of the West,
 published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", rev. 
ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 26)</p>
<p>	436. I would strongly urge you to utilize, to the utmost possible 
extent, the wealth of authentic material gathered in Nabil's stirring 
Narrative and to encourage the youth to master and digest the facts 
recorded therein as a basis for their future work in the teaching field,
 and as a sustenance to their spiritual life and activities in the 
service of the Cause....</p>
<p>	(In the hand writing of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 9
 November 1932 written on his behalf to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	437. I certainly advise you to concentrate next year on "The 
Dawn-Breakers" as well as on the needs, the principles and the purpose 
of Baha'i Administration. The Cause in your land is still in its 
formative period. It needs men and women of vision, of capacity and 
understanding. May your newly- established school render inestimable 
services in this as well as in other fields of activity. I will pray for
 your high endeavours from the depths of my heart. Rest assured and 
persevere.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 25 September 1933 written on his behalf to two believers)</p>
<p>	438. To strive to obtain a more adequate understanding of the 
significance of Baha'u'llah's stupendous Revelation must, it is my 
unalterable conviction, remain the first obligation and the object of 
the constant endeavor of each one of its loyal adherents. An exact and 
thorough comprehension of so vast a system, so sublime a revelation, so 
sacred a trust, is for obvious reasons beyond the reach and ken of our 
finite minds. We can, however, and it is our bounden duty to seek to 
derive fresh inspiration and added sustenance as we labor for the 
propagation of His Faith through a clearer apprehension of the truths it
 enshrines and the principles on which it is based.</p>
<p>	(The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters", p. 100)<br>

</p><p>	439. I grieve to learn of the situation which the disharmony of 
the believers has created. Emphasis should be laid by all members, and 
with increasing force and determination, upon the essentials of the 
administrative order as explained in the book entitled "Baha'i 
Administration". Whatever is not provided, should be referred to your 
National Assembly. The decision of the majority must, under all 
circumstances, be upheld and enforced. Persevere and never lose heart 
and courage.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 9 May 1934 written on his behalf to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	440. I would urge you to concentrate from now on upon the essentials
 of Baha'i belief and the distinguishing features of the Administrative 
Order and endeavour to teach these truths to whomsoever may seem to you 
to be receptive. It would constitute a magnificent act of service in 
your long record of devoted endeavours on behalf of this glorious Cause.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 31 July 1934 written on his behalf to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	441. Those who participate in such a campaign, whether in an 
organizing capacity, or as workers to whose care the execution of the 
task itself has been committed, must, as an essential preliminary to the
 discharge of their duties, thoroughly familiarize themselves with the 
various aspects of the history and teachings of their Faith. In their 
efforts to achieve this purpose they must study for themselves, 
conscientiously and painstakingly, the literature of their Faith, delve 
into its teachings, assimilate its laws and principles, ponder its 
admonitions, tenets and purposes, commit to memory certain of its 
exhortations and prayers, master the essentials of its administration, 
and keep abreast of its current affairs and latest developments....</p>
<p>	("The Advent of Divine Justice" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 49)</p>
<p>	442. As the processes impelling a rapidly evolving Order on the 
highroad of its destiny multiply and gather momentum, attention should 
be increasingly directed to the vital need of ensuring, by every means 
possible, the deepening of the faith, the understanding and the 
spiritual life of the individuals who, as the privileged members of this
 community,<br>
 are called upon to participate in this glorious unfoldment and are 
lending their assistance to this historic evolution. A profound study of
 the Faith which they have espoused, its history, its spiritual as well 
as administrative principles; a thorough understanding of the Covenant 
of Baha'u'llah and of the Will of 'Abdu'l-Baha; a deeper realization of 
the implication of the claims advanced by the Founders of the Faith; 
strict adherence to the laws and principles which They have established;
 a greater dedication to the fundamentals and verities enshrined in 
Their teachings -- these constitute, I feel convinced, the urgent need 
of the members of this rapidly expanding community. For upon this 
spiritual foundation must depend the solidity of the institutions which 
they are now so painstakingly erecting. Every outward thrust into new 
fields, every multiplication of Baha'i institutions, must be paralleled 
by a deeper thrust of the roots which sustain the spiritual life of the 
community and ensure its sound development. From this vital, this 
ever-present need attention must, at no time, be diverted; nor must it 
be, under any circumstances, neglected, or subordinated to the no less 
vital and urgent task of ensuring the outer expansion of Baha'i 
administrative institutions....</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 30
 December 1948 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly 
of Australia and New Zealand)</p>
<p>	443. ...the paramount duty of deepening the spiritual life of these 
newly fledged, these precious and highly esteemed co-workers, and of 
enlightening their minds regarding the essential verities enshrined in 
their Faith and its fundamental institutions, its history and genesis --
 the twin Covenants of Baha'u'llah and of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the present 
Administrative Order, the Future World Order, the Laws of the Most Holy 
Book, the inseparable Institutions of the Guardianship and of the 
Universal House of Justice, the salient events of the Heroic and 
Formative Ages of the Faith, and its relationship with the Dispensations
 that have preceded it, its attitude towards the social and political 
organizations by which it is surrounded -- must continue to constitute 
the most vital aspect of the great spiritual Crusade launched by the 
champions of the Faith<br>
 from the shores of their native land among the peoples of their sister Republics in the South.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter written 
on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	444. The deepening and enrichment of the spiritual life of the 
individual believer, his increasing comprehension of the essential 
verities underlying this Faith, his training in its administrative 
processes, his understanding of the fundamentals of the Covenants 
established by its Author and the authorized Interpreter of its 
teachings should be made the supreme objectives of the national 
representatives responsible for the edification, the progress and 
consolidation of these communities.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 1 
March 1951 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of 
Australia and New Zealand)</p>
<p>	445. Nor must the elected representatives of this Community neglect 
their supreme responsibility to safeguard the spiritual life of its 
members, to continually enrich that life by every means in their power, 
to deepen their grasp of the distinguishing features and the fundamental
 verities of the Baha'i Faith, and to encourage and inspire them to 
reflect its spirit and precepts in their personal lives and conduct.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 14
 June 1954 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of 
South America)</p>
<p>	446. As the process of internal expansion and consolidation gains 
momentum, the elected national representatives of this Community must 
not fail to consecrate themselves to the no less fundamental task of 
enriching continually the spiritual life of its members, of deepening 
their understanding of the essential verities, tenets and principles 
underlying their Faith, of demanding a strict adherence to its laws and 
statutes, and of setting an example to their fellow- believers through a
 fuller reflection, in their personal lives and conduct, of the 
ennobling truths animating the Revelation of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 24
 June 1954 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of 
Central America)<br>

</p><p>	447. Above all, the utmost endeavour should be exerted by your 
Assembly to familiarize the newly enrolled believers with the 
fundamental and spiritual verities of the Faith, and with the origins, 
the aims and purposes, as well as the processes of a divinely appointed 
Administrative Order, to acquaint them more fully with the history of 
the Faith, to instil in them a deeper understanding of the Covenants of 
both Baha'u'llah and of 'Abdu'l-Baha, to enrich their spiritual life, to
 rouse them to a greater effort and a closer participation in both the 
teaching of the Faith and the administration of its activities, and to 
inspire them to make the necessary sacrifices for the furtherance of its
 vital interests. For as the body of the avowed supporters of the Faith 
is enlarged, and the basis of the structure of its Administrative Order 
is broadened, and the fame of the rising community spreads far and wide,
 a parallel progress must be achieved, if the fruits already garnered 
are to endure, in the spiritual quickening of its members and the 
deepening of their inner life.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 26
 June 1956 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of 
Canada)</p>
<p>	448. ...a firmer grasp of the essential verities of the Faith; a 
more profound study of its history and a deeper understanding of the 
genesis, the significance, the workings, and the present status and 
achievements of its embryonic World Order and of the Covenant to which 
it owes its birth and vitality -- these remain the rock-bottom 
requirements which alone can guarantee the opening, and hasten the 
advent, of that blissful era which every British Baha'i heart so eagerly
 anticipates, and the glories of which can, at present, be but dimly 
discerned.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi appended to a letter dated 30 
August 1957 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of 
the British Isles)<br>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF SHOGHI EFFENDI:</p>
<p>	(The following are from letters to individual believers unless otherwise stated)</p>
<p>	449. The Sacred Books are full of allusions to this new 
dispensation. In the "Book of Iqan", Baha'u'llah gives the keynote and 
explains some of the outstanding passages hoping that the friends will 
continue to study the Sacred Books by themselves, and unfold the 
mysteries found therein. The people, failing to comprehend the meaning 
of the symbols and the truth of the Sacred Verses, thought them to be 
myths and unrealizable dreams. It is the duty of the friends who have 
been endowed by Baha'u'llah with the power of discernment to study these
 Sacred Books, ponder upon their passages and teach the disheartened 
people of the earth the treasures of knowledge they enclose.</p>
<p>	(11 March 1923)</p>
<p>	450. If the younger Baha'i generation, in whom Shoghi Effendi has 
great hopes, take the pain of studying the Cause deeply and thoroughly, 
read its history, find its underlying principles and become both well 
informed and energetic, they surely can achieve a great deal. It is upon
 their shoulders that the Master has laid the tremendous work of 
teaching. They are the ones to raise the call of the Kingdom and arouse 
the people from slumber. If they fail the Cause is doomed to 
stagnation....</p>
<p>	(26 April 1923 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	451. To deepen in the Cause means to read the writings of 
Baha'u'llah and the Master so thoroughly as to be able to give it to 
others in its pure form. There are many who have some superficial idea 
of what the Cause stands for. They, therefore, present it together with 
all sorts of ideas that are their own. As the Cause is still in its 
early days we must be most careful lest we fall under this error and 
injure the Movement we so much adore. There is no limit to the study of 
the Cause. The more we read the writings the more truths we can find in 
them and the more we will see that our previous notions were erroneous.</p>
<p>	(25 August 1926)<br>

</p><p>	452. Shoghi Effendi is especially delighted to know that the 
younger group are studying the Will and Testament as this document is 
indispensable for a complete understanding of the spirit, of the mission
 and of the future state of the Baha'i Cause. It would be well to have a
 competent friend explain to them some of the passages.</p>
<p>	(28 February 1928)</p>
<p>	453. Shoghi Effendi is sure that the more you study the Cause and 
its teachings the more you will realize what a mission it has to give to
 this world at this time. Dr. Jowett of Balliol rightly said that this 
is the greatest light that has appeared in the world since Christianity,
 that the present generation is too near to it to appreciate its import,
 that only in the future its significance will become manifest. I do not
 believe that even the Baha'is can conceive the wonderful and 
fundamental change the tenets of this Movement and the spirit of the 
teachings and the life of its Founders, are going to make in the heart 
and mind of this generation and the future ones....</p>
<p>	(17 December 1928)</p>
<p>	454. He sincerely hopes that your group will daily increase in 
number and gradually begin to radiate its light of guidance to the 
neighbouring regions. Before that stage is reached, however, you should 
exert all your efforts upon deepening your knowledge of the teachings 
and literature of the Cause. The Writings of Baha'u'llah and the Master 
are like vast seas, the deeper you go into them, the more priceless 
treasures you will find. And it is only after acquiring those treasures 
that we can hope to share them with others.</p>
<p>	(4 March 1931 to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Columbus, Oh., U. S.A.)</p>
<p>	455. ...Shoghi Effendi hopes that you will exert all your efforts 
first in deepening your own knowledge of the teachings and then strive 
to attract other people. You should form study classes and read the 
important books that have been published, especially the "Iqan", which 
contains the basic tenets of the Faith. The one who ponders over that 
book and grasps its full significance will obtain a clear insight into 
the old scriptures and appreciate the true Mission of the Bab and 
Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(27 March 1931 to the Local Spiritual Assembly of St. Louis, Mo., U.S.A)<br>

</p><p>	456. Being a Baha'i you are certainly aware of the fact that 
Baha'u'llah considered education as one of the most fundamental factors 
of a true civilization. This education, however, in order to be adequate
 and fruitful, should be comprehensive in nature and should take into 
consideration not only the physical and the intellectual side of man but
 also his spiritual and ethical aspects. This should be the programme of
 the Baha'i youth all over the world.</p>
<p>	(9 July 1931)</p>
<p>	457. Concerning the course of study you may follow: Shoghi Effendi 
prefers you to find what subject you like most and for which you are 
best fitted especially after consulting with your Mother. The Cause is 
such that we can serve it no matter what our profession may be. The only
 necessity is that we be spiritually minded and not be guided by purely 
material considerations. We should also not let our studies detain us 
from deepening our knowledge of the literature of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(9 November 1931)</p>
<p>	458. Shoghi Effendi feels that the real purpose of these Summer 
Schools is to deepen the knowledge of the friends. Lectures are very 
essential for they give a wonderful picture of the subject-matter. But 
it is not sufficient to have a picture; the friends should deepen their 
knowledge and this can be achieved if together with the lectures there 
are study classes and seminar work carried on by the same lecturer.</p>
<p>	The world is undoubtedly facing a great crisis and the social, 
economic and political conditions are becoming daily more complex. 
Should the friends desire to take the lead in reforming the world, they 
should start by educating themselves and understand what the troubles 
and problems really are which baffle the mind of man. It is in these 
Summer Schools that this training should be provided for the friends.</p>
<p>	(27 January 1932)</p>
<p>	459. Besides this the friends should arrange proper study classes 
and deepen their knowledge of the teachings. It is only through such 
thorough understanding of the literature of the Cause that you can 
appreciate the real message that Baha'u'llah has brought to the world.<br>

</p><p>	Only then would you see how incomplete and futile is the work of
 the other societies and movements that at present exist in the 
world....</p>
<p>	(1 February 1932)</p>
<p>	460. Shoghi Effendi hopes that you will exert all your effort to 
deepen your knowledge of the literature of the Movement, until you 
become fully acquainted with its spirit and tenets. Unless you do obtain
 such a firm hold you will never be able to teach others and render real
 service to the promulgation of the Faith. Of special importance is the 
Book of the Iqan which explains the attitude of the Cause towards the 
prophets of God and their mission in the history of society. Besides 
this there is "Some Answered Questions" of the Master and "The 
Dawn-Breakers" of Nabil. Every Baha'i should master these books and be 
able to explain their contents to others. Besides their importance, they
 are interesting and most absorbing.</p>
<p>	(9 February 1932)</p>
<p>	461. Surely the ideal way of teaching is to prove our points by 
constant reference to the actual words of Baha'u'llah and the Master. 
This will save the Cause from being misinterpreted by individuals. It is
 what these divine Lights say that is truth and therefore they should be
 the authorities of our statements. This, however, does not mean that 
our freedom of expression is limited. We can always find new ways of 
approach to that truth or explain how they influence our life and 
condition. The more deep our studies the more we can understand the 
significance of the teachings. In the Cause we cannot divorce the letter
 from the spirit of the words. As Baha'u'llah says we should take the 
outward significance and superimpose upon it the inner. Either without 
the other is wrong and defective.</p>
<p>	(16 February 1932)</p>
<p>	462. Another essential thing is that those who do embrace the Faith 
should be constantly urged to study the literature of the Cause. It is 
not sufficient that our numbers should increase, we want people whose 
faith stands on a rock and no trial can move. We want people who will in
 turn arise and carry the Message to other people and guide other souls.</p>
<p>	(13 April 1932 to a Local Spiritual Assembly and an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	463. Shoghi Effendi undertook the translation of "The Dawn- 
Breakers" only after being convinced that its publication will arouse 
the friends to greater self-sacrifice and a more determined way of 
teaching. Otherwise he would not have devoted so much time to it. 
Reading about the life and activities of those heroic souls is bound to 
influence our mode of living and the importance we attach to our 
services in the Cause. Shoghi Effendi therefore hopes that the friends 
will read, nay rather study that book, and encourage their young people 
to do that as well.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	It is also very important to hold study classes and go deep in the 
teachings. A great harm is done by starting to teach without being 
firmly grounded in the literature. "Little knowledge is dangerous" fully
 applies to the teaching work. The friends should read the writings and 
be able to quote from the Tablets when discussing subjects pertaining to
 the Faith.</p>
<p>	(9 May 1932)</p>
<p>	464. He fully approves the idea of holding study classes, for the 
deeper the friends go in their understanding of their teachings the more
 firm and steadfast they will become and the more unwavering in their 
support of the institutions of the Faith. Books such as the "Iqan", 
"Some Answered Questions" and "The Dawn-Breakers" should be mastered by 
every Baha'i. They should read these books over and over again. The 
first two books will reveal to them the significance of this divine 
revelation as well as the unity of all the Prophets of old. The last 
book will show you how the Faith was ushered into the world and how its 
early adherents heroically faced martyrdom and suffering in their desire
 to establish the Cause throughout the world. Knowing the life of those 
heroes will create in us the urge to follow their footsteps and achieve 
the same.</p>
<p>	(9 June 1932)</p>
<p>	465. He sincerely hopes that every one of those individuals who 
expressed his desire to join the Movement will gradually become so 
confirmed that no amount of trials and tribulations will deter him from 
sharing in the work of spreading the Faith throughout the world. Before 
undertaking such a task, however, it is necessary that they should 
deepen their knowledge of the teachings. They should learn to<br>
 study the words for themselves and both grasp their significance and 
also become imbued with their spirit. The hope of Shoghi Effendi is not 
only to increase the number of the friends but also to have truer and 
more understanding Baha'is. The task of the teachers is to produce such 
efficient servants for our beloved Faith.</p>
<p>	(18 October 1932)</p>
<p>	466. The Master used to attach much importance to the learning by 
heart of Tablets of Baha'u'llah and the Bab. During His days it was a 
usual work of the children of the household to learn Tablets by heart; 
now, however, those children are grown up and do not have time for such a
 thing. But the practice is most useful to implant the ideas and spirit 
those words contain into the mind of the children.</p>
<p>	(19 October 1932 to the Local Spiritual Assembly of West England and the Teaching Committee of New Jersey, U.S.A.)</p>
<p>	467. Books such as the "Iqan", "Some Answered Questions", the 
"Tablets of Baha'u'llah", Nabil's Narrative and Dr. Esslemont's book 
should be read and read over again by every soul who desires to serve 
the Movement or considers himself an active member of the group.</p>
<p>	(9 November 1932)</p>
<p>	468. Definite courses should be given along the different phases of 
the Baha'i Faith and in a manner that will stimulate the students to 
proceed in their studies privately once they return home, for the period
 of a few days is not sufficient to learn everything. They have to be 
taught the habit of studying the Cause constantly, for the more we read 
the Words the more will the truth they contain be revealed to us.</p>
<p>	(24 November 1932)</p>
<p>	469. It is, however, very important that these newcomers should 
study the teachings and become thoroughly familiar with them, otherwise 
their faith will be established upon shifting sand and could be easily 
demolished. The words of Baha'u'llah and the Master, however, have a 
creative power and are sure to awaken in the reader the undying fire of 
the love of God.</p>
<p>	(17 February 1933)<br>

</p><p>	470. He does not ask us to follow Him blindly; as He says in one
 of His Tablets, God had endowed man with a mind to operate as a 
torchlight and guide him to truth. Read His words, consider His 
teachings, and measure their value in the light of contemporary problems
 and the truth will surely be revealed to you....</p>
<p>	(26 February 1933 to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 80 (January 1934), p. 5)</p>
<p>	471. Shoghi Effendi found great pleasure and spiritual upliftment 
while working on the translation of Nabil's Narrative. The life of those
 who figure in it is so stirring that everyone who reads those accounts 
is bound to be affected and impelled to follow their footsteps of 
sacrifice in the path of the Faith. The Guardian believes, therefore, 
that it should be studied by the friends, especially the youth who need 
some inspiration to carry them through these troubled days.</p>
<p>	(11 March 1933)</p>
<p>	472. The second point which the Guardian wishes you to stress and to
 keep always in mind is the necessity for every loyal and active member 
of your committee to fully concentrate on the thorough study and 
understanding of the spiritual and administrative principles of the 
Faith, as a necessary step for active and fruitful teaching. You should 
first equip yourselves with the necessary amount of knowledge about the 
Cause and then, and only then, try to teach....</p>
<p>	(August 1933 to the Baha'i Youth Committee of the United States and 
Canada, published in "Baha'i World", Vol. 5 (1932-1934) (New York: 
Baha'i Publishing Committee 1936), p. 372)</p>
<p>	473. Your thorough and continued study of the Teachings, as 
expressed by your readiness to be in close and constant touch with all 
Baha'i publications, is, indeed, remarkable, for besides deepening your 
knowledge of the basic tenets of the Faith and of keeping you in close 
contact with its administrative developments it gives you an opportunity
 to prepare yourself for the teaching of the Cause. To study and to 
teach, these are the twofold and sacred obligations of every responsible
 and active follower of the Faith.</p>
<p>	(13 August 1933)<br>

</p><p>	474. In these gloomy days, when the world is caught into the 
whirlpool of agnosticism and of materialism, the Guardian is eagerly 
looking to such devoted and ardent believers like you, to arise and 
proclaim the Holy Word of God which is humanity's unique and most 
effective ark of salvation. Nothing short of that can save our 
civilization from falling into chaos and anarchy. It is, therefore, the 
sacred responsibility of every loyal follower of the Faith to fully 
realize the tremendous task he is called upon to fulfil, and to seek all
 those measures which can enable him to contribute his share, however 
modest, to the progress of the Cause. And it is evident that such a goal
 cannot be attained unless we are adequately imbued with the spirit and 
informed of the basic tenets and teachings of the Faith. The Guardian 
would, therefore, strongly urge you to get increasingly familiar with 
the literature of the Cause, to study and investigate all its aspects, 
whether spiritual, social or administrative, so that you may, in a not 
distant future, be able to rank among the distinguished and outstanding 
teachers and exponents of the Movement.</p>
<p>	(10 September 1933)</p>
<p>	475. His brotherly advice to you, and to all loyal and ardent young 
believers like you, is that you should deepen your knowledge of the 
history and of the tenets of the Faith, not merely by means of careful 
and thorough study, but also through active, whole-hearted and continued
 participation in all the activities, whether administrative or 
otherwise, of your community. The Baha'i community life provides you 
with an indispensable laboratory, where you can translate into living 
and constructive action the principles which you imbibe from the 
Teachings. By becoming a real part of that living organism you can catch
 the real spirit which runs throughout the Baha'i Teachings. To study 
the principles, and to try to live according to them, are, therefore, 
the two essential mediums through which you can ensure the development 
and progress of your inner spiritual life and of your outer existence as
 well. May Baha'u'llah enable you to attain this high station, and may 
He keep the torch of faith forever burning in your heart!</p>
<p>	(2 November 1933)<br>

</p><p>	476. These sources of disagreement and of difference are all due
 to the lack of thorough understanding, on the part of many of the 
believers, of the basic laws and principles of Baha'i Administration. 
Despite our Guardian's repeated and emphatic instructions and 
recommendations that the friends should deepen their knowledge, through 
both study and practice, of all the administrative teachings of the 
Faith, yet, some have, for some reason or another, neglected to do so. 
The result has been that they are working in the dark, not knowing where
 to look for guidance in all such matters.</p>
<p>	(11 November 1933)</p>
<p>	477. The Guardian ... was gratified to learn of the progress of your
 academic studies, and of your future plans for the study and the 
teaching of the Cause. The spirit which is moving and sustaining you in 
the service of the Faith is, indeed, remarkable, and through it you will
 undoubtedly be moved to render great and imperishable services to the 
Cause of Baha'u'llah. The university training which you are receiving at
 present will be of immense help to you in your efforts to present the 
Message in intellectual circles. In these days when people are so 
sceptical about religion and look with so much contempt towards 
religious organizations and movements, there seems to be more need than 
ever for our young Baha'is to be well equipped intellectually, so that 
they may be in a position to present the Message in a befitting way, and
 in a manner that would convince every unbiased observer of the 
effectiveness and power of the Teachings. In view of that Shoghi Effendi
 would urge you to persevere in your studies, and trusts that as a 
result you will be greatly assisted in your teaching activities....</p>
<p>	(5 May 1934)</p>
<p>	478. The Guardian would strongly urge each and every member of the 
National Spiritual Assembly to carefully peruse, and to quietly ponder 
upon the outer meaning and upon the inner spirit as well, of all his 
communications on the subject of the origin, nature and present-day 
functioning of the administrative order of the Faith. A compilation of 
these letters has been lately published in the States under the title 
"Baha'i Administration", and a complete knowledge of that book seems to 
be<br>
 quite essential to the right handling of the administrative problems facing your National Spiritual Assembly at present....</p>
<p>	(9 May 1934)</p>
<p>	479. Shoghi Effendi was also pleased to learn of the response which 
his last general communication addressed to the friends in the West has 
awakened in your community. It is his hope that the Urbana believers 
will, through their careful and continued study of this important 
communication, acquire a new vision of the Cause, and will be stimulated
 to redouble their efforts for the expansion and consolidation of their 
work for the Faith.</p>
<p>	(11 May 1934)</p>
<p>	480. Shoghi Effendi wishes me also to express his deep-felt 
appreciation of your intention to study the Qur'an. The knowledge of 
this revealed holy Book is, indeed, indispensable to every Baha'i who 
wishes to adequately understand the writings of Baha'u'llah. And in view
 of that the Guardian has been invariably encouraging the friends to 
make as thorough a study of this Book as possible, particularly in their
 Summer Schools. Sale's translation is the most scholarly we have, but 
Rodwell's version is more literary, and hence easier for reading.</p>
<p>	(23 November 1934)</p>
<p>	481. He feels, indeed, that the time has come for the German 
believers to acquire a thorough knowledge as well as a full 
understanding of such important Tablets as Baha'u'llah's "Book of 
Covenant" and 'Abdu'l-Baha's Will and Testament, both of which 
constitute the very bedrock upon which the entire administrative system 
of the Faith has been raised and established. As to "The Dispensation of
 Baha'u'llah" it also constitutes an invaluable supplement to these 
aforementioned Tablets....</p>
<p>	(10 January 1935)</p>
<p>	482. Your emphasis on the study of the Administration, he feels, is 
most timely and of a vital practical importance, inasmuch as it serves 
to consolidate and direct towards a definite objective your general 
teaching work. Without the study and application of the Administration 
the<br>
 teaching of the Cause becomes not only meaningless, but loses in effectiveness and in scope.</p>
<p>	(31 May 1935)</p>
<p>	483. With regard to the School's programme for the next summer: the 
Guardian would certainly advise, and even urge the friends to make a 
thorough study of the Qur'an, as the knowledge of this Sacred Scripture 
is absolutely indispensable for every believer who wishes to adequately 
understand, and intelligently read the Writings of Baha'u'llah. Although
 there are very few persons among our Western Baha'is who are capable of
 handling such a course in a scholarly way yet, the mere lack of such 
competent teachers should encourage and stimulate the believers to get 
better acquainted with the Sacred Scriptures of Islam. In this way, 
there will gradually appear some distinguished Baha'is who will be so 
well versed in the teachings of Islam as to be able to guide the 
believers in their study of that religion.</p>
<p>	(2 December 1935)</p>
<p>	484. The Guardian feels particularly appreciative of the emphasis 
your Committee has laid on the study of the "Gleanings from the Writings
 of Baha'u'llah" -- which book, he believes, should be the continued 
guide and companion of every believer, especially those who are actively
 engaged in teaching the Cause. It is his fervent hope that this book 
will kindle in the heart of all the friends a new light, whereby they 
will receive a fuller guidance and a greater measure of inspiration in 
their labours for the Cause.</p>
<p>	(28 January 1936)</p>
<p>	485. He is particularly pleased to realize that the book of 
"Gleanings" is of such a tremendous inspiration to the Baha'i youth, and
 that they all are making a careful study of its contents with the view 
of preparing themselves for proper teaching work. His hope is that this 
volume will enable them to gain a fuller consciousness of their 
functions and responsibilities, and to arise and set the example before 
the rest of the believers, not only in the field of teaching, but in all
 the other fields of Baha'i activity as well. He is ardently 
supplicating Baha'u'llah on your behalf, and on behalf of the whole body
 of young Baha'is throughout the<br>
 States, and especially the National Youth Committee, that you may be 
given the inspiration, knowledge and guidance to press forward to 
efficient and loyal service.</p>
<p>	(2 February 1936)</p>
<p>	486. An effort should be made to raise the standard of studies, so 
as to provide the Baha'i student with a thorough knowledge of the Cause 
that would enable him to expound it befittingly to the educated public.</p>
<p>	(8 November 1937)</p>
<p>	487. He has noted, in particular, with genuine satisfaction the 
recommendations issued by the National Youth Committee to the members of
 our Baha'i youth to make a deeper study of the Master's Will and to 
ponder more carefully on its manifold and far-reaching implications. He 
hopes that the Regional Youth Conferences recently held in New York and 
Chicago have devoted all the time necessary for the study and discussion
 of this all-important subject, and have given it the full emphasis it 
deserves. He will pray that the results obtained may be such as to give 
all the attendants a clear and wider vision of the tasks, 
responsibilities and obligations they will be called upon to discharge 
during this year, and a renewed stimulus to contribute their full share 
to the success and complete fulfilment of the Seven Year Plan.</p>
<p>	The Guardian would advise that in their studies of the Will and 
Testament the young believers should use the "Dispensation", which will 
undoubtedly help them considerably to grasp the full implications of 
that sacred and historic Document which he has described as the "Charter
 of the New World Order".</p>
<p>	(9 January 1939)</p>
<p>	488. It is his fervent hope and his heart's ardent prayer that you 
may increasingly deepen in your faith, and steadily gain in your 
understanding and appreciation of the Teachings, and display such 
earnestness and perseverance in your Baha'i studies as to gradually 
acquire the full knowledge, training and experience necessary for active
 and effective service to the Faith in the future. Although still young 
in age, you should endeavour from now, through close association with 
your fellow-believers, and through your<br>
 faithful application to your Baha'i studies, to prepare yourself for 
that day when you will be called upon, as a grown-up and responsible 
member of the Community, to take full part in the activities of the 
Cause, and thus prove yourself worthy of being a member of this 
world-wide Fellowship created by Baha'u'llah. The Guardian was truly 
pleased to note that you have already started reading some Baha'i books,
 and would specially advise you to endeavour [to] commit to memory 
certain passages from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, and in particular, 
some of His prayers. This training would undoubtedly be of tremendous 
help to you in your future studies of the Cause, and would also serve to
 considerably deepen and enrich your own spiritual life at present.</p>
<p>	(10 April 1939)</p>
<p>	489. These standards of Baha'i conduct, which he himself has set 
forth in his last general epistle, "The Advent of Divine Justice", and 
which it should be the paramount duty of every loyal and conscientious 
believer to endeavour to uphold and promote, deserve serious study and 
meditation. . .</p>
<p>	The principles and methods laid down by the Guardian in his "Advent 
of Divine Justice" on the vital subject of Baha'i ethics should indeed 
prove of valuable inspiration and guidance to all the students and 
friends attending the Summer School classes, and thus prepare them to 
better appreciate the privileges, and more adequately discharge the 
responsibilities, of their citizenship in the World Order of 
Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(20 May 1939)</p>
<p>	490. Surely, the believers, no matter how qualified they may be, 
whether as teachers or administrators, and however high their 
intellectual and spiritual merits, should never be looked upon as a 
standard whereby to evaluate and measure the divine authority and 
mission of the Faith. It is to the Teachings themselves, and to the 
lives of the Founders of the Cause that the believers should look for 
their guidance and inspiration, and only by keeping strictly to such [a]
 true attitude can they hope to establish their loyalty to Baha'u'llah 
upon an enduring and unassailable basis. You should take heart, 
therefore, and with unrelaxing vigilance and<br>
 unremitting effort endeavour to play your full share in the gradual unfoldment of this Divine World Order.</p>
<p>	(23 August 1939)</p>
<p>	491. His advice to you is to continue deepening your knowledge and 
understanding of this Revelation, both by means of patient and thorough 
study of Baha'i writings, and through active association with your 
fellow-believers and close participation in the activities of your local
 Baha'i community.</p>
<p>	(12 February 1940)</p>
<p>	492. The responsibility of young believers is very great, as they 
must not only fit themselves to inherit the work of the older Baha'is 
and carry on the affairs of the Cause in general, but the world which 
lies ahead of them -- as promised by Baha'u'llah -- will be a world 
chastened by its sufferings, ready to listen to His Divine Message at 
last; and consequently a very high character will be expected of the 
exponents of such a religion. To deepen their knowledge, to perfect 
themselves in the Baha'i standards of virtue and upright conduct, should
 be the paramount duty of every young Baha'i.</p>
<p>	(6 June 1941 to the Baha'i Youth of Bombay)</p>
<p>	493. You Baha'i children and young people have both great privileges
 and great obligations ahead of you, for your generation will be the 
ones to help build up a new, better and more beautiful world after the 
dark years of this war are passed. You should prepare yourselves for 
this great task by trying to grasp the true meaning of the teachings and
 not just merely accepting them as something you are taught. They are 
like a wonderful new world of thought just beginning to be explored, and
 when we realize that Baha'u'llah has brought teachings and laws for a 
thousand years to come, we can readily see that each new generation may 
find some greater meaning in the writings than the ones gone before did.</p>
<p>	(14 October 1942 to the Children of Stanley Bolton)</p>
<p>	494. Regarding your question concerning your studies: as this is a 
purely personal matter that concerns your own future, the Guardian feels
 you should decide it yourself, in consultation with your parents. He 
urges you,<br>
 however, to devote yourself as much as possible to studying and 
spreading the Baha'i teachings, whatever your other occupations may be.</p>
<p>	(26 May 1943)</p>
<p>	495. The Cause needs more Baha'i scholars, people who not only are 
devoted to it and believe in it and are anxious to tell others about it,
 but also who have a deep grasp of the Teachings and their significance,
 and who can correlate its beliefs with the current thoughts and 
problems of the people of the world.</p>
<p>	The Cause has the remedy for all the world's ills. The reason why 
more people don't accept it is because the Baha'is are not always 
capable of presenting it to them in a way that meets the immediate needs
 of their minds. Young Baha'is like yourself must prepare themselves to 
really bring the Message to their generation, who need it so desperately
 and who can understand the language it speaks so well. He would advise 
you among other books to study the Talks of 'Abdu'l-Baha, as His method 
of approaching the mind of the public cannot be surpassed...</p>
<p>	(21 October 1943)</p>
<p>	496. The Guardian hopes that along with whatever other studies you 
take up, you will continually study the teachings and endeavour to 
acquire a profound knowledge of them. The importance of young Baha'is 
becoming thoroughly steeped in every branch of the teachings cannot be 
overemphasized, as they have great teaching tasks ahead of them to 
accomplish.</p>
<p>	(22 January 1944)</p>
<p>	497. Young men and women in the Faith must be deep and thoughtful 
scholars of its teachings, so that they can teach in a way that will 
convince people that all the problems facing them have a remedy. They 
must grasp the Administration, so that they can wisely and efficiently 
administer the ever-growing affairs of the Cause; and they must 
exemplify the Baha'i way of living. All this is not easy -- but the 
Guardian is always encouraged to see the spirit animating such young 
believers as yourself. He has high hopes of what your generation will 
accomplish.</p>
<p>	(12 May 1944)<br>

</p><p>	498. He feels that in your contact with the believers and in 
teaching new souls, you should help them to obtain a full knowledge and 
understanding of the Covenant and the Will and Testament. This will 
strengthen them to meet every test, and to understand the nature of the 
spiritual disease which afflicts those who turn against the Institutions
 of the Faith. These are, indeed, times of testing and of trial, for the
 whole world and for the believers too.</p>
<p>	(15 August 1945)</p>
<p>	499. He quite agrees with you that the Baha'is need deepening in the
 teachings -- a course of adult education would be excellent if it could
 be carried out and the friends would participate. The principles, 
administration and fundamentals of the Faith are well known, but the 
friends need greatly to study the more profound works, which would give 
them spiritual maturity to a greater degree, unify their Community life,
 and enable them to better exemplify the Baha'i way of living; in other 
words to "lead the life".</p>
<p>	(24 February 1946)</p>
<p>	500. By promoting the vital interests of the Faith's institutions 
the Guardian means, amongst other things, that we should help our 
Assemblies by electing wise and capable members, upholding their 
decisions, making suggestions for the work at Feasts, and consulting 
properly on the affairs of the Cause; contributing to the Fund; 
deepening our knowledge of the administrative order, etc.</p>
<p>	(18 March 1946)</p>
<p>	501. The Guardian feels that a sound knowledge of history, including
 religious history, and also of social and economic subjects, is of 
great help in teaching the Cause to intelligent people; as to what 
subjects within the Faith you should concentrate on he feels that the 
young Baha'is should gain a mastery of such books as the "Gleanings", 
"The Dawn- Breakers", "God Passes By", the "Iqan", "Some Answered 
Questions" and the more important Tablets. All aspects of the Faith 
should be deeply studied...</p>
<p>	(4 May 1946)<br>

</p><p>	502. There is no objection to the friends memorizing prayers; on the contrary it is excellent for them to do so.</p>
<p>	(6 September 1946)</p>
<p>	503. Great tasks remain ahead: not only must the work the Master, in
 His mercy, gave to the North American friends to do, be accomplished, 
but a deeper spirit of love and unity must be cultivated by the 
believers within their own communities. The friends themselves are still
 in many ways spiritually immature; they must study the Teachings more 
profoundly, and learn to function as truly mature souls in all their 
relationships, both within the Cause and with their fellow men.</p>
<p>	(5 February 1947 to the Baha'is of Teaneck, New Jersey)</p>
<p>	504. He feels that many of the perplexities that arise in your mind 
could be dissipated if you always conceived of the teachings as one 
great whole with many facets. Truth may, in covering different subjects,
 appear to be contradictory, and yet it is all one if you carry the 
thought through to the end....</p>
<p>	He hopes you will ... rest assured inwardly that for these things 
which sometimes seem difficult to understand there is usually a quite 
simple and reasonable explanation....</p>
<p>	(24 February 1947)</p>
<p>	505. By "verities of the Faith" he means the great teachings and 
fundamentals enshrined in our Baha'i literature; these we can find by 
reading the books, studying under Baha'i scholars at summer schools and 
in classes, and through the aid of study outlines.</p>
<p>	(19 April 1947)</p>
<p>	506. Shoghi Effendi has for years urged the Baha'is (who asked his 
advice, and in general also) to study history, economics, sociology, 
etc., in order to be au courant with all the progressive movements and 
thoughts being put forth today, and so that they could correlate these 
to the Baha'i teachings. What he wants the Baha'is to do is to study 
more, not to study less. The more general knowledge, scientific and 
otherwise, they possess, the better. Likewise he is constantly urging 
them to really study the Baha'i<br>
 teachings more deeply. One might liken Baha'u'llah's teachings to a 
sphere; there are points poles apart, and in between the thoughts and 
doctrines that unite them....</p>
<p>	(5 July 1947)</p>
<p>	507. ...He is indeed pleased to know that the book of "Prayers and 
Meditations" by Baha'u'llah has been out in time to enable the friends 
to read it during the Fast, and he has every hope that the perusal of 
such a precious volume will help to deepen, more than any other 
publication, the spirit of devotion and faith in the friends, and thus 
charge them with all the spiritual power they require for the 
accomplishment of their tremendous duties towards the Cause....</p>
<p>	(Published in "Baha'i News" 212 (October 1948), p. 1)</p>
<p>	508. He feels that what the German Baha'is need -- and must have -- 
more than anything else in the world is a far deeper understanding of 
the Covenants of both Baha'u'llah and the Master. This is the 
rock-foundation without which no sound superstructure can be built. 
Neither the administration, nor the general teaching work of the Cause 
in Germany, will progress, or be able to accomplish anything, unless the
 believers are truly firm, deep, spiritually convinced Baha'is. An 
intellectual grasp of the Teachings is purely superficial; with the 
first real test such believers are shaken from the bough! But once a 
Baha'i has the profound conviction of the authority from God, vested in 
the Prophet, passed on to the Master, and by Him, to the Guardians, and 
which flows out through the Assemblies and creates order based on 
obedience -- once a Baha'i has this, nothing can shake him....</p>
<p>	(11 April 1949)</p>
<p>	509. As he has cabled the N.S.A. a few days ago, he feels that the 
difficulties which have arisen ... are mainly due to the fact that the 
believers need to be deepened in their knowledge and appreciation of the
 Covenants of both Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha. This is the stronghold 
of the faith of every Baha'i, and that which enables him to withstand 
every test and the attacks of the enemies outside the Faith, and the far
 more dangerous, insidious, lukewarm people inside the Faith who have no
 real attachment to the Covenant, and consequently uphold the 
intellectual aspect of the<br>
 teachings while at the same time undermining the spiritual foundation upon which the whole Cause of God rests.</p>
<p>	(15 April 1949)</p>
<p>	510. It seems what we need now is a more profound and co- ordinated 
Baha'i scholarship in order to attract such men as you are contacting. 
The world has -- at least the thinking world -- caught up by now with 
all the great and universal principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah over 70
 years ago, and so of course it does not sound "new" to them. But we 
know that the deeper teachings, the capacity of His projected World 
Order to re-create society, are new and dynamic. It is these we must 
learn to present intelligently and enticingly to such men!</p>
<p>	(3 July 1949)</p>
<p>	511. If the Baha'is want to be really effective in teaching the 
Cause they need to be much better informed and able to discuss 
intelligently, intellectually, the present condition of the world and 
its problems. We need Baha'i scholars, not only people far, far more 
deeply aware of what our teachings really are, but also well-read and 
well-educated people, capable of correlating our teachings to the 
current thoughts of the leaders of society. We Baha'is should, in other 
words, arm our minds with knowledge in order to better demonstrate to, 
especially, the educated classes, the truths enshrined in our Faith....</p>
<p>	(5 July 1949)</p>
<p>	512. He was grieved to hear of some of the things you describe. It 
shows great spiritual immaturity on the part of some of the Baha'is and 
an astonishing lack of understanding and study of the teachings....</p>
<p>	You must not make the great mistake of judging our Faith by one 
community which obviously needs to study and obey the Baha' i teachings.
 Human frailties and peculiarities can be a great test. But the only 
way, or perhaps I should say the first and best way, to remedy such 
situations, is to oneself do what is right. One soul can be the cause of
 the spiritual illumination of a continent. Now that you have seen, and 
remedied, a great fault in your own life, now that you see more clearly 
what is lacking<br>
 in your own community, there is nothing to prevent you from arising and
 showing such an example, such a love and spirit of service, as to 
enkindle the hearts of your fellow Baha'is. He urges you to study deeply
 the teachings, teach others, study with those Baha'is who are anxious 
to do so, the deeper teachings of our Faith, and through example, effort
 and prayer, bring about a change.</p>
<p>	(30 September 1949)</p>
<p>	513. Mature teachers are needed in so many places. Unfortunately 
there are not enough of them to go around and do all the work waiting to
 be done! That is why it is so important for the new European Baha'is, 
like yourself, to study deeply the teachings and qualify themselves to 
take over the work begun by their American brothers and sisters, in 
order to release these pioneers for work in places where the need is 
greater. Just one mature soul, with spiritual understanding and a 
profound knowledge of the Faith, can set a whole country ablaze -- so 
great is the power of the Cause to work through a pure and selfless 
channel.</p>
<p>	(6 November 1949)</p>
<p>	514. ...whilst actively teaching, the friends must themselves be 
taught and deepened in the spirit of the Faith, which brings love and 
unity.</p>
<p>	(17 July 1951)</p>
<p>	515. He was very pleased to hear you do a lot of lecturing for the 
Cause; this is a very important field of service and one you should 
devote as much time to as possible. The public must hear of the Faith, 
and new ways and means must be devised to bring it to their attention. 
He also urges you to study the teachings themselves deeper. Baha'i 
scholarship is needed really more than worldly scholarship, for one is 
spiritual, the other more or less transient. There is a real lack in the
 Cause of people who know the Teachings thoroughly, especially their 
deeper truths, and who can consequently teach the souls properly and lay
 a permanent foundation, one that tests and trials will not shake down.</p>
<p>	(27 August 1951)</p>
<p>	516. When a person becomes a Baha'i, actually what takes place is 
that the seed of the spirit starts to grow in the human soul. This seed 
must be<br>
 watered by the outpourings of the Holy Spirit. These gifts of the 
spirit are received through prayer, meditation, study of the Holy 
Utterances and service to the Cause of God.... Naturally there will be 
periods of distress and difficulty, and even severe tests, but if that 
person turns firmly toward the divine Manifestation, studies carefully 
His spiritual teachings and receives the blessings of the Holy Spirit, 
he will find that in reality these tests and difficulties have been the 
gifts of God to enable him to grow and develop.</p>
<p>	(6 October 1954)</p>
<p>	517. It is better to have one Baha'i who understands the Teachings 
and is wholeheartedly convinced of their truth, than a number of 
Baha'is, who are not well aware of the Cause, and deep-rooted in the 
Covenant.</p>
<p>	(22 January 1955)</p>
<p>	518. He is very happy to have this opportunity of welcoming you into
 the service of our glorious Faith, and he urges you to quietly and 
steadily read the Teachings, as in this way you will fit yourself to 
teach others, and also deepen your own understanding and lay a 
foundation in your own soul and character which no amount of tests and 
trials can change or destroy.</p>
<p>	(28 April 1955)</p>
<p>	519. Success will crown the efforts of the Friends on the home 
front, when they meditate on the teachings, pray fervently for divine 
confirmations for their work, study the teachings so they may carry 
their spirit to the seeker, and then act, and above all persevere in 
action. When these steps are followed, and the teaching work carried on 
sacrificially and with devoted enthusiasm, the Faith will spread 
rapidly.</p>
<p>	(11 March 1956)</p>
<p>	520. There is a desperate need for deepening the Baha'is themselves 
in their own faith. They do not study the Teachings enough. They do not 
therefore either act as whole- heartedly as Baha'is as they should, or 
derive the spiritual strength from the Faith which studying, praying and
 meditating brings.</p>
<p>	(26 March 1956)<br>

</p><p>	521. Some of the younger believers, from letters and reports 
received here, seem to lack a firm grounding on such matters as the Will
 and Testament and the deeper spiritual teachings of the Faith. Whenever
 the grasp of these fundamentals is weak, the friends are almost sure to
 pay undue attention to secondary procedures, to quibble over details, 
to lose themselves in personalities, and to founder in a sea of 
unnecessary inharmony. This has nothing to do with their devotion, their
 loyalty, their zeal, their eagerness to serve. It is merely a question 
of not having received, perhaps through lack of sufficient teachers to 
carry on the all-important work of deepening the friends in their own 
faith, a strong enough education in the Covenant before the duties and 
responsibilities of the Administrative Order were thrust upon them.</p>
<p>	(26 June 1956 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)</p>
<p>	522. It is evident that one of the reasons that the work on the home
 front in America is so seriously lagging is that the Baha'is 
themselves, though undoubtedly devoted, loyal and conscientious, are not
 always very deeply grounded in the spiritual fundamentals of their 
Faith. This produces a maladjustment, so to speak, in the nature of 
their service to the Cause; and only through a deeper understanding of 
their Faith and the inner spiritual strength that this understanding 
brings will they be able to reinforce themselves to meet their tasks, to
 see the joy of discharging their duties and grasping their privileges.</p>
<p>	(19 July 1956 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	523. The friends need only read the Writings; the answers are all in
 them; we have no priests in this Faith to interpret or answer for us.</p>
<p>	(23 April 1957)</p>
<p>	524. It is not enough to bring people into the Faith, one must 
educate them and deepen their love for it and their knowledge of its 
teachings, after they declare themselves. As the Baha'is are few in 
number, especially the active teachers, and there is a great deal of 
work to be done, the education of these new believers is often sadly 
neglected, and then results are seen such as the resignations you have 
had recently. In this respect, the summer schools can be of the greatest
 help to the friends, new and old Baha'is alike, for in them they can 
study, and enjoy the feeling of<br>
 Baha'i companionship which is, alas, usually lacking in their home communities, owing to the smallness of their numbers.</p>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE BAHA'I TEACHINGS DISCOURAGING DIVORCE</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	525. God doth verily love union and concord, and abhorreth separation and divorce.</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Aqdas" - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	526. At all times hath union and association been well- pleasing in 
the sight of God, and separation and dissension abhorred. Hold fast unto
 that which God loveth and is His command unto you. He, verily, is the 
All-Knowing and the All-Seeing, and He is the All-Wise Ordainer.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	527. God, exalted be His glory, disliketh divorce...</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	528. Thou hast asked about affection and reconciliation, in the case
 of Mirza .... This matter was mentioned in the Holy Presence. This is 
what the tongue of our All-Merciful Lord uttered in response: "This is 
regarded with favour and is well-pleasing. After man's recognition of 
God, and becoming steadfast in His Cause, the station of affection, of 
harmony, of concord and of unity is superior to that of most other 
goodly deeds. This is what He Who is the Desire of the world hath 
testified at every morn and eve. God grant that ye may follow that which
 hath been revealed in the Kitab-i- Aqdas."</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	529. O ye two believers in God! The Lord, peerless is He, hath made 
woman and man to abide with each other in the closest companionship, and
 to be even as a single soul. They are two helpmates, two intimate 
friends, who should be concerned about the welfare of each other. If 
they live thus, they will pass through this world with perfect 
contentment, bliss, and peace of heart, and become the object of divine<br>
 grace and favour in the Kingdom of heaven. But if they do other than 
this, they will live out their lives in great bitterness, longing at 
every moment for death, and will be shamefaced in the heavenly realm. 
Strive, then, to abide, heart and soul, with each other as two doves in 
the nest, for this is to be blessed in both worlds.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 92, p. 122)</p>
<p>	530. Formerly in Persia divorce was very easily obtained. Among the 
people of the past Dispensation a trifling matter would cause divorce. 
However, as the light of the Kingdom shone forth, souls were quickened 
by the spirit of Baha'u'llah, then they totally eschewed divorce. In 
Persia now divorce doth not take place among the friends, unless a 
compelling reason existeth which makes harmony impossible. Under such 
rare circumstances some cases of divorce take place.</p>
<p>	Now the friends in America must live and conduct themselves in this 
way. They must strictly refrain from divorce unless something ariseth 
which compelleth them to separate because of their aversion for each 
other, in that case with the knowledge of the Spiritual Assembly they 
may decide to separate. They must then be patient and wait one complete 
year. If during this year, harmony is not re- established between them, 
then their divorce may be realized. It should not happen that upon the 
occurrence of a slight friction or displeasure between husband and wife,
 the husband would think of union with some other woman, or, God forbid,
 the wife also think of another husband. This is contrary to the 
standard of heavenly value and true chastity. The friends of God must so
 live and conduct themselves, and evince such excellence of and conduct,
 as to make others astonished. The love between husband and wife should 
not be purely physical, nay, rather it must be spiritual and heavenly. 
These two souls should be considered as one soul. How difficult it would
 be to divide a single soul! Nay, great would be the difficulty!</p>
<p>	In short, the foundation of the Kingdom of God is based upon harmony
 and love, oneness, relationship and union, not upon differences, 
especially between husband and wife. If one of these two becomes the 
cause of divorce, that one will unquestionably fall into great<br>
 difficulties, will become the victim of formidable calamities and experience deep remorse. Upon you be the glory of Abha!</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	From the writings of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	531. The recrudescence of religious intolerance, of racial 
animosity, and of patriotic arrogance; the increasing evidences of 
selfishness, of suspicion, of fear and of fraud; the spread of 
terrorism, of lawlessness, of drunkenness and of crime; the unquenchable
 thirst for, and the feverish pursuit after, earthly vanities, riches 
and pleasures; the weakening of family solidarity; the laxity in 
parental control; the lapse into luxurious indulgence; the irresponsible
 attitude towards marriage and the consequent rising tide of divorce; 
the degeneracy of art and music, the infection of literature, and the 
corruption of the press; the extension of the influence and activities 
of those "prophets of decadence" who advocate companionate marriage, who
 preach the philosophy of nudism, who call modesty an intellectual 
fiction, who refuse to regard the procreation of children as the sacred 
and primary purpose of marriage, who denounce religion as an opiate of 
the people, who would, if given free rein, lead back the human race to 
barbarism, chaos, and ultimate extinction -- these appear as the 
outstanding characteristics of a decadent society, a society that must 
either be reborn or perish.</p>
<p>	("The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters" rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 187-88)</p>
<p>	532. Not only must irreligion and its monstrous offspring, the 
triple curse that oppresses the soul of mankind in this day, be held 
responsible for the ills which are so tragically besetting it, but other
 evils and vices, which are, for the most part, the direct consequences 
of the "weakening of the pillars of religion," must also be regarded as 
contributory factors to the manifold guilt of which individuals and 
nations stand convicted. The signs of moral downfall, consequent to the 
dethronement of religion and the enthronement of these usurping idols, 
are too numerous and too patent for even a superficial observer of the 
state of present-day society to fail to notice. The spread of 
lawlessness, of drunkenness, of gambling, and of crime; the inordinate 
love of pleasure, of riches, and other earthly<br>
 vanities; the laxity in morals, revealing itself in the irresponsible 
attitude towards marriage, in the weakening of parental control, in the 
rising tide of divorce, in the deterioration in the standard of 
literature and of the press, and in the advocacy of theories that are 
the very negation of purity, of morality and chastity -- these evidences
 of moral decadence, invading both the East and the West, permeating 
every stratum of society, and instilling their poison in its members of 
both sexes, young and old alike, blacken still further the scroll upon 
which are inscribed the manifold transgressions of an unrepentant 
humanity.</p>
<p>	("The Promised Day is Come", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), pp. 114-15)</p>
<p>	From letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	533. On behalf of the Guardian I wish to acknowledge the receipt of 
your letter dated December 15th, and to express his sorrow at the 
disharmony existing between you and your husband. He is the more grieved
 to learn that the situation has reached such a state as to compel you 
to ask for separation from Mr.... -- a step which, though legally valid 
from the standpoint of the Cause, is nevertheless most sad and painful 
to you and to those concerned. The Guardian, however, appreciates the 
fact that, in conformity with the Teachings, you have laid the matter 
before the Local Spiritual Assembly. He sincerely hopes that under the 
guidance of that body, and through your own efforts as well, conditions 
between you and your husband will gradually improve, and that you will 
not feel it necessary to ask for divorce after the one year period of 
separation has been terminated.</p>
<p>	He is fervently en treating Baha'u'llah that He may guide you and 
Mr. Clark in solving this most delicate problem of your life, and that 
the solution reached may be such as to bring peace and satisfaction to 
your heart, and thus bring happiness to you, and also protection to the 
Cause whose interests you have so devotedly served for many years.</p>
<p>	(14 January 1936 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	534. Regarding the Baha'i teachings on divorce. While the latter has
 been made permissible by Baha'u'llah yet he has strongly discouraged 
its<br>
 practice, for if not checked and seriously controlled it leads 
gradually to the disruption of family life and to the disintegration of 
society....</p>
<p>	(16 November 1936 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	535. Regarding divorce, the Guardian stated that it is discouraged, 
deprecated and against the good pleasure of God. The Assembly must 
circulate among the friends whatever has been revealed from the Pen of 
'Abdu'l-Baha in this connection so that all may be fully reminded. 
Divorce is conditional upon the approval and permission of the Spiritual
 Assembly. The members of the Assembly must in such matters 
independently and carefully study and investigate each case. If there 
should be valid grounds for divorce and it is found that reconciliation 
is utterly impossible, that antipathy is intense and its removal is not 
possible, then the Assembly may approve the divorce.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	536. While he wishes me to assure you that he will pray for the 
solution of your domestic troubles, he would urge you to endeavour, by 
every means in your power, to compose your differences, and not to allow
 them to reach such proportions as to lead to your complete and final 
separation from your husband.</p>
<p>	For while, according to the Baha'i law, divorce is permissible, yet 
it is highly discouraged, and should be resorted to only when every 
effort to prevent it has proved to be vain and ineffective.</p>
<p>	It is for you, and for Mr.... as well, to ponder carefully over the 
spiritual implications which any act of divorce on either part would 
involve, and strengthened by the power of faith and confident in the 
blessings which strict adherence to the principles and laws of 
Baha'u'llah is bound to confer upon every one of His faithful followers,
 to make a fresh resolve to solve your common difficulties and to 
restore the harmony, peace and happiness of your family life.</p>
<p>	(11 September 1938 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	537. The situation facing you is admittedly difficult and delicate, 
but no less grave and indeed vital are the responsibilities which it 
entails and which, as a faithful and loyal believer, you should 
conscientiously and<br>
 thoroughly assume. The Guardian, therefore, while fully alive to the 
special circumstances of your case, and however profound his sympathy 
may be for you in this challenging issue with which you are so sadly 
faced, cannot, in view of the emphatic injunctions contained in the 
Teachings, either sanction your demand to contract a second marriage 
while your first wife is still alive and is united with you in the 
sacred bonds of matrimony, or even suggest or approve that you divorce 
her just in order to be permitted to marry a new one.</p>
<p>	For the Baha'i Teachings do not only preclude the possibility of 
bigamy, but also, while permitting divorce, consider it a reprehensible 
act, which should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances, and 
when grave issues are involved, transcending such considerations as 
physical attraction or sexual compatibility and harmony. The institution
 of marriage, as established by Baha'u'llah, while giving due importance
 to the physical aspect of marital union, considers it as subordinate to
 the moral and spiritual purposes and functions with which it has been 
invested by an all-wise and loving Providence. Only when these different
 values are given each their due importance, and only on the basis of 
the subordination of the physical to the moral, and the carnal to the 
spiritual can such excesses and laxity in marital relations as our 
decadent age is so sadly witnessing be avoided, and family life be 
restored to its original purity, and fulfil the true function for which 
it has been instituted by God.</p>
<p>	The Guardian will most fervently pray that, inspired and guided by 
such a divine standard, and strengthened by Baha'u'llah's unfailing 
assistance and confirmations, you may be able to satisfactorily adjust 
your relations with the persons concerned, and thus reach the one right 
solution to this assuredly challenging problem of your life.</p>
<p>	(8 May 1939 to an individual believer who, having married his first 
wife out of compassion, now wished to be permitted to marry a woman with
 whom he had fallen in love, saying that his wife was agreeable to his 
taking this second wife.)</p>
<p>	538. As regards the action you contemplate in seeking divorce from 
him: He leaves the final decision in this matter to you and your 
husband, though of course, from the standpoint of the Cause, he thinks 
it preferable for you both not to resort to such drastic action, unless 
it is absolutely unavoidable.</p>
<p>	(24 February 1940 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	539. Marriage is, in the "Aqdas", set forth as a most sacred and
 binding tie, and the Baha'is should realize that divorce is viewed as a
 last resort, to be avoided at all costs if possible and not to be 
lightly granted.</p>
<p>	(17 October 1944 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	540. Marriage is viewed by Baha'u'llah as a very sacred tie which 
should under no circumstances be severed unless the reasons are very 
grave. He hopes and will pray that you and your wife, as believers, will
 reconsider this matter and do your utmost to live together in the 
service of the Cause you both love so dearly.</p>
<p>	(17 October 1944 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	541. He was very sorry to hear that you and your husband are still 
so unhappy together. It is always a source of sorrow in life when 
married people cannot get on well together, but the Guardian feels that 
you and your husband, in contemplating divorce, should think of the 
future of your children and how this major step on your part will 
influence their lives and happiness. If you feel the need of advice and 
consultation he suggests you consult your Local Assembly; your fellow 
Baha'is will surely do all they can to counsel and help you, protect 
your interests and those of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(16 November 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	542. Shoghi Effendi wishes me to add this note in connection with 
your marriage: he does not feel that any believer, under any 
circumstances whatsoever, can ever use the Cause or service to it as a 
reason for abandoning their marriage; divorce, as we know, is very 
strongly condemned by Baha'u'llah, and only grounds of extreme gravity 
justify it....</p>
<p>	(7 April 1947 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	543. As Baha'u'llah was so very much against divorce (even though He
 permits it) and considered marriage a most sacred responsibility, 
believers should do everything in their power to preserve the marriages 
they have contracted, and to make of them exemplary unions, governed by 
the noblest motives.</p>
<p>	(19 October 1947 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	544. Baha'u'llah has clearly stated the consent of all living 
parents is required for a Baha'i marriage. This applies whether the 
parents are Baha'is or non-Baha'is, divorced for years or not. This 
great law He has laid down to strengthen the social fabric, to knit 
closer the ties of the home, to place a certain gratitude and respect in
 the hearts of children for those who have given them life and sent 
their souls out on the eternal journey towards their Creator. We Baha'is
 must realize that in present-day society the exact opposite process is 
taking place: young people care less and less for their parents' wishes,
 divorce is considered a natural right, and obtained on the flimsiest 
and most unwarrantable and shabby pretexts. People separated from each 
other, especially if one of them has had full custody of the children, 
are only too willing to belittle the importance of the partner in 
marriage also responsible as a parent for bringing those children into 
this world. The Baha'is must, through rigid adherence to the Baha'i laws
 and teachings, combat these corrosive forces which are so rapidly 
destroying home life and the beauty of family relationships, and tearing
 down the moral structure of society.</p>
<p>	(25 October 1947 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	545. He wishes me to tell you that he regrets extremely the sorrow 
that has come into your life, and that he agrees with all you have 
stated in general on the subject of divorce. There is no doubt about it 
that the believers in America, probably unconsciously influenced by the 
extremely lax morals prevalent and the flippant attitude towards divorce
 which seems to be increasingly prevailing, do not take divorce 
seriously enough and do not seem to grasp the fact that although 
Baha'u'llah has permitted it, He has only permitted it as a last resort 
and strongly condemns it. The presence of children, as a factor in 
divorce, cannot be ignored, for surely it places an even greater weight 
of moral responsibility on the man and wife in considering such a step. 
Divorce under such circumstances no longer just concerns them and their 
desires and feelings but also concerns the children's entire future and 
their own attitude towards marriage.</p>
<p>	(19 December 1947 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	546. Divorce should be avoided most strictly by the believers, 
and only under rare and urgent circumstances be resorted to. Modern 
society is criminally lax as to the sacred nature of marriage, and the 
believers must combat this trend assiduously.</p>
<p>	(5 January 1948 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	547. He will pray for your husband and son and your daughter-in-law,
 that, through drawing near to Baha'u'llah, they may be united and 
uplifted into a happier and more harmonious atmosphere, for the Cause 
can heal friction if people will let it and make the effort themselves 
as well.</p>
<p>	(11 June 1948 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	548. He was very sorry to hear that you are contemplating separation
 from your husband. As you no doubt know, Baha'u'llah considers the 
marriage bond very sacred; and only under very exceptional and 
unbearable circumstances is divorce advisable for Baha'is. The Guardian 
does not tell you that you must not divorce your husband; but he does 
urge you to consider prayerfully, not only because you are a believer 
and anxious to obey the laws of God, but also for the sake of the 
happiness of your children, whether it is not possible for you to rise 
above the limitations you have felt in your marriage hitherto, and make a
 go of it together. We often feel that our happiness lies in a certain 
direction; and yet, if we have to pay too heavy a price for it in the 
end we may discover that we have not really purchased either freedom or 
happiness, but just some new situation of frustration and disillusion.</p>
<p>	(5 April 1951 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	549. As regards the problem of your marriage, you are free to refer 
this to the National Spiritual Assembly. As both you and your wife know,
 however, Baha'u'llah was not in favour of divorce, and the friends 
should make every effort to avoid bringing it about. If it is absolutely
 impossible, they then are free to divorce, but they should bear in mind
 the will of God in such matters.</p>
<p>	(13 March 1953 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	550. He has been very sorry to hear that your marriage seems to 
have failed utterly. I need not tell you as a Baha'i that every effort 
should be made by any Baha'i to salvage their marriage for the sake of 
God, rather than for their own sake. In the case of pioneers, it is even
 more important, because they are before the public eye. However, in 
such matters it is neither befitting nor right that the Guardian should 
bring pressure on individuals. He can only appeal to you and...to try 
again; but if you cannot rise to this test, that is naturally a personal
 matter.</p>
<p>	(13 January 1956 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	551. Wherever there is a Baha'i family, those concerned should by 
all means do all they can to preserve it, because divorce is strongly 
condemned in the Teachings, whereas harmony, unity and love are held up 
as the highest ideals in human relationships. This must always apply to 
the Baha'is, whether they are serving in the pioneering field or not.</p>

</p><p>	A COMPILATION ON BAHA'I EDUCATION COMPILED BY THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE</p>
<p>	BAHA'I WORLD CENTRE</p>
<p>	AUGUST 1976</p>
<p>	The newly born babe of that Day excels the wisest and most venerable
 men of this time, and the lowliest and most unlearned of that period 
shall surpass in understanding the most erudite and accomplished divines
 of this age....</p>
<p>	(The Bab, quoted in "The Dawn-Breakers: Nabil's Narrative of the 
Early Days of the Baha'i Revelation" trans. and ed. Shoghi Effendi. 
(London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1975), p. 65)</p>
<p>	I. FROM THE WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH:</p>
<p>	552. The Prophets and Messengers of God have been sent down for the 
sole purpose of guiding mankind to the straight Path of Truth. The 
purpose underlying their revelation hath been to educate all men, that 
they may, at the hour of death, ascend, in the utmost purity and 
sanctity and with absolute detachment, to the throne of the Most 
High....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah" rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), Sec. 81, pp. 156-7)</p>
<p>	553. We have decreed, O people, that the highest and last end of all
 learning be the recognition of Him Who is the Object of all 
knowledge...</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", Sec. 98, p. 199)</p>
<p>	554. Consider ... the revelation of the light of the Name of God, 
the Educator. Behold, how in all things the evidences of such a 
revelation are manifest, how the betterment of all beings dependeth upon
 it. This education is of two kinds. The one is universal. Its influence
 pervadeth all things and sustaineth them. It is for this reason that 
God hath assumed<br>
 the title, "Lord of all worlds". The other is confined to them that 
have come under the shadow of this Name, and sought the shelter of this 
most mighty Revelation. They, however, that have failed to seek this 
shelter, have deprived themselves of this privilege, and are powerless 
to benefit from the spiritual sustenance that hath been sent down 
through the heavenly grace of this Most Great Name. How great the gulf 
fixed between the one and the other!...</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", Sec. 93, pp. 189-90)</p>
<p>	555. Man is the supreme Talisman. Lack of a proper education hath, 
however, deprived him of that which he doth inherently possess. Through a
 word proceeding out of the mouth of God he was called into being; by 
one word more he was guided to recognize the Source of his education; by
 yet another word his station and destiny were safeguarded. The Great 
Being saith: Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. 
Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable 
mankind to benefit therefrom....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", Sec. 122, pp. 259-60)</p>
<p>	556. Bend your minds and wills to the education of the peoples and 
kindreds of the earth, that haply the dissensions that divide it may, 
through the power of the Most Great Name, be blotted out from its face, 
and all mankind become the upholders of one Order, and the inhabitants 
of one City....</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", Sec. 154, pp. 333-4)</p>
<p>	557. We prescribe unto all men that which will lead to the 
exaltation of the Word of God amongst His servants, and likewise, to the
 advancement of the world of being and the uplift of souls. To this end,
 the greatest means is education of the child. To this must each and all
 hold fast. We have verily laid this charge upon you in manifold Tablets
 as well as in My Most Holy Book. Well is it with him who deferreth 
thereto. We ask of God that He will assist each and every one to obey 
this inescapable command that hath appeared and been caused to descend 
through the Pen of the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	558. Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his
 son and daughter in the art of reading and writing and in all that hath
 been laid down in the Holy Tablet. He that putteth away that which is 
commanded unto him, the Trustees are then to take from him that which is
 required for their instruction, if he be wealthy, and if not the matter
 devolveth upon the House of Justice. Verily, have We made it a shelter 
for the poor and needy. He that bringeth up his son or the son of 
another, it is as though he hath brought up a son of Mine; upon him rest
 My Glory, My loving kindness, My Mercy, that have compassed the world.</p>
<p>	("A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy 
Book Baha'u'llah", 1st ed. (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1973), pp. 
15-16)</p>
<p>	559. ...Everyone, whether man or woman, should hand over to a 
trusted person a portion of what he or she earneth through trade, 
agriculture or occupation, for training and education of children, to be
 spent for this purpose with the knowledge of the Trustees of the House 
of Justice.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p.90)</p>
<p>	560. Strain every nerve to acquire both inner and outer perfections,
 for the fruit of the human tree hath ever been and will ever be 
perfections both within and without. It is not desirable that a man be 
left without knowledge or skills, for he is then but a barren tree. 
Then, so much as capacity and capability allow, ye needs must deck the 
tree of being with fruits such as knowledge, wisdom, spiritual 
perception and eloquent speech.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	561. Man is even as steel, the essence of which is hidden: through 
admonition and explanation, good counsel and education, that essence 
will be brought to light. If, however, he be allowed to remain in his 
original condition, the corrosion of lusts and appetites will 
effectively destroy him.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	562. There are many things which will, if neglected, be wasted, and 
come to nothing. How often in this world do we see a child who has lost 
his parents and who, unless attention be devoted to his education and<br>
 training, can produce no fruit. And better off dead than alive is he who produceth no fruit.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the persian)</p>
<p>	563. It is the bounden duty of parents to rear their children to be 
staunch in faith, the reason being that a child who removeth himself 
from the religion of God will not act in such a way as to win the good 
pleasure of his parents and his Lord. For every praiseworthy deed is 
born out of the light of religion, and lacking this supreme bestowal the
 child will not turn away from any evil, nor will he draw nigh unto any 
good.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	564. The fear of God hath ever been the prime factor in the 
education of His creatures. Well is it with them that have attained 
thereunto!</p>
<p>	("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1979), p. 27)</p>
<p>	565. That which is of paramount importance for the children, that 
which must precede all else, is to teach them the oneness of God and the
 laws of God. For lacking this, the fear of God cannot be inculcated, 
and lacking the fear of God an infinity of odious and abominable actions
 will spring up, and sentiments will be uttered that transgress all 
bounds... parents must exert every effort to rear their offspring to be 
religious, for should the children not attain this greatest of 
adornments, they will not obey their parents, which in a certain sense 
means that they will not obey God. Indeed, such children will show no 
consideration to anyone, and will do exactly as they please.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	566. ...Schools must first train the children in the principles of 
religion, so that the Promise and the Threat recorded in the Books of 
God may prevent them from the things forbidden and adorn them with the 
mantle of the commandments; but this in such a measure that it may not 
injure the children by resulting in ignorant fanaticism and bigotry.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 68)<br>

</p><p>	567. ...Arts, crafts and sciences uplift the world of being, and
 are conducive to its exaltation. Knowledge is as wings to man's life, 
and a ladder for his ascent. Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone.
 The knowledge of such sciences, however, should be acquired as can 
profit the peoples of the earth, and not those which begin with words 
and end with words.... truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure for man,
 and a source of glory, of bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer and 
gladness unto him. Happy the man that cleaveth unto it, and woe betide 
the heedless.</p>
<p>	("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, pp. 26-27)</p>
<p>	568. ...The learned of the day must direct the people to acquire 
those branches of knowledge which are of use, that both the learned 
themselves and the generality of mankind may derive benefits therefrom. 
Such academic pursuits as begin and end in words alone have never been 
and will never be of any worth. The majority of Persia's learned doctors
 devote all their lives to the study of a philosophy the ultimate yield 
of which is nothing but words.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", p. 169)</p>
<p>	569. It is incumbent upon the children to exert themselves to the 
utmost in acquiring the art of reading and writing.... Writing skills 
that will provide for urgent needs will be enough for some; and then it 
is better and more fitting that they should spend their time in studying
 those branches of knowledge which are of use.</p>
<p>	As for what the Supreme Pen hath previously set down, the reason is 
that in every art and skill, God loveth the highest perfection.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	570. In the treasuries of the knowledge of God there lieth concealed
 a knowledge which, when applied, will largely, though not wholly, 
eliminate fear. This knowledge, however, should be taught from 
childhood, as it will greatly aid in its elimination....[1]<br>
 [1 Regarding this passage, an extract from a letter dated 5 January 
1948 written  on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer 
states: "Unfortunately it would seem that the knowledge 'which could 
largely eliminate fear' has not been disclosed or identified by 
Baha'u'llah; so we do not know what it  is'. This extract is also 
published in Baha'i News 210 (August 1948), p. 3.]</p>
<p>	("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf", p. 32)<br>

</p><p>	571. It beseemeth ... the ... officials of the Government to 
convene a gathering and choose one of the divers languages, and likewise
 one of the existing scripts, or else to create a new language and a new
 scripts or else to create a new language and a new script to be taught 
children in schools throughout the world. They would, in this way, be 
acquiring only two languages, one their own native tongue, the other the
 language in which all the peoples of the world would converse. Were men
 to take fast hold on that which hath been mentioned, the whole earth 
would come to be regarded as one country, and the people would be 
relieved and freed from the necessity of acquiring and teaching 
different languages....</p>
<p>	("Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 138)</p>
<p>	572. Teach ye your children the verses that have been divinely 
revealed, that they may recite them in most melodious voices. This is 
what hath been set down in His mighty Book.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	573. Teach your children that which hath been sent down from the 
heaven of majesty and power that they may recite the Tablets of the 
Merciful in the halls of the Mashriqu'l- Adhkars in most melodious 
tones....</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Aqdas" - provisional translation from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	574. At the outset of every endeavour, it is incumbent to look to 
the end of it. Of all the arts and sciences, set the children to 
studying those which will result in advantage to man, will ensure his 
progress and elevate his rank. Thus the noisome odours of lawlessness 
will be dispelled, and thus through the high endeavours of the nation's 
leaders, all will live cradled, secure and in peace.</p>
<p>	The Great Being saith: The man of consummate learning and the sage 
endowed with penetrating wisdom are the two eyes to the body of mankind.
 God willing, the earth shall never be deprived of these two greatest 
gifts....</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", pp. 168-71)</p>
<p>	575. As to the children: We have directed that in the beginning they
 should be trained in the observances and laws of religion; and 
thereafter,<br>
 in such branches of knowledge as are of benefit, and in commercial 
pursuits that are distinguished for integrity, and in deeds that will 
further the victory of God's Cause or will attract some outcome which 
will draw the believer closer to his Lord. We beg of God to assist the 
children of His loved ones and adorn them with wisdom, good conduct, 
integrity and righteousness. He, verily, is the Forgiving, the Clement.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	576. O Husayn! O thou Preceptor! From His Most Great Prison, the 
countenance of the Ancient of Days is turned towards thee, and He 
teacheth thee that which will draw thee nigh unto God, the Lord of 
mankind. Blessed is that teacher who shall arise to instruct the 
children, and to guide the people into the pathways of God, the 
Bestower, the Well-Beloved.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	577. Blessed is that teacher who remaineth faithful to the Covenant 
of God, and occupieth himself with the education of children. For him 
hath the Supreme Pen inscribed that reward which is revealed in the Most
 Holy Book. Blessed, blessed is he!</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	II. FROM THE WRITINGS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA:</p>
<p>	578. O God, O Thou Who hast cast Thy splendour over the luminous 
realities of men, shedding upon them the resplendent lights of knowledge
 and guidance, and hast chosen them out of all created things for this 
supernal grace, and hast caused them to encompass all things, to 
understand their inmost essence, and to disclose their mysteries, 
bringing them forth out of darkness into the visible world! "He verily 
showeth His special mercy to whomsoever He will."[1] O Lord, help Thou 
Thy loved ones to acquire knowledge and the sciences and arts, and to 
unravel the secrets that are treasured up in the<br>
 inmost reality of all created beings. Make them to hear the hidden 
truths that are written and embedded in the heart of all that is. Make 
them to be ensigns of guidance amongst all creatures, and piercing rays 
of the mind shedding forth their light in this, the "first life".[2] 
Make them to be leaders unto Thee, guides unto Thy path, runners urging 
men on to Thy Kingdom.<br>
 [1 Qur'an 3:67]<br>
 [2 Qur'an 56:62]</p>
<p>	Thou verily art the Powerful, the Protector, the Potent, the Defender, the Mighty, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>	O Company of God! To each created thing, the Ancient Sovereignty 
hath portioned out its own perfection, its particular virtue and special
 excellence, so that each in its degree may become a symbol denoting the
 sublimity of the true Educator of humankind, and that each, even as a 
crystalline mirror, may tell of the grace and splendour of the Sun of 
Truth.</p>
<p>	And from amongst all creatures He hath singled out man, to grant him
 His most wondrous gift, and hath made him to attain the bounties of the
 Company on High. That most precious of gifts is attainment unto His 
unfailing guidance, that the inner reality of humankind should become as
 a niche to hold this lamp; and when the scattering splendours of this 
light do beat against the bright glass of the heart, the heart's purity 
maketh the beams to blaze out even stronger than before, and to shine in
 glory on the minds and souls of men.</p>
<p>	The attainment of the most great guidance is dependent upon 
knowledge and wisdom, and on being informed as to the mysteries of the 
Holy Words. Wherefore must the loved ones of God, be they young or old, 
be they men or women, each one according to his capabilities, strive to 
acquire the various branches of knowledge, and to increase his 
understanding of the mysteries of the Holy Books, and his skill in 
marshalling the divine proofs and evidences.</p>
<p>	The eminent Sadru's-Sudur, who hath verily attained a most exalted 
station in the Retreats of Bliss, inaugurated the teaching meeting. He 
was the first blessed soul to lay the foundation of this momentous 
institution. God be praised, during the course of his life he educated 
persons who today are strong and eloquent advocates of the Lord God, 
disciples who are indeed pure and spiritual descendants of him who was 
so close to the Holy Threshold. After his passing, certain blessed 
individuals took steps<br>
 to perpetuate his teaching work, and when He learned of it, this Captive's heart rejoiced.</p>
<p>	At this time, likewise, I most urgently request the friends of God 
to make every effort, as much as lieth within their competence, along 
these lines. The harder they strive to widen the scope of their 
knowledge, the better and more gratifying will be the result. Let the 
loved ones of God, whether young or old, whether male or female, each 
according to his capabilities, bestir themselves and spare no efforts to
 acquire the various current branches of knowledge, both spiritual and 
secular, and of the arts. Whensoever they gather in their meetings let 
their conversation be confined to learned subjects and to information on
 the knowledge of the day.</p>
<p>	If they do thus, they will flood the world with the Manifest Light, 
and change this dusty earth into gardens of the Realm of Glory.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	579. O thou true friend! Read, in the school of God, the lessons of 
the spirit, and learn from love's Teacher the innermost truths. Seek out
 the secrets of Heaven, and tell of the overflowing grace and favour of 
God.</p>
<p>	Although to acquire the sciences and arts is the greatest glory of 
mankind, this is so only on condition that man's river floweth into the 
mighty Sea, and draweth from God's ancient source His inspiration. When 
this cometh to pass, then every teacher is as a shoreless ocean, every 
pupil a prodigal fountain of knowledge. If, then, the pursuit of 
knowledge leadeth to the beauty of Him Who is the object of all 
knowledge, how excellent that goal; but if not, a mere drop will perhaps
 shut a man off from flooding grace, for with learning cometh arrogance 
and pride, and it bringeth on error and indifference to God.</p>
<p>	The sciences of today are bridges to reality; if then they lead not 
to reality, naught remains but fruitless illusion. By the one true God! 
If learning be not a means of access to Him, the Most Manifest, it is 
nothing but evident loss.</p>
<p>	It is incumbent upon thee to acquire the various branches of 
knowledge, and to turn thy face toward the beauty of the Manifest 
Beauty, that thou mayest be a sign of saving guidance amongst the 
peoples of the world, and a focal centre of understanding in this sphere
 from which the wise and their wisdom are shut out, except for whoso 
setteth foot in the<br>
 Kingdom of Lights and becometh informed of the veiled and hidden mystery, the well-guarded secret.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), Sec. 72, p. 110)</p>
<p>	580. Man is in the highest degree of materiality, and at the 
beginning of spirituality -- that is to say, he is the end of 
imperfection and the beginning of perfection. He is at the last degree 
of darkness, and at the beginning of light; that is why it has been said
 that the condition of man is the end of the night and the beginning of 
day, meaning that he is the sum of all the degrees of imperfection, and 
that he possesses the degrees of perfection. He has the animal side as 
well as the angelic side, and the aim of an educator is to so train 
human souls that their angelic aspect may overcome their animal side....</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions" rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1985), pp. 235)</p>
<p>	581. Man is said to be the greatest representative of God, and he is
 the Book of Creation because all the mysteries of beings exist in him. 
If he comes under the shadow of the True Educator and is rightly 
trained, he becomes the essence of essences, the light of lights, the 
spirit of spirits; he becomes the centre of the divine appearances, the 
source of spiritual qualities, the rising-place of heavenly lights, and 
the receptacle of divine inspirations. If he is deprived of this 
education, he becomes the manifestation of satanic qualities, the sum of
 animal vices, and the source of all dark conditions. The reason of the 
mission of the Prophets is to educate men, so that this piece of coal 
may become a diamond, and this fruitless tree may be engrafted and yield
 the sweetest, most delicious fruits. When man reaches the noblest state
 in the world of humanity, then he can make further progress in the 
conditions of perfection, but not in state; for such states are limited,
 but the divine perfections are endless.</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", pp. 236-37)</p>
<p>	582. Close investigation will show that the primary cause of 
oppression and injustice, of unrighteousness, irregularity and disorder,
 is the people's lack of religious faith and the fact that they are 
uneducated. When, for<br>
 example, the people are genuinely religious and are literate and 
well-schooled, and a difficulty presents itself, they can apply to the 
local authorities; if they do not meet with justice and secure their 
rights and if they see that the conduct of the local government is 
incompatible with the Divine good pleasure and the king's justice, they 
can then take their case to higher courts and describe the deviation of 
the local administration from the spiritual law. Those courts can then 
send for the local records of the case and in this way justice will be 
done. At present, however, because of their inadequate schooling, most 
of the population lack even that vocabulary to explain what they want.</p>
<p>	("The Secret of Divine Civilization", 2nd ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), p. 18)</p>
<p>	583. The primary, the most urgent requirement is the promotion of 
education. It is inconceivable that any nation should achieve prosperity
 and success unless this paramount, this fundamental concern is carried 
forward. The principal reason for the decline and fall of peoples is 
ignorance. Today the mass of the people are uniformed even as to 
ordinary affairs, how much less do they grasp the core of the important 
problems and complex needs of the time.</p>
<p>	("The Secret of Divine Civilization", p. 109)</p>
<p>	584. Observe carefully how education and the arts of civilization 
bring honour, prosperity, independence and freedom to a government and 
its people.</p>
<p>	("The Secret of Divine Civilization", p. 111)</p>
<p>	585. But education is of three kinds: material, human, and 
spiritual. Material education is concerned with the progress and 
development of the body, through gaining its sustenance, its material 
comfort and ease. This education is common to animals and man. Human 
education signifies civilization and progress -- that is to say, 
government, administration, charitable works, trades, arts and 
handicrafts, sciences, great inventions and discoveries and elaborate 
institutions, which are the activities essential to man as distinguished
 from the animal.<br>

</p><p>	Divine education is that of the Kingdom of God: it consists in 
acquiring divine perfections, and this is true education; for in this 
state man becomes the focus of divine blessings, the manifestation of 
the words, "Let Us make man in Our image, and after Our likeness."[1] 
This is the goal of the world of humanity.<br>
 [1 Cf Gen. 1:26]</p>
<p>	Now we need an educator who will be at the same time a material, 
human, and spiritual educator, and whose authority will be effective in 
all conditions. So if anyone should say, "I possess perfect 
comprehension and intelligence, and I have no need of such an educator",
 he would be denying that which is clear and evident, as though a child 
should say, "I have no need of education; I will act according to my 
reason and intelligence, and so I shall attain the perfections of 
existence"; or as though the blind should say, "I am in no need of 
sight, because many other blind people exist without difficulty."</p>
<p>	Then it is plain and evident that man needs an educator, and this 
educator must be unquestionably and indubitably perfect in all respects 
and distinguished above all men. Otherwise, if he should be like the 
rest of humanity, he could not be their educator, more particularly 
because he must be at the same time their material and human as well as 
their spiritual educator -- that is to say, he must teach men to 
organize and carry out physical matters, and to form a social order in 
order to establish cooperation and mutual aid in living so that material
 affairs may be organized and regulated for any circumstances that may 
occur. In the same way he must establish human education -- that is to 
say, he must educate intelligence and thought in such a way that they 
may attain complete development, so that knowledge and science may 
increase, and the reality of things, the mysteries of beings, and the 
properties of existence may be discovered; that, day by day, 
instructions, inventions, and institutions may be improved; and from 
things perceptible to the senses conclusions as to intellectual things 
may be deduced.</p>
<p>	He must also impart spiritual education, so that intelligence and 
comprehension may penetrate the metaphysical world, and may receive 
benefit from the sanctifying breeze of the Holy Spirit, and may enter 
into relationship with the Supreme Concourse. He must so educate the 
human reality that it may become the center of the divine appearance, to<br>
 such a degree that the attributes and the names of God shall be 
resplendent in the mirror of the reality of man, and the holy verse, "We
 will make man in Our image and likeness", shall be realized."[1]<br>
 [1 Cf Gen. 1:26]</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", pp. 8-9)</p>
<p>	586. There are some who imagine that an innate sense of human 
dignity will prevent man from committing evil actions and insure his 
spiritual and material perfection. That is, that an individual who is 
characterized with natural intelligence, high resolve, and a driving 
zeal, will, without any consideration for the severe punishments 
consequent on evil acts, or for the great rewards of righteousness, 
instinctively refrain from inflicting harm on his fellow men and will 
hunger and thirst to do good. And yet, if we ponder the lessons of 
history it will become evident that this very sense of honor and dignity
 is itself one of the bounties deriving from the instructions of the 
Prophets of God. We also observe in infants the signs of aggression and 
lawlessness, and that if a child is deprived of a teacher's instructions
 his undesirable qualities increase from one moment to the next. It is 
therefore clear that the emergence of this natural sense of human 
dignity and honor is the result of education. Secondly, even if we grant
 for the sake of the argument that instinctive intelligence and an 
innate moral quality would prevent wrongdoing, it is obvious that 
individuals so characterized are as rare as the philosopher's stone. An 
assumption of this sort cannot be validated by mere words, it must be 
supported by the facts. Let us see what power in creation impels the 
masses toward righteous aims and deeds! Aside from this, if that rare 
individual who does exemplify such a faculty should also become an 
embodiment of the fear of God, it is certain that his strivings toward 
righteousness would be strongly reinforced.</p>
<p>	("The Secret of Divine Civilization", pp. 97-8)</p>
<p>	587. As to the differences among human beings and the superiority or
 inferiority of some individuals to others, the materialists are of two 
schools of thought: one group is of the opinion that these differences 
and the superior qualities of some individuals are inborn, and are, as 
they would put it, an exigency of nature. According to them, it is 
obvious that<br>
 differences within the species are inherent. For example, there are, in
 nature, different kinds of trees; animals, too, are varied in their 
nature; even minerals vary naturally among themselves, and you have here
 a quarry filled with stones, there a mine of rubies, translucent and 
richly red; here a shell with pearl enclosed, there only a bit a clay.</p>
<p>	The other school of traditional philosophers holdeth to the view 
that the differences among individuals and the varying levels of 
intellects and talents derive from education: for with training, a 
crooked branch can grow straight, and a barren tree of the desert can be
 domesticated, it can be grafted and made to bear fruit, which may be 
bitter, but with time turneth sweet. At first, its fruit may be small; 
but it will grow large and full of flavour, a delight to the taste.</p>
<p>	The strongest proof adduced by the second group is this, that the 
tribes of Africa are, generally speaking, ignorant and wild, while the 
civilized peoples of America are, in general, possessed of wisdom and 
understanding, which proveth that the difference between these two 
peoples is due to education and experience. Such are the stated views of
 the philosophers.</p>
<p>	The Manifestations of God, on the other hand, affirm that 
differences are demonstrably and indisputably innate, and that "We have 
caused some of you to excel others"[1] is a proven and inescapable fact.
 It is certain that human beings are, by their very nature, different 
one from the other. Observe a small group of children, born of the same 
parents, attending the same school, receiving the same education, living
 on the same diet: some, becoming well educated, will achieve a high 
degree of advancement; some will reach a middle level; and some will not
 prove educable at all. It is therefore clear that the disparity among 
individuals is due to differences of degree which are innate.<br>
 [1 Qur'an 17:22] </p>
<p>	But the Manifestations also consider that training and education 
demonstrably exert a tremendous influence. If, for example, a child is 
deprived of schooling he will certainly remain ignorant, and his 
knowledge will be limited to what he is able to find out for himself; 
but if he is brought to a qualified teacher to study the sciences and 
arts, he will learn of the discoveries made by thousands of other human 
beings. Thus education is a guide to those who have gone astray; it 
maketh the blind<br>
 to see; it bestoweth judgement on the foolish, and a yield of greatness
 on the unproductive; it causeth the mute to speak, and turneth the 
false dawn into the true morning's light; through it the tiny seed will 
become a towering palm, and the runaway slave, a reigning king.</p>
<p>	Thus is it certain that education exerteth an influence, and for 
this reason the Manifestation of God, the Well-Springs of His mercy, are
 raised up in the world, that through the breaths of holiness They may 
educate the human race, and make of the sucking child a strong and 
valiant man. Through Them will the outcasts of the earth become the 
cherished companions of Heaven, and the portionless receive their due.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	588. Question. -- How many kinds of character has man, and what is the cause of the differences and varieties in men?</p>
<p>	Answer. -- He has the innate character, the inherited character, and the acquired character which is gained by education.</p>
<p>	With regard to the innate character, although the divine creation is
 purely good, yet the varieties of natural qualities in man come from 
the difference of degree; all are excellent, but they are more or less 
so, according to the degree. So all mankind possess intelligence and 
capacities, but the intelligence, the capacity, and the worthiness of 
men differ. This is evident.</p>
<p>	For example, take a number of children of one family, of one place, 
of one school, instructed by one teacher, reared on the same food, in 
the same climate, with the same clothing, and studying the same lessons 
-- it is certain that among these children some will be clever in the 
sciences, some will be of average ability, and some dull. Hence it is 
clear that in the original nature there exists a difference of degree 
and varieties of worthiness and capacity. This difference does not imply
 good or evil but is simply a difference of degree. One has the highest 
degree, another the medium degree, and another the lowest degree. So man
 exists; the animal, the plant and the mineral exist also -- but the 
degrees of these four existences vary. What a difference between the 
existence of man and of the animal! Yet both are existences. It is 
evident that in existence there are differences of degrees.</p>
<p>	The variety of inherited qualities comes from strength and weakness 
of constitution -- that is to say, when the two parents are weak, the<br>
 children will be weak; if they are strong, the children will be robust.
 In the same way, purity of blood has a great effect; for the pure germ 
is like the superior stock which exists in plants and animals. For 
example, you see that children born from a weak and feeble father and 
mother will naturally have a feeble constitution and weak nerves; they 
will be afflicted and will have neither patience, nor endurance, nor 
resolution, nor perseverance, and will be hasty; for the children 
inherit the weakness and debility of their parents. Besides this, an 
especial blessing is conferred on some families and some generations. 
Thus it is an especial blessing that from among the descendants of 
Abraham should have come all the Prophets of the children of Israel. 
This is a blessing that God has granted to this descent: to Moses from 
his father and mother, to Christ from his mother's line; also to 
Muhammad and the Bab, and to all the Prophets and the Holy 
Manifestations of Israel. The Blessed Beauty[1] is also a lineal 
descendant of Abraham, for Abraham had other sons besides Ishmael and 
Isaac who in those days migrated to the lands of Persia and Afghanistan,
 and the Blessed Beauty is one of their descendants. Hence it is evident
 that inherited character also exists, and to such a degree that if the 
characters are not in conformity with their origin, although they belong
 physically to that lineage, spiritually they are not considered members
 of the family, like Canaan,[2] who is not reckoned as being of the race
 of Noah.<br>
 [1 Baha'u'llah]<br>
 [2 Cf. Genesis 9:25]</p>
<p>	But the difference of the qualities with regard to culture is very 
great, for education has great influence. Through education the ignorant
 become learned; the cowardly become valiant. Through cultivation the 
crooked branch becomes straight; the acid, bitter fruit of the mountains
 and woods becomes sweet and delicious; and the five-petaled flower 
becomes hundred-petaled. Through education savage nations become 
civilized, and even the animals become domesticated. Education must be 
considered as most important, for as diseases in the world of bodies are
 extremely contagious, so, in the same way, qualities of spirit and 
heart are extremely contagious. Education has a universal influence, and
 the differences caused by it are very great.<br>

</p><p>	Perhaps someone will say that, since the capacity and worthiness
 of men differ, therefore, the difference of capacity certainly causes 
the difference of characters.[1]<br>
 [1 i.e. therefore people cannot be blamed for their character.]</p>
<p>	But this is not so, for capacity is of two kinds: natural capacity 
and acquired capacity. The first, which is the creation of God, is 
purely good -- in the creation of God there is no evil; but the acquired
 capacity has become the cause of the appearance of evil. For example, 
God has created all men in such a manner and has given them such a 
constitution and such capacities that they are benefited by sugar and 
honey and harmed and destroyed by poison. This nature and constitution 
is innate, and God has given it equally to all mankind. But man begins 
little by little to accustom himself to poison by taking a small 
quantity each day, and gradually increasing it, until he reaches such a 
point that he cannot live without a gram of opium every day. The natural
 capacities are thus completely perverted. Observe how much the natural 
capacity and constitution can be changed, until by different habits and 
training they become entirely perverted. One does not criticize vicious 
people because of their innate capacities and nature, but rather for 
their acquired capacities and nature.</p>
<p>	In creation there is no evil; all is good. Certain qualities and 
natures innate in some men and apparently blameworthy are not so in 
reality. For example, from the beginning of his life you can see in a 
nursing child the signs of greed, of anger and of temper. Then, it may 
be said, good and evil are innate in the reality of man, and this is 
contrary to the pure goodness of nature and creation. The answer to this
 is that greed, which is to ask for something more, is a praiseworthy 
quality provided that it is used suitably. So if a man is greedy to 
acquire science and knowledge, or to become compassionate, generous, and
 just, it is most praiseworthy. If he exercises his anger and wrath 
against the bloodthirsty tyrants who are like ferocious beasts, it is 
very praiseworthy; but if he does not use these qualities in a right 
way, they are blameworthy.</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", pp. 212-15)</p>
<p>	589. As to the difference between that material civilization now 
prevailing, and the divine civilization which will be one of the 
benefits to derive from<br>
 the House of Justice, it is this: material civilization, through the 
power of punitive and retaliatory laws, restraineth the people from 
criminal acts; and notwithstanding this, while laws to retaliate against
 and punish a man are continually proliferating, as ye can see, no laws 
exist to reward him. In all the cities of Europe and America, vast 
buildings have been erected to serve as jails for the criminals.</p>
<p>	Divine civilization, however, so traineth every member of society 
that no one, with the exception of a negligible few, will undertake to 
commit a crime. There is thus a great difference between the prevention 
of crime through measures that are violent and retaliatory, and so 
training the people, and enlightening them, and spiritualizing them, 
that without any fear of punishment or vengeance to come, they will shun
 all criminal acts. They will, indeed, look upon the very commission of a
 crime as a great disgrace and in itself the harshest of punishments. 
They will become enamoured of human perfections, and will consecrate 
their lives to whatever will bring light to the world and will further 
those qualities which are acceptable at the Holy Threshold of God.</p>
<p>	See then how wide is the difference between material civilization 
and divine. With force and punishments, material civilization seeketh to
 restrain the people from mischief, from inflicting harm on society and 
committing crimes. But in a divine civilization, the individual is so 
conditioned that with no fear of punishment, he shunneth the 
perpetration of crimes, seeth the crime itself as the severest of 
torments, and with alacrity and joy, setteth himself to acquiring the 
virtues of humankind, to furthering human progress, and to spreading 
light across the world.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 105, pp. 132-33)</p>
<p>	590. Among the safeguards of the Holy Faith is the training of 
children, and this is among the weightiest of principles in all the 
Divine Teachings. Thus from the very beginning mothers must rear their 
infants in the cradle of good morals -- for it is the mothers who are 
the first educators - -so that, when the child cometh to maturity, he 
will prove to be endowed with all the virtues and qualities that are 
worthy of praise.</p>
<p>	And further, according to the Divine commandments, every child must 
learn reading and writing, and acquire such branches of knowledge as are
 useful and necessary, as well as learning an art or skill. The utmost<br>
 care must be devoted to these matters; any neglect of them, any failure to act on them, is not permissible.</p>
<p>	Observe how many penal institutions, houses of detention and places 
of torture are made ready to receive the sons of men, the purpose being 
to prevent them, by punitive measures, from committing terrible crimes 
-- whereas this very torment and punishment only increaseth depravity, 
and by such means the desired aim cannot be properly achieved.</p>
<p>	Therefore must the individual be trained from his infancy in such a 
way that he will never undertake to commit a crime, will, rather, direct
 all his energies to the acquisition of excellence, and will look upon 
the very commission of an evil deed as in itself the harshest of all 
punishments, considering the sinful act itself to be far more grievous 
than any prison sentence. For it is possible so to train the individual 
that, although crime may not be completely done away with, still it will
 become very rare.</p>
<p>	The purport is this, that to train the character of humankind is one
 of the weightiest commandments of God, and the influence of such 
training is the same as that which the sun exerteth over tree and fruit.
 Children must be most carefully watched over, protected and trained; in
 such consisteth true parenthood and parental mercy.</p>
<p>	Otherwise, the children will turn into weeds growing wild, and 
become the cursed, Infernal Tree,[1] knowing not right from wrong, 
distinguishing not the highest of human qualities from all that is mean 
and vile; they will be brought up in vainglory, and will be hated of the
 Forgiving Lord.<br>
 [1 The Zaqqum, Qur'an 37:60, 44:43]</p>
<p>	Wherefore doth every child, new-risen in the garden of Heavenly love, require the utmost training and care.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	591. The root cause of wrongdoing is ignorance, and we must 
therefore hold fast to the tools of perception and knowledge. Good 
character must be taught. Light must be spread afar, so that, in the 
school of humanity, all may acquire the heavenly characteristics of the 
spirit, and see for themselves beyond any doubt that there is no fiercer
 Hell, no more fiery abyss, than to possess a character that is evil and
 unsound; no more<br>
 darksome pit nor loathsome torment than to show forth qualities which deserve to be condemned.</p>
<p>	The individual must be educated to such a high degree that he would 
rather have his throat cut than tell a lie, and would think it easier to
 be slashed with a sword or pierced with a spear than to utter calumny 
or be carried away by wrath.</p>
<p>	Thus will be kindled the sense of human dignity and pride, to burn 
away the reapings of lustful appetites. Then will each one of God's 
beloved shine out as a bright moon with qualities of the spirit, and the
 relationship of each to the Sacred Threshold of his Lord will be not 
illusory but sound and real, will be as the very foundation of the 
building, not some embellishment on its facade.</p>
<p>	It followeth that the children's school must be a place of utmost 
discipline and order, that instruction must be thorough, and provision 
must be made for the rectification and refinement of character; so that,
 in his earliest years, within the very essence of the child, the divine
 foundation will be laid and the structure of holiness raised up.</p>
<p>	Know that this matter of instruction, of character rectification and
 refinement, of heartening and encouraging the child, is of the utmost 
importance, for such are basic principles of God.</p>
<p>	Thus, if God will, out of these spiritual schools illumined children
 will arise, adorned with all the fairest virtues of humankind, and will
 shed their light not only across Persia, but around the world.</p>
<p>	It is extremely difficult to teach the individual and refine his 
character once puberty is passed. By then, as experience has shown, even
 if every effort be exerted to modify some tendency of his, it all 
availeth nothing. He may, perhaps, improve somewhat today; but let a few
 days pass and he forgetteth, and turneth backward to his habitual 
condition and accustomed ways. Therefore it is in early childhood that a
 firm foundation must be laid. While the branch is green and tender it 
can easily be made straight.</p>
<p>	Our meaning is that qualities of the spirit are the basic and divine
 foundation, and adorn the true essence of man; and knowledge is the 
cause of human progress. The beloved of God must attach great importance
 to this matter, and carry it forward with enthusiasm and zeal.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 111) pp. 136-37)<br>

</p><p>	592. Were there no educator, all souls would remain savage, and 
were it not for the teacher, the children would be ignorant creatures.</p>
<p>	It is for this reason that, in this new cycle, education and 
training are recorded in the Book of God as obligatory and not 
voluntary. That is, it is enjoined upon the father and mother, as a 
duty, to strive with all effort to train the daughter and the son, to 
nurse them from the breast of knowledge and to rear them in the bosom of
 sciences and arts. Should they neglect this matter, they shall be held 
responsible and worthy of reproach in the presence of the stern Lord.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 98, pp. 126-27)</p>
<p>	593. And among the teachings of Baha'u'llah is the promotion of 
education. Every child must be instructed in sciences as much as is 
necessary. If the parents are able to provide the expenses of this 
education, it is well, otherwise the community must provide the means 
for the teaching of that child.</p>
<p>	(From a letter written by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the Central Organization 
for a Durable Peace, The Hague, (December 17, 1919), p.12; also 
published in "Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 227, 
p. 304)</p>
<p>	594. There are certain pillars which have been established as the 
unshakable supports of the Faith of God. The mightiest of these is 
learning and the use of the mind, the expansion of consciousness, and 
insight into the realities of the universe and the hidden mysteries of 
Almighty God.</p>
<p>	To promote knowledge is thus an inescapable duty imposed on every 
one of the friends of God. It is incumbent upon that Spiritual Assembly,
 that assemblage of God, to exert every effort to educate the children, 
so that from infancy they will be trained in Baha'i conduct and the ways
 of God, and will, even as young plants, thrive and flourish in the 
soft-flowing waters that are the counsels and admonitions of the Blessed
 Beauty. Work then with heart and soul, loose your tongues to further 
this endeavour, sacrifice your possessions so that the School of 
'Ishqabad will ever advance in discipline and order.[1]<br>
 [1 Cf. "Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i   World Centre, 1982), Sec. 97, p. 126]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	595. Thou didst write as to the children: From the very 
beginning, the children must receive divine education and must 
continually be reminded to remember their God. Let the love of God 
pervade their inmost being, commingled with their mother's milk.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 99, p. 127)</p>
<p>	596. My wish is that these children should receive a Baha'i 
education, so that they may progress both here and in the Kingdom, and 
rejoice thy heart.</p>
<p>	In a time to come, morals will degenerate to an extreme degree. It 
is essential that children be reared in the Baha'i way, that they may 
find happiness both in this world and the next. If not, they shall be 
beset by sorrows and troubles, for human happiness is founded upon 
spiritual behaviour.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 100, p. 127)</p>
<p>	597. Child education is a matter of the utmost importance. The 
infant, while yet a suckling, must receive Baha'i training, and the 
loving spirit of Christ and Baha'u'llah must be breathed into him, that 
he may be reared in accord with the verities of the Gospel and the Most 
Holy Book.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	598. O thou who gazest upon the Kingdom of God!<br>
	Thy letter was received and we note that thou art engaged in teaching 
the children of the believers, that these tender little ones have been 
learning the Hidden Words and the prayers and what it meaneth to be a 
Baha'i.</p>
<p>	The instruction of these children is even as the work of a loving 
gardener who tendeth his young plants in the flowering fields of the 
All-Glorious. There is no doubt that it will yield the desired results; 
especially is this true of instruction as to Baha'i obligations and 
Baha'i conduct, for the little children must needs be made aware in 
their very heart and soul that "Baha'i" is not just a name but a truth. 
Every child must be trained in the things of the spirit, so that he may 
embody all the virtues and become a source of glory to the Cause of God.
 Otherwise, the mere word "Baha'i", if it yield no fruit, will come to 
nothing.<br>

</p><p>	Strive then to the best of thine ability to let these children 
know that a Baha'i is one who embodieth all the perfections, that he 
must shine out like a lighted taper -- not be darkness upon darkness and
 yet bear the name "Baha'i".</p>
<p>	Name thou this school the Baha'i Sunday School.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	599. We have previously written and sent out a detailed letter 
regarding the education of children in faith, certitude, learning and 
spiritual knowledge, and their being taught to call upon the Heavenly 
Kingdom with suppliant hearts.</p>
<p>	It is certain that ye will exert every effort toward this end.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	600. As to thy question regarding the education of children: It 
behoveth thee to nurture them at the breast of the love of God, and urge
 them onward to the things of the spirit -- that they may turn their 
faces unto God; that their ways may conform to the rules of good conduct
 and their character be second to none; that they make their own all the
 graces and praiseworthy qualities of humankind; that they acquire a 
sound knowledge of the various branches of learning -- so that from the 
very beginning of life they may become spiritual beings, dwellers in the
 Kingdom, enamoured of the sweet breaths of holiness, and may receive an
 education religious, spiritual, and of the Heavenly Realm. Verily will I
 call upon God to grant them a happy outcome in this.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 122, p. 142)</p>
<p>	601. Exert every effort to acquire the various branches of knowledge
 and true understanding. Strain every nerve to achieve both material and
 spiritual accomplishments. Encourage the children from their earliest 
years to master every kind of learning, and make them eager to become 
skilled in every art -- the aim being that through the favouring grace 
of God, the heart of each one may become even as a mirror disclosing the
 secrets of the universe, penetrating the innermost reality of all 
things; and that each may earn world-wide fame in all branches of 
knowledge, science and the arts.<br>

</p><p>	Certainly, certainly, neglect not the education of the children.
 Rear them to be possessed of spiritual qualities, and be assured of the
 gifts and favours of the Lord.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	602. O ye two servants at the Holy Threshold! We have been greatly 
cheered and refreshed to know that ye have organized meetings for the 
education of children. Whoso is active in those meetings whether as a 
teacher of the children or a sponsor, will certainly become the 
recipient of confirmations from the invisible Realm, and endless 
bounties will compass him about.</p>
<p>	With great joy, therefore, encouragement is offered for this highly 
laudable endeavour that ye may witness an exceeding great reward.</p>
<p>	Await ye the sure and certain confirmations of the All-Merciful.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	603. O ye two well-loved handmaids of God! Whatever a man's tongue 
speaketh, that let him prove by his deeds. If he claimeth to be a 
believer, then let him act in accordance with the precepts of the Abha 
Kingdom.</p>
<p>	Praised be God, ye two have demonstrated the truth of your words by 
your deeds, and have won the confirmations of the Lord God. Every day at
 first light, ye gather the Baha'i children together and teach them the 
communes and prayers. This is a most praiseworthy act, and bringeth joy 
to the children's hearts: that they should, at every morn, turn their 
faces toward the Kingdom and make mention of the Lord and praise His 
Name, and in the sweetest of voices, chant and recite.</p>
<p>	These children are even as young plants, and teaching them the 
prayers is as letting the rain pour down upon them, that they may wax 
tender and fresh, and the soft breezes of the love of God may blow over 
them, making them to tremble with joy.</p>
<p>	Blessedness awaiteth you, and a fair haven.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 115, p. 139)</p>
<p>	604. O thou steadfast in the Covenant!<br>
	Your letter hath come and imparted great delight, with its word that, 
praised be God, the youth of the Abha paradise are verdant and tender, 
from showers scattered out of clouds of heavenly grace; that they thrive<br>
 and flourish in the April rains of heavenly guidance, and are progressing day by day.</p>
<p>	It is certain that each and every one of them will grow to be as a 
banner of guidance, a symbol of the bestowals that come from the Realm 
of the All-Glorious. They will be sweet-singing nightingales in the 
gardens of knowledge, gazelles delicate and comely, roaming the plains 
of the love of God. You must attach the greatest importance to the 
education of children, for this is the foundation of the Law of God, and
 the bedrock of the edifice of His Faith.</p>
<p>	If it were known how much joy you have imparted through what hath 
been done for the children, the believers would surely educate all their
 children in the same way.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	605. O true companions!<br>
	All humankind are as children in a school, and the Dawning-Points of 
Light, the Sources of divine revelation, are the teachers, wondrous and 
without peer. In the school of realities they educate these sons and 
daughters, according to teachings from God, and foster them in the bosom
 of grace, so that they may develop along every line, show forth the 
excellent gifts and blessings of the Lord, and combine human 
perfections; that they may advance in all aspects of human endeavour, 
whether outward or inward, hidden or visible, material or spiritual, 
until they make of this mortal world a wide-spread mirror, to reflect 
that other world which dieth not.</p>
<p>	... Because, in this most momentous of ages, the Sun of Truth hath 
risen at the highest point of the spring equinox, and cast its rays on 
every clime, it shall kindle such tremulous excitement, it shall release
 such vibrations in the world of being, it shall stimulate such growth 
and development, it shall stream out with such a glory of light, and 
clouds of grace shall pour down such plentiful waters, and fields and 
plains shall teem with such a galaxy of sweet-smelling plants and 
blooms, that this lowly earth will become the Abha Kingdom, and this 
nether world the world above. Then will this fleck of dust be as the 
vast circle of the skies, this human place the palace-court of God, this
 spot of clay the Dayspring of the endless favours of the Lord of Lords.<br>

</p><p>	Wherefore, O loved ones of God! Make ye a mighty effort till you
 yourselves betoken this advancement and all these confirmations, and 
become focal centres of God's blessings, daysprings of the light of His 
unity, promoters of the gifts and graces of civilized life. Be ye in 
that land vanguards of the perfections of humankind; carry forward the 
various branches of knowledge, be active and progressive in the field of
 inventions and the arts. Endeavour to rectify the conduct of men, and 
seek to excel the whole world in moral character. While the children are
 yet in their infancy feed them from the breast of heavenly grace, 
foster them in the cradle of all excellence, rear them in the embrace of
 bounty. Give them the advantage of every useful kind of knowledge. Let 
them share in every new and rare and wondrous craft and art. Bring them 
up to work and strive, and accustom them to hardship. Teach them to 
dedicate their lives to matters of great import, and inspire them to 
undertake studies that will benefit mankind.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 102, pp. 128-29)</p>
<p>	606. The education and training of children is among the most 
meritorious acts of humankind and draweth down the grace and favour of 
the All-Merciful, for education is the indispensable foundation of all 
human excellence and alloweth man to work his way to the heights of 
abiding glory. If a child be trained from his infancy, he will, through 
the loving care of the Holy Gardener, drink in the crystal waters of the
 spirit and of knowledge, like a young tree amid the rilling brooks. And
 certainly he will gather to himself the bright rays of the Sun of 
Truth, and through its light and heat will grow ever fresh and fair in 
the garden of life.</p>
<p>	Therefore must the mentor be a doctor as well: that is, he must, in 
instructing the child, remedy its faults; must give him learning, and at
 the same time rear him to have a spiritual nature. Let the teacher be a
 doctor to the character of the child, thus will he heal the spiritual 
ailments of the children of men.</p>
<p>	If, in this momentous task, a mighty effort be exerted, the world of
 humanity will shine out with other adornings, and shed the fairest 
light. Then will this darksome place grow luminous, and this abode of 
earth turn into Heaven. The very demons will change to angels then, and 
wolves to shepherds of the flock, and the wild-dog pack to gazelles that
 pasture on the plains of oneness, and ravening beasts to peaceful 
herds; and birds<br>
 of prey, with talons sharp as knives, to songsters warbling their sweet native notes.</p>
<p>	For the inner reality of man is a demarcation line between the 
shadow and the light, a place where the two seas meet;[1] it is the 
lowest point on the arc of descent,[2] and therefore is it capable of 
gaining all the grades above. With education it can achieve all 
excellence; devoid of education it will stay on, at the lowest point of 
imperfection.<br>
 [1 Qur'an 25:55, 35:13, 55:19-25. See also Marriage Prayer revealed by 
 'Abdu'l-Baha beginning "He is God! O Peerless Lord! In thine almighty  
wisdom Thou hast enjoined marriage..."]<br>
 [2 See "Some Answered Questions, pp. 328-29 for 'Abdu'l-Baha's comments on  the arc of descent and ascent.] </p>
<p>	Every child is potentially the light of the world -- and at the same
 time its triple darkness; wherefore must the question of education be 
accounted as of primary importance. From his infancy, the child must be 
nursed at the breast of God's love, and nurtured in the embrace of His 
knowledge, that he may radiate light, grow in spirituality, be filled 
with wisdom and learning, and take on the characteristics of the angelic
 host. Since ye have been assigned to this holy task, ye must therefore 
exert every effort to make that school famed in all respects throughout 
the world; to make it the cause of exalting the Word of the Lord.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 103, pp. 129-31)</p>
<p>	607. Among the greatest of all services that can possibly be 
rendered by man to Almighty God is the education and training of 
children, young plants of the Abha Paradise, so that these children, 
fostered by grace in the way of salvation, growing like pearls of divine
 bounty in the shell of education, will one day bejewel the crown of 
abiding glory. It is, however, very difficult to undertake this service,
 even harder to succeed in it. I hope that thou wilt acquit thyself well
 in this most important of tasks, and successfully carry the day, and 
become an ensign of God's abounding grace; that these children, reared 
one and all in the holy Teachings, will develop natures like unto the 
sweet airs that blow across the gardens of the All-Glorious, and will 
waft their fragrance around the world.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 106, pp. 133-34)<br>

</p><p>	608. Blessed art thou, since thou art engaged in rendering a 
service which will make thy face to shine in the Abha Kingdom, and that 
is the education and training of children. If one should, in the right 
way, teach and train the children, he will be performing a service than 
which none is greater at the sacred Threshold. According to what we have
 heard, you are succeeding in this. You must, however, struggle 
unceasingly to perfect yourself and win ever higher achievements.</p>
<p>	At all times, I implore Almighty God to make you the means of 
illuminating the minds of those children, of bringing their hearts to 
life and sanctifying their souls.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	609. It is the hope of 'Abdu'l-Baha that those youthful souls in the
 schoolroom of the deeper knowledge will be tended by one who traineth 
them to love. May they all, throughout the reaches of the spirit, learn 
well of the hidden mysteries; so well that in the Kingdom of All- 
Glorious, each one of them, even as a nightingale endowed with speech, 
will cry out the secrets of the Heavenly Realm, and like unto a longing 
lover pour forth his sore need and utter want of the Beloved.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 107, p. 134)</p>
<p>	610. O thou handmaid of God! Do thou establish a heavenly school and
 be thou a teacher in that house of learning. Educate the children in 
the things of God; and, even as pearls, rear them in the heart of the 
shell of divine guidance. Strive thou with heart and soul; see to it 
that the children are raised up to embody the highest perfections of 
humankind, to such a degree that every one of them will be trained in 
the use of the mind, in acquiring knowledge, in humility and lowliness, 
in dignity, in ardour and love.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	611. Make ye inquiries as to a woman teacher. She must be extremely 
modest, even-tempered, forbearing, and well bred, and she must be expert
 in the English language.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the persian)<br>

</p><p>	612. In thy school, instruct thou God's children in the customs 
of the Kingdom. Be thou a teacher of love, in a school of unity. Train 
thou the children of the friends of the Merciful in the rules and ways 
of His loving-kindness. Tend the young trees of the Abha Paradise with 
the welling waters of His grace and peace and joy. Make them to flourish
 under the downpour of His bounty. Strive with all thy powers that the 
children may stand out and grow fresh, delicate, and sweet, like the 
ideal trees in the gardens of Heaven.</p>
<p>	All these gifts and bounties depend upon love for the Beauty of the 
All-Glorious, and on the blessings in the teachings of the Most High, 
and the spiritual instructions of the Supreme Concourse, and on ecstasy 
and ardour and diligent pursuit of whatsoever will redound to the 
eternal honour of the community of man.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	613. Make every effort to acquire the advanced knowledge of the day,
 and strain every nerve to carry forward the divine civilization. 
Establish schools that are well organized, and promote the fundamentals 
of instruction in the various branches of knowledge through teachers who
 are pure and sanctified, distinguished for their high standards of 
conduct and general excellence, and strong in faith; scholars and 
educators with a thorough knowledge of sciences and arts.</p>
<p>	It is incumbent upon the exalted body of the Hands of the Cause of 
God to watch over and protect these schools in every way, and see to 
their requirements, so that all the means of progress will continually 
be at hand, and the lights of learning will illumine the whole world.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	614. O thou steadfast in the Covenant!<br>
	In reply to thy letter, I am obliged to be brief: Praise thou God that 
thou hast succeeded in becoming a teacher of young Baha'is, young trees 
of the Abha Paradise, and at the same time art able to benefit the other
 children as well. According to the explicit divine Text, teaching the 
children is indispensable and obligatory. It followeth that teachers are
 servants of the Lord God, since they have arisen to perform this task, 
which is the same<br>
 as worship. You must therefore offer praise with every breath, for you 
are educating your spiritual children. The spiritual father is greater 
than the physical one, for the latter bestoweth but this world's life, 
whereas the former endoweth his child with life everlasting. This is 
why, in the Law of God, teachers are listed among the heirs.</p>
<p>	Now you in reality have acquired all these spiritual children free 
and gratis, and that is better than having physical children; for such 
children are not grateful to their fathers, since they feel that the 
father serveth them because he must -- and therefore no matter what he 
doeth for them, they pay it no mind. Spiritual children, however, are 
always appreciative of their father's loving kindness. This verily is 
out of the grace of thy Lord, the Beneficent.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	615. O thou who art steadfast in the Covenant!<br>
	Thou hast exerted strenuous efforts for the education of children and I
 have been, and am, infinitely pleased with thee. Praise God, thou hast 
been enabled to serve in this field, and it is certain that the 
confirmations of the Abha Kingdom will encompass thee, and thou shalt 
achieve prosperity and success.</p>
<p>	Today the training and education of the believers' children is the 
pre-eminent goal of the chosen. It is the same as servitude to the 
Sacred Threshold and waiting upon the Blessed Beauty. Joyously, 
therefore, canst thou pride thyself on this.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	616. O thou teacher of the children of the kingdom! Thou hast arisen
 to perform a service which would justly entitle thee to vaunt thyself 
over all the teachers on earth. For the teachers of this world make use 
of human education to develop the powers, whether spiritual or material,
 of humankind, whilst thou art training these young plants in the 
gardens of God according to the education of Heaven, and art giving them
 the lessons of the Kingdom. The result of this kind of teaching will be
 that it will attract the blessings of God, and make manifest the 
perfections of man.<br>

</p><p>	Hold thou fast to this kind of teaching, for the fruits of it 
will be very great. The children must, from their infancy, be raised to 
be spiritual and godly Baha'is. If such be their training, they will 
remain safe from every test.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	617. O ye recipients of the favours of God!<br>
	In this new and wondrous Age, the unshakable foundation is the teaching
 of sciences and arts. According to explicit Holy Texts, every child 
must be taught crafts and arts, to the degree that is needful. 
Wherefore, in every city and village, schools must be established and 
every child in that city or village is to engage in study to the 
necessary degree.</p>
<p>	It followeth that whatever soul shall offer his aid to bring this 
about will assuredly be accepted at the Heavenly Threshold, and extolled
 by the Company on High.</p>
<p>	Since ye have striven hard toward this all important end, it is my 
hope that ye will reap your reward from the Lord of clear tokens and 
signs, and that the glances of heavenly grace will turn your way.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 109, pp. 13435)</p>
<p>	618. O ye of high resolve and noble aims!<br>
	Your letter was eloquent, its contents original and sensitively 
expressed, and it betokened your great and praiseworthy efforts to 
educate the children, both girls and boys. This is among the most 
important of all human endeavours. Every possible means of education 
must be made available to Baha'i children, tender plants of the divine 
garden, for in this consisteth the illumination of humankind.</p>
<p>	Praised be God, the friends in 'Ishqabad have laid a solid 
foundation, an unassailable base. It was in the City of Love that the 
first Baha'i House of Worship was erected; and today in this city the 
means for the education of children are also being developed, inasmuch 
as even during the war years this duty was not neglected, and indeed 
deficiencies were made up for. Now must ye widen the scope of your 
endeavours and draw up plans to establish schools for higher education, 
so that the City of Love will become the Baha'i focal centre for science
 and the arts. Thanks to the bountiful assistance of the Blessed Beauty,
 means for this will be provided.<br>

</p><p>	Devote ye particular attention to the school for girls, for the 
greatness of this wondrous Age will be manifested as a result of 
progress in the world of women. This is why ye observe that in every 
land the world of women is on the march, and this is due to the impact 
of the Most Great Manifestation, and the power of the teachings of God.</p>
<p>	Instruction in the schools must begin with instruction in religion. 
Following religious training, and the binding of the child's heart to 
the love of God, proceed with his education in the other branches of 
knowledge.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	619. One of the friends hath sent us a letter regarding the school 
at 'Ishqabad, to the effect that, praised be God, the friends there are 
now working hard to get the school in order, and have appointed teachers
 well qualified for their task, and that from this time forward the 
greatest care will be devoted to the supervision and management of the 
school.</p>
<p>	It is likewise my hope that the favours and bestowals of God, the 
bountiful King, will encompass you, so that the friends may come to 
excel the others in all things.</p>
<p>	One of the most important of undertakings is the education of 
children, for success and prosperity depend upon service to and worship 
of God, the Holy, the All- Glorified.</p>
<p>	Among the greatest of all great services is the education of 
children, and promotion of the various sciences, crafts and arts. 
Praised be God, ye are now exerting strenuous efforts toward this end. 
The more ye persevere in this most important task, the more will ye 
witness the confirmations of God, to such a degree that ye yourselves 
will be astonished.</p>
<p>	This verily is a matter beyond all doubt, a pledge that shall certainly be redeemed.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	620. The services ye are rendering in support of the Ta'yid School 
merit the highest praise. It is certain that God in His bounty will send
 down His manifold, heavenly blessings upon you.</p>
<p>	The believers are in duty bound to establish schools where children 
can acquire knowledge, and since these friends have pledged themselves 
to make sacrifices in this connection, and are contributing to the 
support<br>
 of the Ta'yid School, 'Abdu'l-Baha in all lowliness and submission 
offereth thanks and praise to the Kingdom of Mysteries. He asketh that 
bounties will be sent down unto you, and peace of mind, so that ye may 
succeed in rendering this most laudable service with ease and joy.</p>
<p>	O Thou Provider! These souls are doing good. Make them dear to both 
worlds, make them the recipients of measureless grace. Thou art the 
Powerful, Thou art the Able, Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the 
Incomparable Lord.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	621. What thou hadst written as to the school is a cause for great 
rejoicing, and delighteth the heart. The friends one and all were 
cheered and refreshed by this news.</p>
<p>	This school is one of the vital and essential institutions which 
indeed support and bulwark the edifice of humankind. God willing, it 
will develop and be perfected along every line. Once this school hath, 
in every respect, been perfected, once it hath been made to flourish and
 to surpass all other schools, then, each following the other, more and 
more schools must be established.</p>
<p>	Our meaning is that the friends must direct their attention toward 
the education and training of all the children of Persia, so that all of
 them, having, in the school of true learning, achieved the power of 
understanding and come to know the inner realities of the universe, will
 go on to uncover the signs and mysteries of God, and will find 
themselves illumined by the lights of the knowledge of the Lord, and by 
His love. This truly is the very best way to educate all peoples.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	622. Make ye every effort to improve the Tarbiyat School and to 
develop order and discipline in this institution. Utilize every means to
 make this School a garden of the All- Merciful, from which the lights 
of learning will cast their beams, and wherein the children, whether 
Baha'i or other, will be educated to such a degree as to become God's 
gifts to man, and the pride of the human race. Let them make the 
greatest progress in the shortest span of time, let them open wide their
 eyes and uncover the inner realities of all things, become proficient 
in every art and skill, and learn<br>
 to comprehend the secrets of all things even as they are -- this 
faculty being one of the clearly evident effects of servitude to the 
Holy Threshold. It is certain that ye will make every effort to bring 
this about, will also draw up plans for the opening of a number of 
schools. These schools for academic studies must at the same time be 
training centres in behaviour and conduct, and they must favour 
character and conduct above the sciences and arts. Good behaviour and 
high moral character must come first, for unless the character be 
trained, acquiring knowledge will only prove injurious. Knowledge is 
praiseworthy when it is coupled with ethical conduct and virtuous 
character; otherwise it is a deadly poison, a frightful danger. A 
physician of evil character, and who betrayeth his trust, can bring on 
death, and become the source of numerous infirmities and diseases.</p>
<p>	Devote ye the utmost attention to this matter, for the basic, the 
foundation-principle of a school is first and foremost moral training, 
character and the rectification of conduct.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	623. The All-Merciful hath created humankind for the adornment of 
this contingent world, so that men may array the earth with the manifold
 blessings of Heaven; that the inner reality of the human being may, 
like unto a lamp of the spirit, cause the community of man to become as a
 mirror for the assemblage on high.</p>
<p>	It is clear that learning is the greatest bestowal of God; that 
knowledge and the acquirement thereof is a blessing from Heaven. Thus is
 it incumbent upon the friends of God to exert such an effort and strive
 with such eagerness to promote divine knowledge, culture and the 
sciences, that erelong those who are schoolchildren today will become 
the most erudite of all the fraternity of the wise. This is a service 
rendered unto God Himself; and it is one of His inescapable 
commandments.</p>
<p>	Wherefore, O loving friends, strive with heart and soul and strength
 to make the Tarbiyat School a center of enlightenment, and a 
well-spring of truth, that the children of God may shine with the rays 
of boundless learning, and that these tender plants of the divine garden
 may grow and flourish in the grace that showereth down from the clouds 
of knowledge and true understanding, and advance to such a degree as to 
astonish the company of those who know.<br>

</p><p>	I swear by the bounty of God's wisdom that if they win this 
great prize, the members of the Tarbiyat School will be admitted to the 
assemblage of God, and that unto them, beyond a peradventure, the 
portals of His grace will open wide.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	624. God be praised that ye have succeeded in establishing a school 
in Mihdiyabad and are, with great energy and enthusiasm, engaged in 
educating the children.</p>
<p>	In this new and wondrous Cause, the advancement of all branches of 
knowledge is a fixed and vital principle, and the friends, one and all, 
are obligated to make every effort toward this end, so that the Cause of
 the Manifest Light may be spread abroad, and that every child, 
according to his need, will receive his share of the sciences and arts 
-- until not even a single peasant's child will be found who is 
completely devoid of schooling.</p>
<p>	It is essential that the fundamentals of knowledge be taught; 
essential that all should be able to read and write. Wherefore is this 
new institution most worthy of praise, and its programme to be 
encouraged. The hope is that other villages will take you for a model, 
and that in every village where there is a certain number of believers, a
 school will be founded where the children can study reading, writing, 
and basic knowledge.</p>
<p>	This is what bringeth joy to the heart of 'Abdu'l-Baha, cheer and peace to His soul.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	625. The method of instruction which ye have established, beginning 
with proofs of the existence of God and the oneness of God, the mission 
of the Prophets and Messengers and Their teachings, and the wonders of 
the universe, is highly suitable. Keep on with this. It is certain that 
the confirmations of God will attend you. It is also highly praiseworthy
 to memorize the Tablets, divine verses and sacred traditions.</p>
<p>	Ye will surely exert every effort in teaching, and in furthering understanding.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	626. As to the children: From the age of five their formal 
education must begin. That is, during the daytime they should be looked 
after in a place where there are teachers, and should learn good 
conduct.</p>
<p>	Here they should be taught, in play, some letters and words and a 
little reading -- as it is done in certain countries where they fashion 
letters and words out of sweets and give them to the child. For example,
 they make an "a" out of candy and say its name is "a", or make a candy 
"b" and call it "b", and so on with the rest of the alphabet, giving 
these to the young child. In this way, children will soon learn their 
letters...</p>
<p>	When the children are ready for bed, let the mother read or sing 
them the Odes of the Blessed Beauty, so that from their earliest years 
they will be educated by these verses of guidance.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	627. Thou didst ask as to the education of children. Those children 
who, sheltered by the Blessed Tree, have set foot upon the world, those 
who are cradled in the Faith and are nurtured at the breast of grace -- 
such must from the beginning receive spiritual training directly from 
their mothers. That is, the mother must continually call God to mind and
 make mention of Him, and tell of His greatness, and instill the fear of
 Him in the child, and rear the child gently, in the way of tenderness, 
and in extreme cleanliness. Thus from the very beginning of life every 
child will be refreshed by the gentle wafting of the love of God and 
will tremble with joy at the sweet scent of heavenly guidance. In this 
lieth the beginning of the process; it is the essential basis of all the
 rest.</p>
<p>	And when the child hath reached the age where he can make 
distinctions, let him be placed in a Baha'i school, in which at the 
beginning the Holy Texts are recited and religious concepts are taught. 
At this school the child is to study reading and writing as well as some
 fundamentals of the various branches of knowledge, such as can be 
learned by children.</p>
<p>	At the start the teacher must place a pen in the child's hand, 
arrange the children in groups, and instruct each group according to its
 capacity. When the children have, in a given place, been seated in 
rows, and each holdeth a pen, and each hath a paper before him, and the 
teacher hath suspended a blackboard in front of the children, let him 
write thereon with his chalk and have the children copy what he hath 
written. For<br>
 example, let the teacher write an alif (a) and say, "This is an alif." 
Let the children then copy it and repeat: "This is an alif." And so on, 
till the end of the alphabet. As soon as they properly recognize the 
letters, let the teacher make combinations of the letters, while the 
children follow his lead, writing the combinations on their paper, 
until, by this method, they come to recognize all the letters, singly 
and combined in words. Let the teacher then proceed to writing 
sentences, while the children copy what he hath written, each on his own
 sheet of paper. Let the teacher then explain the meaning of the 
sentence to the children.</p>
<p>	And once they have become skilled in the Persian tongue, let the 
teacher first translate and write out single words and ask the students 
the meaning of those words. If a pupil hath grasped a little of this, 
and hath translated the word, let the teacher praise him; if all the 
students are unable to accomplish this, let the teacher write the 
foreign language translation beneath the given word. For example, let 
him write sama (heaven) in Arabic, and ask: "How do we say this in 
Persian?" If one of the children replieth, "The Persian translation of 
this word is asiman", let the teacher praise and encourage him. If they 
are unable to answer, let the teacher himself give the translation and 
write it down, and let the children copy it.</p>
<p>	Later, let the teacher ask: "How do they say this in Russian, or 
French, or Turkish?" If they know the answer, excellent. If not, let the
 teacher say, "In Russian, or French, the translation is thus and so", 
write the word on the board, and have the children copy it down. When 
the children have become skilled in translating single words, let the 
teacher combine the words into a sentence, write this on the board and 
ask the children to translate it. If they are unable, let the teacher 
himself translate the sentence and write down the translation. It would 
of course be preferable for him to make use of several languages.</p>
<p>	In this way, over a short period -- that is, three years- -the 
children will, as a result of writing the words down, become fully 
proficient in a number of languages, and will be able to translate a 
passage from one language to another. Once they have become skilled in 
these fundamentals, let them go on to learning the elements of the other
 branches of knowledge, and once they have completed this study, let 
each one who is able and hath a keen desire for it, enroll in higher 
institutions of learning and study advanced courses in the sciences and 
arts.<br>

</p><p>	Not all, however, will be able to engage in these advanced 
studies. Therefore, such children must be sent to industrial schools 
where they can also acquire technical skills, and once the child becomes
 proficient in such a skill, then let consideration be given to the 
child's own preference and inclinations. If a child hath a liking for 
commerce, then let him choose commerce; if industry, then industry; if 
for higher education, then the advancement of knowledge; if for some 
other of the responsibilities of humankind, then that. Let him be placed
 in the field for which he hath an inclination, a desire, and a talent.</p>
<p>	But the indispensable basis of all is that he should develop 
spiritual characteristics and the praiseworthy virtues of humankind. 
This is the primary consideration. If a person be unlettered, and yet 
clothed with divine excellence, and alive in the breaths of the Spirit, 
that individual will contribute to the welfare of society, and his 
inability to read and write will do him no harm. And if a person be 
versed in the arts and every branch of knowledge, and not live a 
religious life, and not take on the characteristics of God, and not be 
directed by a pure intent, and be engrossed in the life of the flesh -- 
then he is harm personified, and nothing will come of all his learning 
and intellectual accomplishments but scandal and torment.</p>
<p>	If, however, an individual hath spiritual characteristics, and 
virtues that shine out, and his purpose in life be spiritual and his 
inclinations be directed toward God, and he also study other branches of
 knowledge -- then we have light upon light:[1] his outer being 
luminous, his private character radiant, his heart sound, his thought 
elevated, his understanding swift, his rank noble.<br>
 [1 Qur'an 24:35]</p>
<p>	Blessed is he who attaineth this exalted station. (From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	628. The subjects to be taught in children's school are many, and 
for lack of time We can touch on only a few: First and most important is
 training in behaviour and good character; the rectification of 
qualities; arousing the desire to become accomplished and acquire 
perfections, and to cleave unto the religion of God and stand firm in 
His Laws: to accord total obedience to every just government, to show 
forth loyalty and<br>
 trustworthiness to the ruler of the time, to be well wishers of mankind, to be kind to all.</p>
<p>	And further, as well as in the ideals of character, instruction in 
such arts and sciences as are of benefit, and in foreign tongues. Also, 
the repeating of prayers for the well-being of ruler and ruled; and the 
avoidance of materialistic works that are current among those who see 
only natural causation, and tales of love, and books that arouse the 
passions.</p>
<p>	To sum up, let all the lessons be entirely devoted to the 
acquisition of human perfections. Here, then, in brief are directions 
for the curriculum of these schools.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	629. As to the organization of the schools: If possible the children
 should all wear the same kind of clothing, even if the fabric is 
varied. It is preferable that the fabric as well should be uniform; if, 
however, this is not possible, there is no harm done. The more cleanly 
the pupils are, the better; they should be immaculate. The school must 
be located in a place where the air is delicate and pure. The children 
must be carefully trained to be most courteous and well-behaved. They 
must be constantly encouraged and made eager to gain all the summits of 
human accomplishment, so that from their earliest years they will be 
taught to have high aims, to conduct themselves well, to be chaste, 
pure, and undefiled, and will learn to be of powerful resolve and firm 
of purpose in all things. Let them not jest and trifle, but earnestly 
advance unto their goals, so that in every situation they will be found 
resolute and firm.</p>
<p>	Training in morals and good conduct is far more important than book 
learning. A child that is cleanly, agreeable, of good character, 
well-behaved -- even though he be ignorant -- is preferable to a child 
that is rude, unwashed, ill-natured, and yet becoming deeply versed in 
all the sciences and arts. The reason for this is that the child who 
conducts himself well, even though he be ignorant, is of benefit to 
others, while an ill-natured, ill-behaved child is corrupted and harmful
 to others, even though he be learned. If, however, the child be trained
 to be both learned and good, the result is light upon light.</p>
<p>	Children are even as a branch that is fresh and green; they will 
grow up in whatever way you train them. Take the utmost care to give 
them<br>
 high ideals and goals, so that once they come of age, they will cast 
their beams like brilliant candles on the world, and will not be defiled
 by lusts and passions in the way of animals, heedless and unaware, but 
instead will set their hearts on achieving everlasting honour and 
acquiring all the excellences of humankind.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 110, pp. 135-36)</p>
<p>	630. As to the education of children, exert every effort to further 
this; it is of the utmost importance. So too, the education of girls in 
all the rules of righteous conduct, that they may grow up with a good 
character and high standards of behaviour. For mothers are the first 
educators of the child, and every child at the beginning of life is like
 a fresh and tender branch in his parents' hands. His father and mother 
can train him in any way they choose.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	631. The school for girls taketh precedence over the school for 
boys, for it is incumbent upon the girls of this glorious era to be 
fully versed in the various branches of knowledge, in sciences and the 
arts and all the wonders of this pre-eminent time, that they may then 
educate their children and train them from their earliest days in the 
ways of perfection.</p>
<p>	If, as she ought, the mother possesseth the learning and 
accomplishments of humankind, her children, like unto angels, will be 
fostered in all excellence, in right conduct and beauty. Therefore the 
School for Girls that hath been established in that place must be made 
the object of the deep concern and high endeavours of the friends. The 
teachers of that school are handmaids close to the Sacred Threshold, for
 they are of those who, obedient to the commandments of the Blessed 
Beauty, have arisen to educate the girl children.</p>
<p>	The day will come when those children will be mothers, and each one 
of them in her deep gratitude will offer up prayers and supplications to
 Almighty God and ask that her teachers will be granted joy and 
well-being forever, and a high station in the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>	Name ye this school the Mawhibat School (The School of Bounty).</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	632. Our hearts rejoiced at thy letter concerning a school for girls.<br>

</p><p>	Praised be God that there is now a school of this type in Tihran
 where young maidens can, through His bounty, receive an education and 
with all vigour acquire the accomplishments of humankind. Erelong will 
women in every field keep pace with the men.</p>
<p>	Until now, in Persia, the means for women's advancement were 
non-existent. But now, God be thanked, ever since the dawning of the 
Morn of Salvation, they have been going forward day by day. The hope is 
that they will take the lead in virtues and attainments, in closeness to
 the Court of Almighty God, in faith and certitude -- and that the women
 of the East will become the envy of the women of the West.</p>
<p>	Praised be God, thou art confirmed in thy service, art exerting 
every effort in this work and taking great pains; and so, too, the 
teacher in the school, Miss Lillian Kappes. Give her my most 
affectionate greetings.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	633. In past centuries the girl children of Persia were deprived of 
all instruction. They had neither school nor academy, no kindly tutor 
and no teacher. Now in this greatest of centuries the bounty of the 
All-Bountiful hath encompassed the girls as well, and many schools have 
been founded in Persia for the education of girl children -- but what is
 missing from them is character training, and this despite the fact that
 such training is more important than instruction, for it is the primary
 accomplishment of humankind.</p>
<p>	Praised be God, a school for girls hath now been established in 
Hamadan. Ye who are the teachers thereof must devote more of your 
efforts to character training than instruction, and must raise up your 
girl children to be modest and chaste, of good character and conduct -- 
and in addition must teach them the various branches of knowledge.</p>
<p>	If ye follow this course, the confirmations of the All- Glorious 
Kingdom, in a great rolling swell, will rise and surge above that 
school.</p>
<p>	My hope is that ye will succeed in this.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	634. In this holy Cause the question of orphans hath the utmost 
importance. The greatest consideration must be shown towards orphans; 
they must be taught, trained and educated. The Teachings of Baha'u'llah,
 especially, must by all means be given to them as far as is possible.<br>

</p><p>	I supplicate God that thou mayest become a kind parent to 
orphaned children, quickening them with the fragrances of the Holy 
Spirit, so that they will attain the age of maturity as true servants of
 the world of humanity and as bright candles in the assemblage of 
mankind.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 112, p. 138)</p>
<p>	635. Your letter hath come and hath occasioned the utmost joy, with 
its news that, praised be God, in Hamadan a welfare and relief 
association hath been established. I trust that this will become a 
source of general prosperity and assistance, and that means will be 
provided to set the hearts of the poor and weak at rest, and to educate 
the orphans and other children.</p>
<p>	The question of training the children and looking after the orphans 
is extremely important, but most important of all is the education of 
girl children, for these girls will one day be mothers, and the mother 
is the first teacher of the child. In whatever way she reareth the 
child, so will the child become, and the results of that first training 
will remain with the individual throughout his entire life, and it would
 be most difficult to alter them. And how can a mother, herself ignorant
 and untrained, educate her child? It is therefore clear that the 
education of girls is of far greater consequence than that of boys. This
 fact is extremely important, and the matter must be seen to with the 
greatest energy and dedication.</p>
<p>     God sayeth in the Qur'an that they shall not be equals,<br>
those who have knowledge and those who have it not.[1]<br>
Ignorance is thus utterly to be blamed, whether in male or<br>
female; indeed, in the female its harm is greater. I hope,<br>
therefore, that the friends will make strenuous efforts to<br>
educate their children, sons and daughters alike. This is<br>
verily the truth, and outside the truth there is manifestly<br>
naught save perdition.<br>
 [1 Qur'an 39:12] </p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	636. Thou didst write about the believers' daughters who attend the 
schools of other faiths. It is true that, while these children do learn a
 little in such schools, still the character and behaviour of the women 
teachers have an effect on them, and through the inculcation of doubts 
and ambiguities, the minds of these girls are influenced and changed.<br>

</p><p>	It is incumbent upon the friends to provide a school for Baha'i 
girls whose women teachers will educate their pupils according to the 
teachings of God. There must the girls be taught spiritual ethics and 
holy ways.</p>
<p>	A child is as a young plant: it will grow in whatever way you train 
it. If you rear it to be truthful, and kind, and righteous, it will grow
 straight, it will be fresh and tender, and will flourish. But if not, 
then from faulty training it will grow bent, and stand awry, and there 
will be no hope of changing it.</p>
<p>	Certainly, the women teachers from Europe give instruction in 
language and scripts, and housekeeping, and embroidery and sewing; but 
their pupils' character is completely altered, to such a point that the 
girls no longer care for their mothers, their disposition is spoiled, 
they misbehave, they become self-satisfied and proud.</p>
<p>	Rather, girls ought to be trained in such a manner that from day to 
day they will become more self-effacing, more humble, and will defer to 
and obey their parents and forebears, and be a comfort and a solace to 
all.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	637. Consider that if the mother is a believer, the children will 
become believers too, even if the father denieth the Faith; while, if 
the mother is not a believer, the children are deprived of faith, even 
if the father be a believer convinced and firm. Such is the usual 
outcome, except in rare cases.</p>
<p>	For this reason both fathers and mothers must carefully watch over 
their little daughters and have them thoroughly taught in the schools by
 highly qualified women teachers, so that they may familiarize 
themselves with all the sciences and arts and become acquainted with and
 reared in all that is necessary for human living, and will provide a 
family with comfort and joy.</p>
<p>	It is therefore incumbent upon the Spiritual Assembly of 'Ishqabad 
to take the lead in this most urgent matter, so that by the grace and 
favour of God they may establish an institution which will be a source 
of security and happiness forever and ever.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	638. O handmaids of the beauty of Abha! Your letter hath come, 
and its perusal brought great joy. Praised be God, the women believers 
have organized meetings where they will learn how to teach the Faith, 
will spread the sweet savours of the Teachings and make plans for 
training the children.</p>
<p>	This gathering must be completely spiritual. That is, the 
discussions must be confined to marshalling clear and conclusive proofs 
that the Sun of Truth hath indeed arisen. And further, those present 
should concern themselves with every means of training the girl 
children; with teaching the various branches of knowledge, good 
behaviour, a proper way of life, the cultivation of a good character, 
chastity and constancy, perseverance, strength, determination, firmness 
of purpose; with household management, the education of children, and 
whatever especially applieth to the needs of girls -- to the end that 
these girls, reared in the stronghold of all perfections, and with the 
protection of a goodly character, will, when they themselves become 
mothers, bring up their children from earliest infancy to have a good 
character and conduct themselves well.</p>
<p>	Let them also study whatever will nurture the health of the body and
 its physical soundness, and how to guard their children from disease.</p>
<p>	When matters are thus well arranged, every child will become a peerless plant in the gardens of the Abha Paradise.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 94, pp.123-24)</p>
<p>	639. Today it is obligatory for the loved ones of God, and their 
imperative duty, to educate the children in reading, writing, the 
various branches of knowledge, and the expansion of consciousness, that 
on all levels they may go forward day by day.</p>
<p>	The mother is the first teacher of the child. For children, at the 
beginning of life, are fresh and tender as a young twig, and can be 
trained in any fashion you desire. If you rear the child to be straight,
 he will grow straight, in perfect symmetry. It is clear that the mother
 is the first teacher and that it is she who establisheth the character 
and conduct of the child.</p>
<p>	Wherefore, O ye loving mothers, know ye that in God's sight, the 
best of all ways to worship Him is to educate the children and train 
them in<br>
 all the perfections of humankind; and no nobler deed than this can be imagined.[1]<br>
 [1 Cf. "Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i  World Centre, 1982), Sec. 114, p. 139.]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	640. O Handmaids of the Lord! The spiritual assemblage that ye 
established in that illumined city is most propitious. Ye have made 
great strides; ye have surpassed the others, have arisen to serve the 
Holy Threshold, and have won heavenly bestowals. Now with all spiritual 
zeal must ye gather in that enlightened assemblage and recite the Holy 
Writings and engage in remembering the Lord. Set ye forth His arguments 
and proofs. Work ye for the guidance of the women in that land, teach 
the young girls and the children,so that the mothers may educate their 
little ones from their earliest days, thoroughly train them, rear them 
to have a goodly character and good morals, guide them to all the 
virtues of humankind, prevent the development of any behaviour that 
would be worthy of blame, and foster them in the embrace of Baha'i 
education. Thus shall these tender infants be nurtured at the breast of 
the knowledge of God and His love. Thus shall they grow and flourish, 
and be taught righteousness and the dignity of humankind, resolution and
 the will to strive and to endure. Thus shall they learn perseverance in
 all things, the will to advance, high-mindedness and high resolve, 
chastity and purity of life. Thus shall they be enabled to carry to a 
successful conclusion whatsoever they undertake.</p>
<p>	Let the mothers consider that whatever concerneth the education of 
children is of the first importance. Let them put forth every effort in 
this regard, for when the bough is green and tender it will grow in 
whatever way ye train it. Therefore is it incumbent upon the mothers to 
rear their little ones even as a gardener tendeth his young plants. Let 
them strive by day and by night to establish within their children faith
 and certitude, the fear of God, the love of the Beloved of the worlds, 
and all good qualities and traits. Whensoever a mother seeth that her 
child hath done well, let her praise and applaud him and cheer his 
heart; and if the slightest undesirable trait should manifest itself, 
let her counsel the child and punish him, and use means based on reason,
 even a slight verbal<br>
 chastisement should this be necessary. It is not, however, permissible 
to strike a child, or vilify him, for the child's character will be 
totally perverted if he be subjected to blows or verbal abuse.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 95, pp. 124-125)</p>
<p>	641. ... O maid-servants of the Merciful! It is incumbent upon you 
to train the children from their earliest babyhood! It is incumbent upon
 you to beautify their morals! It is incumbent upon you to attend to 
them under all aspects and circumstances, inasmuch as God -- glorified 
and exalted is He! -- hath ordained mothers to be the primary trainers 
of children and infants. This is a great and important affair and a high
 and exalted position, and it is not allowable to slacken therein at 
all!</p>
<p>	If thou walkest in this right path, thou wouldst become a real mother to the children, both spiritually and materially....</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas" vol. III (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Society, 1916), Vol. III, p. 606)</p>
<p>	642. Deliver my longings and greetings to the consolation of thine 
eye[1]... and to thy younger son ... Verily I love them both even as a 
compassionate father loveth his dear children. As to thee, have for them
 an abundant love and exert thine utmost in training them, so that their
 being may grow through the milk of the love of God, forasmuch as it is 
the duty of parents to perfectly and thoroughly train their children.<br>
 [1 "Consolation of thine eye" - idiomatic Persian expression meaning "child"]</p>
<p>     There are also certain sacred duties on children toward<br>
parents which duties are written in the Book of God, as<br>
belonging to God.[1] The (children's) prosperity in this<br>
world and the Kingdom depends upon the good pleasure of<br>
parents, and without this they will be in manifest loss.<br>
 [1 In Questions and Answers, an appendix to the Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
Baha'u'llah lays  upon children the obligation of serving their parents 
and categorically states  that after the recognition of the oneness of 
God, the most important of all  duties for children is to have due 
regard for the rights of their parents.]</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. II (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Society, 1915), Vol. II, pp. 262-3)</p>
<p>	643. ...O dear one of 'Abdu'l-Baha! Be the son of thy father and be 
the fruit of that tree. Be a son that hath been born of his soul and 
heart and not only of the water and clay. A real son is such an one as 
hath branched<br>
 from the spiritual part of a man. I ask God that thou mayest be at all times confirmed and strengthened.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Vol. II, p. 342)</p>
<p>	644. O ye dear children!<br>
	Your father is compassionate, clement and merciful unto you and 
desireth for you success, prosperity and eternal life in the Kingdom of 
God. Therefore, it is incumbent upon you, dear children, to seek his 
good pleasure, to be guided by his guidance, to be drawn by the magnet 
of the love of God and be brought up in the lap of the love of God; that
 ye may become beautiful branches in the Gardens of EL-ABHA, verdant and
 watered by the abundance of the gift of God.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Vol. III, p. 622)</p>
<p>	645. It is incumbent upon the youth to walk in the footsteps of 
Hakim[1] and to be trained in his ways, for such important souls as he 
and his like have now ascended to the Kingdom of Abha. The youth must 
grow and develop and take the place of their fathers, that this abundant
 grace, in the posterity of each one of the loved ones of God who bore 
great agonies, may day by day increase, until in the end it shall yield 
its fruit on earth and in Heaven.<br>
 [1 One of the distinguished believers of Qazvin]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	646. The Sunday school for the children in which the Tablets and 
Teachings of Baha'u'llah are read, and the Word of God is recited for 
the children is indeed a blessed thing. Thou must certainly continue 
this organized activity without cessation, and attach importance to it, 
so that day by day it may grow and be quickened with the breaths of the 
Holy Spirit. If this activity is well organized, rest thou assured that 
it will yield great results. Firmness and steadfastness, however, are 
necessary, otherwise it will continue for some time, but later be 
gradually forgotten. Perseverance is an essential condition. In every 
project firmness and steadfastness will undoubtedly lead to good 
results; otherwise it will exist for some days, and then be 
discontinued.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", Sec. 124, pp. 143-44)<br>

</p><p>	647. O ye children of the Kingdom:<br>
	Your letters with your photographs have been received. From the perusal
 of the letters the utmost heartfelt emotions were experienced and at 
the sight of the portraits a spiritual joy and gladness was felt. Praise
 be to God the letters were indicative of the turning of the faces 
toward the Kingdom and from those faces it was evident that the light of
 the love of God is manifest and resplendent upon the brows.</p>
<p>	I pray to God that in this school on Sundays ye may acquire heavenly
 knowledge, ye may secure a training of merciful characteristics and 
that ye may advance from day to day so that each of you may become a 
peerless shrub in the Divine Rose-garden and may be adorned with full 
foliage, and fruits.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to the children of the Baha'i school, Urbana, 
Illinois, published in "The Magazine of The Children of the Kingdom" 
Vol. I, No. 2 (March, 1920), p. 2)</p>
<p>	648. O young trees and plants, matchless and tender, that grow in 
the meadows of guidance! O ye newcomers to the Fraternity of Truth!</p>
<p>	Although now ye be learners, the hope is that through showerings 
from the clouds of grace, ye will become teachers; that ye will flourish
 even as flowers and fragrant herbs in the garden of that knowledge 
which is both of the mind and of the heart; that each one of you will 
grow as a tree rich in yield, fair, fresh and strong, heavy with sweet 
fruit.</p>
<p>	May the hidden confirmations of God make each one of you to become a
 well-spring of knowledge. May your hearts ever receive inspiration from
 the Denizens of the Concourse on high. May the drop become as the great
 sea; may the mote dazzle as the shining sun.</p>
<p>	His Holiness the Bab hath said: "Should a tiny ant desire in this 
day to be possessed of such power as to be able to unravel the 
abstrusest and most bewildering passages of the Qur'an, its wish will no
 doubt be fulfilled, inasmuch as the mystery of eternal might vibrates 
within the innermost being of all created things."[1] If so helpless a 
creature can be endowed with so subtle a capacity, how much more 
efficacious must be the power released through the liberal effusions of 
the grace of<br>
 Baha'u'llah! What confirmations will be garnered, what influxes of the heart!<br>
 [1 Cf. "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Selected Letters" [rev. ed.] (Wilmette:  Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 126-27.]</p>
<p>	Wherefore, O ye illumined youth, strive by night and by day to 
unravel the mysteries of the mind and spirit, and to grasp the secrets 
of the Day of God. Inform yourselves of the evidences that the Most 
Great Name hath dawned. Open your lips in praise. Adduce convincing 
arguments and proofs. Lead those who thirst to the fountain of life; 
grant ye true health to the ailing. Be ye apprentices of God; be ye 
physicians directed by God, and heal ye the sick among humankind. Bring 
those who have been excluded into the circle of intimate friends. Make 
the despairing to be filled with hope. Waken them that slumber; make the
 heedless mindful.</p>
<p>	Such are the fruits of this earthly life. Such is the station of resplendent glory.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	III. FROM THE WRITINGS OF SHOGHI EFFENDI AND LETTERS WRITTEN ON HIS BEHALF:</p>
<p>	649. For the members of the Children's Educational Work Committee 
... I supplicate Divine Assistance, that He may graciously aid them in a
 work which was so near and dear to the Master's heart and enable them 
to assist in the rise of future devoted and efficient servants to the 
Cause of God.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 23 December 1922 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, 
published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932" [rev. 
ed.], (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), p. 29)</p>
<p>	650. They must promote by every means in their power the material as
 well as the spiritual enlightenment of youth, the means for the 
education of children, institute, whenever possible, Baha'i educational 
institutions, organize and supervise their work and provide the best 
means for their progress and development.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 March 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the 
Baha'is of America, Australasia, France, Germany, British Isles, Italy, 
Japan and Switzerland, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932", p. 38)<br>

</p><p>	651. As to the spiritual activities of the "Children of the 
Kingdom" in America, my hope and prayer is that they may grow to become 
efficient servants of the Cause of Baha'u'llah. Their devotion and 
self-sacrifice, their readiness to help the cause of the Baha'i Temple, 
their activity in connection with the "Baha'i Magazine" are all 
unmistakable signs of the glorious future of the Cause in that land. May
 the care and loving-kindness of the Heavenly Father guide them, protect
 them and aid them in their future mission in life.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 November 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	652. A basic and vital requirement of these days is the matter of 
educating the boys and girls. One of the duties devolving upon the 
members of Spiritual Assemblies is that, with the support of the 
friends, they should exert all their powers to establish schools for the
 instruction of boys and girls in the things of the spirit, the 
fundamentals of teaching the Faith, reading the Sacred Writings, 
learning the history of the Faith, the secular branches of knowledge, 
the various arts and skills, and the different languages -- so that 
Baha'i methods of instruction will become so widely known that children 
from every level of society will seek to acquire divine teachings as 
well as secular knowledge in Baha'i schools, and thereby means for the 
promotion of the Cause of God will be provided.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 December 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to 
the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tihran, Iran - translated from the 
Persian)</p>
<p>	653. The "Magazine of the Children of the Kingdom", the latest issue
 of which I have just received from that indefatigable pioneer of your 
cause, ... has kindled in me such fresh hopes that I feel moved to send 
you this message of love and confidence in the great part you are 
destined to play for the future of the Cause.</p>
<p>	I feel it is urgent and important that this first and only organ of 
the Baha'i youth throughout the world should, in whatever it publishes, 
instil in its readers, and particularly in every Baha'i child, the sense
 of his unique opportunities and future responsibilities in the great 
task that awaits him in future.</p>
<p>	Its duty is to initiate, promote and mirror forth the various 
activities of the rising generation throughout the Baha'i world, to 
establish and<br>
 strengthen a bond of true fellowship amongst all the children of 
'Abdu'l-Baha whether in the East or in the West, and to unfold to their 
eyes the vision of a golden future before them. It should impress upon 
their hearts the vital necessity of establishing, now, whilst in their 
tender age, a firm foundation for their mission in life.</p>
<p>	The cause of the Children of the Kingdom, whom the Master so loved, 
and on whom He showered many a blessing and infinite loving-kindness, 
is, I assure you, still dear and close to our hearts. In you, the 
descendants of the heroic pioneers of a world Movement, rests the hope 
of achieving the task which they have so nobly begun -- their task for 
the service and salvation of all mankind.</p>
<p>	As to my humble share of service and support, I can but pray on your
 behalf, and supplicate during my hours of prayer at the three Holy 
Shrines, the guidance, the blessings, and the assistance of Baha'u'llah,
 beseeching Him most fervently to enable you, in the happy days to come,
 to establish His Kingdom and fulfil His Word. May your Magazine inspire
 you to achieve this end.</p>
<p>	(From a Letter dated 30 December 1923 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Magazine of the Children of the Kingdom, Boston, U.S.A)</p>
<p>	654. 'Abdu'l-Baha has always attached very great importance to the 
education of children and we take this opportunity to congratulate you 
on your signal success in this field of service. We hope some day your 
work will extend into the East extensively where it is so badly needed.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 9 April 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	655. In connection with the question that you had asked as to 
whether you should take a trip to the Holy Land or keep the sum to 
defray the expense of a young man you are educating. Shoghi Effendi 
wishes me to write you that although it means profound pleasure to him 
and to the members of the holy family, to welcome you in the home of our
 beloved Master and to share with you the eternal outpourings of His 
Grace in and around His blessed Shrine, he deems it of greater 
importance for you to keep up helping the young boy whom you have 
undertaken to educate. This he would advise you with a deep realization 
of Baha'u'llah's most pregnant<br>
 utterance that he who educates his child or another's it is just as though he is educating a child of Baha'u'llah Himself.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 29 May 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	656. Among the sacred obligations devolving upon the Spiritual 
Assemblies is the promotion of learning, the establishing of schools and
 creation of the necessary academic equipment and facilities for every 
boy and girl.</p>
<p>	Every child, without exception, must from his earliest years make a 
thorough study of the art of reading and writing, and according to his 
own tastes and inclinations and the degree of his capacity and powers, 
devote extreme diligence to the acquisition of learning beneficial arts 
and skills, various languages, speech, and contemporary technology.</p>
<p>	To assist the children of the poor in the attainment of these 
accomplishments, and particularly in learning the basic subjects, is 
incumbent upon the members of the Spiritual Assemblies, and is accounted
 as one of the obligations laid upon the conscience of the trustees of 
God in every land.</p>
<p>	"He that bringeth up his son or the son of another, it is as though 
he hath brought up a son of Mine; upon him rest My Glory, My 
Loving-Kindness, My Mercy, that have compassed the world."[1]<br>
 [1 "Tablet of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", rev. ed. (Haifa:   Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 128.]</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 June 1925 written by Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia)</p>
<p>	657. Shoghi Effendi was very interested to hear of the plans you are
 making for the education of your children. He hopes that they will all 
grow to be ardent adherents of the Baha'i Cause, able servants of the 
Blessed Threshold, and eloquent speakers on religious and social 
subjects. He desires to be remembered to them as well as to their dear 
father.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 24 December 1925 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	658. We had heard through various channels the wonderful way your 
children had grown to speak about the Cause in public. Shoghi Effendi's<br>
 hope is that they will, the three of them, become able and devoted 
speakers on the Cause and subjects akin to it. To do this properly they 
will need a firm foundation of scientific and literary training which 
fortunately they are obtaining. It is just as important for the Baha'i 
young boys and girls to become properly educated in colleges of high 
standing as it is to be spiritually developed. The mental as well as the
 spiritual side of the youth has to be developed before he can serve the
 Cause efficiently.</p>
<p>	From Shoghi Effendi's postscript:</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	I will specially pray for your dear children, that they, too, 
firmly-grounded through a well-guided plan of sound education, may in 
days to come serve efficiently and effectively the Cause of God. They 
are richly endowed with gifts, and my prayer is that a proper training 
may enable them to utilize those gifts for the propagation of God's 
Faith.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 November 1926 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	659. In philanthropic enterprises and acts of charity, in promotion 
of the general welfare and furtherance of the public good including that
 of every group without any exceptions whatever, let the beloved of God 
attract the favourable attention of all, and lead all the rest.</p>
<p>	Let them, freely and without charge, open the doors of their schools
 and their higher institutions for the study of sciences and the liberal
 arts, to non-Baha'i children and youth who are poor and in need.</p>
<p>	...and next is the propagation of learning and the promulgation of 
Baha'i rules of conduct, practices and laws. At this time, when the 
nation has awakened out of its sleep of negligence, and the Government 
has begun to consider the promotion and expansion of its educational 
establishment, let the Baha'i representatives in that country arise in 
such a manner that as a result of their high endeavours in every hamlet,
 village and town, of every province and district, preliminary measures 
will be taken for the setting up of institutions for the study of 
sciences, the liberal arts and religion. Let Baha'i children without any
 exceptions learn the fundamentals of reading and writing and 
familiarize themselves with the rules of conduct, the customs, practices
 and laws as set forth in the Book of God; and let them, in the new 
branches of knowledge, in the arts and technology of the day, in pure 
and praiseworthy characteristics -- Baha'i conduct, the Baha'i way of 
life -- become so distinguished above the rest<br>
 that all other communities, whether Islamic, Zoroastrian, Christian, 
Judaic or materialist, will of their own volition and most gladly enter 
their children in such advanced Baha'i institutions of learning and 
entrust them to the care of Baha'i instructors.</p>
<p>	So too is the promotion and execution of the laws set forth in the Book of God.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated January 1929 written by Shoghi Effendi to the believers of the East- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	660. Your short but impressive letter addressed to Shoghi Effendi 
was received. He perused it with deep interest and charged me to thank 
you on his behalf and to express his fondest hopes that you will pursue 
with an abiding zeal your academic studies. Being a Baha'i you are 
certainly aware of the fact that Baha'u'llah considered education as one
 of the most fundamental factors of a true civilization. This education,
 however, in order to be adequate and fruitful, should be comprehensive 
in nature and should take into consideration not only the physical and 
the intellectual side of man but also his spiritual and ethical aspects.
 This should be the programme of the Baha'i youth all over the world.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 9 July 1931 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	661. We hope that before long the Baha'is will even afford to have 
schools that would provide the children the intellectual and spiritual 
education as prescribed in the writings of Baha'u'llah and the Master.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 December 1931 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Local Spiritual Assembly of New York City)</p>
<p>	662. He is very glad to know that you attach importance to the 
training of the children, for whatever they learn in that early stage of
 their development will leave its traces upon their whole life. It 
becomes part of their nature.</p>
<p>	There is no especial book which the Guardian can recommend. It is 
for the older friends to attempt a compilation that would suit that 
purpose, and after many attempts a good one will ultimately be produced.</p>
<p>	The Master used to attach much importance to the learning by heart 
of Tablets of Baha'u'llah and the Bab. During His days it was a usual 
work<br>
 of the children of the household to learn Tablets by heart; now, 
however, those children are grown up and do not have time for such a 
thing. But the practice is most useful to implant the ideas and spirit 
those words contain into the mind of the children.</p>
<p>	With "The Dawn-Breakers" in your possession you could also arrange 
interesting stories about the early days of the Movement which the 
children would like to hear. There are also stories about the life of 
Christ, Muhammad and the other prophets which if told to the children 
will break down any religious prejudice they may have learned from older
 people of little understanding.</p>
<p>	Such stories regarding the life of different prophets together with 
their sayings will also be useful to better understand the literature of
 the Cause for there is constant reference to them. It is however the 
work of experienced people to bring together such materials and make of 
them interesting text books for the children.</p>
<p>	The Cause will gradually produce people who would answer these 
needs. It is only a question of time. What we should strive to do is to 
stimulate different individuals who have the talent to attempt the task.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 October 1932 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to a Local Spiritual Assembly and a State Teaching Committee)</p>
<p>	663. He was deeply gratified to hear that the friends are attaching 
such a great importance to the teaching and training of Baha'i children.
 The education of the youth is, undoubtedly, of paramount importance as 
it serves to deepen their understanding of the Cause and to canalize 
their energies along the most profitable lines. Inasmuch, however, as 
the national expenses of the Cause in America are daily increasing, the 
members of your Committee should be very careful not to extend beyond 
their financial resources the sphere of their activities. The plans your
 Committee has made should not develop to such an extent as to hamper 
the progress of the Temple work.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 April, 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the members of the Committee on the Teaching and Training of 
Children, published in "Baha'i News" 77 (September 1933), p.2)</p>
<p>	664. Shoghi Effendi wishes you particularly to give all your 
attention to the education of your boys so that they may become sincere,
 loyal and<br>
 active Baha'is. It is to the youth that we should look for help, and it
 is, therefore, the sacred obligation of the parents to provide their 
children with a thorough Baha'i training.</p>
<p>(From a letter dated 31 May 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi<br>
Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	665. The Baha'i Faith ... advocates compulsory education...</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated June 1933 written by Shoghi Effendi to the High Commissioner for Palestine)</p>
<p>	666. He was deeply gratified to learn that your material conditions 
are improving and he sincerely hopes that they will give you an 
opportunity to give to ... and ... the best educational training, so 
that they may become, in a not distant future, devoted servants and 
champions of the Cause.</p>
<p>	Your responsibility as a mother, and especially as a Baha'i mother, 
whose sacred obligation is to look after the training of the children 
along Baha'i lines, is indeed immense. It is hoped that through God's 
help and guidance you will be enabled to fully discharge your duties.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 July 1933 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	667. Shoghi Effendi was deeply saddened to learn from your letter...
 of the rather serious situation which your daughter's conduct and her 
general attitude towards the Cause have created...</p>
<p>	Although he highly deplores this fact, and is fully aware of the bad
 repercussions which it may have on the Cause, yet he feels that nothing
 short of your motherly care and love and of the counsels which you and 
the friends can give her, can effectively remedy this situation. Above 
all, you should be patient, and confident that your efforts to that end 
are being sustained and guided through the confirmations of Baha'u'llah.
 He is surely hearing your prayers, and will no doubt accept them, and 
thus hasten the gradual and complete materialization of your hopes and 
expectations for your daughter and for the Cause.</p>
<p>	The Guardian would advise you, therefore, not to take any drastic 
action with regard to your daughter's attendance at the meetings... For 
in this way there is much greater chance to reform her character than 
through force or any other drastic method. Love and kindness have far<br>
 greater influence than punishment upon the improvement of human character.</p>
<p>	The Guardian, therefore, trusts that by this means you will succeed 
in gradually introducing a fundamental change in your daughter's life, 
and also in making of her a better and truer believer. He is fervently 
praying on her behalf that she may fully attain this station.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 January 1935 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	668. The Guardian sees no objection that reference be made to the 
fact that the teaching classes and conferences which the believers are 
now organizing might evolve in the distant future into departments of 
education, or such institutions of learning as will be established in 
the future Baha'i social order.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 July 1938 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	669. As regards your plans: the Guardian fully approves indeed of 
your view that no matter how urgent and vital the requirements of the 
teaching work may be you should under no circumstances neglect the 
education of your children, as towards them you have an obligation no 
less sacred than towards the Cause.</p>
<p>	Any plan or arrangement you may arrive at which would combine your 
twofold duties towards your family and the Cause, and would permit you 
to resume active work in the field of pioneer teaching, and also to take
 good care of your children so as to not jeopardize their future in the 
Cause would meet with the whole-hearted approval of the Guardian.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 17 July 1938 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	670. The Guardian wishes me to assure you, in particular, of his 
supplications on behalf of your children, that they may, through Divine 
confirmations and assistance, and under your loving care and protection,
 receive such training as may lead them to fully recognize and 
unreservedly accept the Faith, and provide them with the necessary 
spiritual equipment to effectively and loyally serve and promote its 
interests in the future.<br>

</p><p>	As a Baha'i mother you have certainly a most sacred and weighty 
responsibility for their spiritual development in the Cause, and you 
should from now endeavour to instil into their hearts the love of 
Baha'u'llah and thus prepare them for the full recognition and 
acceptance of His Station once they attain the age and capacity to do 
so.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 20 April, 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	671. With regard to your activities in connection with the training 
and education of Baha'i children: needless to tell you what a vital 
importance the Guardian attaches to such activities, on which so much of
 the strength, welfare and growth of the Community must necessarily 
depend. What a more sacred privilege, and also what a weightier 
responsibility than the task of rearing up the new generation of 
believers, and of inculcating into their youthful and receptive minds 
the principles and teachings of the Cause, and of thus preparing them to
 fully assume, and properly discharge the weighty responsibilities and 
obligations of their future life in the Baha'i Community.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 28 April, 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National Committee and an individual believer)</p>
<p>	672. You have asked him for detailed information concerning the 
Baha'i educational programme: there is as yet no such thing as a Baha'i 
curriculum, and there are no Baha'i publications exclusively devoted to 
this subject, since the teachings of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha do not
 present a definite and detailed educational system, but simply offer 
certain basic principles and set forth a number of teaching ideals that 
should guide future Baha'i educationalists in their efforts to formulate
 an adequate teaching curriculum which would be in full harmony with the
 spirit of the Baha'i Teachings, and would thus meet the requirements 
and needs of the modern age.</p>
<p>	These basic principles are available in the sacred writings of the 
Cause, and should be carefully studied, and gradually incorporated in 
various college and university programmes. But the task of formulating a
 system of education which would be officially recognized by the Cause, 
and enforced as such throughout the Baha'i world is one which [the] 
present-day generation of believers cannot obviously undertake, and<br>
 which has to be gradually accomplished by Baha'i scholars and educationalists of the future.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 7 June, 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	673. With regard to the statement attributed to 'Abdu'l-Baha and 
which you have quoted in your letter regarding a "problem child": these 
statements of the Master, however true in their substance, should never 
be given a literal interpretation. 'Abdu'l-Baha could have never meant 
that a child should be left to himself, entirely free. In fact Baha'i 
education, just like any other system of education, is based on the 
assumption that there are certain natural deficiencies in every child, 
no matter how gifted, which his educators, whether his parents, 
schoolmasters, or his spiritual guides and preceptors, should endeavour 
to remedy. Discipline of some sort, whether physical, moral or 
intellectual, is indeed indispensable, and no training can be said to be
 complete and fruitful if it disregards this element. The child when 
born is far from being perfect. It is not only helpless, but actually is
 imperfect, and even is naturally inclined towards evil. He should be 
trained, his natural inclinations harmonized, adjusted and controlled, 
and if necessary suppressed or regulated, so as to ensure his healthy 
physical and moral development. Baha'i parents cannot simply adopt an 
attitude of non-resistance towards their children, particularly those 
who are unruly and violent by nature. It is not even sufficient that 
they should pray on their behalf. Rather they should endeavour to 
inculcate, gently and patiently, into their youthful minds such 
principles of moral conduct and initiate them into the principles and 
teachings of the Cause with such tactful and loving care as would enable
 them to become "true sons of God" and develop into loyal and 
intelligent citizens of His Kingdom. This is the high purpose which 
Baha'u'llah Himself has clearly defined as the chief goal of every 
education.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 9 July 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	674. The task of bringing up a Baha'i child, as emphasized time and 
again in Baha'i writings, is the chief responsibility of the mother, 
whose unique privilege is indeed to create in her home such conditions 
as would be<br>
 most conducive to both his material and spiritual welfare and 
advancement. The training which a child first receives through his 
mother constitutes the strongest foundation for his future development, 
and it should therefore be the paramount concern of your wife...to 
endeavour from now imparting to her new-born son such spiritual training
 as would enable him later on to fully assume and adequately discharge 
all the responsibilities and duties of Baha'i life.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 16 November 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	675. With regard to your little daughter ...; he is truly rejoiced 
and encouraged to realize how eager you both are to provide her with a 
thoroughly Baha'i training, and is confident that under your wise and 
devoted care, and through the unfailing protection and guidance of 
Baha'u'llah she will in time develop into a devoted and loyal servant of
 the Faith.</p>
<p>	With this in mind, the Guardian thinks it would be preferable not to
 place the child in a purely Catholic institution, and to give her 
instead a broad spiritual and intellectual training that would enable 
her, at a later age, to fully appreciate the spirit of the Cause. While 
it should be your constant endeavour to bring her up in a thoroughly 
religious atmosphere, you should also be careful in keeping her away 
from all such influences that would tend to breed in her the spirit of 
religious bigotry, and thus narrow down the horizon of her spiritual 
understanding.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 12 December 1939 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to two believers)</p>
<p>	676. With reference to the question of the training of children: 
given the emphasis placed by Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha on the 
necessity for the parents to train their children while still in their 
tender age, it would seem preferable that they should receive their 
first training at home at the hand of their mother, rather than be sent 
to a nursery. Should circumstances, however, compel a Baha'i mother to 
adopt the latter course there can be no objection.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 13 November 1940 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	677. The question of the training and education of children in 
case one of the parents is a non-Baha'i is one which solely concerns the
 parents themselves, who should decide about it the way they find best 
and most conducive to the maintenance of the unity of their family, and 
to the future welfare of their children. Once the child comes of age, 
however, he should be given full freedom to choose his religion, 
irrespective of the wishes and desires of his parents.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 December 1940 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	678. The Guardian was delighted to hear of your youth group. The 
children who are trained in the world-embracing teachings of Baha'u'llah
 cannot but grow up to be a truly new race of men. He hopes these young 
people will prepare themselves for the great task which will face them 
in the future, that of helping to rebuild the world with the aid and 
inspiration of the Baha'i teachings.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 25 December 1941 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Baha'is of Hobart, Australia)</p>
<p>	679. These Baha'i children are of such great importance to the 
future. They will live in times, and have to meet problems, which never 
faced their elders. And the Cause alone can equip them to properly serve
 the needs of a future, war-weary, disillusioned, unhappy humanity. So 
their task will be very great and a very responsible one, and too much 
care cannot be devoted to their upbringing and preparation.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 January 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	680. ...The Guardian feels that it would be better for either the 
mothers of Baha'i children -- or some Committee your Assembly might 
delegate the task to -- to choose excerpts from the Sacred Words to be 
used by the child rather than just something made up. Of course prayer 
can be purely spontaneous, but many of the sentences and thoughts 
combined in Baha'i writings of a devotional nature are easy to grasp, 
and the revealed Word is endowed with a power of its own.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 8 August 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles)<br>

</p><p>	681. You Baha'i children and young people have both great 
privileges and great obligations ahead of you, for your generation will 
be the ones to help build up a new, better and more beautiful world 
after the dark years of this war are passed. You should prepare 
yourselves for this great task by trying to grasp the true meaning of 
the teachings and not just merely accepting them as something you are 
taught. They are like a wonderful new world of thought just beginning to
 be explored, and when we realize that Baha'u'llah has brought teachings
 and laws for a thousand years to come, we can readily see that each new
 generation may find some greater meaning in the writings than the ones 
gone before did.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 14 October 1942 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to some individual believers)</p>
<p>	682. The Guardian, in his remarks to ... about parents' and 
children's, wives' and husbands' relations in America, meant that there 
is a tendency in that country for children to be too independent of the 
wishes of their parents and lacking in the respect due to them....</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 22 July 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	683. Regarding your question about children fighting: the statement 
of the Master, not to strike back, should not be taken so extremely 
literally that Baha'i children must accept to be bullied and thrashed. 
If they can manage to show a better way of settling disputes than by 
active self- defence, they should naturally do so.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 11 May 1945 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	684. You ask him about the fear of God: perhaps the friends do not 
realize that the majority of human beings need the element of fear in 
order to discipline their conduct? Only a relatively very highly evolved
 soul would always be disciplined by love alone. Fear of punishment, 
fear of the anger of God if we do evil, are needed to keep people's feet
 on the right path. Of course we should love God -- but we must fear Him
 in the sense of a child fearing the righteous anger and chastisement of
 a parent; not cringe before Him as before a tyrant, but know His mercy 
exceeds His justice!</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 26 July 1946 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	685. He is sorry to hear your little boy is not developing 
satisfactorily; very few children are really bad. They do, however, 
sometimes have complicated personalities and need very wise handling to 
enable them to grow into normal, moral, happy adults. If you feel 
convinced your son will really benefit from going to Father Flanagan's 
school you could send him there. But in general we should certainly 
always avoid sending Baha'i children to orthodox religious schools, 
especially Catholic, as the children receive the imprint of religious 
beliefs we as believers know are outdated and no longer for this age. He
 will especially pray for the solution of this problem.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 30 May 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	686. Regarding the questions you asked him: there is no objection to
 children who are as yet unable to memorize a whole prayer learning 
certain sentences only.</p>
<p>	He does not feel that the friends should make a practice of saying 
grace or of teaching it to children. This is not part of the Baha'i 
Faith, but a Christian practice, and as the Cause embraces members of 
all races and religions we should be careful not to introduce into it 
the customs of our previous beliefs. Baha'u'llah has given us the 
obligatory prayers, also prayers before sleeping, for travellers, etc. 
We should not introduce a new set of prayers He has not specified, when 
He has given us already so many, for so many occasions.</p>
<p>	Your work for child education is certainly important, and he urges you to keep it up.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 27 September 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	687. In regard to your question: he feels this is a matter for you 
and your husband to decide, especially in view of his attitude towards 
the Cause; the children, being minors, are under your jurisdiction, and 
you both have sacred rights and responsibility as regards their future.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 24 November 1947 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	688. Any Baha'i can give to the Cause's Funds, adult or child. 
No statement is required on this subject; Baha'i children have always 
given to the Cause, everywhere. Whatever situation may arise in a class 
which non- Baha'i children attend is for the teacher of the class to 
solve. No ruling should be made to cover such things.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 August 1949 written on behalf of Shoghi 
Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	689. Just because you are children does not mean you cannot serve 
the Faith, and teach it, by your example and by the way you let people 
see that you are better and more intelligent than most other children.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 16 March 1952 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Santa Monica Children's Class)</p>
<p>	690. The general principle ... is that a request for excuse from 
School sessions on Baha'i Holy Days is desirable. This applies to all 
Baha'i children regardless of their age. Children of Baha'i parents, 
under the age of 15, are considered Baha'is.</p>
<p>	What a Baha'i parent or your Assembly should do is apply to the 
School Board to grant to their children permission to remain away from 
School on Baha'i Holy Days, and then abide by whatever decision the 
School Board may make, and not try in any way to force the matter.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 19 August 1952 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	691. The beloved Guardian was greatly delighted to learn of the 
success of the institute for teaching the Indian children. He feels this
 is a very fine method of implanting the teachings of the Faith in the 
hearts and the minds of the young children, so that they may grow and 
develop into strong and virile men and women who will serve the Cause. 
Likewise through this effort, he hopes you will be able to attract some 
of the parents.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 February 1954 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	692. The Guardian will pray for the spiritual development of your 
dear son. On the shoulders of the youth today rests the future of the 
Faith.<br>
 Therefore they should be well educated and trained not only in the Teachings of the Faith, but also in secular matters. </p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 24 May 1954 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	693. The Guardian is happy to see you are teaching the children, as a
 firm foundation of the Teachings in their minds will greatly assist in 
forming their characters, and enable them to become well-balanced and 
useful believers when they mature.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 6 March 1955 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	694. In explaining the fear of God to children, there is no 
objection to teaching it as 'Abdu'l-Baha so often taught everything, in 
the form of parables. Also the child should be made to understand that 
we don't fear God because He is cruel, but we fear Him because He is 
just, and, if we do wrong and deserve to be punished, then in His 
justice He may see fit to punish us. We must both love God and fear Him.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 15 February 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to some individual believers)</p>
<p>	695. Individual Baha'is may press for getting religion taught in the
 public schools, but this should not be done officially, as we don't yet
 carry enough weight.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 15 August 1957 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	SUPPLEMENT</p>
<p>	IV. EXTRACTS FROM THE TALKS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA:</p>
<p>	696. Among these children many blessed souls will arise, if they be 
trained according to the Baha'i Teachings. If a plant is carefully 
nurtured by a gardener, it will become good, and produce better fruit. 
These children must be given a good training from their earliest 
childhood. They must be given a systematic training which will further 
their development from day to day, in order that they may receive 
greater insight, so that their spiritual receptivity be broadened. 
Beginning in childhood they must receive instruction. They cannot be 
taught through books. Many elementary sciences must be made clear to 
them in the nursery; they must learn them in play, in amusement. Most 
ideas must be taught them through speech, not by book learning. One 
child must question the other concerning these things, and the other 
child must give the answer. In this way, they will make great progress. 
For example, mathematical problems must also be taught in the form of 
questions and answers. One of the children asks a question and the other
 must give the answer. Later on, the children will of their own accord 
speak with each other concerning these same subjects. The children who 
are at the head of the class must receive premiums. They must be 
encouraged and when any one of them shows good advancement, for the 
further development they must be praised and encouraged therein. Even so
 in Godlike affairs. Oral questions must be asked and the answers must 
be given orally. They must discuss with each other in this manner.</p>
<p>	("The Baha'i World", Vol. 9 (1940-1944)(Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1945), p. 543)</p>
<p>	697. Educate the children in their infancy in such a way that they 
may become exceedingly kind and merciful to the animals. If the animal 
is sick they should endeavour to cure it; if it is hungry they should 
feed it; if it is thirsty, they should satisfy its thirst; if it is 
tired they should give it rest.</p>
<p>	Man is generally sinful and the animal is innocent; unquestionably 
one must be more kind and merciful to the innocent. The harmful animals,
 such as the bloodthirsty wolf, the poisonous snake and other<br>
 injurious animals are excepted, because mercy towards these is cruelty to man, and other animals.</p>
<p>	("The Baha'i World", Vol. 9, p. 544)</p>
<p>	698. The art of music is divine and effective. It is the food of the
 soul and spirit. Through the power and charm of music the spirit of man
 is uplifted. It has wonderful sway and effect in the hearts of 
children, for their hearts are pure and melodies have great influence in
 them. The latent talents with which the hearts of these children are 
endowed will find expression through the medium of music. Therefore, you
 must exert yourselves to make them proficient; teach them to sing with 
excellence and effect. It is incumbent upon each child to know something
 of music, for without knowledge of this art the melodies of instrument 
and voice cannot be rightly enjoyed. Likewise, it is necessary that the 
schools teach it in order that the souls and hearts of the pupils may 
become vivified and exhilarated and their lives be brightened with 
enjoyment.</p>
<p>	Today illumined and spiritual children are gathered in this meeting.
 They are the children of the Kingdom. The Kingdom of heaven is for such
 souls as these, for they are near to God. They have pure hearts. They 
have spiritual faces. The effect of the divine teachings is manifest in 
the perfect purity of their hearts. That is why Christ has addressed the
 world, saying, "Except ye be converted, and become as little children, 
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven" -- that is, men must 
become pure in heart to know God. The teachings have had great effect. 
Spiritual souls! Tender souls! The hearts of all children are of the 
utmost purity. They are mirrors upon which no dust has fallen. But this 
purity is on account of weakness and innocence, not on account of any 
strength and testing, for as this is the early period of their 
childhood, their hearts and minds are unsullied by the world. They 
cannot display any great intelligence. They have neither hypocrisy nor 
deceit. This is on account of the child's weakness, whereas the man 
becomes pure through his strength. Through the power of intelligence he 
becomes simple; through the great power of reason and understanding and 
not through the power of weakness he becomes sincere. When he attains to
 the state of perfection, he will receive these qualities; his heart 
becomes purified, his spirit enlightened, his soul is sensitized and 
tender -- all through his great strength. This is the difference between
 the perfect man and the child. Both have the<br>
 underlying qualities of simplicity and sincerity -- the child through 
the power of weakness and the man through the power of strength.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	I give you my advice, and it is this: Train these children with 
divine exhortations. From their childhood instill in their hearts the 
love of God so they may manifest in their lives the fear of God and have
 confidence in the bestowals of God. Teach them to free themselves from 
human imperfections and to acquire the divine perfections latent in the 
heart of man. The life of man is useful if he attains the perfections of
 man. If he becomes the center of the imperfections of the world of 
humanity, death is better than life, and nonexistence better than 
existence. Therefore, make ye an effort in order that these children may
 be rightly trained and educated and that each of them may attain 
perfection in the world of humanity. Know ye the value of these children
 for they are all my children.</p>

'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
2nd. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 52-54)</p>
<p>	699. If a pupil is told that his intelligence is less than his 
fellow pupils, it is a very great drawback and handicap to his progress.
 He must be encouraged to advance...</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace", pp. 76-77)</p>
<p>	700. ...According to the teachings of Baha'u'llah the family, being a
 human, unit must be educated according to the rules of sanctity. All 
the virtues must be taught the family. The integrity of the family bond 
must be constantly considered, and the rights of the individual members 
must not be transgressed. The rights of the son, the father, the mother 
-- none of them must be transgressed, none of them must be arbitrary. 
Just as the son has certain obligations to his father, the father, 
likewise, has certain obligations to his son. The mother, the sister and
 other members of the household have certain prerogatives. All these 
rights and prerogatives must be conserved, yet the unity of the family 
must be sustained. The injury of one shall be considered the injury of 
all; the comfort of each, the comfort of all; the honor of one, the 
honor of all.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace", p. 168)<br>

</p><p>	701. He promulgated the adoption of the same course of education
 for man and woman. Daughters and sons must follow the same curriculum 
of study, thereby promoting unity of the sexes. When all mankind shall 
receive the same opportunity of education and the equality of men and 
women be realized, the foundations of war will be utterly destroyed. 
Without equality this will be impossible because all differences and 
distinction are conducive to discord and strife. Equality between men 
and women is conducive to the abolition of warfare for the reason that 
women will never be willing to sanction it. Mothers will not give their 
sons as sacrifices upon the battlefield after twenty years of anxiety 
and loving devotion in rearing them from infancy, no matter what cause 
they are called upon to defend. There is no doubt that when women obtain
 equality of rights, war will entirely cease among mankind.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace", p. 175)</p>
<p>	702. The child must not be oppressed or censured because it is undeveloped; it must be patiently trained....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 180-1)</p>
<p>	703. Baha'u'llah has announced that inasmuch as ignorance and lack 
of education are barriers of separation among mankind, all must receive 
training and instruction. Through this provision the lack of mutual 
understanding will be remedied and the unity of mankind furthered and 
advanced. Universal education is a universal law....</p>
<p>("The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 300)</p>
<p>	704. The education of each child is compulsory.... In addition to 
this wide-spread education each child must be taught a profession, art, 
or trade, so that every member of the community will be enabled to earn 
his own livelihood. Work done in the spirit of service is the highest 
form of worship....</p>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS ON THE SPIRITUAL CHARACTER OF BAHA'I ELECTIONS</p>
<p>	From letters written by Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	705. Beware, beware lest the foul odour of the parties and peoples 
of foreign lands in the West, and their pernicious methods, such as 
intrigues, party politics and propaganda- -practices which are abhorrent
 even in name -- should ever reach the Baha'i community, exert any 
influence whatsoever upon the friends, and thus bring all spirituality 
to naught. The friends should, through their devotion, love, loyalty and
 altruism, abolish these evil practices, not imitate them. It is only 
after the friends completely ignore and sanctify themselves from these 
evils, that the spirit of God can penetrate and operate in the body of 
humanity, and in the Baha'i community.</p>
<p>	(30 January 1923 to the Central Spiritual Assembly of Iran -- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	706. On the election day, the friends must wholeheartedly 
participate in the elections, in unity and amity, turning their hearts 
to God, detached from all things but Him, seeking His guidance and 
supplicating His aid and bounty.</p>
<p>	(27 February 1923 to the Baha'i in the East -- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	707. ...I earnestly appeal to every one of you ... to make ... yet 
another effort, this time more spontaneous and selfless than before, and
 endeavour to approach your task .. . with that purity of spirit that 
can alone obtain our Beloved's most cherished desire. Let us recall His 
explicit and often repeated assurances that every Assembly elected in 
that rarefied atmosphere of selflessness and detachment is in truth 
appointed of God...</p>
<p>	(23 February 1924 to the Baha'is in North America, published in 
"Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932" (Wilmette: Baha'i 
Publishing Trust, 1980), p. 65)</p>
<p>	708. If we but turn our gaze to the high qualifications of the 
members of Baha'i Assemblies, ... we are filled with feelings of 
unworthiness and dismay, and would feel truly disheartened but for the 
comforting thought<br>
 that if we rise to play nobly our part every deficiency in our lives 
will be more than compensated by the all- conquering spirit of His grace
 and power. Hence it is incumbent upon the chosen delegates to consider 
without the least trace of passion and prejudice, and irrespective of 
any material consideration, the names of only those who can best combine
 the necessary qualities of unquestioned loyalty, of selfless devotion, 
of a well-trained mind, of recognized ability and mature experience....</p>
<p>	(3 June 1925 to the Baha'i Convention, published in "Baha'i Administration" p. 88)</p>
<p>	709. I feel that reference to personalities before the election 
would give rise to misunderstanding and differences. What the friends 
should do is to get thoroughly acquainted with one another, to exchange 
views, to mix freely and discuss among themselves the requirements and 
qualifications for such a membership without reference or application, 
however indirect, to particular individuals. We should refrain from 
influencing the opinion of others, of canvassing for any particular 
individual, but should stress the necessity of getting fully acquainted 
with the qualifications of membership referred to in our Beloved's 
Tablets and of learning more about one another through direct, personal 
experience rather than through the reports and opinions of our friends.</p>
<p>	(14 May 1927 to a Local Spiritual Assembly, published in "Baha'i News Letter", June 1927, p. 9)</p>
<p>	710. ...the elector ... is called upon to vote for none but those 
whom prayer and reflection have inspired him to uphold. Moreover, the 
practice of nomination, so detrimental to the atmosphere of a silent and
 prayerful election, is viewed with mistrust inasmuch as it gives the 
right to deny that God-given right of every elector to vote only in 
favour of those whom he is conscientiously convinced are the most worthy
 candidates....</p>
<p>	(27 May 1927 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration", p. 136)</p>
<p>	711. Baha'i elections of the Community are ... sanctified from all 
traces of canvassing and plotting that characterize the activities of 
the perfidious.</p>
<p>	(13 December 1932 to the Baha'is in Iran -- translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	712. I greatly value your suggestions, but I do not feel it to 
be in keeping with the spirit of the Cause to impose any limitation upon
 the freedom of the believers to choose those of any race, nationality 
or temperament who best combine the essential qualifications for 
membership of administrative institutions. They should disregard 
personalities and concentrate their attention on the qualities and 
requirements of office, without prejudice, passion or partiality. The 
Assembly should be representative of the choicest and most varied and 
capable elements in every Baha'i community....</p>
<p>	(11 August 1933 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>     From letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	713. One's vote should be kept confidential. It is not permissible 
to make any reference whatsoever to individual names. The friends must 
avoid the evil methods and detestable practices of the politicians. They
 must turn completely to God, and with a purity of motive, a freedom of 
spirit and a sanctity of heart, participate in the elections; otherwise 
the outcome will be chaos and confusion, serious difficulties will 
ensue, mischief will abound and the confirmation of God will be cut off.</p>
<p>	(16 January 1923 to the Central Spiritual Assembly of Iran- -translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	714. Let them exercise the utmost vigilance so that the elections 
are carried out freely, universally and by secret ballot. Any form of 
intrigue, deception, collusion and compulsion must be stopped and is 
forbidden.</p>
<p>	(8 March 1932 to a Local Spiritual Assembly -- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	715. The strength and progress of the Baha'i community depend upon 
the election of pure, faithful and active souls... Canvassing is 
deprecated....</p>
<p>	(9 April 1932 to a Local Spiritual Assembly -- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	716. The electors ... must prayerfully and devotedly and after 
meditation and reflection elect faithful, sincere, experienced, capable 
and competent souls who are worthy of membership....</p>
<p>	(1 July 1943 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran -- translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	717. In regard to your question about qualifications of 
delegates and Assembly members: the qualifications which he outlined are
 really applicable to anyone we elect to a Baha'i office, whatever its 
nature. But these are only an indication, they do not mean people who 
don't fulfil them cannot be elected to office. We must aim as high as we
 can....</p>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH, 'ABDU'L-BAHA, AND 
SHOGHI EFFENDI REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF 
JUSTICE</p>
<p>	I. From the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	718. The endowments dedicated to charity revert to God, the Revealer
 of Signs. No one has the right to lay hold on them without leave from 
the Dawning-Place of Revelation. After Him the decision rests with the 
Aghsan [Branches], and after them with the House of Justice -- should it
 be established in the world by then -- so that they may use these 
endowments for the benefit of the Sites exalted in this Cause, and for 
that which they have been commanded by God, the Almighty, the 
All-Powerful. Otherwise the endowments should be referred to the people 
of Baha, who speak not without His leave and who pass no judgement but 
in accordance with that which God has ordained in this Tablet, they who 
are the champions of victory betwixt heaven and earth, so that they may 
spend them on that which has been decreed in the Holy Book by God, the 
Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Aqdas " -- Provisional translation from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	719. O ye Men of Justice! Be ye in the realm of God shepherds unto 
His sheep and guard them from the ravening wolves that have appeared in 
disguise, even as ye would guard your own sons. Thus exhorteth you the 
Counsellor, the Faithful.</p>
<p>	("A Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the Most Holy 
Book of Baha'u'llah", 1st ed. (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1973),p. 16)</p>
<p>	720. The men of God's House of Justice have been charged with the 
affairs of the people. They, in truth, are the Trustees of God among His
 servants and the daysprings of authority in His countries.</p>
<p>	O people of God! That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is
 upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are the
 sources of life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a new 
problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should
 be referred to the Ministers of the House of Justice that they may act<br>
 according to the needs and requirements of the time. They that, for the
 sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of divine 
inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. It is incumbent upon all to be 
obedient unto them. All matters of State should be referred to the House
 of Justice, but acts of worship must be observed according to that 
which God hath revealed in His Book.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), pp. 26-27)</p>
<p>	721. It is incumbent upon the Trustees of the House of Justice to 
take counsel together regarding those things which have not outwardly 
been revealed in the Book, and to enforce that which is agreeable to 
them. God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth, and He, 
verily, is the Provider, the Omniscient.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah", p. 68)</p>
<p>	722. We exhort the men of the House of Justice and command them to 
ensure the protection and safeguarding of men, women and children. It is
 incumbent upon them to have the utmost regard for the interests of the 
people at all times and under all conditions. Blessed is the ruler who 
succoureth the captive, and the rich one who careth for the poor, and 
the just one who secureth from the wrong doer the rights of the 
downtrodden, and happy the trustee who observeth that which the 
Ordainer, the Ancient of Days hath prescribed unto him.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah", pp. 69-70)</p>
<p>	723. First: It is incumbent upon the ministers of the House of 
Justice to promote the Lesser Peace so that the people of the earth may 
be relieved from the burden of exorbitant expenditures. This matter is 
imperative and absolutely essential, inasmuch as hostilities and 
conflict lie at the root of affliction and calamity.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah", p. 89)</p>
<p>	724. According to the fundamental laws which We have formerly 
revealed in the "Kitab-i-Aqdas" and other Tablets, all affairs are 
committed to the care of just kings and presidents and of the Trustees 
of the House of Justice. Having pondered on that which We have 
enunciated, every man<br>
 of equity and discernment will readily perceive, with his inner and 
outer eyes, the splendours of the day-star of justice which radiate 
therefrom.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah", p. 93)</p>
<p>	725. In the abundance of Our grace and loving-kindness We have 
revealed specially for the rulers and ministers of the world that which 
is conducive to safety and protection, tranquillity and peace; haply the
 children of men may rest secure from the evils of oppression. He, 
verily, is the Protector, the Helper, the Giver of victory. It is 
incumbent upon the men of God's House of Justice to fix their gaze by 
day and by night upon that which hath shone forth from the Pen of Glory 
for the training of peoples, the upbuilding of nations, the protection 
of man and the safeguarding of his honour.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah", p. 125)</p>
<p>	726. The purpose of religion as revealed from the heaven of God's 
holy Will is to establish unity and concord amongst the peoples of the 
world; make it not the cause of dissension and strife. The religion of 
God and His divine law are the most potent instruments and the surest of
 all means for the dawning of the light of unity amongst men. The 
progress of the world, the development of nations, the tranquillity of 
peoples, and the peace of all who dwell on earth are among the 
principles and ordinances of God. Religion bestoweth upon man the most 
precious of all gifts, offereth the cup of prosperity, imparteth eternal
 life, and showereth imperishable benefits upon mankind. It behoveth the
 chiefs and rulers of the world, and in particular the Trustees of God's
 House of Justice, to endeavour to the utmost of their power to 
safeguard its position, promote its interests and exalt its station in 
the eyes of the world. In like manner it is incumbent upon them to 
enquire into the conditions of their subjects and to acquaint themselves
 with the affairs and activities of the divers communities in their 
dominions. We call upon the manifestations of the power of God -- the 
sovereigns and rulers on earth -- to bestir themselves and do all in 
their power that haply they may banish discord from this world and 
illumine it with the light of concord.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah", pp. 129-30)<br>

</p><p>	II. From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Bahai:</p>
<p>	727. ...for 'Abdu'l-Baha is in a tempest of dangers and infinitely 
abhors differences of opinion... Praise be to God, there are no grounds 
for differences.</p>
<p>	The Bab, the Exalted One, is the Morn of Truth, the splendour of 
Whose light shineth through all regions. He is also the Harbinger of the
 Most Great Light, the Abha Luminary. The Blessed Beauty is the One 
promised by the sacred books of the past, the revelation of the Source 
of light that shone upon Mount Sinai, Whose fire glowed in the midst of 
the Burning Bush. We are, one and all, servants of Their threshold, and 
stand each as a lowly keeper at Their door.</p>
<p>	My purpose is this, that ere the expiration of a thousand years, no 
one has the right to utter a single word, even to claim the station of 
Guardianship. The Most Holy Book is the Book to which all peoples shall 
refer, and in it the Laws of God have been revealed. Laws not mentioned 
in the Book should be referred to the decision of the Universal House of
 Justice. There will be no grounds for difference... Beware, beware lest
 anyone create a rift or stir up sedition. Should there be differences 
of opinion, the Supreme House of Justice would immediately resolve the 
problems. Whatever will be its decision, by majority vote, shall be the 
real truth, inasmuch as that House is under the protection, unerring 
guidance and care of the one true Lord. He shall guard it from error and
 will protect it under the wing of His sanctity and infallibility. He 
who opposes it is cast out and will eventually be of the defeated.</p>
<p>	The Supreme House of Justice should be elected according to the 
system followed in the election of the parliaments of Europe. And when 
the countries would be guided, the Houses of Justice of the various 
countries would elect the Supreme House of Justice.</p>
<p>	At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country appoint 
their delegates, and these in turn elect their representatives, and 
these representatives elect a body, that body shall be regarded as the 
Supreme House of Justice.</p>
<p>	The establishment of that House is not dependent upon the conversion
 of all the nations of the world. For example, if conditions were 
favourable and no disturbances would be caused, the friends in Persia 
would elect their representatives, and likewise the friends in America, 
in India, and other areas would also elect their representatives, and 
these<br>
 would elect a House of Justice. That House of Justice would be the Supreme House of Justice. That is all.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. 3 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing 
Society, 1916), pp. 499-501; cited in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages 
1963-1968", 1st rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1976) pp. 
47-48)</p>
<p>	728. Those matters of major importance which constitute the 
foundation of the Law of God are explicitly recorded in the Text, but 
subsidiary laws are left to the House of Justice. The wisdom of this is 
that the times never remain the same, for change is a necessary quality 
and an essential attribute of this world, and of time and place. 
Therefore the House of Justice will take action accordingly.</p>
<p>	Let it not be imagined that the House of Justice will take any 
decision according to its own concepts and opinions. God forbid! The 
Supreme House of Justice will take decisions and establish laws through 
the inspiration and confirmation of the Holy Spirit, because it is in 
the safekeeping and under the shelter and protection of the Ancient 
Beauty, and obedience to its decisions is a bounden and essential duty 
and an absolute obligation, and there is no escape for anyone.</p>
<p>	Say, O people: Verily the Supreme House of Justice is under the 
wings of your Lord, the Compassionate, the All- Merciful, that is, under
 His protection, His care, and His shelter; for He has commanded the 
firm believers to obey that blessed, sanctified and all-subduing body, 
whose sovereignty is divinely ordained and of the Kingdom of Heaven and 
whose laws are inspired and spiritual.</p>
<p>	Briefly, this is the wisdom of referring the laws of society to the 
House of Justice. In the religion of Islam, similarly, not every 
ordinance was explicitly revealed; nay not a tenth part of a tenth part 
was included in the Text; although all matters of major importance were 
specifically referred to, there were undoubtedly thousands of laws which
 were unspecified. These were devised by the divines of a later age 
according to the laws of Islamic jurisprudence, and individual divines 
made conflicting deductions from the original revealed ordinances. All 
these were enforced. Today this process of deduction is the right of the
 body of the House of Justice, and the deductions and conclusions of 
individual learned men have no authority, unless they are endorsed by 
the House of Justice. The difference is precisely this, that from the 
conclusions and<br>
 endorsements of the body of the House of Justice whose members are 
elected by and known to the worldwide Baha'i community, no differences 
will arise; whereas the conclusions of individual divines and scholars 
would definitely lead to differences, and result in schism, division, 
and dispersion. The oneness of the Word would be destroyed, the unity of
 the Faith would disappear, and the edifice of the Faith of God would be
 shaken.</p>
<p>	("Rahiq-i- Makhtum" vol. I, pp. 302-4; "Baha'i News" 426 (September 1966), p. 2; cited in "Wellspring of Guidance" pp. 84-6)</p>
<p>	729. The substance is, that prior to the completion of a thousand 
years, no individual may presume to breathe a word. All must consider 
themselves to be of the order of subjects, submissive and obedient to 
the commandments of God and the laws of the House of Justice. Should any
 deviate by so much as a needle's point from the decrees of the 
Universal House of Justice, or falter in his compliance therewith, then 
is he of the outcast and rejected.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", [Rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 33, p. 68.)</p>
<p>	730. The House of Justice, however, according to the explicit text 
of the Law of God, is confined to men; this for a wisdom of the Lord 
God's, which will ere long be made manifest as clearly as the sun at 
high noon.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 38, p. 80)</p>
<p>	731. Praise be to God, all such doors are closed in the Cause of 
Baha'u'llah for a special authoritative Centre hath been appointed -- a 
Centre that solveth all difficulties and wardeth off all differences. 
The Universal House of Justice, likewise, wardeth off all differences 
and whatever it prescribeth must be accepted and he who transgresseth is
 rejected. But this Universal House of Justice which is the Legislature 
hath not yet been instituted.</p>
<p>	Thus it is seen that no means for dissension hath been left, but 
carnal desires are the cause of difference as it is the case with the 
violators. These do not doubt the validity of the Covenant but selfish 
motives have dragged them to this condition. It is not that they do not 
know what they do -- they are perfectly aware and still they exhibit 
opposition.<br>

</p><p>	(From a Tablet dated 24 July, 1919 to an individual believer -- 
translated from the Persian; published in "Selections from the Writings 
of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 187, pp. 215-16.)</p>
<p>	732. The sacred and youthful branch, the Guardian of the Cause of 
God as well as the Universal House of Justice, to be universally elected
 and established, are both under the care and protection of the Abha 
Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of His Holiness, the 
Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they 
decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not 
obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled 
against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with 
them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed 
with God; whoso denieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him 
hath disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth
 aside from him hath in truth deviated, separated himself and turned 
aside from God. May the wrath, the fierce indignation, the vengeance of 
God rest upon him! The mighty stronghold shall remain impregnable and 
safe through obedience to him who is the Guardian of the Cause of God. 
It is incumbent upon the members of the House of Justice, upon all the 
Aghsan, the Afnan, the Hands of the Cause of God to show their 
obedience, submissiveness and subordination unto the Guardian of the 
Cause of God, to turn unto him and be lowly before him....</p>
<p>	("Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha", (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1971), p. 11)</p>
<p>	733. And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath 
ordained as the source of all good and freed from all error, it must be 
elected by universal suffrage, that is, by the believers. Its members 
must be manifestations of the fear of God and daysprings of knowledge 
and understanding, must be steadfast in God's faith and the well-wishers
 of all mankind. By this House is meant the Universal House of Justice, 
that is, in all countries a secondary House of Justice must be 
instituted, and these secondary Houses of Justice must elect the members
 of the Universal one. Unto this body all things must be referred. It 
enacteth all ordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the 
explicit Holy<br>
 Text. By this body all the difficult problems are to be resolved and 
the Guardian of the Cause of God is its sacred head and the 
distinguished member for life of that body. Should he not attend in 
person its deliberations, he must appoint one to represent him. Should 
any of the members commit a sin, injurious to the common weal, the 
Guardian of the Cause of God hath at his own discretion the right to 
expel him, whereupon the people must elect another one in his stead. 
This House of Justice enacteth the laws and the government enforceth 
them. The legislative body must reinforce the executive, the executive 
must aid and assist the legislative body so that through the close union
 and harmony of these two forces, the foundation of fairness and justice
 may become firm and strong, that all the regions of the world may 
become even as Paradise itself.</p>
<p>	("Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha", pp. 14-15)</p>
<p>	734. This is the foundation of the belief of the people of Baha (may
 my life be offered up for them): "His Holiness, the Exalted One (the 
Bab), is the Manifestation of the Unity and Oneness of God and the 
Forerunner of the Ancient Beauty. His Holiness the Abha Beauty (may my 
life be a sacrifice for His steadfast friends) is the Supreme 
Manifestation of God and the Dayspring of His Most Divine Essence. All 
others are servants unto Him and do His bidding." Unto the Most Holy 
Book every one must turn and all that is not expressly recorded therein 
must be referred to the Universal House of Justice. That which this 
body, whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily 
the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom 
is verily of them that love discord, hath shown forth malice, and turned
 away from the Lord of the Covenant. By this House is meant that 
Universal House Justice which is to be elected from all countries, that 
is from those parts in the East and West where the loved ones are to be 
found, after the manner of the customary elections in Western countries 
such as those of England.</p>
<p>	It is incumbent upon these members (of the Universal House of 
Justice) to gather in a certain place and deliberate upon all problems 
which have caused difference, questions that are obscure and matters 
that are not expressly recorded in the Book. Whatsoever they decide has 
the same effect as the Text itself. And inasmuch as this House of 
Justice hath power to enact laws that are not expressly recorded in the 
Book and bear<br>
 upon daily transactions, so also it hath power to repeal the same. Thus
 for example, the House of Justice enacteth today a certain law and 
enforceth it, and a hundred years hence, circumstances having profoundly
 changed and the conditions having altered, another House of Justice 
will then have power, according to the exigencies of the time, to alter 
that law. This it can do because that law formeth no part of the Divine 
Explicit Text. The House of Justice is both the initiator and the 
abrogator of its own laws.</p>
<p>	("Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha", pp. 19-20)</p>
<p>	735. All must seek guidance and turn unto the Center of the Cause 
and the House of Justice. And he that turneth unto whatsoever else is 
indeed in grievous error. The Glory of Glories rest upon you!</p>
<p>	("Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 26)</p>
<p>	III. From the Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	736. To epitomize: essential infallibility belongs especially to the
 supreme Manifestations, and acquired infallibility is granted to every 
holy soul. For instance, the Universal House of Justice, if it be 
established under the necessary conditions -- with members elected from 
all the people -- that House of Justice will be under the protection and
 the unerring guidance of God. If that House of Justice shall decide 
unanimously, or by a majority, upon any question not mentioned in the 
Book, that decision and command will be guarded from mistake. Now the 
members of the House of Justice have not, individually, essential 
infallibility; but the body of the House of Justice is under the 
protection and unerring guidance of God: this is called conferred 
infallibility.</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1985), pp. 172-73)</p>
<p>	737. He [Baha'u'llah] has ordained and established the House of 
Justice, which is endowed with a political as well as a religious 
function, the consummate union and blending of church and state. This 
institution is under the protecting power of Baha'u'llah Himself. A 
universal, or international, House of Justice shall also be organized. 
Its rulings shall be in accordance with the commands and teachings of 
Baha'u'llah, and that<br>
 which the Universal House of Justice ordains shall be obeyed by all 
mankind. This international House of Justice shall be appointed and 
organized from the Houses of Justice of the whole world, and all the 
world shall come under its administration.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
2nd. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 455)</p>
<p>	IV. Extracts from letters and cables written by Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	738. As to the order and the management of the spiritual affairs of 
the friends, that which is very important now is the consolidation of 
the Spiritual Assemblies in every centre, because on these fortified and
 unshakable foundations, God's Supreme House of Justice shall be erected
 and firmly established in the days to come. When this most great 
edifice shall be reared on such an immovable foundation, God's purpose, 
wisdom, universal truths, mysteries and realities of the Kingdom, which 
the mystic Revelation of Baha'u'llah has deposited within the Will and 
Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, shall gradually be revealed and made 
manifest.</p>
<p>	(19 December 1922 to the Baha'is of the East -- translated from the Persian; published in "The Baha'i World", vol. XIV, p. 436)</p>
<p>	739. With these Assemblies, local as well as national, harmoniously,
 vigorously, and efficiently functioning throughout the Baha'i world, 
the only means for the establishment of the Supreme House of Justice 
will have been secured. And when this Supreme Body will have been 
properly established, it will have to consider afresh the whole 
situation, and lay down the principle which shall direct, so long as it 
deems advisable, the affairs of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(12 March 1923, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932" [rev. ed.], (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 
1980), p. 41)</p>
<p>	740. We are called upon by our beloved Master in His Will and 
Testament not only to adopt it [Baha'u'llah's new world order] 
unreservedly, but to unveil its merit to all the world. To attempt to 
estimate its full value, and grasp its exact significance after so short
 a time since its inception would be premature and presumptuous on our 
part. We must trust to time, and<br>
 the guidance of God's Universal House of Justice, to obtain a clearer 
and fuller understanding of its provisions and implications....</p>
<p>	(23 February 1924, published in "Baha'i Administration", p. 62)</p>
<p>	741. The purpose of so much perpetual and intensive emphasis on the 
support and consolidation of these Spiritual Assemblies is this -- that 
the foundation of the Cause of God must become broader and stronger day 
by day, that no confusion ever enter the divine order, that new and 
strong ties be forged between East and West, that Baha'i unity be 
safeguarded and illumine the eyes of the people of the world with its 
resplendent beauty, so that upon these Assemblies God's Houses of 
Justice may be firmly established and upon these secondary Houses of 
Justice the lofty edifice of the Universal House of Justice may, with 
complete order, perfection and glory, and with no delay, be raised up. 
When the Universal House of Justice shall have stepped forth from the 
realm of hope into that of visible fulfilment and its fame be 
established in every corner and clime of the world, then that august 
body -- solidly grounded and founded on the firm and unshakable 
foundation of the entire Baha'i community of East and West, and the 
recipient of the bounties of God and His inspiration -- will proceed to 
devise and carry out important undertakings, world-wide activities and 
the establishment of glorious institutions. By this means the renown of 
the Cause of God will become world-wide and its light will illumine the 
whole earth.</p>
<p>	(1924 to the Baha'is of the East -- translated from the Persian; published in "The Baha'i World" vol. XIV, p. 436)</p>
<p>	742. These Spiritual Assemblies have been primarily constituted to 
carry out these affairs, and secondly to lay a perfect and strong 
foundation for the establishment of the divine and Universal House of 
Justice. When that central pivot of the people of Baha shall be 
effectively, majestically and firmly established, a new era will dawn, 
heavenly bounties and graces will pour out from that Source, and the 
all-encompassing promises will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>	(30 October 1924 to the Spiritual Assembly of Tihran -- translated 
from the Persian; published in "The Baha'i World" vol. XIV, p. 436)<br>

</p><p>	743. Regarding the method to be adopted for the election of the 
National Spiritual Assemblies, it is clear that the text of the 
Beloved's Testament gives us no indication as to the manner in which 
these Assemblies are to be elected. In one of His earliest Tablets, 
however, addressed to a friend in Persia, the following is expressly 
recorded.</p>
<p>	"At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country appoint 
their delegates, and these in turn elect their representatives, and 
these representatives elect a body, that body shall be regarded as the 
Supreme Baytu'l- 'Adl (Universal House of Justice)"</p>
<p>	These words clearly indicate that a three-stage election has been 
provided by 'Abdu'l-Baha for the formation of the International House of
 Justice, and as it is explicitly provided in His Will and Testament 
that the "Secondary Houses of Justice (i.e. National Assemblies) must 
elect the members the Universal One", it is obvious that the members of 
the National Spiritual Assemblies will have to be indirectly elected by 
the body of the believers in their respective provinces. In view of 
these complementary instructions the principle, set forth in my letter 
of March 12th, 1923, has been established requiring the believers (the 
beloved of God) in every country to elect a certain number of delegates 
who in turn will elect their national representatives (Secondary House 
of Justice or National Spiritual Assembly), whose sacred obligation and 
privilege will be to elect in time God's Universal House of Justice.</p>
<p>	(12 May 1925, published in "Baha'i Administration", p. 84)</p>
<p>	744. It should be carefully borne in mind that the local as well as 
the international Houses of Justice have been expressly enjoined by the 
Kitab-i-Aqdas; that the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly, 
as an intermediary body, and referred to in the Master's Will as the 
"Secondary House of Justice," has the express sanction of 'Abdu'l-Baha; 
and that the method to be pursued for the election of the International 
and National Houses of Justice has been set forth by Him in His Will, as
 well as in a number of His Tablets. Moreover, the institutions of the 
local and national Funds, that are now the necessary adjuncts to all 
local and national spiritual assemblies, have not only been established 
by 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets He revealed to the Baha'is of the Orient,
 but their importance and necessity have been repeatedly emphasized by 
Him in His utterances and writings. The concentration of authority in 
the<br>
 hands of the elected representatives of the believers; the necessity of
 the submission of every adherent of the Faith to the considered 
judgment of Baha'i Assemblies; His preference for unanimity in decision;
 the decisive character of the majority vote; and even the desirability 
for the exercise of close supervision over all Baha'i publications, have
 been sedulously instilled by 'Abdu'l-Baha, as evidenced by His 
authenticated and widely-scattered Tablets. To accept His broad and 
humanitarian Teachings on one hand, and to reject and dismiss with 
neglectful indifference His more challenging and distinguishing 
precepts, would be an act of manifest disloyalty to that which He has 
cherished most in His life.</p>
<p>	That the Spiritual Assemblies of today will be replaced in time by 
the Houses of Justice, and are to all intents and purposes identical and
 not separate bodies, is abundantly confirmed by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself. 
He has in fact in a Tablet addressed to the members of the first Chicago
 Spiritual Assembly, the first elected Baha'i body instituted in the 
United States, referred to them as the members of the "House of Justice"
 for that city, and has thus with His own pen established beyond any 
doubt the identity of the present Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies with the 
Houses of Justice referred to by Baha'u'llah. For reasons which are not 
difficult to discover, it has been found advisable to bestow upon the 
elected representatives of Baha'i communities throughout the world the 
temporary appellation of Spiritual Assemblies, a term which, as the 
position and aims of the Baha'i Faith are better understood and more 
fully recognized, will gradually be superseded by the permanent and more
 appropriate designation of House of Justice. Not only will the 
present-day Spiritual Assemblies be styled differently in future, but 
they will be enabled also to add to their present functions those 
powers, duties, and prerogatives necessitated by the recognition of the 
Faith of Baha'u'llah, not merely as one of the recognized religious 
systems of the world, but as the State Religion of an independent and 
Sovereign Power. And as the Baha'i Faith permeates the masses of the 
peoples of East and West, and its truth is embraced by the majority of 
the peoples of a number of the Sovereign States of the world, will the 
Universal House of Justice attain the plenitude of its power, and 
exercise, as the supreme organ of the Baha'i Commonwealth, all the 
rights, the duties, and responsibilities incumbent upon the world's 
future super- state.<br>

</p><p>	It must be pointed out, however, in this connection that, 
contrary to what has been confidently asserted, the establishment of the
 Supreme House of Justice is in no way dependent upon the adoption of 
the Baha'i Faith by the mass of the peoples of the world, nor does it 
presuppose its acceptance by the majority of the inhabitants of any one 
country. In fact, 'Abdu'l-Baha, Himself, in one of His earliest Tablets,
 contemplated the possibility of the formation of the Universal House of
 Justice in His own lifetime, and but for the unfavorable circumstances 
prevailing under the Turkish regime, would have, in all probability, 
taken the preliminary steps for its establishment. It will be evident, 
therefore, that given favorable circumstances, under which the Baha'is 
of Persia and of the adjoining countries under Soviet rule, may be 
enabled to elect their national representatives, in accordance with the 
guiding principles laid down in 'Abdu'l- Baha's writings, the only 
remaining obstacle in the way of the definite formation of the 
International House of Justice will have been removed. For upon the 
National Houses of Justice of the East and the West devolves the task, 
in conformity with the explicit provisions of the Will, of electing 
directly the members of the International House of Justice. Not until 
they are themselves fully representative of the rank and file of the 
believers in their respective countries, not until they have acquired 
the weight and the experience that will enable them to function 
vigorously in the organic life of the Cause, can they approach their 
sacred task, and provide the spiritual basis for the constitution of so 
august a body in the Baha'i world.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	It must be also clearly understood by every believer that the 
institution of Guardianship does not under any circumstances abrogate, 
or even in the slightest degree detract from, the powers granted to the 
Universal House of Justice by Baha'u'llah in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, and 
repeatedly and solemnly confirmed by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His Will. It does 
not constitute in any manner a contradiction to the Will and Writings of
 Baha'u'llah, nor does it nullify any of His revealed instructions. It 
enhances the prestige of that exalted assembly, stabilizes its supreme 
position, safeguards its unity, assures the continuity of its labors, 
without presuming in the slightest to infringe upon the inviolability of
 its clearly-defined sphere of jurisdiction. We stand indeed too close 
to so monumental a document to claim for ourselves a complete 
understanding of all its implications, or to<br>
 presume to have grasped the manifold mysteries it undoubtedly contains.
 Only future generations can comprehend the value and significance 
attached to this Divine Masterpiece, which the Master-builder of the 
world has designed for the unification and triumph of the world-wide 
Faith of Baha'u'llah. Only those who come after us will be in a position
 to realize the value of the surprisingly strong emphasis that has been 
placed on the institution of the House of Justice and of the 
Guardianship....</p>
<p>	(27 February 1929, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah: 
Selected Letters" rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), 
pp. 5-8)</p>
<p>	745. The National Spiritual Assemblies, like unto pillars, will be 
gradually and firmly established in every country on the strong and 
fortified foundations of the Local Assemblies. On these pillars, the 
mighty edifice, the Universal House of Justice, will be erected, raising
 high its noble frame above the world of existence. The unity of the 
followers of Baha'u'llah will thus be realized and fulfilled from one 
end of the earth to the other. The explicit ordinances of His Most Holy 
Book will be promulgated, applied and carried out most befittingly in 
the world of creation, and the living waters of everlasting life will 
stream forth from that fountain-head of God's World Order upon all the 
warring nations and peoples of the world, to wash away the evils and 
iniquities of the realm of dust, heal man's age-old ills and ailments. 
Then will the visible sovereignty of the Most Great Name shake the 
foundations of the countries and nations of the world, strike fear and 
remorse in the hearts of some of the traditional ecclesiastical divines 
of various creeds and nations, and cause others to become frustrated, 
disturbed, vanquished and obliterated...</p>
<p>	In these days the things that are regarded as the most imperative of
 all and upon which will depend the development of the Cause of God, the
 enhancement of its position and prestige and the promulgation of the 
laws of His Faith, are but two momentous tasks: first, to expedite 
preparations for the formation of the divinely ordained, the Supreme 
House of Justice; second, to complete the construction of the Temple in 
the United States.</p>
<p>	(27 November 1929 to the Baha'is of Persia -- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	746. Then will the Throne of Baha'u'llah's sovereignty be founded in
 the promised land and the scales of justice be raised on high. Then 
will the<br>
 banner of the independence of the Faith be unfurled, and His Most Great
 Law be unveiled and rivers of laws and ordinances stream forth from 
this snow-white spot with all-conquering power and awe-inspiring 
majesty, the like of which past ages have never seen. Then will appear 
the truth of what was revealed by the Tongue of Grandeur: "Call out to 
Zion, O Carmel, and announce the joyful tidings: He that was hidden from
 mortal eyes is come! His all-conquering sovereignty is manifest; His 
all-encompassing splendour is revealed." "...O Carmel... Well is it with
 him that circleth around thee, that proclaimeth the revelation of thy 
glory, and recounteth that which the bounty of the Lord, thy God, hath 
showered upon thee... Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will
 manifest the people of Baha who have been mentioned in the Book of 
Names."[1]<br>
 [1 Translated by Shoghi Effendi, "Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah",  rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i<br>
Publishing Trust, 1984), pp. 15-16.]</p>
<p>	Through it the pillars of the Faith on this earth will be firmly 
established and its hidden powers be revealed, its signs shine forth, 
its banners be unfurled and its light be shed upon all peoples.</p>
<p>	(27 November 1929 to the Baha'is of Persia -- translated from the Arabic; published in "The Baha'i World", vol. XIV, p. 438)</p>
<p>	747. For Baha'u'llah, we should readily recognize, has not only 
imbued mankind with a new and regenerating Spirit. He has not merely 
enunciated certain universal principles, or propounded a particular 
philosophy, however potent, sound and universal these may be. In 
addition to these He, as well as 'Abdu'l-Baha after Him, has, unlike the
 Dispensations of the past, clearly and specifically laid down a set of 
Laws, established definite institutions, and provided for the essentials
 of a Divine Economy. These are destined to be a pattern for future 
society, a supreme instrument for the establishment of the Most Great 
Peace, and the one agency for the unification of the world, and the 
proclamation of the reign of righteousness and justice upon the earth. 
Not only have They revealed all the directions required for the 
practical realization of those ideals which the Prophets of God have 
visualized, and which from time immemorial have inflamed the imagination
 of seers and poets in every age. They have also, in unequivocal and 
emphatic language, appointed those twin institutions of the House of 
Justice and of the Guardianship as<br>
 Their chosen Successors, destined to apply the principles, promulgate 
the laws, protect the institutions, adapt loyally and intelligently the 
Faith to the requirements of progressive society, and consummate the 
incorruptible inheritance which the Founders of the Faith have 
bequeathed to the world.</p>
<p>	(28 November 1931, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", pp. 19-20)</p>
<p>	748. Then will all our cherished hopes and aspirations be realized, 
the tree of our endeavours bear fruit, the Will and Testament of our 
Master and our Beloved be fully and firmly established, and the hidden 
powers of the Cause of our Lord and God be fully manifested. Then will 
be unveiled before our eyes the inauguration of an era the like of which
 has never been witnessed in past ages....</p>
<p>	(13 December 1932 to the Baha'is of Persia -- translated from the Arabic; published in "The Baha'i World, vol. XIV, p. 438)</p>
<p>	749. To their Persian brethren, who in the heroic age of the Faith 
had won the crown of martyrdom, the American believers, forerunners of 
its golden age, were now worthily succeeding, bearing in their turn the 
palm of a hard-won victory. The unbroken record of their illustrious 
deeds had established beyond the shadow of a doubt their preponderating 
share in shaping the destinies of their Faith. In a world writhing with 
pain and declining into chaos this community -- the vanguard of the 
liberating forces of Baha'u'llah -- succeeded in the years following 
'Abdu'l- Baha's passing in raising high above the institutions 
established by its sister communities in East and West what may well 
constitute the chief pillar of that future House- -a House which 
posterity will regard as the last refuge of a tottering civilization.</p>
<p>	(21 April 1933, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 89)</p>
<p>	750. In the Tablets of Baha'u'llah where institutions of the 
International and Local Houses of Justice are specifically designated 
and formally established; in the institution of the Hands of the Cause 
of God which first Baha'u'llah and then 'Abdu'l-Baha brought into being;
 in the institution of both local and national Assemblies which in their
 embryonic stage were already functioning in the days preceding 
'Abdu'l-Baha's<br>
 ascension; in the authority with which the Author of our Faith and the 
Center of His Covenant have in their Tablets chosen to confer upon them;
 in the institution of the Local Fund which operated according to 
'Abdu'l-Baha's specific injunctions addressed to certain Assemblies in 
Persia; in the verses of the Kitab-i-Aqdas the implications of which 
clearly anticipate the institution of the Guardianship; in the 
explanation which 'Abdu'l-Baha, in one of His Tablets, has given to, and
 the emphasis He has placed upon, the hereditary principle and the law 
of primogeniture as having been upheld by the Prophets of the past -- in
 these we can discern the faint glimmerings and discover the earliest 
intimation of the nature and working of the Administrative Order which 
the Will of 'Abdu'l-Baha was at a later time destined to proclaim and 
formally establish.</p>
<p>	(8 February 1934, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 147)</p>
<p>	751. Acting in conjunction with each other these two inseparable 
institutions administer its affairs, coordinate its activities, promote 
its interests, execute its laws and defend its subsidiary institutions. 
Severally, each operates within a clearly defined sphere of 
jurisdiction; each is equipped with its own attendant institutions -- 
instruments designed for the effective discharge of its particular 
responsibilities and duties. Each exercises, within the limitations 
imposed upon it, its powers, its authority, its rights and prerogatives.
 These are neither contradictory, nor detract in the slightest degree 
from the position which each of these institutions occupies. Far from 
being incompatible or mutually destructive, they supplement each other's
 authority and functions, and are permanently and fundamentally united 
in their aims.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	Severed from the no less essential institution of the Universal 
House of Justice this same System of the Will of 'Abdu'l-Baha would be 
paralyzed in its action and would be powerless to fill in those gaps 
which the Author of the Kitab-i-Aqdas has deliberately left in the body 
of His legislative and administrative ordinances.</p>
<p>	(8 February 1934, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 148)</p>
<p>	752. From these statements it is made indubitably clear and evident 
that the Guardian of the Faith has been made the Interpreter of the Word
 and<br>
 that the Universal House of Justice has been invested with the function
 of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the teachings. The 
interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own sphere, is as
 authoritative and binding as the enactments of the International House 
of Justice, whose exclusive right and prerogative is to pronounce upon 
and deliver the final judgment on such laws and ordinances as 
Baha'u'llah has not expressly revealed. Neither can, nor will ever, 
infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the other. Neither 
will seek to curtail the specific and undoubted authority with which 
both have been divinely invested. Though the Guardian of the Faith has 
been made the permanent head of so august a body he can never, even 
temporarily, assume the right of exclusive legislation. He cannot 
override the decision of the majority of his fellow members, but is 
bound to insist upon a reconsideration by them of any enactment he 
conscientiously believes to conflict with the meaning and to depart from
 the spirit of Baha'u'llah's revealed utterances....</p>
<p>	(8 February 1934, published in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", pp. 149-50)</p>
<p>	753. The Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah must in no
 wise be regarded as purely democratic in character inasmuch as the 
basic assumption which requires all democracies to depend fundamentally 
upon getting their mandate from the people is altogether lacking in this
 Dispensation. In the conduct of the administrative affairs of the 
Faith, in the enactment of the legislation necessary to supplement the 
laws of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the members of the Universal House of 
Justice, it should be borne in mind, are not, as Baha'u'llah's 
utterances clearly imply, responsible to those whom they represent, nor 
are they allowed to be governed by the feelings, the general opinion, 
and even the convictions of the mass of the faithful, or of those who 
directly elect them. They are to follow, in a prayerful attitude, the 
dictates and promptings of their conscience. They may, indeed they must,
 acquaint themselves with the conditions prevailing among the community,
 must weigh dispassionately in their minds the merits of any case 
presented for their consideration, but must reserve for themselves the 
right of an unfettered decision.</p>
<p>	("God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth," is 
Baha'u'llah's incontrovertible assurance. They, and not the body of 
those who either<br>
 directly or indirectly elect them, have thus been made the recipients 
of the divine guidance which is at once the life- blood and ultimate 
safeguard of this Revelation.... (8 February 1934, published in "The 
World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 153)</p>
<p>	754. The first [a high sense of moral rectitude in their social and 
administrative activities] is specially, though not exclusively, 
directed to their elected representatives, whether local, regional, or 
national, who, in their capacity as the custodians and members of the 
nascent institutions of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, are shouldering the 
chief responsibility in laying an unassailable foundation for that 
Universal House of Justice which, as its title implies, is to be the 
exponent and guardian of that Divine Justice which can alone insure the 
security of, and establish the reign of law and order in, a strangely 
disordered world....</p>
<p>	(25 December 1938, published in "The Advent of Divine Justice", (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 22)</p>
<p>	755. For it must be clearly understood, nor can it be sufficiently 
emphasized, that the conjunction of the resting-place of the Greatest 
Holy Leaf with those of her brother and mother incalculably reinforces 
the spiritual potencies of that consecrated Spot which, under the wings 
of the Bab's overshadowing Sepulchre, and in the vicinity of the future 
Mashriqu'l-Adhkar which will be reared on its flank, is destined to 
evolve into the focal centre of those world-shaking, world-embracing, 
world-directing administrative institutions, ordained by Baha'u'llah and
 anticipated by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and which are to function in consonance 
with the principles that govern the twin institutions of the 
Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice. Then, and then only, 
will this momentous prophecy which illuminates the concluding passages 
of the Tablet of Carmel be fulfilled: "Ere long will God sail His Ark 
upon thee (Carmel), and will manifest the people of Baha who have been 
mentioned in the Book of Names.</p>
<p>	To attempt to visualize, even in its barest outline, the glory that 
must envelop these institutions, to essay even a tentative and partial 
description of their character or the manner of their operation, or to 
trace however inadequately the course of events leading to their rise 
and eventual<br>
 establishment is far beyond my own capacity and power. Suffice it to 
say that at this troubled stage in world history the association of 
these three incomparably precious souls who, next to the three Central 
Figures of our Faith, tower in rank above the vast multitude of the 
heroes, Letters, martyrs, Hands, teachers and administrators of the 
Cause of Baha'u'llah, in such a potentially powerful spiritual and 
administrative Centre, is in itself an event which will release forces 
that are bound to hasten the emergence in a land which, geographically, 
spiritually and administratively, constitutes the heart of the entire 
planet, of some of the brightest gems of that World Order now shaping in
 the womb of this travailing age.</p>
<p>	(21 December 1939, published in "Messages to America: Selected 
Letters and Cablegrams Addressed to the Baha'is of North America 
1932-1946", (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1947), pp. 32-33)</p>
<p>	756. In this Charter of the future world civilization 
[Kitab-i-Aqdas] its Author -- at once the Judge, the Lawgiver, the 
Unifier and Redeemer of mankind -- announces to the kings of the earth 
the promulgation of the "Most Great Law" ... In it He formally ordains 
the institution of the "House of Justice," defines its functions, fixes 
its revenues, and designates its members as the "Men of Justice," the 
"Deputies of God," the "Trustees of the All-Merciful" ..</p>
<p>	("God Passes By", Rev. ed . (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), p. 214)</p>
<p>	757. Parallel with this double process of consolidation and 
construction particular attention should be devoted to the provision of 
the necessary means whereby the newly fledged centres in the Dominion of
 Canada and throughout the Republics of Latin America can be 
co-ordinated and further consolidated, through the formation of three 
National Spiritual Assemblies, designed to participate in time in the 
international elections that must precede the constitution of the First 
Universal House of Justice. The erection of these three pillars, raising
 to eleven the number of existing National Spiritual Assemblies, which 
are to be designated in future as Secondary Houses of Justice, and are 
designed to support the highest legislative body in the administrative 
hierarchy of the Faith, will, as the Divine Plan continues to unfold, be
 supplemented by the formation of similar bodies which, as they 
multiply, will, of necessity, broaden the<br>
 basis, and reinforce the representative character, of the supreme 
elective Institution which, in conjunction with the institution of 
Guardianship, must direct and co-ordinate the activities of a 
world-encircling Faith. Through the formation of these National 
Spiritual Assemblies, as the implications of the Divine Plan gradually 
unfold in the coming years, the American Baha'i Community will, in 
addition to its missionary activities throughout five continents and the
 islands of the seven seas, be contributing directly to the laying of 
the foundation, and hastening the formation, of an institution which, 
when constituted, will have consummated the threefold process involved 
in the erection of the total structure of the Administrative Order of 
the Faith of Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(15 June 1946, published in "Messages to America", p. 94)</p>
<p>	758. On the success of this enterprise [the Africa Campaign], 
unprecedented in its character and immense in its spiritual 
potentialities, must depend the initiation, at a later period in the 
Formative Age of the Faith, of undertakings embracing within their range
 all National Assemblies functioning throughout the Baha'i world -- 
undertakings constituting in themselves a prelude to the launching of 
world-wide enterprises destined to be embarked upon, in future epochs of
 that same Age, by the Universal House of Justice, that will symbolize 
the unity and co- ordinate and unify the activities of these National 
Assemblies.</p>
<p>	Indeed the birth of this African enterprise, in the opening decade 
of the second Baha'i century, coinciding as it does with the formation 
of the International Baha'i Council, should be acclaimed as an event of 
peculiar significance in the evolution of our beloved Faith. Both events
 will, no doubt, be hailed by posterity as simultaneous and compelling 
evidences of the irresistible unfoldment of a divinely appointed 
Administrative Order and of the development, on an international scale, 
of its subsidiary agencies, heralding the establishment of the Supreme 
Legislative Body designed to crown the Administrative Edifice now being 
laboriously erected by the privileged builders of a Divine Order, whose 
features have been delineated by the Centre of the Covenant in His Will 
and Testament, whose fundamental laws have been revealed by the Founder 
of our Faith<br>
 in His "Kitab-i-Aqdas", and whose advent has been foreshadowed by the 
Herald of the Baha'i Dispensation in the "Bayan", His most weighty Book.</p>
<p>	(25 February 1951, published in "Unfolding Destiny: The Messages 
from the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith to the Baha'i Community of the

<p>	760. In this great Tablet [of Carmel] which unveils divine mysteries
 and heralds the establishment of two mighty, majestic and momentous 
undertakings -- one of which is spiritual and the other administrative, 
both at the World Centre of the Faith -- Baha'u'llah refers to an "Ark",
 whose dwellers are the men of the Supreme House of Justice, which, in 
conformity with the exact provisions of the Will and Testament of the 
Centre of the Mighty Covenant, is the body which should lay down laws 
not explicitly revealed in the Text. In this Dispensation, these laws 
are destined to flow from this Holy Mountain, even as in the Mosaic 
Dispensation the law of God was promulgated from Zion. The "sailing of 
the Ark" of His laws is a reference to the establishment of the 
Universal House of Justice, which is indeed the Seat of Legislation, one
 of the<br>
 branches of the World Administrative Centre of the Baha'is on this Holy Mountain ....</p>
<p>	(Naw Ruz 111-1954 to the Baha'is of the East -- translated from the Persian; published in "The Baha'i World", vol. XIV, p. 438)</p>
<p>	761. The raising of this Edifice will in turn herald the 
construction, in the course of successive epochs of the Formative Age of
 the Faith, of several other structures, which will serve as the 
administrative seats of such divinely appointed institutions as the 
Guardianship, the Hands of the Cause, and the Universal House of 
Justice. These Edifices will, in the shape of a far-flung arc, and 
following a harmonizing style of architecture, surround the 
resting-places of the Greatest Holy Leaf, ranking as foremost among the 
members of her sex in the Baha'i Dispensation, of her Brother, offered 
up as a ransom by Baha'u'llah for the quickening of the world and its 
unification, and of their Mother, proclaimed by Him to be His chosen 
"consort in all the worlds of God". The ultimate completion of this 
stupendous undertaking will mark the culmination of the development of a
 world-wide divinely- appointed Administrative Order whose beginnings 
may be traced as far back as the concluding years of the Heroic Age of 
the Faith.</p>
<p>	(27 November 1954, published in "Messages to the Baha'i World 1950-1957" p. 74)</p>
<p>	V. From the Constitution of the Universal House of Justice:</p>
<p>	762. Baha'u'llah, the Revealer of God's Word in this Day, the Source
 of Authority, the Fountainhead of Justice, the Creator of a new World 
Order, the Establisher of the Most Great Peace, the Inspirer and Founder
 of a world civilization, the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Unifier and 
Redeemer of all mankind, has proclaimed the advent of God's Kingdom on 
earth, has formulated its laws and ordinances, enunciated its 
principles, and ordained its institutions. To direct and canalize the 
forces released by His Revelation He instituted His Covenant, whose 
power has preserved the integrity of His Faith, maintained its unity and
 stimulated its world-wide expansion throughout the successive 
ministries of 'Abdu'l-Baha and<br>
 Shoghi Effendi. It continues to fulfil its life-giving purpose through 
the agency of the Universal House of Justice whose fundamental object, 
as one of the twin successors of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, is to 
ensure the continuity of that divinely-appointed authority which flows 
from the Source of the Faith, to safeguard the unity of its followers, 
and to maintain the integrity and flexibility of its teachings.</p>
<p>	...</p>
<p>	The provenance, the authority, the duties, the sphere of action of 
the Universal House of Justice all derive from the revealed Word of 
Baha'u'llah which, together with the interpretations and expositions of 
the Centre of the Covenant and of the Guardian of the Cause -- who, 
after 'Abdu'l-Baha, is the sole authority in the interpretation of 
Baha'i Scripture -- constitute the binding terms of reference of the 
Universal House of Justice and are its bedrock foundation. The authority
 of these Texts is absolute and immutable until such time as Almighty 
God shall reveal His new Manifestation to Whom will belong all authority
 and power.</p>
<p>	There being no successor to Shoghi Effendi as Guardian of the Cause 
of God, the Universal House of Justice is the Head of the Faith and its 
supreme institution, to which all must turn, and on it rests the 
ultimate responsibility for ensuring the unity and progress of the Cause
 of God....</p>
<p>	(pp. 3-4)</p>
<p>	VI. From letters written by the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	763. We are glad that you have brought to our attention the 
questions perplexing some of the believers. It is much better for these 
questions to be put freely and openly than to have them, unexpressed, 
burdening the hearts of devoted believers. Once one grasps certain basic
 principles of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah such uncertainties are 
easily dispelled. This is not to say that the Cause of God contains no 
mysteries. Mysteries there are indeed, but they are not of a kind to 
shake one's faith once the essential tenets of the Cause and the 
indisputable facts of any situation are clearly understood.</p>
<p>	The questions put by the various believers fall into three groups. 
The first group centres upon the following queries: Why were steps taken
 to elect a Universal House of Justice with the foreknowledge that there<br>
 would be no Guardian? Was the time ripe for such an action? Could not 
the International Baha'i Council have carried on the work?</p>
<p>	At the time of our beloved Shoghi Effendi's death it was evident, 
from the circumstances and from the explicit requirements of the Holy 
Texts, that it had been impossible for him to appoint a successor in 
accordance with the provisions of the Will and Testament of 
'Abdu'l-Baha. This situation, in which the Guardian died without being 
able to appoint a successor, presented an obscure question not covered 
by the explicit Holy Text, and had to be referred to the Universal House
 of Justice. The friends should clearly understand that before the 
election of the Universal House of Justice there was no knowledge that 
there would be no Guardian. There could not have been any such 
foreknowledge, whatever opinions individual believers may have held. 
Neither the Hands of the Cause of God, nor the International Baha'i 
Council, nor any other existing body could make a decision upon this 
all-important matter. Only the House of Justice had authority to 
pronounce upon it. This was one urgent reason for calling the election 
of the Universal House of Justice as soon as possible.</p>
<p>	Following the passing of Shoghi Effendi the international 
administration of the Faith was carried on by the Hands of the Cause of 
God with the complete agreement and loyalty of the National Spiritual 
Assemblies and the body of the believers. This was in accordance with 
the Guardian's designation of the Hands as the "Chief Stewards of 
Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Commonwealth".</p>
<p>	From the very outset of their custodianship of the Cause of God the 
Hands realized that since they had no certainty of divine guidance such 
as is incontrovertibly assured to the Guardian and to the Universal 
House of Justice, their one safe course was to follow with undeviating 
firmness the instructions and policies of Shoghi Effendi. The entire 
history of religion shows no comparable record of such strict 
self-discipline, such absolute loyalty and such complete self-abnegation
 by the leaders of a religion finding themselves suddenly deprived of 
their divinely inspired guide. The debt of gratitude which mankind for 
generations, nay, ages to come, owes to this handful of grief-stricken, 
steadfast, heroic souls is beyond estimation.</p>
<p>	The Guardian had given the Baha'i world explicit and detailed plans 
covering the period until Ridvan 1963, the end of the Ten Year Crusade.<br>
 From that point onward, unless the Faith were to be endangered, further
 divine guidance was essential. This was the second pressing reason for 
the calling of the election of the Universal House of Justice. The 
rightness of the time was further confirmed by references in Shoghi 
Effendi's letters to the Ten Year Crusade's being followed by other 
plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice. One such 
reference is the following passage from a letter addressed to the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles on 25th February 1951, 
concerning its Two Year Plan which immediately preceded the Ten Year 
Crusade:</p>
<p>     On the success of this enterprise, unprecedented in<br>
   its scope,  unique in its character and immense in its<br>
   spiritual potentialities,  must depend the initiation,<br>
   at a later period in the Formative Age of the Faith, of<br>
   undertakings embracing within their range all National<br>
   Assemblies functioning throughout the Baha'i world --<br>
   undertakings constituting in themselves a prelude to the<br>
   launching of world-wide enterprises destined to be<br>
   embarked upon, in future epochs of that same Age, by the<br>
   Universal House  of Justice, that will symbolize the<br>
   unity and co-ordinate and unify  the activities of these<br>
   National Assemblies.</p>
<p>	Having been in charge of the Cause of God for six years, the Hands, 
with absolute faith in the Holy Writings, called upon the believers to 
elect the Universal House of Justice, and even went so far as to ask 
that they themselves be not voted for. The sole, sad instance of anyone 
succumbing to the allurements of power was the pitiful attempt of 
Charles Mason Remey to usurp the Guardianship.</p>
<p>	The following excerpts from a Tablet of 'Abdu'l-Baha state clearly 
and emphatically the principles with which the friends are already 
familiar from the Will and Testament of the Master and the various 
letters of Shoghi Effendi, and explain the basis for the election of the
 Universal House of Justice. This Tablet was sent to Persia by the 
beloved Guardian himself, in the early years of his ministry, for 
circulation among the believers.</p>
<p>	...for 'Abdu'l-Baha is in a tempest of dangers and infinitely abhors
 differences of opinion... Praise be to God, there are no grounds for 
differences.</p>
<p>	The Bab, the Exalted One, is the Morn of Truth, the splendour of Whose light shineth through all regions. He is also<br>
 the Harbinger of the Most Great Light, the Abha Luminary. The Blessed 
Beauty is the One promised by the sacred books of the past, the 
revelation of the Source of light that shone upon Mount Sinai, Whose 
fire glowed in the midst of the Burning Bush. We are, one and all, 
servants of Their threshold, and stand each as a lowly keeper at Their 
door.</p>
<p>	My purpose is this, that ere the expiration of a thousand years, no 
one has the right to utter a single word, even to claim the station of 
Guardianship. The Most Holy Book is the Book to which all peoples shall 
refer, and in it the Laws of God have been revealed. Laws not mentioned 
in the Book should be referred to the decision of the Universal House of
 Justice. There will be no grounds for difference... Beware, beware lest
 anyone create a rift or stir up sedition. Should there be differences 
of opinion, the Supreme House of Justice would immediately resolve the 
problems. Whatever will be its decision, by majority vote, shall be the 
real truth, inasmuch as that House is under the protection, unerring 
guidance and care of the one true Lord. He shall guard it from error and
 will protect it under the wing of His sanctity and infallibility. He 
who opposes it is cast out and will eventually be of the defeated.</p>
<p>	The Supreme House of Justice should be elected according to the 
system followed in the election of the parliaments of Europe. And when 
the countries would be guided, the Houses of Justice of the various 
countries would elect the Supreme House of Justice.</p>
<p>	At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country appoint 
their delegates, and these in turn elect their representatives, and 
these representatives elect a body, that body shall be regarded as the 
Supreme House of Justice.</p>
<p>	The establishment of that House is not dependent upon the conversion
 of all the nations of the world. For example, if conditions were 
favourable and no disturbances would be caused, the friends in Persia 
would elect their representatives, and likewise the friends in America, 
in India, and other areas would also elect their representatives, and 
these would elect a<br>
 House of Justice. That House of Justice would be the Supreme House of Justice. That is all.</p>
<p>	("Makatib-i-'Abdu'l-Baha", Vol. 111, pp. 500-501)</p>
<p>	The friends should realize that there is nothing in the Texts to 
indicate that the election of the Universal House of Justice could be 
called only by the Guardian. On the contrary, 'Abdu'l-Baha envisaged the
 calling of its election in His own life-time. At a time described by 
the Guardian as "the darkest moments of His [the Master's] life, under 
'Abdu'l-Hamid's regime, when He stood ready to be deported to the most 
inhospitable regions of Northern Africa", and when even His life was 
threatened, 'Abdu'l-Baha wrote to Haji Mirza Taqi Afnan, the cousin of 
the Bab and chief builder of the 'Ishqabad Temple, commanding him to 
arrange for the election of the Universal House of Justice should the 
threats against the Master materialize. The second part of the Master's 
Will is also relevant to such a situation and should be studied by the 
friends.</p>
<p>	The second series of problems vexing some of the friends centres on 
the question of the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice and 
its ability to function without the presence of the Guardian. Particular
 difficulty has been experienced in understanding the implications of 
the following statement by the beloved Guardian:</p>
<p>     Divorced from the institution of the Guardianship<br>
   the World Order of Baha'u'llah would be mutilated and<br>
   permanently deprived of that hereditary principle which,<br>
   as 'Abdu'l-Baha has written, has been invariably upheld<br>
   by the Law of God. "In all the Divine Dispensations," He<br>
   states, in a Tablet addressed to a follower of the Faith<br>
   in Persia, "the eldest son hath been given extraordinary<br>
   distinctions. Even the station of prophethood hath been<br>
   his birthright." Without such an institution the<br>
   integrity of the Faith would be imperilled, and the<br>
   stability of the entire fabric would be gravely<br>
   endangered. Its prestige would suffer, the means required<br>
   to enable it to take a long, an uninterrupted view over<br>
   a series of generations would be completely lacking, and<br>
   the necessary guidance to define the sphere of the<br>
   legislative action of its elected representatives would<br>
   be totally withdrawn.</p>
<p>	("The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah", "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 148)<br>

</p><p>	Let the friends who wish for a clearer understanding of this 
passage at the present time consider it in the light of the many other 
texts which deal with the same subject, for example the following 
passages gleaned from the letters of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>     They have also, in unequivocal and emphatic<br>
   language, appointed those twin institutions of the House<br>
   of Justice and of the Guardianship as their chosen<br>
   Successors, destined to apply the principles, promulgate<br>
   the laws, protect the institutions, adapt loyally and<br>
   intelligently the Faith to the requirements of<br>
   progressive society, and consummate the incorruptible<br>
   inheritance which the Founders of the Faith have<br>
   bequeathed to the world.</p>
<p>	(Letter dated 21 March 1930, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 20)</p>
<p>     It must be also clearly understood by every believer that<br>
   the institution of Guardianship does not under any<br>
   circumstances abrogate, or even in the slightest degree<br>
   detract from, the powers granted to the Universal House<br>
   of Justice by Baha'u'llah in the "Kitabu'l-Aqdas", and<br>
   repeatedly and solemnly confirmed by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His<br>
   Will. It does not constitute in any manner a<br>
   contradiction to the Will and Writings of Baha'u'llah,<br>
   nor does it nullify any of His revealed instructions. It<br>
   enhances the prestige of that exalted assembly,<br>
   stabilizes its supreme position, safeguards its unity,<br>
   assures the continuity of its labours, without presuming<br>
   in the slightest to infringe upon the inviolability of<br>
   its clearly-defined sphere of jurisdiction. We stand<br>
   indeed too close to so monumental a document to claim for<br>
   ourselves a complete understanding of all its<br>
   implications, or to presume to have grasped the manifold<br>
   mysteries it undoubtedly contains....</p>
<p>	(Letter dated 27 February 1929, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 8)</p>
<p>	From these statements it is made indubitably clear and evident that 
the Guardian of the Faith has been made the Interpreter of the Word and 
that the Universal House of Justice has been invested with the function 
of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the teachings. The 
interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own sphere, is as
 authoritative<br>
 and binding as the enactments of the International House of Justice, 
whose exclusive right and prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver 
the final judgement on such laws and ordinances as Baha'u'llah has not 
expressly revealed. Neither can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred
 and prescribed domain of the other. Neither will seek to curtail the 
specific and undoubted authority with which both have been divinely 
invested.</p>
<p>	("The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah", "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", pp. 149-50)</p>
<p>	Each exercises, within the limitations imposed upon it, its powers, 
its authority, its rights and prerogatives. These are neither 
contradictory, nor detract in the slightest degree from the position 
which each of these institutions occupies.</p>
<p>	("The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah", "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 148)</p>
<p>	Though the Guardian of the Faith has been made the permanent head of
 so august a body he can never, even temporarily, assume the right of 
exclusive legislation. He cannot override the decision of the majority 
of his fellow- members...</p>
<p>	("The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah", "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 150)</p>
<p>	Above all, let the hearts of the friends be assured by these words of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>     The Hand of Omnipotence hath established His<br>
   Revelation upon an unassailable, an enduring foundation.<br>
   Storms of human strife are powerless to undermine its<br>
   basis, nor will men's fanciful theories succeed in<br>
   damaging its structure.</p>
<p>	("The World Order of Baha'u'llah" p. 109)</p>
<p>	and these of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>     Verily, God effecteth that which He pleaseth; naught<br>
   can annul His Covenant; naught can obstruct His favor nor<br>
   oppose His Cause! He doeth with His will that which<br>
   pleaseth Him and He is powerful over all things!... </p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", Vol. III, p. 598)</p>
<p>	It should be understood by the friends that before legislating upon 
any matter the Universal House of Justice studies carefully and<br>
 exhaustively both the Sacred Texts and the Writings of Shoghi Effendi 
on the subject. The interpretations written by the beloved Guardian 
cover a vast range of subjects and are equally as binding as the Text 
itself.</p>
<p>	There is a profound difference between the interpretations of the 
Guardian and the elucidations of the House of Justice in exercise of its
 function to "deliberate upon all problems which have caused difference,
 questions that are obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded 
in the Book". The Guardian reveals what the Scripture means; his 
interpretation is a statement of truth which cannot be varied. Upon the 
Universal House of Justice, in the words of the Guardian, "has been 
conferred the exclusive right of legislating on matters not expressly 
revealed in the Baha'i writings". Its pronouncements, which are 
susceptible of amendment or abrogation by the House of Justice itself, 
serve to supplement and apply the Law of God. Although not invested with
 the function of interpretation, the House of Justice is in a position 
to do everything necessary to establish the World Order of Baha'u'llah 
on this earth. Unity of doctrine is maintained by the existence of the 
authentic texts of Scripture and the voluminous interpretations of 
'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi, together with the absolute prohibition 
against anyone propounding "authoritative" or "inspired" interpretations
 or usurping the function of Guardian. Unity of administration is 
assured by the authority of the Universal House of Justice.</p>
<p>     "Such", in the words of Shoghi Effendi, "is the<br>
   immutability of His revealed Word. Such is the elasticity<br>
   which characterizes the functions of His appointed<br>
   ministers. The first preserves the identity of His Faith,<br>
   and guards the integrity of His law. The second enables<br>
   it, even as a living organism, to expand and adapt itself<br>
   to the needs and requirements of an ever-changing<br>
   society."</p>
<p>	(Letter dated 21 March 1930, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 25)</p>
<p>	Every true believer, if he is to deepen in his understanding of the 
Cause of Baha'u'llah, must needs combine profound faith in the unfailing
 efficacy of His Message and His Covenant, with the humility of 
recognizing that no one of this generation can claim to have embraced 
the vastness of His Cause nor to have comprehended the manifold 
mysteries and potentialities it contains. The words of Shoghi Effendi 
bear ample testimony to this fact:<br>

</p><p>	How vast is the Revelation of Baha'u'llah! How great the 
magnitude of His blessings showered upon humanity in this day! And yet, 
how poor, how inadequate our conception of their significance and glory!
 This generation stands too close to so colossal a Revelation to 
appreciate, in their full measure, the infinite possibilities of His 
Faith, the unprecedented character of His Cause, and the mysterious 
dispensations of His Providence.</p>
<p>	(Letter dated 21 March 1930, "The World Order of Baha'u'llah", p. 24)</p>
<p>	We are called upon by our beloved Master in His Will and Testament 
not only to adopt it [Baha'u'llah's new world order] unreservedly, but 
to unveil its merit to all the world. To attempt to estimate its full 
value, and grasp its exact significance after so short a time since its 
inception would be premature and presumptuous on our part. We must trust
 to time, and the guidance of God's Universal House of Justice, to 
obtain a clearer and fuller understanding of its provisions and 
implications....</p>
<p>	(Letter dated 23 February 1924, published in "Baha'i Administration", p. 62)</p>
<p>	As to the order and the management of the spiritual affairs of the 
friends, that which is very important now is the consolidation of the 
Spiritual Assemblies in every centre, because on these fortified and 
unshakable foundations, God's Supreme House of Justice shall be erected 
and firmly established in the days to come. When this most great Edifice
 shall be reared on such an immovable foundation, God's purpose, wisdom,
 universal truths, mysteries and realities of the Kingdom, which the 
mystic revelation of Baha'u'llah has deposited within the Will and 
Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, shall gradually be revealed and made 
manifest.</p>
<p>	(Letter dated 19 December 1922 -- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	Statements such as these indicate that the full meaning of the Will 
and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha, as well as an understanding of the 
implications of the World Order ushered in by that remarkable Document 
can be revealed only gradually to men's eyes, and after the Universal 
House of Justice has come into being. The friends are called upon to 
trust to time and to await the guidance of the Universal House<br>
 of Justice, which, as circumstances require, will make pronouncements that will resolve and clarify obscure matters.</p>
<p>	The third group of queries raised by the friends concerns details of
 functioning of the Universal House of Justice in the absence of the 
Guardian, particularly the matter of expulsion of members of the House 
of Justice. Such questions will be clarified in the Constitution of the 
House of Justice, the formulation of which is a goal of the Nine Year 
Plan. Meanwhile the friends are informed that any member committing a 
"sin injurious to the common weal", may be expelled from membership of 
the House of Justice by a majority vote of the House itself. Should any 
member, God forbid, be guilty of breaking the Covenant, the matter would
 be investigated by the Hands of the Cause of God, and the 
Covenant-breaker would be expelled by decision of the Hands of the Cause
 of God residing in the Holy Land, subject to the approval of the House 
of Justice, as in the case of any other believer. The decision of the 
Hands in such a case would be announced to the Baha'i world by the 
Universal House of Justice.</p>
<p>	We are certain that when you share this letter with the friends and 
they have these quotations from the Scriptures and the Writings of the 
Guardian drawn to their attention, their doubts and misgivings will be 
dispelled and they will be able to devote their every effort to 
spreading the Message of Baha'u'llah, serenely confident in the power of
 His Covenant to overcome whatever tests an inscrutable Providence may 
shower upon it, thus demonstrating its ability to redeem a travailing 
world and to upraise the Standard of the Kingdom of God on earth.</p>
<p>	(9 March 1965 to a National Spiritual Assembly, published in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages, 1963-1968", pp. 44-56)</p>
<p>	764. You query the timing of the election of the Universal House of 
Justice in view of the Guardian's statement: "...given favourable 
circumstances, under which the Baha'is of Persia and of the adjoining 
countries under Soviet rule, may be enabled to elect their national 
representatives ... the only remaining obstacle in the way of the 
definite formation of the International House of Justice will have been 
removed." On 19th April 1947 the Guardian, in a letter written on his 
behalf by his secretary, replied to the enquiry of an individual 
believer about this passage: "At the time he referred to Russia there 
were Baha'is there, now the Community<br>
 has practically ceased to exist; therefore the formation of the 
International House of Justice cannot depend on a Russian National 
Spiritual Assembly. But other strong National Spiritual Assemblies will 
have to be built up before it can be established."</p>
<p>	You suggest the possibility that, for the good of the Cause, certain
 information concerning the succession to Shoghi Effendi is being 
withheld from the believers. We assure you that nothing whatsoever is 
being withheld from the friends for whatever reason. There is no doubt 
at all that in the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha Shoghi Effendi was
 the authority designated to appoint his successor, but he had no 
children and all the surviving Aghsan had broken the Covenant. Thus, as 
the Hands of the Cause stated in 1957, it is clear that there was no one
 he could have appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Will. 
To have made an appointment outside the clear and specific provisions of
 the Master's Will and Testament would obviously have been an impossible
 and unthinkable course of action for the Guardian, the 
divinely-appointed upholder and defender of the Covenant. Moreover, that
 same Will had provided a clear means for the confirmation of the 
Guardian's appointment of his successor, as you are aware. The nine 
Hands to be elected by the body of the Hands were to give their assent 
by secret ballot to the Guardian's choice. In 1957 the entire body of 
the Hands, after fully investigating the matter, announced that Shoghi 
Effendi had appointed no successor and left no will. This is documented 
and established.</p>
<p>	The fact that Shoghi Effendi did not leave a will cannot be adduced 
as evidence of his failure to obey Baha'u'llah -- rather should we 
acknowledge that in his very silence there is a wisdom and a sign of his
 infallible guidance. We should ponder deeply the writings that we have,
 and seek to understand the multitudinous significances that they 
contain. Do not forget that Shoghi Effendi said two things were 
necessary for a growing understanding of the World Order of Baha'u'llah:
 the passage of time and the guidance of the Universal House of Justice.</p>
<p>	The infallibility of the Universal House of Justice, operating 
within its ordained sphere, has not been made dependent upon the 
presence in its membership of the Guardian of the Cause. Although in the
 realm of interpretation the Guardian's pronouncements are always 
binding, in the area of the Guardian's participation in legislation it 
is always the decision<br>
 of the House itself which must prevail. This is supported by the words 
of the Guardian: "The interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within
 his own sphere, is as authoritative and binding as the enactments of 
the International House of Justice, whose exclusive right and 
prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgement on such
 laws and ordinances as Baha'u'llah has not expressly revealed. Neither 
can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of 
the other. Neither will seek to curtail the specific and undoubted 
authority with which both have been divinely invested.</p>
<p>	"Though the Guardian of the Faith has been made the permanent head 
of so august a body he can never, even temporarily, assume the right of 
exclusive legislation. He cannot override the decision of the majority 
of his fellow- members, but is bound to insist upon a reconsideration by
 them of any enactment he conscientiously believes to conflict with the 
meaning and to depart from the spirit of Baha'u'llah's revealed 
utterances."</p>
<p>	However, quite apart from his function as a member and sacred head 
for life of the Universal House of Justice, the Guardian, functioning 
within his own sphere, had the right and duty "to define the sphere of 
the legislative action" of the Universal House of Justice. In other 
words, he had the authority to state whether a matter was or was not 
already covered by the Sacred Texts and therefore whether it was within 
the authority of the Universal House of Justice to legislate upon it. No
 other person, apart from the Guardian, has the right or authority to 
make such definitions. The question therefore arises: In the absence of 
the Guardian, is the Universal House of Justice in danger of straying 
outside its proper sphere and thus falling into error? Here we must 
remember three things: First, Shoghi Effendi, during the thirty-six 
years of his Guardianship, has already made innumerable such 
definitions, supplementing those made by 'Abdu'l-Baha and by Baha'u'llah
 Himself. As already announced to the friends, a careful study of the 
Writings and interpretations on any subject on which the House of 
Justice proposes to legislate always precedes its act of legislation. 
Second, the Universal House of Justice, itself assured of divine 
guidance, is well aware of the absence of the Guardian and will approach
 all matters of legislation only when certain of its sphere of 
jurisdiction, a sphere which the Guardian has confidently described as 
"clearly defined". Third, we must not forget the Guardian's written<br>
 statement about these two Institutions: "Neither can, nor will ever, 
infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the other."</p>
<p>	As regards the need to have deductions made from the Writings to 
help in the formulation of the enactments of the House of Justice, there
 is the following text from the pen of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	Those matters of major importance which constitute the foundation of
 the Law of God are explicitly recorded in the Text, but subsidiary laws
 are left to the House of Justice. The wisdom of this is that the times 
never remain the same, for change is a necessary quality and an 
essential attribute of this world, and of time and place. Therefore the 
House of Justice will take action accordingly.</p>
<p>        Let it not be imagined that the House of Justice<br>
   will take any decision according to its own concepts and<br>
   opinions. God forbid! The Supreme House of Justice will<br>
   take decisions and establish laws through the inspiration<br>
   and confirmation of the Holy Spirit, because it is in the<br>
   safekeeping and under the shelter and protection of the<br>
   Ancient Beauty, and obedience to its decisions is a<br>
   bounden and essential duty and an absolute obligation,<br>
   and there is no escape for anyone.</p>
<p>        Say, O people: Verily the Supreme House of Justice<br>
   is under the wings of your Lord, the Compassionate, the<br>
   All-Merciful, that is, under His protection, His care,<br>
   and His shelter; for He has commanded the firm believers<br>
   to obey that blessed, sanctified and all-subduing body,<br>
   whose sovereignty is divinely ordained and of the Kingdom<br>
   of Heaven and whose laws are inspired and spiritual.</p>
<p>        Briefly, this is the wisdom of referring the laws<br>
   of society to the House of Justice. In the religion of<br>
   Islam, similarly, not every ordinance was explicitly<br>
   revealed; nay not a tenth part of a tenth part was<br>
   included in the Text; although all matters of major<br>
   importance were specifically referred to, there were<br>
   undoubtedly thousands of laws which were unspecified.<br>
   These were devised by the divines of a later age<br>
   according to the laws of Islamic jurisprudence, and<br>
   individual divines made conflicting deductions from the<br>
   original revealed ordinances. All these were enforced.<br>
   Today this process of deduction is the right of the body<br>
   of the House of Justice, and the deductions and<br>
   conclusions of<br>
 individual learned men have no<br>
   authority, unless they are endorsed by the House of<br>
   Justice. The difference is precisely this,  that from<br>
   the conclusions and endorsements of the body of the<br>
   House of Justice whose members are elected by and known<br>
   to the worldwide Baha'i community, no differences will<br>
   arise; whereas the conclusions of individual divines<br>
   and scholars would definitely lead to differences, and<br>
   result in schism, division, and  dispersion. The oneness<br>
   of the Word would be destroyed, the  unity of the Faith<br>
   would disappear, and the edifice of the Faith  of God<br>
   would be shaken.</p>
<p>	In the Order of Baha'u'llah there are certain functions which are 
reserved to certain institutions, and others which are shared in common,
 even though they may be more in the special province of one or the 
other. For example, although the Hands of the Cause of God have the 
specific functions of protection and propagation, and are specialized 
for these functions, it is also the duty of the Universal House of 
Justice and the Spiritual Assemblies to protect and teach the Cause -- 
indeed teaching is a sacred obligation placed upon every believer by 
Baha'u'llah. Similarly, although after the Master authoritative 
interpretation was exclusively vested in the Guardian, and although 
legislation is exclusively the function of the Universal House of 
Justice, these two Institutions are, in Shoghi Effendi's words, 
"complementary in their aim and purpose." 'Their common, their 
fundamental object is to ensure the continuity of that 
divinely-appointed authority which flows from the Source of our Faith, 
to safeguard the unity of its followers and to maintain the integrity 
and flexibility of its teachings." Whereas the Universal House of 
Justice cannot undertake any function which exclusively appertained to 
the Guardian, it must continue to pursue the object which it shares in 
common with the Guardianship.</p>
<p>	("Letters, 2nd rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 148 (both quotes).</p>
<p>	As you point out with many quotations, Shoghi Effendi repeatedly 
stressed the inseparability of these two institutions. Whereas he 
obviously envisaged their functioning together, it cannot logically be 
deduced from this that one is unable to function in the absence of the 
other. During the whole thirty-six years of his Guardianship Shoghi 
Effendi functioned without the Universal House of Justice. Now the 
Universal House of<br>
 Justice must function without the Guardian, but the principle of 
inseparability remains. The Guardianship does not lose its significance 
nor position in the Order of Baha'u'llah merely because there is no 
living Guardian. We must guard against two extremes: one is to argue 
that because there is no Guardian all that was written about the 
Guardianship and its position in the Baha'i World Order is a dead letter
 and was unimportant; the other is to be so overwhelmed by the 
significance of the Guardianship as to underestimate the strength of the
 Covenant, or to be tempted to compromise with the clear texts in order 
to find somehow, in some way, a "Guardian".</p>
<p>	Service to the Cause of God requires absolute fidelity and integrity
 and unwavering faith in Him. No good but only evil can come from taking
 the responsibility for the future of God's Cause into our own hands and
 trying to force it into ways that we wish it to go regardless of the 
clear texts and our own limitations. It is His Cause. He has promised 
that its light will not fail. Our part is to cling tenaciously to the 
revealed Word and to the Institutions that He has created to preserve 
His Covenant.</p>
<p>	It is precisely in this connection that the believers must recognize
 the importance of intellectual honesty and humility. In past 
dispensations many errors arose because the believers in God's 
Revelation were over-anxious to encompass the Divine Message within the 
framework of their limited understanding, to define doctrines where 
definition was beyond their power, to explain mysteries which only the 
wisdom and experience of a later age would make comprehensible, to argue
 that something was true because it appeared desirable and necessary. 
Such compromises with essential truth, such intellectual pride, we must 
scrupulously avoid.</p>
<p>	If some of the statements of the Universal House of Justice are not 
detailed the friends should realize that the cause of this is not 
secretiveness, but rather the determination of this body to refrain from
 interpreting the teachings and to preserve the truth of the Guardian's 
statement that "Leaders of religion, exponents of political theories, 
governors of human institutions ... need have no doubt or anxiety 
regarding the nature, the origin, or validity of the institutions which 
the adherents of the Faith are building up throughout the world. For 
these lie embedded in the teachings themselves, unadulterated and<br>
 unobscured by unwarranted inferences, or unauthorized interpretations of His Word."</p>
<p>	A clear distinction is made in our Faith between authoritative 
interpretation and the interpretation or understanding that each 
individual arrives at for himself from his study of its teachings. While
 the former is confined to the Guardian, the latter, according to the 
guidance given to us by the Guardian himself, should by no means be 
suppressed. In fact such individual interpretation is considered the 
fruit of man's rational power and conducive to a better understanding of
 the teachings, provided that no disputes or arguments arise among the 
friends and the individual himself understands and makes it clear that 
his views are merely his own. Individual interpretations continually 
change as one grows in comprehension of the teachings. As Shoghi Effendi
 explained:[1] "To deepen in the Cause means to read the writings of 
Baha'u'llah and the Master so thoroughly as to be able to give it to 
others in its pure form. There are many who have some superficial idea 
of what the Cause stands for. They, therefore, present it together with 
all sorts of ideas that are their own. As the Cause is still in its 
early days we must be most careful lest we fall under this error and 
injure the Movement we so much adore. There is no limit to the study of 
the Cause. The more we read the Writings the more truths we can find in 
them and the more we will see that our previous notions were erroneous."
 So, although individual insights can be enlightening and helpful, they 
can also be misleading. The friends must therefore learn to listen to 
the views of others without being over-awed or allowing their faith to 
be shaken, and to express their own views without pressing them on their
 fellow Baha'is.<br>
 [1 Written by the Guardian's secretary to an individual believer, on 25 August 1926.]</p>
<p>	The Cause of God is organic, growing and developing like a living 
being. Time and again it has faced crises which have perplexed the 
believers, but each time the Cause, impelled by the immutable purpose of
 God, overcame the crisis and went on to greater heights. However great 
may be our inability to understand the mystery and the implications of 
the passing of Shoghi Effendi,the strong cord to which all must cling 
with assurance is the Covenant. The emphatic and vigorous language of 
'Abdu'l-Baha's Will and Testament is at this time, as at the time of His
 own passing, the safeguard of the Cause:<br>

</p><p>     "Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn and all<br>
   that is not expressly recorded therein must be referred<br>
   to the Universal House of Justice. That which this body,<br>
   whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is<br>
   verily the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself. Whoso<br>
   doth deviate therefrom is verily of them that love<br>
   discord, hath shown forth malice and turned away from the<br>
   Lord of the Covenant...." And again: "...All must seek<br>
   guidance and turn unto the Centre of the Cause and  he<br>
   House of Justice. And he that turneth unto whatsoever<br>
   else is indeed in grievous error."</p>
<p>	The Universal House of Justice, which the Guardian said would be 
regarded by posterity as "the last refuge of a tottering civilization" 
is now, in the absence of the Guardian, the sole infallibly guided 
institution in the world to which all must turn, and on it rests the 
responsibility for ensuring the unity and progress of the Cause of God 
in accordance with the revealed Word. There are statements from the 
Master and the Guardian indicating that the Universal House of Justice, 
in addition to being the Highest Legislative Body of the Faith, is also 
the body to which all must turn, and is the "apex" of the Baha'i 
Administrative Order, as well as the "supreme organ of the Baha'i 
Commonwealth". The Guardian has in his writings specified for the House 
of Justice such fundamental functions as the formulation of future 
world-wide teaching plans, the conduct of the administrative affairs of 
the Faith, and the guidance, organisation and unification of the affairs
 of the Cause throughout the world. Furthermore in "God Passes By" the 
Guardian makes the following statement: "the Kitab-i-Aqdas ... not only 
preserves for posterity the basic laws and ordinances on which the 
fabric of His future World Order must rest, but ordains, in addition to 
the function of interpretation which it confers upon His Successor, the 
necessary institutions through which the integrity and unity of His 
Faith can alone be safeguarded." He has also, in "The Dispensation of 
Baha'u'llah", written that the members of the Universal House of Justice
 "and not the body of those who either directly or indirectly elect 
them, have thus been made the recipients of the divine guidance which is
 at once the life-blood and ultimate safeguard of this Revelation."</p>
<p>	As the Universal House of Justice has already announced, it cannot 
legislate to make possible the appointment of a successor to Shoghi<br>
 Effendi,nor can it legislate to make possible the appointment of any 
more Hands of the Cause, but it must do everything within its power to 
ensure the performance of all those functions which it shares with these
 two mighty Institutions. It must make provision for the proper 
discharge in future of the functions of protection and propagation, 
which the administrative bodies share with the Guardianship and the 
Hands of the Cause; it must, in the absence of the Guardian, receive and
 disburse the Huququ'llah, in accordance with the following statement of
 'Abdu'l-Baha: "Disposition of the Huquq, wholly or partly, is 
permissible, but this should be done by permission of the authority in 
the Cause to whom all must turn."; it must make provision in its 
Constitution for the removal of any of its members who commits a sin 
"injurious to the common weal". Above all, it must, with perfect faith 
in Baha'u'llah, proclaim His Cause and enforce His Law so that the Most 
Great Peace shall be firmly established in this world and the foundation
 of the Kingdom of God on earth shall be accomplished.</p>
<p>	(27 May 1966 to an individual, published in "Wellspring of Guidance: Messages, 1963-1968", pp. 81-91)</p>
<p>	765. Your recent letter, in which you share with us the questions 
that have occurred to some of the youth in studying "The Dispensation of
 Baha'u'llah", has been carefully considered, and we feel that we should
 comment both on the particular passage you mention and on a related 
passage in the same work, because both bear on the relationship between 
the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice.</p>
<p>	The first passage concerns the Guardian's duty to insist upon a 
reconsideration by his fellow-members in the Universal House of Justice 
of any enactment which he believes conflicts with the meaning and 
departs from the spirit of the Sacred Writings. The second passage 
concerns the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice without the
 Guardian, namely Shoghi Effendi's statement that 'Without such an 
institution [the Guardianship] ... the necessary guidance to define the 
sphere of the legislative action of its elected representatives would be
 totally withdrawn."</p>
<p>	Some of the youth, you indicate, were puzzled as to how to reconcile
 the former of these two passages with such statements as that in the 
Will<br>
 of 'Abdu'l-Baha which affirms that the Universal House of Justice is "freed from all error".</p>
<p>	Just as the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha does not in any way 
contradict the "Kitab-i-Aqdas" but, in the Guardian's words, "confirms, 
supplements, and correlates the provisions of the "Aqdas", so the 
writings of the Guardian contradict neither the revealed Word nor the 
interpretations of the Master. In attempting to understand the Writings,
 therefore, one must first realize that there is and can be no real 
contradiction in them, and in the light of this we can confidently seek 
the unity of meaning which they contain.</p>
<p>	The Guardian and the Universal House of Justice have certain duties 
and functions in common; each also operates within a separate and 
distinct sphere. As Shoghi Effendi explained, "...it is made indubitably
 clear and evident that the Guardian of the Faith has been made the 
Interpreter of the Word and that the Universal House of Justice has been
 invested with the function of legislating on matters not expressly 
revealed in the teachings. The interpretation of the Guardian, 
functioning within his own sphere, is as authoritative and binding as 
the enactments of the International House of Justice, whose exclusive 
right and prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final 
judgement on such laws and ordinances as Baha'u'llah has not expressly 
revealed." He goes on to affirm, "Neither can, nor will ever, infringe 
upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the other. Neither will seek to
 curtail the specific and undoubted authority with which both have been 
divinely invested." It is impossible to conceive that two centres of 
authority, which the Master has stated "are both under the care and 
protection of the Abha Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance 
of His Holiness, the Exalted One", could conflict with one another, 
because both are vehicles of the same Divine Guidance.</p>
<p>	The Universal House of Justice, beyond its function as the enactor 
of legislation, has been invested with the more general functions of 
protecting and administering the Cause, solving obscure questions and 
deciding upon matters that have caused difference. Nowhere is it stated 
that the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice is by virtue of
 the Guardian's membership or presence on that body. Indeed, 
'Abdu'l-Baha in His Will and Shoghi Effendi in his "Dispensation of 
Baha'u'llah" have both explicitly stated that the elected members of the
 Universal House of<br>
 Justice in consultation are recipients of unfailing Divine Guidance. 
Furthermore the Guardian himself in "The World Order of Baha'u'llah" 
asserted that "It must be also clearly understood by every believer that
 the institution of Guardianship does not under any circumstances 
abrogate, or even in the slightest degree detract from, the powers 
granted to the Universal House of Justice by Baha'u'llah in the 
"Kitabu'l-Aqdas", and repeatedly and solemnly confirmed by 'Abdu'l-Baha 
in His Will. It does not constitute in any manner a contradiction to the
 Will and Writings of Baha'u'llah, nor does it nullify any of His 
revealed instructions."</p>
<p>	While the specific responsibility of the Guardian is the 
interpretation of the Word, he is also invested with all the powers and 
prerogatives necessary to discharge his function as Guardian of the 
Cause, its Head and supreme protector. He is, furthermore, made the 
irremovable head and member for life of the supreme legislative body of 
the Faith. It is as the head of the Universal House of Justice, and as a
 member of that body, that the Guardian takes part in the process of 
legislation. If the following passage, which gave rise to your query, is
 considered as referring to this last relationship, you will see that 
there is no contradiction between it and the other texts: "Though the 
Guardian of the Faith has been made the permanent head of so august a 
body he can never, even temporarily, assume the right of exclusive 
legislation. He cannot override the decision of the majority of his 
fellow-members, but is bound to insist upon a reconsideration by them of
 any enactment he conscientiously believes to conflict with the meaning 
and to depart from the spirit of Baha'u'llah's revealed utterances."</p>
<p>	Although the Guardian, in relation to his fellow- members within the
 Universal House of Justice, cannot override the decision of the 
majority, it is inconceivable that the other members would ignore any 
objection he raised in the course of consultation or pass legislation 
contrary to what he expressed as being in harmony with the spirit of the
 Cause. It is, after all, the final act of judgement delivered by the 
Universal House of Justice that is vouchsafed infallibility, not any 
views expressed in the course of the process of enactment.</p>
<p>	It can be seen, therefore, that there is no conflict between the 
Master's statements concerning the unfailing divine guidance conferred 
upon the Universal House of Justice and the above passage from "The 
Dispensation of Baha'u'llah".<br>

</p><p>	It may help the friends to understand this relationship if they 
are aware of some of the processes that the Universal House of Justice 
follows when legislating. First, of course, it observes the greatest 
care in studying the Sacred Texts and the interpretations of the 
Guardian as well as considering the views of all the members. After long
 consultation the process of drafting a pronouncement is put into 
effect. During this process the whole matter may well be reconsidered. 
As a result of such reconsideration the final judgement may be 
significantly different from the conclusion earlier favoured, or 
possibly it may be decided not to legislate at all on that subject at 
that time. One can understand how great would be the attention paid to 
the views of the Guardian during the above process were he alive.</p>
<p>	In considering the second passage we must once more hold fast to the principle that the teachings do not contradict themselves.</p>
<p>	Future Guardians are clearly envisaged and referred to in the 
Writings, but there is nowhere any promise or guarantee that the line of
 Guardians would endure for ever; on the contrary there are clear 
indications that the line could be broken. Yet, in spite of this, there 
is a repeated insistence in the Writings on the indestructibility of the
 Covenant and the immutability of God's Purpose for this Day. One of the
 most striking passages which envisage the possibility of such a break 
in the line of Guardians is in the "Kitab-i-Aqdas" itself:</p>
<p>        The endowments dedicated to charity revert to God,<br>
   the  Revealer of Signs. No one has the right to lay hold<br>
   on them  without leave from the Dawning-Place of<br>
   Revelation. After Him the decision rests with the Aghsan<br>
   [Branches], and after them with the House of Justice --<br>
   should it be established in the world by then -- so that<br>
   they may use these endowments for the benefit of the<br>
   Sites exalted in this Cause, and for that which they have<br>
   been commanded by God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful.<br>
   Otherwise the endowments should be referred to the people<br>
   of Baha, who speak not without His leave and who pass no<br>
   judgement but in accordance with that which God has<br>
   ordained in this Tablet, they who are the champions of<br>
   victory betwixt heaven and earth, so that they may spend<br>
   them on that which has been decreed in the Holy Book by<br>
   God, the Mighty, the Bountiful.<br>

</p><p>	The passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957 precipitated the very 
situation provided for in this passage, in that the line of Aghsan ended
 before the House of Justice had been elected. Although, as is seen, the
 ending of the line of Aghsan at some stage was provided for, we must 
never underestimate the grievous loss that the Faith has suffered. God's
 purpose for mankind remains unchanged, however, and the mighty Covenant
 of Baha'u'llah remains impregnable. Has not Baha'u'llah stated 
categorically, "The Hand of Omnipotence hath established His Revelation 
upon an unassailable, an enduring foundation." While 'Abdu'l-Baha 
confirms: "Verily, God effecteth that which He pleaseth; naught can 
annul His Covenant; naught can obstruct His favour nor oppose His 
Cause!" "Everything is subject to corruption; but the Covenant of thy 
Lord shall continue to pervade all regions." "The tests of every 
dispensation are in direct proportion to the greatness of the Cause, and
 as heretofore such a manifest Covenant, written by the Supreme Pen, 
hath not been entered upon, the tests are proportionately severe.... 
These agitations of the violators are no more than the foam of the 
ocean,... This foam of the ocean shall not endure and shall soon 
disperse and vanish, while the ocean of the Covenant shall eternally 
surge and roar." And Shoghi Effendi has clearly stated: "The bedrock on 
which this Administrative Order is founded is God's immutable Purpose 
for mankind in this day." "...this priceless gem of Divine Revelation, 
now still in its embryonic state, shall evolve within the shell of His 
law, and shall forge ahead, undivided and unimpaired, till it embraces 
the whole of mankind."</p>
<p>	In the Baha'i Faith there are two authoritative centres appointed to
 which the believers must turn, for in reality the Interpreter of the 
Word is an extension of that centre which is the Word itself. The Book 
is the record of the utterance of Baha'u'llah, while the divinely 
inspired Interpreter is the living Mouth of that Book -- it is he and he
 alone who can authoritatively state what the Book means. Thus one 
centre is the Book with its Interpreter, and the other is the Universal 
House of Justice guided by God to decide on whatever is not explicitly 
revealed in the Book. This pattern of centres and their relationships is
 apparent at every stage in the unfoldment of the Cause. In the 
"Kitab-i-Aqdas" Baha'u'llah tells the believers to refer after His 
passing to the Book, and to "Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath 
branched from this Ancient Root."<br>
 In the "Kitab-i-'Ahdi" (the Book of Baha'u'llah's Covenant), He makes 
it clear that this reference is to 'Abdu'l-Baha. In the "Aqdas" 
Baha'u'llah also ordains the institution of the Universal House of 
Justice, and confers upon it the powers necessary for it to discharge 
its ordained functions. The Master in His Will and Testament explicitly 
institutes the Guardianship, which Shoghi Effendi states was clearly 
anticipated in the verses of the "Kitab-i-Aqdas", reaffirms and 
elucidates the authority of the Universal House of Justice, and refers 
the believers once again to the Book: "Unto the Most Holy Book every one
 must turn and all that is not expressly recorded therein must be 
referred to the Universal House of Justice.", and at the very end of the
 Will He says: "All must seek guidance and turn unto the Centre of the 
Cause and the House of Justice. And he that turneth unto whatsoever else
 is indeed in grievous error."</p>
<p>	As the sphere of jurisdiction of the Universal House of Justice in 
matters of legislation extends to whatever is not explicitly revealed in
 the Sacred Text, it is clear that the Book itself is the highest 
authority and delimits the sphere of action of the House of Justice. 
Likewise, the Interpreter of the Book must also have the authority to 
define the sphere of the legislative action of the elected 
representatives of the Cause. The writings of the Guardian and the 
advice given by him over the thirty-six years of his Guardianship show 
the way in which he exercised this function in relation to the Universal
 House of Justice as well as to National and Local Spiritual Assemblies.</p>
<p>	The fact that the Guardian has the authority to define the sphere of
 the legislative action of the Universal House of Justice does not carry
 with it the corollary that without such guidance the Universal House of
 Justice might stray beyond the limits of its proper authority; such a 
deduction would conflict with all the other texts referring to its 
infallibility, and specifically with the Guardian's own clear assertion 
that the Universal House of Justice never can or will infringe on the 
sacred and prescribed domain of the Guardianship. It should be 
remembered, however, that although National and Local Spiritual 
Assemblies can receive divine guidance if they consult in the manner and
 spirit described by 'Abdu'l-Baha, they do not share in the explicit 
guarantees of infallibility conferred upon the Universal House of 
Justice. Any careful student of the Cause can see with what care the 
Guardian, after the passing of 'Abdu'l- Baha, guided these elected 
representatives of the believers in the<br>
 painstaking erection of the Administrative Order and in the formulation of Local and National Baha'i Constitutions.</p>
<p>	We hope that these elucidations will assist the friends in 
understanding these relationships more clearly, but we must all remember
 that we stand too close to the beginnings of the System ordained by 
Baha'u'llah to be able fully to understand its potentialities or the 
inter-relationships of its component parts. As Shoghi Effendi's 
secretary wrote on his behalf to an individual believer on 25 March 
1930, "The contents of the Will of the Master are far too much for the 
present generation to comprehend. It needs at least a century of actual 
working before the treasures of wisdom hidden in it can be revealed...."</p>

</p><p>	EXCELLENCE IN ALL THINGS</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Baha'u'llah:</p>
<p>	766. Say: Beware, O people of Baha, lest ye walk in the ways of them
 whose words differ from their deeds. Strive that ye may be enabled to 
manifest to the peoples of the earth the signs of God, and to mirror 
forth His commandments. Let your acts be a guide unto all mankind, for 
the professions of most men, be they high or low, differ from their 
conduct. It is through your deeds that ye can distinguish yourselves 
from others. Through them the brightness of your light can be shed upon 
the whole earth. Happy is the man that heedeth My counsel, and keepeth 
the precepts prescribed by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), sec. 139, p. 305)</p>
<p>	767. Let each morn be better than its eve and each morrow richer 
than its yesterday. Man's merit lieth in service and virtue and not in 
the pageantry of wealth and riches.... Guard against idleness and sloth,
 and cling unto that which profiteth mankind, whether young or old, 
whether high or low....</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas", (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1988), p. 138)</p>
<p>	768. The companions of God are, in this day, the lump that must 
leaven the peoples of the world. They must show forth such 
trustworthiness, such truthfulness and perseverance, such deeds and 
character that all mankind may profit by their example.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine Justice" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 23)</p>
<p>	769. Tell him, no one in this world can claim any relationship to Me
 except those who, in all their deeds and in their conduct, follow My 
example, in such wise that all the peoples of the earth would be 
powerless to prevent them from doing and saying that which is meet and 
seemly.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Shoghi Effendi, "God Passes By", rev. ed. (Wilmette:Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), p. 133)<br>

</p><p>	770. Strain every nerve to acquire both inner and outer 
perfections, for the fruit of the human tree hath ever been and will 
ever be perfections both within and without. It is not desirable that a 
man be left without knowledge or skills, for he is then but a barren 
tree. Then, so much as capacity and capability allow, ye needs must deck
 the tree of being with fruits such as knowledge, wisdom, spiritual 
perception and eloquent speech.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	771. It is incumbent upon the children to exert themselves to the 
utmost in acquiring the art of reading and writing.... Writing skills 
that will provide for urgent needs will be enough for some; and then it 
is better and more fitting that they should spend their time in studying
 those branches of knowledge which are of use. As for what the Supreme 
Pen hath previously set down, the reason is that in every art and skill,
 God loveth the highest perfection.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	From the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	772. From amongst all mankind hath He chosen you, and your eyes have
 been opened to the light of guidance and your ears attuned to the music
 of the Company above; and blessed by abounding grace, your hearts and 
souls have been born into new life. Thank ye and praise ye God that the 
hand of infinite bestowals hath set upon your heads this gem-studded 
crown, this crown whose lustrous jewels will forever flash and sparkle 
down all the reaches of time.</p>
<p>	To thank Him for this, make ye a mighty effort, and choose for 
yourselves a noble goal. Through the power of faith, obey ye the 
teachings of God, and let all your actions conform to His laws....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 17, p. 35)</p>
<p>	773. O army of God! Through the protection and help vouchsafed by 
the Blessed Beauty -- may my life be a sacrifice to His loved ones -- ye
 must conduct yourselves in such a manner that ye may stand out 
distinguished and brilliant as the sun among other souls. Should any one
 of you enter a city, he should become a centre of attraction by reason 
of his sincerity,<br>
 his faithfulness and love, his honesty and fidelity, his truthfulness 
and loving-kindness towards all the peoples of the world, so that the 
people of that city may cry out and say: "This man is unquestionably a 
Baha'i, for his manners, his behaviour, his conduct, his morals, his 
nature, and disposition reflect the attributes of the Baha'is." Not 
until ye attain this station can ye be said to have been faithful to the
 Covenant and Testament of God....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 35, pp. 70-71)</p>
<p>	774. O true companions! All humankind are as children in a school, 
and the Dawning-Points of Light, the Sources of divine revelation, are 
the teachers, wondrous and without peer. In the school of realities they
 educate these sons and daughters, according to teachings from God, and 
foster them in the bosom of grace, so that they may develop along every 
line, show forth the excellent gifts and blessings of the Lord, and 
combine human perfections; that they may advance in all aspects of human
 endeavour, whether outward or inward, hidden or visible, material or 
spiritual, until they make of this mortal world a widespread mirror, to 
reflect that other world which dieth not.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 102, p. 128)</p>
<p>	775. Wherefore, O loved ones of God! Make ye a mighty effort till 
you yourselves betoken this advancement in all these confirmations, and 
become focal centres of God's blessings, daysprings of the light of His 
unity, promoters of the gifts and graces of civilized life. Be ye in 
that land vanguards of the perfections of humankind; carry forward the 
various branches of knowledge, be active and progressive in the field of
 inventions and the arts. Endeavour to rectify the conduct of men, and 
seek to excel the whole world in moral character. While the children are
 yet in their infancy feed them from the breast of heavenly grace, 
foster them in the cradle of all excellence, rear them in the embrace of
 bounty. Give them the advantage of every useful kind of knowledge. Let 
them share in every new and rare and wondrous craft and art. Bring them 
up to work and strive, and accustom them to hardship. Teach them to 
dedicate their lives to matters of great import, and inspire them to 
undertake studies that will benefit mankind.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 102, p. 129)<br>

</p><p>	776. They must be constantly encouraged and made eager to gain 
all the summits of human accomplishment, so that from their earliest 
years they will be taught to have high aims, to conduct themselves well,
 to be chaste, pure, and undefiled, and will learn to be of powerful 
resolve and firm of purpose in all things....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 110, p. 135)</p>
<p>	777. It is incumbent upon Baha'i children to surpass other children 
in the acquisition of sciences and arts, for they have been cradled in 
the grace of God.</p>
<p>	Whatever other children learn in a year, let Baha'i children learn 
in a month. The heart of 'Abdu'l-Baha longeth, in its love, to find that
 Baha'i young people, each and all, are known throughout the world for 
their intellectual attainments. There is no question but that they will 
exert all their efforts, their energies, their sense of pride, to 
acquire the sciences and arts.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 119, p. 141)</p>
<p>	778. The instruction of these children is even as the work of a 
loving gardener who tendeth his young plants in the flowering fields of 
the All-Glorious. There is no doubt that it will yield the desired 
results; especially is this true of instruction as to Baha'i obligations
 and Baha'i conduct, for the little children must needs be made aware in
 their very heart and soul that "Baha'i" is not just a name but a truth.
 Every child must be trained in the things of the spirit, so that he may
 embody all the virtues and become a source of glory to the Cause of 
God. Otherwise, the mere word "Baha'i", if it yield no fruit, will come 
to nothing.</p>
<p>	Strive then to the best of thine ability to let these children know 
that a Baha'i is one who embodieth all the perfections, that he must 
shine out like a lighted taper -- not be darkness upon darkness and yet 
bear the name "Baha'i".</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 123, p. 143)</p>
<p>	779. It behoveth the craftsmen of the world at each moment to offer a
 thousand tokens of gratitude at the Sacred Threshold, and to exert 
their highest endeavour and diligently pursue their professions so that 
their<br>
 efforts may produce that which will manifest the greatest beauty and perfection before the eyes of all men.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 127, p. 145)</p>
<p>	780. Make ye then a mighty effort, that the purity and sanctity 
which, above all else, are cherished by 'Abdu'l- Baha, shall distinguish
 the people of Baha; that in every kind of excellence the people of God 
shall surpass all other human beings; that both outwardly and inwardly 
they shall prove superior to the rest; that for purity, immaculacy, 
refinement, and the preservation of health, they shall be leaders in the
 vanguard of those who know. And that by their freedom from enslavement,
 their knowledge, their self- control, they shall be first among the 
pure, the free and the wise.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 129, p. 150)</p>
<p>	781. Let God's beloved, each and every one, be the essence of 
purity, the very life of holiness, so that in every country they may 
become famed for their sanctity, independence of spirit, and meekness. 
Let them be cheered by draughts from the eternal cup of love for God, 
and make merry as they drink from the wine-vaults of Heaven. Let them 
behold the Blessed Beauty, and feel the flame and rapture of that 
meeting, and be struck dumb with awe and wonder. This is the station of 
the sincere; this is the way of the loyal; this is the brightness that 
shineth on the faces of those nigh unto God.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 174, p. 203)</p>
<p>	782. Now amidst all the peoples of the world must the beloved arise,
 with a heart even as the day-star, a strong inward urge, a shining 
brow, a musk-scented breath, a tongue speaking ever of God, an 
exposition crystal-clear, a high resolve, a power born of heaven, a 
spiritual character, a confirmation nothing short of the divine. Let 
them one and all become as a splendour on the horizon of heaven, and in 
the skies of the world a dazzling star. Let them be fruitful trees in 
the celestial bowers, sweet-scented blooms in the divine gardens; let 
them be verses of perfection on the page of the universe, words of 
oneness in the Book of Life. This is the first age, and the early 
beginnings of the dispensation of the Most Great light, wherefore, 
within this century, virtues must be acquired, goodly qualities must be 
perfected within this span of time. In<br>
 these very days the Abha Paradise must pitch its pavilions on the 
plains of the world. The lights of reality must now be revealed, and the
 secrets of God's bestowals must now be made known, and now must the 
olden grace shine forth and this world change into the pleasure-ground 
of heaven, the garden of God. And out of pure hearts, and through 
heavenly bounties, all the perfections, qualities and attributes of the 
divine must now be made manifest.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 193, p. 232)</p>
<p>	783. I beg of Him to bestow His confirmations upon those loved ones,
 dwellers in that pure and holy land, and to grant them successful 
outcomes in all things: that in their character, their behaviour, their 
words, their way of life, in all they are and do, He will make them to 
achieve distinction among men; that He will gather them into the world 
community, their hearts filled with ecstasy and fervour and yearning 
love, with knowledge and certitude, with steadfastness and unity, their 
faces beauteous and bright.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 207, p. 260)</p>
<p>	784. ...they should exemplify in every aspect of their lives those 
attributes and virtues that are born of God and should arise to 
distinguish themselves by their goodly behaviour. They should justify 
their claim to be Baha'is by deeds and not by name. He is a true Baha'i 
who strives by day and by night to progress and advance along the path 
of human endeavor, whose most cherished desire is so to live and act as 
to enrich and illuminate the world, whose source of inspiration is the 
essence of Divine virtue, whose aim in life is so to conduct himself as 
to be the cause of infinite progress. Only when he attains unto such 
perfect gifts can it be said of him that he is a true Baha'i. For in 
this holy Dispensation, the crowning glory of bygone ages and cycles, 
true Faith is no mere acknowledgement of the Unity of God, but rather 
the living of a life that will manifest all the perfections and virtues 
implied in such belief....</p>
<p>	("Baha'i Year Book" ["The Baha'i World"], vol. 1 (New York: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1926), p. 12)<br>

</p><p>	785. So, O beloved of God, endeavor with your hearts and souls, 
that ye may be qualified with the morals and attributes of the Blessed 
Perfection, and partake of the bounties of His sanctity; that ye may 
become signs of unity and standards of oneness, discover the essence of 
singleness and sing harmonies and lays in this divine garden, in 
merciful melodies; that ye may become as thankful birds, and sing a song
 in the rose-garden of existence which may astonish minds and senses; 
that ye may hoist a standard on the apex of the universe which may 
flutter in the winds of favor, and plant a tree in the field of the 
visible world which may bring forth fruits of the utmost delicacy and 
freshness.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. 2 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Society, 1915), p. 374)</p>
<p>	786. O ye friends of God! Show ye an endeavor that all the nations 
and communities of the world, even the enemies, put their trust, 
assurance and hope in you; that if a person falls into errors for a 
hundred-thousand times he may yet turn his face to you, hopeful that you
 will forgive his sins; for he must not become hopeless, neither grieved
 nor despondent. This is the conduct and the manner of the people of 
Baha'. This is the foundation of the most high pathway! Ye should 
conform your conduct and manners with the advices of Abdul-Baha.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. 2, p. 436)</p>
<p>	787. Then know thou that, verily, the people of Baha' must needs be 
distinguished from others in all respects, until they become the lamps 
of the True One among the creatures and the stars of guidance shining 
from the Supreme Concourse.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas, vol. 3 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Society, 1916), p. 682)</p>
<p>	788. The most vital duty, in this day, is to purify your characters,
 to correct your manners, and improve your conduct. The beloved of the 
Merciful must show forth such character and conduct among His creatures,
 that the fragrance of their holiness may be shed upon the whole world, 
and may quicken the dead, inasmuch as the purpose of the Manifestation 
of God and the dawning of the limitless lights of the Invisible is to 
educate the souls of men, and refine the character of every living man 
-- so that blessed individuals, who have freed themselves from the<br>
 murk of the animal world, shall rise up with those qualities which are the adornings of the reality of man....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet, published in "Selections from the Writings of 
'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 10 and cited in Shoghi Effendi, "The Advent of Divine 
Justice", p. 26)</p>
<p>	789. At this time, likewise, I most urgently request the friends of 
God to make every effort, as much as lieth within their competence, 
along these lines. The harder they strive to widen the scope of their 
knowledge, the better and more gratifying will be the result. Let the 
loved ones of God, whether young or old, whether male or female, each 
according to his capabilities, bestir themselves and spare no efforts to
 acquire the various current branches of knowledge, both spiritual and 
secular, and of the arts. Whensoever they gather in their meetings let 
their conversation be confined to learned subjects and to information on
 the knowledge of the day.</p>
<p>	If they do thus, they will flood the world with the Manifest Light, 
and change this dusty earth into gardens of the Realm of Glory.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	790. It is clear that learning is the greatest bestowal of God; that
 knowledge and the acquirement thereof is a blessing from Heaven. Thus 
is it incumbent upon the friends of God to exert such an effort and 
strive with such eagerness to promote divine knowledge, culture and the 
sciences, that erelong those who are schoolchildren today will become 
the most erudite of all the fraternity of the wise. This is a service 
rendered unto God Himself, and it is one of His inescapable 
commandments.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	791. O loving friends! Exert every effort to acquire the various 
branches of knowledge and true understanding. Strain every nerve to 
achieve both material and spiritual accomplishments.</p>
<p>	Encourage the children from their earliest years to master every 
kind of learning, and make them eager to become skilled in every art -- 
the aim being that through the favouring grace of God, the heart of each
 one may become even as a mirror disclosing the secrets of the universe,
 penetrating the innermost reality of all things; and that each may earn
 world-wide fame in all branches of knowledge, science and the arts.<br>

</p><p>	Certainly, certainly, neglect not the education of the children.
 Rear them to be possessed of spiritual qualities, and be assured of the
 gifts and favours of the Lord.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	792. Utilize every means to make this School a garden of the 
All-Merciful, from which the lights of learning will cast their beams, 
and wherein the children, whether Baha'i or other, will be educated to 
such a degree as to become God's gifts to man, and the pride of the 
human race. Let them make the greatest progress in the shortest span of 
time, let them open wide their eyes and uncover the inner realities of 
all things, become proficient in every art and skill, and learn to 
comprehend the secrets of all things even as they are -- this faculty 
being one of the clearly evident effects of servitude to the Holy 
Threshold.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	From the Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha:</p>
<p>	793. I give you my advice, and it is this: Train these children with
 divine exhortations. From their childhood instill in their hearts the 
love of God so they may manifest in their lives the fear of God and have
 confidence in the bestowals of God. Teach them to free themselves from 
human imperfections and to acquire the divine perfections latent in the 
heart of man. The life of man is useful if he attains the perfections of
 man. If he becomes the center of the imperfections of the world of 
humanity, death is better than life, and nonexistence better than 
existence. Therefore, make ye an effort in order that these children may
 be rightly trained and educated and that each one of them may attain 
perfection in the world of humanity. Know ye the value of these 
children, for they are all my children.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
2nd. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 53-54)</p>
<p>	794. I desire distinction for you. The Baha'is must be distinguished
 from others of humanity. But this distinction must not depend upon 
wealth -- that they should become more affluent than other people. I do 
not desire for you financial distinction. It is not an ordinary 
distinction I desire; not<br>
 scientific, commercial, industrial distinction. For you I desire 
spiritual distinction -- that is, you must become eminent and 
distinguished in morals. In the love of God you must become 
distinguished from all else. You must become distinguished for loving 
humanity, for unity and accord, for love and justice. In brief, you must
 become distinguished in all the virtues of the human world -- for 
faithfulness and sincerity, for justice and fidelity, for firmness and 
steadfastness, for philanthropic deeds and service to the human world, 
for love toward every human being, for unity and accord with all people,
 for removing prejudices and promoting international peace. Finally, you
 must become distinguished for heavenly illumination and for acquiring 
the bestowals of God. I desire this distinction for you. This must be 
the point of distinction among you.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace", p. 190)</p>
<p>	795. Therefore I say that man must travel in the way of God. Day by 
day he must endeavor to become better, his belief must increase and 
become firmer, his good qualities and his turning to God must be 
greater, the fire of his love must flame more brightly; then day by day 
he will make progress, for to stop advancing is the means of going back.
 The bird when he flies soars ever higher and higher, for as soon as he 
stops flying he will come down. Every day, in the morning when arising 
you should compare today with yesterday and see in what condition you 
are. If you see your belief is stronger and your heart more occupied 
with God and your love increased and your freedom from the world greater
 then thank God and ask for the increase of these qualities. You must 
begin to pray and repent for all that you have done which is wrong and 
you must implore and ask for help and assistance that you may become 
better than yesterday so that you may continue to make progress.</p>
<p>	("Star of the West", vol. 8, no. 6 (24 June 1917), p. 68)</p>
<p>	796. You must become the shining candles of moral precepts and 
spiritual ideals and be the means of the illumination of others. Clothe 
your bodies with the robes of virtues. Characterize yourselves with the 
characteristics of the people of divine morality. Shun all manner of 
vices as you shun a poisonous snake or a leper. Let the corps of 
professors and the students be impressed with the purity and holiness of
 your lives so that they may<br>
 take you as paragons of worthiness, examples of nobility of nature, 
observers of the moral laws, holding in subordination the lower element 
by the higher spirit, the conquerors of self and the masters of 
wholesome, vital forces in all the avenues of life. Strive always to be 
at the head of your classes through hard study and true merit. Be always
 in a prayerful state and appreciate the value of everything. Entertain 
high ideals and stimulate your intellectual and constructive forces.</p>
<p>	("Star of the West", vol. 9, no. 9 (20 August 1918), p. 98)</p>
<p>	797. I hope that while you are studying in this college you may so 
excel all other students in the various branches of knowledge taught 
therein that all of them may testify that the Bahai students have 
another power, are inspired with another effort, are imbued with a 
nobler ambition, are stimulated by higher motives and make wider and 
deeper exertions than others. If you do not surpass the others, then 
what distinction will there remain for you? Therefore, you must strive 
to be superior to them, so that everyone may bear testimony to this 
fact....</p>
<p>	("Star of the West", vol. 9, no. 9 (20 August 1918), pp. 98-99)</p>
<p>	798. I hope that through the favor and bounty of the Blessed Beauty,
 his holiness the Bab, and the ineffable blessings which hallow this 
holy shrine,[1] the confirmations of the Kingdom of Abha may encircle 
you, and that you may be characterized with the shining qualities and 
brilliant attributes of the Bahai life. May your morality become more 
defined day by day! May your faith and assurance be increased day by 
day! May your attraction to the Kingdom of Abha be intensified day by 
day! May your attainment in sciences and arts become more universal day 
by day! Perchance, God willing, you may become perfect and accomplished 
from every standpoint and be the means of the enlightenment of Persia.<br>

<p>	From letters written by Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	799. One thing would lessen appreciably the heavy burden that weighs
 upon my heart and mind and that is the extent to which the Baha'is 
conform in their private life and<br>
 by Baha'u'llah. It is an infinitely high standard and anything short of
 it will in the eyes of those who really count prove piteously 
negligible and utterly futile.</p>
<p>	(12 October 1924 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	800. Let every believer, desirous to witness the swift and healthy 
progress of the Cause of God, realize the twofold nature of his task. 
Let him first turn his eyes inwardly and search his own heart and 
satisfy himself that in his relations with his fellow-believers, 
irrespective of colour and class, he is proving himself increasingly 
loyal to the spirit of his beloved Faith. Assured and content that he is
 exerting his utmost in a conscious effort to approach nearer every day 
the lofty station to which his gracious Master summons him, let him turn
 to his second task, and, with befitting confidence and vigour, assail 
the devastating power of those forces which in his own heart he has 
already succeeded in subduing. Fully alive to the unfailing efficacy of 
the power of Baha'u'llah, and armed with the essential weapons of wise 
restraint and inflexible resolve, let him wage a constant fight against 
the inherited tendencies, the corruptive instincts, the fluctuating 
fashions, the false pretences of the society in which he lives and 
moves.</p>
<p>	(12 April 1927 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected 
Messages 1922-1932" [rev. ed.], (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 
1980), p. 130)</p>
<p>	801. We can prove ourselves worthy of our Cause only if in our 
individual conduct and corporate life we sedulously imitate the example 
of our beloved Master, Whom the terrors of tyranny, the storms of 
incessant abuse, the oppressiveness of humiliation, never caused to 
deviate a hair's breadth from the revealed Law of Baha'u'llah. Such is 
the path of servitude, such is the way of holiness He chose to tread to 
the very end of His life. Nothing short of the strictest adherence to 
His glorious example can safely steer our course amid the pitfalls of 
this perilous age, and lead us on to fulfil our high destiny.</p>
<p>	(12 April 1927, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 1922-1932", p. 132)<br>

</p><p>	802. In philanthropic enterprises and acts of charity, in 
promotion of the general welfare and furtherance of the public good 
including that of every group without any exceptions whatever, let the 
beloved of God attract the favourable attention of all, and lead all the
 rest.</p>
<p>	(January 1929 addressed to the Baha'is of the East- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	803. The work in which you are engaged is dear and near to my heart 
and constitutes one of the most vital aspects of the manifold activities
 of our beloved Faith. The highest standards of purity, of integrity, of
 detachment and sacrifice must be maintained by the members of your 
group in order to enable you to play a decisive part in the spread and 
consolidation of the Faith. A tremendous responsibility has been laid 
upon you, and nothing short of a pure, a virtuous, an active and truly 
exemplary life can enable you to fulfil your high destiny....</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 6 
September 1934 written on his behalf to the Youth Council of the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	804. Such a rectitude of conduct must manifest itself, with 
ever-increasing potency, in every verdict which the elected 
representatives of the Baha'i community, in whatever capacity they may 
find themselves, may be called upon to pronounce. It must be constantly 
reflected in the business dealings of all its members, in their domestic
 lives, in all manner of employment, and in any service they may, in the
 future, render their government or people. It must be exemplified in 
the conduct of all Baha'i electors, when exercising their sacred rights 
and functions. It must characterize the attitude of every loyal believer
 towards nonacceptance of political posts, nonidentification with 
political parties, nonparticipation in political controversies, and 
nonmembership in political organizations and ecclesiastical 
institutions. It must reveal itself in the uncompromising adherence of 
all, whether young or old, to the clearly enunciated and fundamental 
principles laid down by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His addresses, and to the laws 
and ordinances revealed by Baha'u'llah in His Most Holy Book. It must be
 demonstrated in the impartiality of every defender of the Faith against
 its enemies, in his fair- mindedness in recognizing any merits that 
enemy may possess, and in his honesty in<br>
 discharging any obligations he may have towards him. It must constitute
 the brightest ornament of the life, the pursuits, the exertions, and 
the utterances of every Baha'i teacher, whether laboring at home or 
abroad, whether in the front ranks of the teaching force, or occupying a
 less active and responsible position. It must be made the hallmark of 
that numerically small, yet intensely dynamic and highly responsible 
body of the elected national representatives of every Baha'i community, 
which constitutes the sustaining pillar, and the sole instrument for the
 election, in every community, of that Universal House whose very name 
and title, as ordained by Baha'u'llah, symbolizes that rectitude of 
conduct which is its highest mission to safeguard and enforce.</p>
<p>	(25 December 1938 to the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, published in "The Advent of Divine Justice" pp. 26- 27)</p>
<p>	805. A chaste and holy life must be made the controlling principle 
in the behavior and conduct of all Baha'is, both in their social 
relations with the members of their own community, and in their contact 
with the world at large. It must adorn and reinforce the ceaseless 
labors and meritorious exertions of those whose enviable position is to 
propagate the Message, and to administer the affairs, of the Faith of 
Baha'u'llah. It must be upheld, in all its integrity and implications, 
in every phase of the life of those who fill the ranks of that Faith, 
whether in their homes, their travels, their clubs, their societies, 
their entertainments, their schools, and their universities. It must be 
accorded special consideration in the conduct of the social activities 
of every Baha'i summer school and any other occasions on which Baha'i 
community life is organized and fostered. It must be closely and 
continually identified with the mission of the Baha'i youth, both as an 
element in the life of the Baha'i community, and as a factor in the 
future progress and orientation of the youth of their own country.</p>
<p>	(25 December 1938, published in "The Advent of Divine Justice", pp. 29-30)</p>
<p>	From letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi:</p>
<p>	806. The responsibility of young believers is very great, as they 
must not only fit themselves to inherit the work of the older Baha'is 
and carry on the affairs of the Cause in general, but the world which 
lies ahead of them -- as promised by Baha'u'llah -- will be a world 
chastened by its<br>
 sufferings, ready to listen to His Divine Message at last; and 
consequently a very high character will be expected of the exponents of 
such a religion. To deepen their knowledge, to perfect themselves in the
 Baha'i standards of virtue and upright conduct, should be the paramount
 duty of every young Baha'i.</p>
<p>	(6 June 1941 to the Baha'i youth of Bombay, India, published in 
"Dawn of a New Day" (New Delhi: Baha'i Publishing Trust, [1970]), pp. 
179-80)</p>
<p>	807. The Guardian was delighted to hear of your youth group. The 
children who are trained in the world-embracing teachings of Baha'u'llah
 cannot but grow up to be a truly new race of men. He hopes these young 
people will prepare themselves for the great task which will face them 
in the future, that of helping to rebuild the world with the aid and 
inspiration of the Baha'i teachings.</p>
<p>	(25 December 1941 to the Baha'is of Hobart, Tasmania)</p>
<p>	808. If we could perceive the true reality of things we would see 
that the greatest of all battles raging in the world today is the 
spiritual battle. If the believers like yourself, young and eager and 
full of life, desire to win laurels for true and undying heroism, then 
let them join in the spiritual battle -- whatever their physical 
occupation may be -- which involves the very soul of man. The hardest 
and the noblest task in the world today is to be a true Baha'i; this 
requires that we defeat not only the current evils prevailing all over 
the world, but the weaknesses, attachments to the past, prejudices, and 
selfishnesses that may be inherited and acquired within our own 
characters; that we give forth a shining and incorruptible example to 
our fellow-men.</p>
<p>	(5 April 1942 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	809. He hopes that you will develop into Baha'is in character as 
well as in belief. The whole purpose of Baha'u'llah is that we should 
become a new kind of people, people who are upright, kind, intelligent, 
truthful, and honest and who live according to His great laws laid down 
for this new epoch in man's development. To call ourselves Baha'is is 
not enough, our inmost being must become ennobled and enlightened 
through living a Baha'i life.</p>
<p>	(25 August 1944 to the Youth Session, Louhelen School)<br>

</p><p>	810. Indeed if the friends could seek, and exert themselves, to 
become 100 per cent Baha'is they would see how greatly their influence 
over others would be increased, and how rapidly the Cause would spread. 
The world is seeking not a compromise but the embodiment of a high and 
shining ideal. The more the friends live up to our teachings in every 
aspect of their lives, in their homes, in business, in their social 
relationships, the greater will be the attraction they exercise over the
 hearts of others.</p>
<p>	(23 January 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	811. The believers, as we all know, should endeavour to set such an 
example in their personal lives and conduct that others will feel 
impelled to embrace a Faith which reforms human character. However, 
unfortunately, not everyone achieves easily and rapidly the victory over
 self. What every believer, new or old, should realize is that the Cause
 has the spiritual power to re-create us if we make the effort to let 
that power influence us, and the greatest help in this respect is 
prayer. We must supplicate Baha'u'llah to assist us to overcome the 
failings in our own characters, and also exert our own will-power in 
mastering ourselves.</p>
<p>	(27 January 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	812. His constant hope is that the believers will conduct 
themselves, individually and in their Baha'i Community life, in such a 
manner as to attract the attention of others to the Cause. The world is 
not only starving for lofty principles and ideals, it is, above all, 
starving for a shining example which the Baha'is can and must provide.</p>
<p>	(22 February 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	813. ...the young Baha'is in every city should make a point of 
keeping in touch with local youth activities and clubs, and endeavouring
 to make their views known to as many young people in as many ways as 
possible. Above all they should set a high example to them; chastity, 
politeness, friendliness, hospitality, joyous optimism about the 
ultimate future happiness and well-being of mankind, should distinguish 
them and win<br>
 over to them the love and admiration of their fellow youth. The thing 
which is most conspicuously lacking in modern life is a high standard of
 conduct and good character; the young Baha'is must demonstrate both, if
 they hope to seriously win over to the Faith members of their own 
generation, so sorely disillusioned and so contaminated by the laxity 
war gives rise to.</p>
<p>	(20 October 1945 to the National Youth Committee of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	814. We must be patient with each other's shortcomings, and always 
strive to create love and unity among the believers, who, after all, are
 still immature in many ways and far from perfect. The Faith itself is 
the great thing, and the Baha'is must strive to become ever more perfect
 instruments for Baha'u'llah to use and to accomplish His purpose 
through.</p>
<p>	(26 May 1946 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	815. The Guardian has urged, over and over again, the paramount 
necessity for Baha'i Youth to exemplify the Teachings, most particularly
 the moral aspect of them. If they are not distinguished for their high 
conduct they cannot expect other young people to take the Cause very 
seriously.</p>
<p>	(6 September 1946 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	816. He feels that the youth, in particular, must constantly and 
determinedly strive to exemplify a Baha'i life. In the world around us 
we see moral decay, promiscuity, indecency, vulgarity, bad manners -- 
the Baha'i young people must be the opposite of these things, and, by 
their chastity, their uprightness, their decency, their consideration 
and good manners, attract others, old and young, to the Faith. The world
 is tired of words; it wants example, and it is up to the Baha'i youth 
to furnish it.</p>
<p>	(19 September 1946 to the Green Acre Summer School)</p>
<p>	817. The eyes of the people of the world are beginning to be focused
 on us; and, as humanity's plight goes from bad to worse, we will be 
watched ever more intently by non- Baha'is, to see whether we do uphold 
our own<br>
 institutions whole-heartedly; whether we are the people of the new 
creation or not; whether we live up to our beliefs, principles and laws 
in deed as well as word. We cannot be too careful. We cannot be too 
exemplary.</p>

<p>	818. Blessed is the spot, and the house, and the place, and the 
city, and the heart, and the mountain, and the refuge, and the cave, and
 the valley, and the land, and the sea, and the island, and the meadow 
where mention of God hath been made, and His praise glorified.</p>

<p>	819. The parents must exert every effort to rear their offspring to 
be religious, for should the children not attain this greatest of 
adornments, they will not obey their parents, which in a certain sense 
means that they will not obey God. Indeed, such children will show no 
consideration to anyone, and will do exactly as they please.</p>

compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice 
(London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), p. 4)</p>
<p>	820. We have enjoined upon every son to serve his father. Thus have We decreed this command in the Book.</p>
<p>	(From "Questions &amp; Answers" - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	821. The fruits of the tree of existence are trustworthiness, 
loyalty, truthfulness and purity. After the recognition of the oneness 
of the Lord, exalted be He, the most important of all duties is to have 
due regard for the rights of one's parents. This matter hath been 
mentioned in all the Books of God...</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian and Arabic)</p>
<p>	822. Blessed is the house that hath attained unto My tender mercy, 
wherein My remembrance is celebrated, and which is ennobled by the<br>
 presence of My loved ones, who have proclaimed My praise, cleaved fast 
to the cord of My grace and been honoured by chanting My verses. Verily 
they are the exalted servants whom God hath extolled in the 
Qayyumu'l-Asma' and other scriptures. Verily He is the All-Hearing, the 
Answerer, He Who perceiveth all things.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>823. These blessed words were uttered by the Tongue of<br>
Grandeur in the Land of Mystery,[1] exalted and glorified is<br>
His utterance:<br>
 [1 Adrianople]</p>
<p>	One of the distinguishing characteristics of this most great 
Dispensation is that the kin of such as have recognized and embraced the
 truth of this Revelation and have, in the glory of His name, the 
Sovereign Lord, quaffed the choice, sealed wine from the chalice of the 
love of the one true God, will, upon their death, if they are outwardly 
non-believers, be graciously invested with divine forgiveness and 
partake of the ocean of His Mercy.</p>
<p>	This bounty, however, will be vouchsafed only to such souls as have 
inflicted no harm upon Him Who is the Sovereign Truth nor upon His loved
 ones. Thus hath it been ordained by Him Who is the Lord of the Throne 
on High and the Ruler of this world and of the world to come.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	824. We have caused thee to return to thy home as a token of Our 
mercy unto thy mother, inasmuch as We have found her overwhelmed with 
sorrow. We have enjoined you in the Book "to worship no one but God and 
to show kindness to your parents".[1] Thus hath the one true God spoken 
and the decree hath been fulfilled by the Almighty, the All-Wise. 
Therefore We have caused thee to return unto her and unto thy sister, 
that your mother's eyes may thereby be cheered, and she may be of the 
thankful.<br>
 [1  Qur'an 46:15.]</p>
<p>	Say, O My people! Show honour to your parents and pay homage to 
them. This will cause blessings to descend upon you from the clouds of 
the bounty of your Lord, the Exalted, the Great.<br>

</p><p>	When We learned of her sadness, We directed thee to return unto 
her, as a token of mercy unto thee from Our presence, and as an 
admonishment for others.</p>
<p>	Beware lest ye commit that which would sadden the hearts of your 
fathers and mothers. Follow ye the path of Truth which indeed is a 
straight path. Should anyone give you a choice between the opportunity 
to render a service to Me and a service to them, choose ye to serve 
them, and let such service be a path leading you to Me. This is My 
exhortation and command unto thee. Observe therefore that which thy 
Lord, the Mighty, the Gracious, hath prescribed unto thee.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF THE BAB:</p>
<p>	825. It is seemly that the servant should, after each prayer, 
supplicate God to bestow mercy and forgiveness upon his parents. 
Thereupon God's call will be raised: "Thousand upon thousand of what 
thou hast asked for thy parents shall be thy recompense!" Blessed is he 
who remembereth his parents when communing with God. There is, verily, 
no God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab", [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 94)</p>
<p>	826. O my God! Let the outpourings of Thy bounty and blessings 
descend upon homes whose inmates have embraced Thy Faith, as a token of 
Thy grace and as a mark of loving- kindness from Thy presence....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of the Bab", p. 200)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA:</p>
<p>	827. As to the terminology I used in my letter, bidding thee to 
consecrate thyself to service in the Cause of God, the meaning of it is 
this: limit thy thoughts to teaching the Faith. Act by day and night 
according to the teachings and counsels and admonitions of Baha'u'llah. 
This doth not preclude marriage. Thou canst take unto thyself a husband 
and at the same time serve the Cause of God; the one doth not preclude 
the other. Know thou the value of these days; let not this chance escape
 thee. Beg thou God to make thee a lighted candle, so that thou mayest 
guide a great multitude through this darksome world.<br>

</p><p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", [rev. ed.] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), p. 100)</p>
<p>	828. Marriage, among the mass of the people, is a physical bond, and
 this union can only be temporary, since it is foredoomed to a physical 
separation at the close.</p>
<p>	Among the people of Baha, however, marriage must be a union of the 
body and of the spirit as well, for here both husband and wife are aglow
 with the same wine, both are enamoured of the same matchless Face, both
 live and move through the same spirit, both are illumined by the same 
glory. This connection between them is a spiritual one, hence it is a 
bond that will abide forever. Likewise do they enjoy strong and lasting 
ties in the physical world as well, for if the marriage is based both on
 the spirit and the body, that union is a true one, hence it will 
endure. If, however, the bond is physical and nothing more, it is sure 
to be only temporary, and must inexorably end in separation.</p>
<p>	When, therefore, the people of Baha undertake to marry, the union 
must be a true relationship, a spiritual coming together as well as a 
physical one, so that throughout every phase of life, and in all the 
worlds of God, their union will endure; for this real oneness is a 
gleaming out of the love of God.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 117)</p>
<p>	829. Baha'i marriage is the commitment of the two parties one to the
 other, and their mutual attachment of mind and heart. Each must, 
however, exercise the utmost care to become thoroughly acquainted with 
the character of the other, that the binding covenant between them may 
be a tie that will endure forever. Their purpose must be this: to become
 loving companions and comrades and at one with each other for time and 
eternity....</p>
<p>	The true marriage of Baha'is is this, that husband and wife should 
be united both physically and spiritually, that they may ever improve 
the spiritual life of each other, and may enjoy everlasting unity 
throughout all the worlds of God. This is Baha'i marriage.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 118)<br>

</p><p>830. And above all other unions is that between human<br>
beings, especially when it cometh to pass in the love of<br>
God. Thus is the primal oneness made to appear; thus is laid<br>
the foundation of love in the spirit....<br>
("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 119)</p>
<p>	831. Thy wife is not in harmony with thee, but praise be to God, the
 Blessed Beauty is pleased with thee and is conferring upon thee the 
utmost bounty and blessings. But still try to be patient with thy wife, 
perchance she may be transformed and her heart may be illumined....</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 121)</p>
<p>	832. As to thy respected husband: it is incumbent upon thee to treat
 him with great kindness, to consider his wishes and be conciliatory 
with him at all times, till he seeth that because thou hast directed 
thyself toward the Kingdom of God, thy tenderness for him and thy love 
for God have but increased, as well as thy concern for his wishes under 
all conditions.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 122)</p>
<p>	833. O ye two believers in God! The Lord, peerless is He, hath made 
woman and man to abide with each other in the closest companionship, and
 to be even as a single soul. They are two helpmates, two intimate 
friends, who should be concerned about the welfare of each other.</p>
<p>	If they live thus, they will pass through this world with perfect 
contentment, bliss, and peace of heart, and become the object of divine 
grace and favour in the Kingdom of heaven. But if they do other than 
this, they will live out their lives in great bitterness, longing at 
every moment for death, and will be shamefaced in the heavenly realm. 
Strive, then, to abide, heart and soul, with each other as two doves in 
the nest, for this is to be blessed in both worlds.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 122)</p>
<p>	834. O ye loving mothers, know ye that in God's sight, the best of 
all ways to worship Him is to educate the children and train them in all
 the perfections of humankind; and no nobler deed than this can be 
imagined.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 139)<br>

</p><p>	835. O dear one of 'Abdu'l-Baha! Be the son of thy father and be
 the fruit of that tree. Be a son that hath been born of his soul and 
heart and not only of water and clay. A real son is such one as hath 
branched from the spiritual part of man. I ask God that thou mayest be 
at all times confirmed and strengthened.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", p. 140)</p>
<p>	836. Note ye how easily, where unity existeth in a given family, the
 affairs of that family are conducted; what progress the members of that
 family make, how they prosper in the world. their concerns are in 
order, they enjoy comfort and tranquility, they are secure, their 
position is assured, they come to be envied by all. Such a family but 
addeth to its stature and its lasting honour, as day succeedeth day...</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abu'l-Baha", p. 279)</p>
<p>	837. Comfort thy mother and endeavour to do what is conducive to the happiness of her heart....</p>
<p>	('Abdu'l-Baha, "Tablets of Abdul Baha Abbas", vol. 1 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1930), p, 74)</p>
<p>	838. Deliver my longings and greetings to the consolation of thine 
eye,[1]... Verily I love them both even as a compassionate father loveth
 his dear children. As to thee, have for them an abundant love and exert
 thine utmost in training them, so that their being may grow through the
 milk of the love of God, forasmuch as it is the duty of parents to 
perfectly and thoroughly train their children.<br>
 [1 "Consolation of thine eye" - idiomatic Persian expression meaning "son".]</p>
<p>	There are also certain sacred duties on children toward parents, 
which duties are written in the Book of God, as belonging to God. The 
[children's] prosperity in this world and the Kingdom depends upon the 
good pleasure of parents, and without this they will be in manifest 
loss.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. 2 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1930), pp. 262-63)</p>
<p>	839. As to thy question concerning the husband and wife, the tie 
between them and the children given to them by God: Know thou, verily, 
the<br>
 husband is one who hath sincerely turned unto God, is awakened by the 
call of the Beauty of El-Baha and chanteth the verses of Oneness in the 
great assemblies; the wife is a being who wisheth to be overflowing with
 and seeketh after the attributes of God and His names; and the tie 
between them is none other than the Word of God. Verily, it [the Word of
 God] causeth the multitudes to assemble together and the remote ones to
 be united. Thus the husband and wife are brought into affinity, are 
united and harmonized, even as though they were one person. Through 
their mutual union, companionship and love great results are produced in
 the world, both material and spiritual. The spiritual result is the 
appearance of divine bounties. The material result is the children who 
are born in the cradle of the love of God, who are nurtured by the 
breast of the knowledge of God, who are brought up in the bosom of the 
gift of God, and who are fostered in the lap of the training of God. 
Such children are those of whom it was said by Christ, "Verily, they are
 the children of the Kingdom!"</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas", vol. 3 (Chicago: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1930), pp. 605-6)</p>
<p>	840. The friends of God must so live and conduct themselves, and 
evince such excellence of character and conduct, as to make others 
astonished. The love between husband and wife must not be purely 
physical, nay, rather, it must be spiritual and heavenly. These two 
souls should be considered as one soul. How difficult it would be to 
divide a single soul! Nay, great would be the difficulty!</p>
<p>	In short, the foundation of the Kingdom of God is based upon harmony
 and love, oneness, relationship and union, not upon differences, 
especially between husband and wife....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	841. You have asked whether a husband would be able to prevent his 
wife from embracing the divine light or a wife dissuade her husband from
 gaining entry into the Kingdom of God. In truth neither of them could 
prevent the other from entering into the Kingdom, unless the husband 
hath an excessive attachment to the wife or the wife to the husband. 
Indeed when either of the two worshippeth the other to the exclusion of<br>
 God, then each could prevent the other from seeking admittance into His Kingdom.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	842. I beseech God to graciously make of thy home a centre for the 
diffusion of the light of divine guidance, for the dissemination of the 
Words of God and for enkindling at all times the fire of love in the 
hearts of His faithful servants and maidservants. Know thou of a 
certainty that every house wherein the anthem of praise is raised to the
 Realm of Glory in celebration of the Name of God is indeed a heavenly 
home, and one of the gardens of delight in the Paradise of God.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	843. If thou wouldst show kindness and consideration to thy parents 
so that they may feel generally pleased, this would also please Me, for 
parents must be highly respected and it is essential that they should 
feel contented, provided they deter thee not from gaining access to the 
Threshold of the Almighty, nor keep thee back from walking in the way of
 the Kingdom. Indeed it behoveth them to encourage and spur thee on in 
this direction.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	844. O Lord! In this Most Great Dispensation Thou dost accept the 
intercession of children in behalf of their parents. This is one of the 
special infinite bestowals of this Dispensation. Therefore, O Thou kind 
Lord, accept the request of this Thy servant at the threshold of Thy 
singleness and submerge his father in the ocean of Thy grace, because 
this son hath arisen to render Thee service and is exerting effort at 
all times in the pathway of Thy love. Verily, Thou art the Giver, the 
Forgiver and the Kind!</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	845. Treat all thy friends and relatives, even strangers, with a spirit of utmost love and kindliness.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	846. Exert yourselves, that haply ye may be enabled to acquire 
such virtues as shall honour and distinguish you amongst all women. Of a
 surety, there is no greater pride and glory for a woman than to be a 
handmaid in God's Court of Grandeur; and the qualities that shall merit 
her this station are an alert and wakeful heart; a firm conviction of 
the unity of God, the Peerless; a heartfelt love for all His 
maidservants; spotless purity and chastity; obedience to and 
consideration for her husband; attention to the education and nurturing 
of her children; composure, calmness, dignity and self-possession; 
diligence in praising God, and worshipping Him both night and day; 
constancy and firmness in His holy Covenant; and the utmost ardour, 
enthusiasm, and attachment to His Cause....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	847. Regarding thy question about consultation of a father with his 
son, or a son with his father, in matters of trade and commerce, 
consultation is one of the fundamental elements of the foundation of the
 Law of God. Such consultation is assuredly acceptable, whether between 
father and son, or with others. There is nothing better than this. Man 
must consult in all things for this will lead him to the depths of each 
problem and enable him to find the right solution.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	848. Your affectionate brother hath written and mentioned your 
names, and hath highly praised and commended you. Observe how drawn he 
is to you, and how he loveth you. Thus should a brother be, so 
affectionate and soul- uplifting, unlike 'Abdu'l-Baha's brother, who is 
more bitter than venom.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	849. The father must always endeavour to educate his son and to 
acquaint him with the heavenly teachings. He must give him advice and 
exhort him at all times, teach him praiseworthy conduct and character, 
enable him to receive training at school and to be instructed in such 
arts and sciences as are deemed useful and necessary. In brief, let him 
instil into his mind the virtues and perfections of the world of 
humanity. Above all he should continually call to his mind the 
remembrance of God so that his throbbing veins and arteries may pulsate 
with the love of God.<br>

</p><p>	The son, on the other hand, must show forth the utmost obedience
 towards his father, and should conduct himself as a humble and a lowly 
servant. Day and night he should seek diligently to ensure the comfort 
and welfare of his loving father and to secure his good pleasure. He 
must forgo his own rest and enjoyment and constantly strive to bring 
gladness to the hearts of his father and mother, that thereby he may 
attain the good pleasure of the Almighty and be graciously aided by the 
hosts of the unseen.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	850. Hold thy husband dear and always show forth an amiable temper 
towards him, no matter how ill-tempered he may be. Even if thy 
loving-kindness maketh him more bitter, manifest thou more kindliness, 
more tenderness, be more loving and tolerate his cruel actions and ill- 
treatment.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE UTTERANCES OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA:</p>
<p>	851. The variety of inherited qualities comes from strength and 
weakness of constitution -- that is to say, when the two parents are 
weak, the children will be weak; if they are strong, the children will 
be robust. In the same way, purity of blood has a great effect; for the 
pure germ is like the superior stock which exists in plants and animals.
 For example, you see that children born from a weak and feeble father 
and mother will naturally have a feeble constitution and weak nerves; 
they will be afflicted and will have neither patience, nor endurance, 
nor resolution, nor perseverance, and will be hasty; for the children 
inherit the weakness and debility of their parents.</p>
<p>	Besides this, an especial blessing is conferred on some families and
 some generations. Thus it is an especial blessing that from among the 
descendants of Abraham should have come all the Prophets of the children
 of Israel. This is a blessing that God has granted to this descent: to 
Moses from His father and mother, to Christ from His mother's line; also
 to Muhammad and the Bab, and to all the Prophets and the Holy<br>
 Manifestations of Israel. The Blessed Beauty[1] is also a lineal 
descendant of Abraham, for Abraham had other sons besides Ishmael and 
Isaac who in those days migrated to the lands of Persia and Afghanistan,
 and the Blessed Beauty is one of their descendants.<br>
 [1 Baha'u'llah.]</p>
<p>	Hence it is evident that inherited character also exists, and to 
such a degree that if the characters are not in conformity with their 
origin, although they belong physically to that lineage, spiritually 
they are not considered members of the family, like Canaan,[1] who is 
not reckoned as being of the race of Noah.<br>
 [1 Cf. Gen. 9:25.]</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), p. 213)</p>
<p>	852. Also a father and mother endure the greatest troubles and 
hardships for their children; and often when the children have reached 
the age of maturity, the parents pass on to the other world. Rarely does
 it happen that a father and mother in this world see the reward of the 
care and trouble they have undergone for their children. Therefore, 
children, in return for this care and trouble, must show forth charity 
and beneficence, and must implore pardon and forgiveness for their 
parents. So you ought, in return for the love and kindness shown you by 
your father, to give to the poor for his sake, with greatest submission 
and humility implore pardon and remission of sins, and ask for the 
supreme mercy.</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", pp. 231-32)</p>
<p>	853. If love and agreement are manifest in a single family, that 
family will advance, become illumined and spiritual; but if enmity and 
hatred exist within it, destruction and dispersion are inevitable....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912", 
2nd. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1982), pp. 144-45)</p>
<p>	854. According to the teachings of Baha'u'llah the family, being a 
human unit, must be educated according to the rules of sanctity. All the
 virtues must be taught the family. The integrity of the family bond 
must be<br>
 constantly considered, and the rights of the individual members must 
not be transgressed. The rights of the son, the father, the mother -- 
none of them must be transgressed, none of them must be arbitrary. Just 
as the son has certain obligations to his father, the father, likewise, 
has certain obligations to his son. The mother, the sister and other 
members of the household have their certain prerogatives. All these 
rights and prerogatives must be conserved, yet the unity of the family 
must be sustained. The injury of one shall be considered the injury of 
all; the comfort of each, the comfort of all; the honor of one, the 
honor of all.</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912",

<p>	855. The child must not be oppressed or censured because it is undeveloped; it must be patiently trained....</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by 
'Abdu'l-Baha during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912" 
pp. 180-81)</p>
<p>	856. When you love a member of your family or a compatriot, let it 
be with a ray of the Infinite Love! Let it be in God, and for God! 
Wherever you find the attributes of God love that person, whether he be 
of your family or of another....</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912" 10th ed. (London: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1979), p. 38)</p>
<p>	857. This is in truth a Baha'i house. Every time such a house or 
meeting place is founded it becomes one of the greatest aids to the 
general development of the town and country to which it belongs. It 
encourages the growth of learning and science and is known for its 
intense spirituality and for the love it spreads among the peoples.</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912" pp. 72-73)</p>
<p>	858. Consider the harmful effects of discord and dissension in a 
family; then reflect upon the favours and blessings which descend upon 
that family when unity exists among its various members. What 
incalculable benefits and blessings would descend upon the great human 
family if unity and brotherhood were established! In this century when 
the<br>
 beneficent results of unity and the ill effects of discord are so 
clearly apparent, the means for the attainment and accomplishment of 
human fellowship have appeared in the world. His Holiness Baha'u'llah 
has proclaimed and provided the way by which hostility and dissension 
may be removed from the human world. He has left no ground or 
possibility for strife and disagreement. First He has proclaimed the 
oneness of mankind and specialized religious teachings for existing 
human conditions.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet, published in "Star of the West" vol. 17, no. 7, (October 1926), p. 232)</p>
<p>	859. My home is the home of peace. My home is the home of joy and 
delight. My home is the home of laughter and exultation. Whosoever 
enters through the portals of this home, must go out with gladsome 
heart. This is the home of light; whosoever enters here must become 
illumined....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet, published in "Star of the West", vol. 9, no. 3, (28 April 1918), p. 40)</p>
<p>	860. It is highly important for man to raise a family. So long as he
 is young, because of youthful self-complacency, he does not realize its
 significance, but this will be a source of regret when he grows old....
 In this glorious Cause the life of a married couple should resemble the
 life of the angels in heaven -- a life full of joy and spiritual 
delight, a life of unity and concord, a friendship both mental and 
physical. The home should be orderly and well-organized. Their ideas and
 thoughts should be like the rays of the sun of truth and the radiance 
of the brilliant stars in the heavens. Even as two birds they should 
warble melodies upon the branches of the tree of fellowship and harmony.
 They should always be elated with joy and gladness and be a source of 
happiness to the hearts of others. They should set an example to their 
fellow-men, manifest a true and sincere love towards each other and 
educate their children in such a manner as to blazon the fame and glory 
of their family.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN BY SHOGHI EFFENDI TO INDIVIDUAL BELIEVES:</p>
<p>	861. I urge you to concentrate for a time upon whatever means you 
think will eventually secure the good-will, tolerance and sympathy of 
your husband. Show him the utmost kindness and consideration, and try, 
at the opportune moment to make him realize the purpose and spirit of 
the Faith. I will pray for the success of your efforts in this 
connection and wish you happiness from all my heart.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 20
 March 1928 written on his behalf to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	862. I cannot refrain, out of my great love and sympathy for you, 
from adding a few words myself in order to impress upon you the 
necessity of showing continually the utmost regard, consideration and 
love to your dear and respected husband. I have great hopes that upon 
your attitude, and consideration for him will chiefly depend his 
ultimate acceptance of the Cause which you love so dearly and serve so 
well. My profound sympathy is with you in your domestic cares which I 
know weigh heavily on your heart. I will continue to supplicate for you 
from the very depths of my heart. I pray that you may achieve in your 
manifold activities your heart's fondest desire.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi appended to a letter dated 20 
December 1928 written on his behalf to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF SHOGHI EFFENDI:</p>
<p>	The following are from letters to individual believers unless otherwise stated</p>
<p>	863. When such difference of opinion and belief occurs between 
husband and wife it is very unfortunate for undoubtedly it detracts from
 that spiritual bond which is the stronghold of the family bond, 
especially in times of difficulty. The way, however, that it could be 
remedied is not by acting in such wise as to alienate the other party. 
One of the objects of the Cause is actually to bring about a closer bond
 in the homes. In all such cases, therefore, the Master used to advise 
obedience to the wishes of the other party and prayer. Pray that your 
husband may gradually see the light and at the same time so act as to 
draw him nearer rather than<br>
 prejudice him. Once that harmony is secured then you will be able to serve unhampered.</p>
<p>	(15 July 1928)</p>
<p>	864. Under such circumstances the Master used to ask the friends to 
be lavish in their love and become exceptionally obedient to their 
husbands. Such individuals have to see through acts that the Cause has 
not come to break up family ties but to strengthen them; it has not come
 to eliminate love but to strengthen it; it has not been created to 
weaken social institutions but to strengthen them.</p>
<p>	(14 October 1928)</p>
<p>	865. Surely Shoghi Effendi would like to see you and the other 
friends give their whole time and energy to the Cause, for we are in 
great need for competent workers, but the home is an institution that 
Baha'u'llah has come to strengthen and not to weaken. Many unfortunate 
things have happened in Baha'i homes just for neglecting this point. 
Serve the Cause but also remember your duties towards your home. It is 
for you to find the balance and see that neither makes you neglect the 
other. We would have many more husbands in the Cause were the wives more
 thoughtful and moderate in their Baha'i activities.</p>
<p>	(14 May 1929)</p>
<p>	866. A truly Baha'i home is a true fortress upon which the Cause can
 rely while planning its campaigns. If ... and ... love each other and 
would like to marry, Shoghi Effendi does not wish them to think that by 
doing so they are depriving themselves of the privilege of service; in 
fact such a union will enhance their ability to serve. There is nothing 
more beautiful than to have young Baha'is marry and found truly Baha'i 
homes, the type Baha'u'llah wishes them to be. Please give them both the
 Guardian's loving greetings.</p>
<p>	(6 November 1932)</p>
<p>	867. A God that is only loving or only just is not a perfect God. 
The Divinity has to possess both of these aspects as every father ought 
to express both in his attitude towards his children. If we ponder a 
while, we will see that<br>
 our welfare can be ensured only when both of these divine attributes are equally emphasized and practised.</p>
<p>	(29 April 1933)</p>
<p>	868. There is no limit to our offerings to the Temple. The more we 
give, the better it is for the Cause and for ourselves. But your case is
 a special one, since your husband is not a believer. If you can succeed
 in convincing him of the importance of your donations to the Cause, so 
much the better. But you should never oppose him on this matter and 
allow anything [to] disturb the peace and unity of your family life....</p>
<p>	(21 September 1933)</p>
<p>	869. The Guardian wishes me specially to urge you to remain patient 
and confident, and above all to show your husband the utmost kindness 
and love, in return for all the opposition and hatred you receive from 
him. A conciliatory and friendly attitude in such cases is not only the 
duty of every Baha'i but is also the most effective way of winning for 
the Cause the sympathy and admiration of its former foes and enemies. 
Love is, indeed, a most potent elixir that can transform the vilest and 
meanest of people into heavenly souls. May your example serve to further
 confirm the truth of this beautiful teaching of our Faith.</p>
<p>	(6 December 1935)</p>
<p>	870. The Guardian ... has learned with deep concern of your family 
difficulties and troubles. He wishes me to assure you of his fervent 
prayers on your behalf and on behalf of your dear ones at home, that you
 may be guided and assisted from on High to compose your differences and
 to restore complete harmony and fellowship in your midst. While he 
would urge you to make any sacrifice in order to bring about unity in 
your family, he wishes you not to feel discouraged if your endeavours do
 not yield any immediate fruit. You should do your part with absolute 
faith that in doing so you are fulfilling your duty as a Baha'i. The 
rest is assuredly in God's hand.</p>
<p>	As regards your husband's attitude towards the Cause: unfriendly 
though that may be you should always hope that, through conciliatory and
 friendly means, and with wise, tactful and patient effort you can 
gradually succeed in winning his sympathy for the Faith. Under no<br>
 circumstances should you try to dictate and impose upon him by force 
your personal religious convictions. Neither should you allow his 
opposition to the Cause [to] seriously hinder your activities... You 
should act patiently, tactfully and with confidence that your efforts 
are being guided and reinforced by Baha'u'llah.</p>
<p>	(23 July 1937)</p>
<p>	871. It made him very happy to know of the recent confirmation of 
your ... friend, and of her earnest desire to serve and promote the 
Faith. He will certainly pray on her behalf that she may, 
notwithstanding the opposition of her parents and relatives, 
increasingly gain in knowledge and in understanding of the Teachings, 
and become animated with such zeal as to arise, and bring into the Cause
 a large number of her former co-religionists.</p>
<p>	Under no circumstances, however, should she allow her parents to 
become completely alienated from her, but it is her bounden duty to 
strive, through patient, continued and loving effort, to win their 
sympathy for the Faith, and even, perhaps, to bring about their 
confirmation...</p>
<p>	(6 July 1938)</p>
<p>	872. As regards your plans: the Guardian fully approves indeed of 
your view that no matter how urgent and vital the requirements of the 
teaching work may be you should under no circumstances neglect the 
education of your children, as towards them you have an obligation no 
less sacred than towards the Cause.</p>
<p>	Any plan or arrangement you may arrive at which would combine your 
twofold duties towards your family and the Cause, and would permit you 
to resume active work in the field of pioneer teaching, and also to take
 good care of your children so as to not jeopardize their future in the 
Cause would meet with the whole-hearted approval of the Guardian.</p>
<p>	(17 July 1938)</p>
<p>	873. The institution of marriage, as established by Baha'u'llah, 
while giving due importance to the physical aspect of marital union, 
considers it as subordinate to the moral and spiritual purposes and 
functions with which it has been invested by an all-wise and loving 
Providence. Only when these different values are given each their due 
importance, and only<br>
 on the basis of the subordination of the physical to the moral, and the
 carnal to the spiritual can such excesses and laxity in marital 
relations as our decadent age is so sadly witnessing be avoided, and 
family life be restored to its original purity, and fulfil the true 
function for which it has been instituted by God.</p>
<p>	(8 May 1939)</p>
<p>	874. While the Guardian highly appreciates your desire to take a 
more active part in the teaching field, he realizes also that in 
deference to the wishes of your husband, towards whom you have duties no
 less sacred and binding than those facing you as a believer, you should
 endeavour to so arrange your plans as not to be too far away from him, 
particularly as he himself is anxious that you should not break up, 
however temporarily, your home life.</p>
<p>	(5 June 1939)</p>
<p>	875. The Guardian is, nevertheless, thankful that he does not object
 in principle to your attending Baha'i meetings, and gives you full 
freedom to participate in all local Baha'i activities. Even though he 
may insist on your obtaining his consent in such matters, you should not
 feel hurt or discouraged, but rather should continue, in a friendly and
 conciliatory way, to endeavour [to] win his sympathy towards the Cause.
 You can have no serious reason for any real grievance against him, 
unless he unduly interferes in your Baha'i work, and prevents you from 
discharging your vital spiritual and administrative obligations towards 
the Faith. The Guardian will pray in the mean time that your hopes of 
seeing him well confirmed and active in the Cause may be fulfilled, and 
that also you may be guided to adopt towards him such [a] true Baha'i 
attitude as will serve to further awaken his sympathies for the Faith, 
and quicken the spiritual energies latent in his heart to the point of 
bringing about his full confirmation in the Cause. Rest assured, and 
confidently persist in your efforts.</p>
<p>	(5 August 1939)</p>
<p>	876. The task of bringing up a Baha'i child, as emphasized time and 
again in Baha'i writings, is the chief responsibility of the mother, 
whose unique privilege is indeed to create in her home such conditions 
as would be<br>
 most conducive to both his material and spiritual welfare and 
advancement. The training which a child first receives through his 
mother constitutes the strongest foundation for his future development, 
and it should therefore be the paramount concern of your wife ... to 
endeavour from now imparting to her new-born son such spiritual training
 as would enable him later on to fully assume and adequately discharge 
all the responsibilities and duties of Baha'i life.</p>
<p>	(16 November 1939)</p>
<p>	877. He has noted with feelings of genuine admiration your longing 
to serve in the field of pioneer teaching, but is sorry to hear that 
your domestic circumstances do not permit you to carry out this dear 
wish of your heart. While he heartily appreciates your eagerness to 
labour for the Faith in distant and hitherto unopened territories, he 
feels that, in view of your husband's opposition, and also in 
consideration of the need of your children for your close help and 
guidance, you should, for the present, endeavour instead to work in 
virgin localities in the vicinity of ... or of the adjoining towns.</p>
<p>	(7 November 1940)</p>
<p>	878. The question of the training and education of children in case 
one of the parents is a non-Baha'i is one which solely concerns the 
parents themselves, who should decide about it the way they find best 
and most conducive to the maintenance of the unity of their family, and 
to the future welfare of their children. Once the child comes of age, 
however, he should be given full freedom to choose his religion, 
irrespective of the wishes and desires of his parents.</p>
<p>	(14 December 1940 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	879. ...now that you both feel the sincere desire to unite in your 
efforts to make your married life happy, Shoghi Effendi advises you to 
do everything in your power, through love and kindness, to win your 
husband to your side and to remove his prejudice against the Cause.</p>
<p>	(27 November 1941)<br>

</p><p>	880. She should certainly not grieve if she finds that her 
family are not receptive to the teachings -- for not every soul is 
spiritually enlightened. Indeed, many members of the families of the 
Prophets themselves have remained unconverted even in face of the 
example and persuasion of the Manifestation of God; therefore, the 
friends should not be distressed by such things but rather leave the 
future of those they love in the hand of God, and by their services and 
devotion to the Faith, win the right to plead for their ultimate 
spiritual rebirth....</p>
<p>	(9 March 1942)</p>
<p>	881. Deep as are family ties, we must always remember that the 
spiritual ties are far deeper; they are everlasting and survive death, 
whereas physical ties, unless supported by spiritual bonds, are confined
 to this life. You should do all in your power, through prayer and 
example, to open the eyes of your family to the Baha'i Faith, but do not
 grieve too much over their actions. Turn to your Baha'i brothers and 
sisters who are living with you in the light of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>	(8 May 1942)</p>
<p>	882. Our Faith is just as much for children as for older people, and
 it rejoices his heart when he sees both working together to bring this 
great Message of good to all mankind.</p>
<p>	(30 November 1942 to two believers)</p>
<p>	883. Regarding the Guardian's statement that pioneering is 
conditioned upon the consent of parents and that it would be necessary 
for them to concur, you have asked whether this ruling applies equally 
to children who are of age and those who are not. The Guardian's reply 
is that the ruling applies only to those who have not yet come of age.</p>
<p>	(From a letter dated 18 January 1943 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia)</p>
<p>	884. Baha'u'llah has urged marriage upon all people as the natural 
and rightful way of life. He has also, however, placed strong emphasis 
on its spiritual nature, which, while in no way precluding a normal 
physical life, is the most essential aspect of marriage. That two people
 should live their lives in love and harmony is of far greater 
importance than that they<br>
 should be consumed with passion for each other. The one is a great rock
 of strength on which to lean in time of need; the other a purely 
temporary thing which may at any time die out.</p>
<p>	(20 January 1943)</p>
<p>	885. The Guardian, in his remarks ... about parents' and children's,
 wives' and husbands' relations in America, meant that there is a 
tendency in that country for children to be too independent of the 
wishes of their parents and lacking in the respect due to them. Also 
wives, in some cases, have a tendency to exert an unjust degree of 
domination over their husbands, which, of course, is not right, any more
 than that the husband should unjustly dominate his wife.</p>
<p>	(22 July 1943)</p>
<p>	886. He feels you should by all means show your husband the greatest
 love and sympathy; if we are ever in any doubt as to how we should 
conduct ourselves as Baha'is we should think of 'Abdu'l-Baha and study 
His life and ask ourselves what would He have done, for He is our 
perfect example in every way. And you know how tender He was, and how 
His affection and kindness shone like sunlight on everyone.</p>
<p>	Your husband and your child have a right to your love, and give you a
 wonderful opportunity of demonstrating your faith in the Cause.</p>
<p>	Also you should pray to Baha'u'llah to help unite you with your husband and make your home a true and happy home.</p>
<p>	(9 March 1946)</p>
<p>	887. He was very sorry to see you are having trouble in your home 
because of the Baha'i Faith. He feels that you should do all in your 
power to promote love and harmony between your husband and yourself, for
 your own sakes and for the sake of your children. You should, however, 
point out to him that every man is free to seek God for himself, and 
that, although you will never seek to influence him or even discuss the 
Baha'i Faith with him, if he does not want to, he should leave you free 
to attend the meetings. The Guardian hopes that through patience, tact 
and prayer, you will gradually overcome his prejudice.</p>
<p>	(16 March 1946)<br>

</p><p>	888. A Baha'i is never forced to stay in a particular place; if 
you could not earn a living in ... and wished to be near your aged 
parents, you were quite right to leave....</p>
<p>	(1 April 1946)</p>
<p>	889. Shoghi Effendi wishes me to add this note in connection with 
your marriage: he does not feel that any believer, under any 
circumstances whatsoever, can ever use the Cause or service to it as a 
reason for abandoning their marriage; divorce, as we know, is very 
strongly condemned by Baha'u'llah, and only grounds of extreme gravity 
justify it....</p>
<p>	(7 April 1947)</p>
<p>	890. He feels, in regard to your family problems, that you should 
take these matters up with your Assembly, if you desire advice; one of 
the duties of these Assemblies is to advise and aid the friends, and it 
is your privilege to turn to your Assembly....</p>
<p>	(10 April 1947 to two believers)</p>
<p>	891. He was very happy to hear of your desire to assist the pioneer 
work... He does not feel that your activities in this field, however, 
should be a source of inharmony between you and your dear husband, and 
he assures you he will pray for him in the Holy Shrines, that God may 
awaken him to a realization of the meaning of our Faith and quicken him 
in its service.</p>
<p>	(30 April 1947)</p>
<p>	892. Baha'u'llah has clearly stated the consent of all living 
parents is required for a Baha'i marriage. This applies whether the 
parents are Baha'is or non-Baha'is, divorced for years or not. This 
great law He has laid down to strengthen the social fabric, to knit 
closer the ties of the home, to place a certain gratitude and respect in
 the hearts of children for those who have given them life and sent 
their souls out on the eternal journey towards their Creator. We Baha'is
 must realize that in present-day society the exact opposite process is 
taking place: young people care less and less for their parents' wishes,
 divorce is considered a natural right, and obtained on the flimsiest 
and most unwarrantable and shabby<br>
 pretexts. People separated from each other, especially if one of them 
has had full custody of the children, are only too willing to belittle 
the importance of the partner in marriage also responsible as a parent 
for bringing those children into this world. The Baha'is must, through 
rigid adherence to the Baha'i laws and teachings, combat these corrosive
 forces which are so rapidly destroying home life and the beauty of 
family relationships, and tearing down the moral structure of society.</p>
<p>	(25 October 1947 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	893. In regard to the questions you asked him: he feels sure that, 
although in some ways you may be a financial burden to your children, it
 is to them a privilege to look after you; you are their Mother and have
 given them life, and through the bounty of Baha'u'llah they are now 
attracted to His Faith. Anything they do for you is small recompense for
 all you have done for them.</p>
<p>	(20 September 1948)</p>
<p>	894. Your responsibility towards your son and your husband is very 
great, and the Guardian hopes your work will soon reach a point where 
you can return, at least for sometime, to them, and give them that love 
and encouragement which is a woman's great contribution to home life.</p>
<p>	(5 August 1949)</p>
<p>	895. He was particularly pleased to hear your family relationships 
are so satisfactory, and feels you are doing the right thing by 
deferring to your husband's wishes and remaining abroad longer.</p>
<p>	The Guardian has long felt that the American Baha'is are not, in 
some cases, living up to the ideal of marriage set forth by Baha'u'llah.
 They are prone to being influenced by the current light and selfish 
attitude of the people towards the marriage bond. Consequently when he 
sees you are successfully living up to the Baha'i standard, putting your
 best into it and preserving this sacred tie you have with your husband,
 he is very happy indeed. He hopes you will be in a position to be an 
example to others. For he disapproves of the way some Baha'is, in the 
name of serving the Cause, disencumber themselves of their husbands, or 
go and get new ones!<br>

</p><p>	(2 April 1950)</p>
<p>	896. It is one of the essential teachings of the Faith that unity 
should be maintained in the home. Of course this does not mean that any 
member of the family has a right to influence the faith of any other 
member; and if this is realized by all the members, then it seems 
certain that unity would be feasible.</p>
<p>	(6 July 1952)</p>
<p>	897. The Guardian will pray that your mother may become a Baha'i, 
and very actively serve the Cause of God. It should be borne in mind 
that by your leading a consecrated Baha'i life, your mother will be 
affected perhaps as much or more than by reading and studying. When one 
sees the effect of the Baha'i Teachings on another person 's life, that 
very often has a very great effect.</p>
<p>	(12 July 1952)</p>
<p>	898. He feels that you should by all means make every effort to hold
 your marriage together, especially for the sake of your children, who, 
like all children of divorced parents, cannot but suffer from 
conflicting loyalties, for they are deprived of the blessing of a father
 and mother in one home, to look after their interests and love them 
jointly.</p>
<p>	Now that you realize that your husband is ill, you should be able to
 reconcile yourself to the difficulties you have faced with him 
emotionally, and not take an unforgiving attitude, however much you may 
suffer.</p>
<p>	We know that Baha'u'llah has very strongly frowned upon divorce; and
 it is really incumbent upon the Baha'is to make almost a superhuman 
effort not to allow a Baha'i marriage to be dissolved.</p>
<p>	(6 March 1953)</p>
<p>	899. The Guardian fully appreciates your desire to go forth as a 
pioneer at this time, and to help establish the Faith in the virgin 
areas, but you should not go against the wishes of your husband, and 
force him to give up everything in order that you might serve the Faith 
in this manner. We must bear in mind the wishes and the rights of those 
who are closely connected in our lives.<br>

</p><p>	If your husband wishes you to remain where you are, certainly there is a vast field for teaching there....</p>
<p>	(31 July 1953)</p>
<p>	900. Your sons, even though they will not be able at first to serve 
with you in pioneering, are certainly helping you to do so because of 
their devoted spirit and their complete co-operation. Life at best is so
 full of unexpected vicissitudes that leaving your boys at home does 
not, he feels, present any added risks. They are devoted to the Cause 
and will no doubt be inspired by your example.</p>
<p>	(10 August 1953 to two believers)</p>
<p>	901. With regard to your question as to your going out as a pioneer 
... the Guardian feels, in view of the aversion of Baha'u'llah to 
divorce, that it is not right for a Baha'i, even for the purpose of 
pioneering, to break up a marriage. He, therefore, urges you to 
endeavour with all your powers to become reconciled with your husband, 
as he considers this is more important than that you should go forth to a
 virgin territory to pioneer.</p>
<p>	(27 August 1953)</p>
<p>	902. ...he wishes me to say that he favours your pioneering. 
However, if you consider that your going to one of the Pacific Islands 
as a pioneer, will destroy your relationship with your father, then he 
would suggest that perhaps your wife could go now, and then you can see 
how things work out for your joining her later.</p>
<p>	(27 September 1953)</p>
<p>	903. The Guardian, in view of the fact that your husband does not 
really wish to be separated from you, but on the contrary is desirous of
 keeping your marriage together, feels that you, as a Baha'i, have no 
right to destroy it because of your desire to serve the Faith.</p>
<p>	Marriage is a very sacred institution. Baha'u'llah said its purpose 
is to promote unity. If the friends neglect, for the sake of the Cause, 
this institution, they place the Faith in a poor light before the 
public. In these days the people of the world are so immoral, and treat 
the marriage institution so lightly; and we, as Baha'is, in contrast to 
the people of the<br>
 world, are trying to create a high moral standard, an reinstate the sanctity of marriage.</p>
<p>     If your husband will allow you to do a certain amount<br>
of teaching work, and occasionally to travel in the<br>
interests of the Faith, all the better; but he does not<br>
think the Faith should be made the thing which destroys<br>
your family life.<br>
(6 June 1954)</p>
<p>	904. He feels, in view of your husband's circumstances and feelings,
 and also considering that your two older children will naturally want 
to see you, and indeed should see you at times so that you can help them
 in their Baha'i lives, that the wise thing for you to do is to pioneer 
with your husband somewhere in the States, where your services will be 
of the greatest value.</p>
<p>	(29 July 1954)</p>
<p>	905. He appreciates very much the pioneer services you have 
rendered. He hopes that from now on you and your dear husband will be 
able to serve the Faith unitedly and devotedly together, as that is the 
highest form of Baha'i cooperation in marriage.</p>
<p>	(3 March 1955)</p>
<p>	906. If the condition of the health of your parents is such that 
your presence is really needed, then you should not leave them. If, 
however, there is some other relative who could care for them, then you 
could help with the work in ... and aid the friends in establishing the 
Faith on a solid foundation there.</p>
<p>	(28 October 1955)</p>
<p>	907. He will pray that the opposition of your husband and sister may
 be changed, through your own acts of love, kindness, and the patience 
and tolerance you show to them.</p>
<p>	(20 March 1956)</p>
<p>	908. Wherever there is a Baha'i family, those concerned should by 
all means do all they can to preserve it, because divorce is strongly 
condemned in the Teachings, whereas harmony, unity and love are held<br>
 up as the highest ideals in human relationships. This must always apply
 to the Baha'is, whether they are serving in the pioneering field or 
not.</p>
<p>	(9 November 1956 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Central America)</p>
<p>	909. He feels that, now that you have found the thing you were 
searching for inwardly, and have this added joy in your life of our 
glorious Faith, you should be kinder to your husband and more 
considerate than ever, and do everything in your power to make him feel 
that this has not taken you away from him, but only made your love for 
him, and your desire to be a good wife to him, greater. Whether he will 
ultimately be able to become a Baha'i or not, is something that only 
time can tell; but there is no doubt where your duty lies, and that is 
to make him appreciate the fact that your new affiliation has not 
interfered in any way with his home life or his marriage, but, on the 
contrary, has strengthened both.</p>
<p>	It is difficult when one has found what one knows is the truth, to 
sit by and see a dear and close relative completely blind to it. The 
temptation is to try and "stir them up and make them see the light", but
 this is often disastrous. Silence, love and forbearance will win 
greater victories in such cases. However, your husband has no right to 
ask you to give up being a Baha'i. That is going too far. Nobody should 
trespass on the sacred bond every human being has a right to have with 
their Creator.</p>
<p>	(20 April 1957)</p>
<p>	910. However, as you no doubt know, Baha'u'llah has stated that the 
purpose of marriage is to promote unity, so you should bear this in mind
 when dealing with your non-Baha'i relatives; they cannot be expected to
 feel the way we do on questions of racial amity, and we must not force 
our views on them, but rather lovingly and wisely seek to educate them.</p>
<p>	(30 August 1957)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM MESSAGES OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE:</p>
<p>	(The following are addressed to individual believers unless otherwise stated)</p>
<p>	911. Regarding your other question concerning the strained 
relationship between you and your mother-in-law and what you can do to 
alleviate the situation, we feel you should, with the help and 
consultation of your<br>
 husband, persevere in your efforts to achieve unity in the family. From
 your description of the unfriendly attitude your mother-in-law displays
 toward you it is clear that you will not have an easy task. However, 
the important thing is that you, as a Baha'i, are aware of 'Abdu'l- 
Baha's admonition to concentrate on an individual's good qualities and 
that this approach to your mother-in-law can strengthen you in your 
resolve to achieve unity. And furthermore, perseverance in prayer will 
give you the strength to continue your efforts.</p>
<p>	(6 September 1970)</p>
<p>	912. A Baha'i who has a problem may wish to make his own decision 
upon it after prayer and after weighing all the aspects of it in his own
 mind; he may prefer to seek the counsel of individual friends or of 
professional counsellors such as his doctor or lawyer so that he can 
consider such advice when making his decision; or in a case where 
several people are involved, such as a family situation, he may want to 
gather together those who are affected so that they may arrive at a 
collective decision....</p>
<p>	(19 March 1973 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Canada)</p>
<p>	913. That the first teacher of the child is the mother should not be
 startling, for the primary orientation of the infant is to its mother. 
This provision of nature in no way minimizes the role of the father in 
the Baha'i family. Again, equality of status does not mean identity of 
function.</p>
<p>	(23 June 1974)</p>
<p>	914. In considering the problems that you and your wife are 
experiencing, the House of Justice points out that the unity of your 
family should take priority over any other consideration. Baha'u'llah 
came to bring unity to the world, and a fundamental unity is that of the
 family. Therefore, we must believe that the Faith is intended to 
strengthen the family, not weaken it. For example, service to the Cause 
should not produce neglect of the family. It is important for you to 
arrange your time so that your family life is harmonious and your 
household receives the attention it requires.</p>
<p>	Baha'u'llah also stressed the importance of consultation. We should 
not think this worthwhile method of seeking solutions is confined to the
 administrative institutions of the Cause. Family consultation employing<br>
 full and frank discussion, and animated by awareness of the need for 
moderation and balance, can be the panacea for domestic conflict....</p>
<p>	(1 August 1978)</p>
<p>	915. Although Baha'i services should be undertaken with a spirit of 
sacrifice, one cannot lose sight of the importance given in our Holy 
Writings to the responsibilities placed on parents in relationship to 
their children, as well as to the duties of children towards their 
parents.</p>
<p>	(19 November 1 978)</p>
<p>	916. The House of Justice suggests that all statements in the Holy 
Writings concerning specific areas of the relationship between men and 
women should be considered in the light of the general principle of 
equality between the sexes that has been authoritatively and repeatedly 
enunciated in the Sacred Texts. In one of His Tablets 'Abdu'l-Baha 
asserts: "In this divine age the bounties of God have encompassed the 
world of women. Equality of men and women, except in some negligible 
instances, has been fully and categorically announced. Distinctions have
 been utterly removed." That men and women differ from one another in 
certain characteristics and functions is an inescapable fact of nature; 
the important thing is that 'Abdu'l-Baha regards such inequalities as 
remain between the sexes as being "negligible".</p>
<p>	The relationship between husband and wife must be viewed in the 
context of the Baha'i ideal of family life. Baha'u'llah came to bring 
unity to the world, and a fundamental unity is that of the family. 
Therefore, one must believe that the Faith is intended to strengthen the
 family, not weaken it, and one of the keys to the strengthening of 
unity is loving consultation. The atmosphere within a Baha'i family as 
within the community as a whole should express "the keynote of the Cause
 of God" which, the beloved Guardian has stated, "is not dictatorial 
authority, but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but the spirit of
 frank and loving consultation."</p>
<p>	A family, however, is a very special kind of "community". The 
Research Department has not come across any statements which 
specifically name the father as responsible for the "security, progress 
and unity of the family" as is stated in Bahiyyih Nakhjavani's book, but
 it can be inferred from a number of the responsibilities placed upon 
him, that<br>
 the father can be regarded as the "head" of the family. The members of a
 family all have duties and responsibilities towards one another and to 
the family as a whole, and these duties and responsibilities vary from 
member to member because of their natural relationships. The parents 
have the inescapable duty to educate their children -- but not vice 
versa; the children have the duty to obey their parents -- the parents 
do not obey the children; the mother -- not the father -- bears the 
children, nurses them in babyhood, and is thus their first educator; 
hence daughters have a prior right to education over sons and, as the 
Guardian's secretary has written on his behalf, "The task of bringing up
 a Baha' i child, as emphasized time and again in Baha'i Writings, is 
the chief responsibility of the mother, whose unique privilege is indeed
 to create in her home such conditions as would be most conducive to 
both his material and spiritual welfare and advancement. The training 
which a child first receives through his mother constitutes the 
strongest foundation for his future development..."A corollary of this 
responsibility of the mother is her right to be supported by her husband
 -- a husband has no explicit right to be supported by his wife. This 
principle of the husband's responsibility to provide for and protect the
 family can be seen applied also in the law of intestacy which provides 
that the family's dwelling place passes, on the father's death, not to 
his widow, but to his eldest son; the son at the same time has the 
responsibility to care for his mother.</p>
<p>	It is in this context of mutual and complementary duties, and 
responsibilities that one should read the Tablet in which 'Abdu'l-Baha 
gives the following exhortation:</p>
<p>      O Handmaids of the All-Sufficing God!<br>
    Exert yourselves, that haply ye may be enabled to acquire<br>
    such virtues as shall honour and distinguish you amongst<br>
    all women. Of a surety, there is no greater pride and<br>
    glory for a woman than to be a handmaid in God's Court of<br>
    Grandeur; and the qualities that shall merit her this<br>
    station are an alert and wakeful heart; a firm conviction<br>
    of the unity of God, the Peerless; a heartfelt love for<br>
    all His maidservants; spotless purity and chastity;<br>
    obedience to and consideration for her husband; attention<br>
    to the education and nurturing of her children; composure,<br>
    calmness, dignity and self-possession; diligence in<br>

    praising God, and worshipping Him both night and day;<br>
    constancy and firmness in His holy Covenant; and the<br>
    utmost ardour, enthusiasm, and attachment to His<br>
    Cause....[1]<br>
 [1 The quotation in the original letter has been replaced by this revised translation.]</p>
<p>	This exhortation to the utmost degree of spirituality and 
self-abnegation should not be read as a legal definition giving the 
husband absolute authority over his wife, for, in a letter written to an
 individual believer on 22 July 1943, the beloved Guardian's secretary 
wrote on his behalf:</p>
<p>	The Guardian, in his remarks ... about parents' and children's, 
wives' and husbands' relations in America, meant that there is a 
tendency in that country for children to be too independent of the 
wishes of their parents and lacking in the respect due to them. Also 
wives, in some cases, have a tendency to exert an unjust degree of 
domination over their husbands, which, of course, is not right, any more
 than that the husband should unjustly dominate his wife.</p>
<p>	In any group, however loving the consultation, there are 
nevertheless points on which, from time to time, agreement cannot be 
reached. In a Spiritual Assembly this dilemma is resolved by a majority 
vote. There can, however, be no majority where only two parties are 
involved, as in the case of a husband and wife. There are, therefore, 
times when a wife should defer to her husband, and times when a husband 
should defer to his wife, but neither should ever unjustly dominate the 
other. In short, the relationship between husband and wife should be as 
held forth in the prayer revealed by 'Abdu'l-Baha which is often read at
 Baha'i weddings: "Verily, they are married in obedience to Thy command.
 Cause them to become the signs of harmony and unity until the end of 
time."</p>
<p>	These are all relationships within the family, but there is a much 
wider sphere of relationships between men and women than in the home, 
and this too we should consider in the context of Baha'i society, not in
 that of past or present social norms. For example, although the mother 
is the first educator of the child, and the most important formative 
influence in his development, the father also has the responsibility of 
educating his children, and this responsibility is so weighty that 
Baha'u'llah has stated that a father who fails to exercise it forfeits 
his rights of fatherhood.<br>
 Similarly, although the primary responsibility for supporting the 
family financially is placed upon the husband, this does not by any 
means imply that the place of woman is confined to the home. On the 
contrary, 'Abdu'l-Baha has stated:</p>
<p>      In the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah, women are advancing<br>
    side by side with men. There is no area or instance where<br>
    they will lag behind: they have equal rights with men, and<br>
    will enter, in the future, into all branches of the<br>
    administration of society. Such will be their elevation<br>
    that, in every area of endeavour, they will occupy the<br>
    highest levels in the human world....[1]<br>
 [1 The quotation in the original letter which was taken from "Paris 
Talks", p. 182, has been replaced by this revised translation.]</p>
<p>	and again:</p>
<p>      So it will come to pass that when women participate fully<br>
    and  equally in the affairs of the world, when they<br>
    enter confidently  and capably the great arena of laws and<br>
    politics, war will cease;...</p>
<p>	("The Promulgation of Universal Peace" p. 135)</p>
<p>	In the Tablet of the World, Baha'u'llah Himself has envisaged that women as well as men would be breadwinners in stating:</p>
<p>      Everyone, whether man or woman, should hand over to a<br>
    trusted person a portion of what he or she earneth through<br>
    trade, agriculture or other occupation, for the training<br>
    and education  of children, to be spent for this purpose<br>
    with the knowledge of the Trustees of the Hot se of<br>
    Justice.</p>
<p>	("Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i- Aqdas", p. 90)</p>
<p>	A very important element in the attainment of such equality is 
Baha'u'llah's provision that boys and girls must follow essentially the 
same curriculum in schools.</p>

Assemblies)</p>

</p><p>	THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE</p>
<p>	BAHA'I WORLD CENTRE<br>
	27 August 1989</p>
<p>	To the followers of Baha'u'llah</p>
<p>	Dear Baha'i Friends,</p>
<p>	The Nineteen Day Feast, its framework, purpose and possibilities, 
have in recent years become a subject of increasing inquiry among the 
friends. It occupied much of the consultation at the Sixth International
 Baha'i Convention last year, and we feel the time has come for us to 
offer clarifications.</p>
<p>	The World Order of Baha'u'llah encompasses all units of human 
society; integrates the spiritual, administrative and social processes 
of life; and canalizes human expression in its varied forms towards the 
construction of a new civilization. The Nineteen Day Feast embraces all 
these aspects at the very base of society. Functioning in the village, 
the town, the city, it is an institution of which all the people of Baha
 are members. It is intended to promote unity, ensure progress, and 
foster joy.</p>
<p>	"If this feast be held in the proper fashion," 'Abdu'l-Baha states, 
"the friends will, once in nineteen days, find themselves spiritually 
restored, and endued with a power that is not of this world." To ensure 
this glorious outcome the concept of the Feast must be adequately 
understood by all the friends. The Feast is known to have three distinct
 but related parts: the devotional, the administrative, and the social. 
The first entails the recitation of prayers and reading from the Holy 
Texts. The second is a general meeting where the Local Spiritual 
Assembly reports its activities, plans and problems to the community, 
shares news and messages from the World Centre and the National 
Assembly, and receives the thoughts and recommendations of the friends 
through a process of consultation. The third involves the partaking of 
refreshments and engaging in other activities meant to foster fellowship
 in a culturally determined diversity of forms which do not violate 
principles of the Faith or the essential character of the Feast.</p>
<p>	Even though the Feast requires strict adherence to the threefold 
aspects in the sequence in which they have been defined, there is much<br>
 room for variety in the total experience. For example, music may be 
introduced at various stages, including the devotional portion; 
'Abdu'l-Baha recommends that eloquent, uplifting talks be given; 
originality and variety in expressions of hospitality are possible; the 
quality and range of the consultation are critical to the spirit of the 
occasion. The effects of different cultures in all these respects are 
welcome factors which can lend the Feast a salutary diversity, 
representative of the unique characteristics of the various societies in
 which it is held and therefore conducive to the upliftment and 
enjoyment of its participants.</p>
<p>	It is notable that the concept of the Feast evolved in stages in 
relation to the development of the Faith. At its earliest stage in Iran,
 the individual friends, in response to Baha'u'llah's injunctions, 
hosted gatherings in their homes to show hospitality once every nineteen
 days and derived inspiration from the reading and discussion of the 
Teachings. As the community grew. 'Abdu'l-Baha delineated and emphasized
 the devotional and social character of the event. After the 
establishment of Local Spiritual Assemblies, Shoghi Effendi introduced 
the administrative portion and acquainted the community with the idea of
 the Nineteen Day Feast as an institution. It was as if a symphony, in 
three movements, had now been completed.</p>
<p>	But it is not only in the sense of its gradual unfoldment as an 
institution that the evolution of the Feast must be regarded; there is a
 broader context yet. The Feast may well be seen in its unique 
combination of modes as the culmination of a great historic process in 
which primary elements of community life -- acts of worship, of 
festivity and other forms of togetherness -- over vast stretches of time
 have achieved a glorious convergence. The Nineteen Day Feast represents
 the new stage in this enlightened age to which the basic expression of 
community life has evolved. Shoghi Effendi has described it as the 
foundation of the new World Order, and in a letter written on his 
behalf, it is referred to as constituting "a vital medium for 
maintaining close and continued contact between the believers 
themselves, and also between them and the body of their elected 
representatives in the local community".</p>
<p>	Moreover, because of the opportunity which it provides for conveying
 messages from the national and international levels of the 
administration and also for communicating the recommendations of the 
friends to those levels, the Feast becomes a link that connects the 
local community in a<br>
 dynamic relationship with the entire structure of the Administrative 
Order. But considered in its local sphere alone there is much to thrill 
and amaze the heart. Here it links the individual to the collective 
processes by which a society is built or restored. Here, for instance, 
the Feast is an arena of democracy at the very root of society, where 
the Local Spiritual Assembly and the members of the community meet on 
common ground, where individuals are free to offer their gifts of 
thought, whether as new ideas or constructive criticism, to the building
 processes of an advancing civilization. Thus it can be seen that aside 
from its spiritual significance, this common institution of the people 
combines an array of elemental social disciplines which educate its 
participants in the essentials of responsible citizenship.</p>
<p>	If the Feast is to be properly experienced, beyond an understanding 
of the concept must also be the preparation of it and the preparation 
for it. Although the Local Spiritual Assembly is administratively 
responsible for the conduct of the Feast, it often calls upon an 
individual or a group of individuals to make preparations -- a practice 
which is consonant with the spirit of hospitality so vital to the 
occasion. Such individuals can act as hosts and are sometimes concerned 
with the selection of the prayers and readings for the devotional 
portion; they may also attend to the social portion. In small 
communities the aspect of personal hospitality is easy to carry out, but
 in large communities the Local Spiritual Assemblies, while retaining 
the concept of hospitality, may find it necessary to devise other 
measures.</p>
<p>	Important aspects of the preparation of the Feast include the proper
 selection of readings, the assignment, in advance, of good readers, and
 a sense of decorum both in the presentation and the reception of the 
devotional programme. Attention to the environment in which the Feast is
 to be held, whether indoors or outdoors, greatly influences the 
experience. Cleanliness, arrangement of the space in practical and 
decorative ways -- play a significant part. Punctuality is also a 
measure of good preparation.</p>
<p>	To a very large extent, the success of the Feast depends on the 
quality of the preparation and participation of the individual. The 
beloved Master offers the following advice: "Give ye great weight to the
 Nineteen Day gatherings, so that on these occasions the beloved of the 
Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful may turn their faces toward the 
Kingdom,<br>
 chant the communes, beseech God's help, become joyfully enamoured each 
of the other, and grow in purity and holiness, and in the fear of God, 
and in resistance to passion and self. Thus will they separate 
themselves from this elemental world, and immerse themselves in the 
ardours of the spirit."</p>
<p>	In absorbing such advice, it is illuminating indeed to view the 
Nineteen Day Feast in the context in which it was conceived. It is 
ordained in the "Kitab-i-Aqdas" in these words: "It hath been enjoined 
upon you once a month to offer hospitality, even should ye serve no more
 than water, for God hath willed to bind your hearts together, though it
 be through heavenly and earthly means combined". It is clear, then, 
that the Feast is rooted in hospitality, with all its implications of 
friendliness, courtesy, service, generosity and conviviality. The very 
idea of hospitality as the sustaining spirit of so significant an 
institution introduces a revolutionary new attitude to the conduct of 
human affairs at all levels, an attitude which is critical to that world
 unity which the Central Figures of our Faith laboured so long and 
suffered so much cruelty to bring into being. It is in this divine 
festival that the foundation is laid for the realization of so 
unprecedented a reality.</p>
<p>	That you may all attain the high mark set for the Feast as a 
"bringer of joy", the "groundwork of agreement and unity", the "key to 
affection and fellowship" will remain an object of our ardent 
supplications at the Holy Threshold.</p>
<p>	With loving Baha'i greetings,<br>

<p>	THE NINETEEN DAY FEAST</p>
<p>	1. General Statements</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Baha'u'llah</p>
<p>	917. It hath been enjoined upon you once a month to offer 
hospitality, even should ye serve no more than water; for God hath 
willed to bind your hearts together, though it be through heavenly and 
earthly means combined.</p>
<p>	(From the "Kitab-i-Aqdas", provisional translation)</p>
<p>	From the Writings and Utterances of 'Abdu'l-Baha</p>
<p>	918. O thou steadfast in the Covenant!<br>
	Thou hast written . . . concerning the Feast. This festivity, which is 
held on a day of the nineteen-day month, was established by His Holiness
 the Bab, and the Blessed Beauty directed, confirmed and warmly 
encouraged the holding of it. It is, therefore, of the utmost 
importance. You should unquestionably see to it with the greatest care, 
and make its value known, so that it may become solidly established on a
 permanent basis. Let the beloved of God gather together and associate 
most lovingly and spiritually and happily with one another, conducting 
themselves with the greatest courtesy and self-restraint. Let them read 
the holy verses, as well as essays which are of benefit, and the letters
 of 'Abdu'l-Baha; encourage and inspire one another to love each and 
all; chant the prayers with serenity and joy; give eloquent talks, and 
praise the matchless Lord.</p>
<p>	The host, with complete self-effacement, showing kindness to all, 
must be a comfort to each one, and serve the friends with his own hands.</p>
<p>	If the Feast is befittingly held, in the manner described, then this
 supper will verily be the Lord's Supper, for its fruits will be the 
very fruits of that Supper, and its influence the same.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	919. As to the Nineteen Day Feast, ye must give this your most 
careful attention, and firmly establish it. For this Feast bringeth 
bliss and unity and love to the lovers of God.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	920. Ye have written of the Nineteen Day festivities. This Feast
 is a bringer of joy. It is the groundwork of agreement and unity. It is
 the key to affection and fellowship. It diffuseth the oneness of 
mankind.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	921. O ye loyal servants of the Ancient Beauty! In every cycle and 
dispensation, the feast hath been favoured and loved, and the spreading 
of a table for the lovers of God hath been considered a praiseworthy 
act. This is especially the case today, in this dispensation beyond 
compare, this most generous of ages, when it is highly acclaimed, for it
 is truly accounted among such gatherings as are held to worship and 
glorify God. Here the holy verses, the heavenly odes and laudations are 
intoned, and the heart is quickened, and carried from itself.</p>
<p>	The primary intent is to kindle these stirrings of the spirit, but 
at the same time it follows quite naturally that those present should 
partake of food, so that the world of the body may mirror the spirit's 
world, and flesh take on the qualities of soul; and just as the 
spiritual delights are here in profusion, so too the material delights.</p>
<p>	Happy are ye, to be observing this rule, with all its mystic 
meanings, thus keeping the friends of God alert and heedful, and 
bringing them peace of mind, and joy.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 48, pp. 90- 91)</p>
<p>	922. Thy letter hath been received. Thou didst write of the Nineteen
 Day festivity, and this rejoiced my heart. These gatherings cause the 
divine table to descend from heaven, and draw down the confirmations of 
the All- Merciful. My hope is that the breathings of the Holy Spirit 
will be wafted over them, and that each one present shall, in great 
assemblies, with an eloquent tongue and a heart flooded with the love of
 God, set himself to acclaiming the rise of the Sun of Truth, the dawn 
of the Day-Star that lighteth all the world.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 49, p. 91)</p>
<p>	923. Give ye great weight to the Nineteen Day gatherings, so that on
 these occasions the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the 
Merciful may<br>
 turn their faces toward the Kingdom, chant the communes, beseech God's 
help, become joyfully enamoured each of the other, and grow in purity 
and holiness, and in the fear of God, and in resistance to passion and 
self. Thus will they separate themselves from this elemental world, and 
immerse themselves in the ardours of the spirit.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to the local Spiritual Assembly of Spokane, Washington - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	924. I beg of God, out of His endless bounties, that many such 
gatherings will be held, and that the Nineteen Day festivity will also 
be observed, so that men and women believers will occupy themselves with
 making mention of God, and praising and glorifying Him, and guiding the
 people aright.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to the Baha'is of Stuttgart, Germany - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	925. O thou who art steadfast in the Covenant!<br>
	Your detailed letter hath been received, but because of the press of 
work a brief answer must suffice. You have asked as to the Feast in 
every Baha'i month. This Feast is held to foster comradeship and love, 
to call God to mind and supplicate Him with contrite hearts, and to 
encourage benevolent pursuits. That is, the friends should there dwell 
upon God and glorify Him, read the prayers and holy verses, and treat 
one another with the utmost affection and love. Should trouble arise 
between two of the friends, let both be invited in, and efforts be made 
to compose their differences. Let all discussion centre on the doing of 
charitable acts and holy deeds, that laudable results may be the fruit 
thereof.[1]<br>
 [1 Cf. "Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 50, p. 91.]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	926. As to the Nineteen Day Feast, it rejoiceth mind and heart. If 
this feast be held in the proper fashion, the friends will, once in 
nineteen days, find themselves spiritually restored, and endued with a 
power that is not of this world.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.]. (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 51, p. 91)<br>

</p><p>	927. As to the Nineteen Day festivity, it is of the utmost 
importance that the friends should gather at a meeting where, in 
complete attunement and love, they should engage in the remembrance of 
God and His praise, and converse as to the glad tidings of God, and 
proofs of the Advent of Baha'u'llah, and should recount the high deeds 
and sacrifices of the lovers of God in Persia, and tell of the martyrs' 
detachment from the world, and their ecstasy, and of how the believers 
there stood by one another and gave up everything they had. The Nineteen
 Day festivity is, therefore, of very great importance.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	928. ... make of the Feasts[1] occasions of joy and fellowship 
reminiscent of the feasts[2] that our forebears used to hold in 
connection with their commemoration of the Lord's Supper...<br>
 [1 The Nineteen Day Feasts.]<br>
 [2 The agape or "love-feast" of the early Christians.]</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	929. Vigorous steps must be taken to establish the Nineteen Day 
reception throughout the whole community. Since this Feast is confined 
to believers only, conclusive proofs must there be set forth as to the 
people of the Bayan, so that newcomers, unaware of the situation, may be
 made aware of it.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	930. It befitteth the friends to hold a gathering, a meeting, where 
they shall glorify God and fix their hearts upon Him, and read and 
recite the Holy Writings of the Blessed Beauty -- may my soul be the 
ransom of His lovers! The lights of the All-Glorious Realm, the rays of 
the Supreme Horizon, will be cast upon such bright assemblages, for 
these are none other than the Mashriqu'l- Adhkars, the Dawning-Points of
 God's Remembrance, which must, at the direction of the most Exalted 
Pen, be established in every hamlet and city... These spiritual 
gatherings must be held with the utmost purity and consecration, so that
 from the site itself, and its earth and the air about it, one will 
inhale the fragrant breathings of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed.], (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 55, pp. 93-94)<br>

</p><p>	931. Thou hast written of that meeting held in the quarter where
 standeth the city gate of 'Abdu'l-'Azim. Do not call it a meeting. Call
 it a confluence of holy souls; a convocation of those who love the 
Lord; a retreat for the people of the All-Merciful; a palace-hall for 
all who sing His praise. For the members of that gathering are each one a
 lighted taper, and that council a mansion of the moon and stars. It 
hath been blessed by the Lord of all mankind, and hath made current the 
Feast as set forth in the Most Holy Book.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	932. And thou, O my dear daughter, stay thou at all times in close 
touch with my honoured daughter, Mrs...., and be thou her friend. Rest 
you assured that the breaking of the Holy Spirit will loosen your 
tongue. Speak, therefore; speak out with great courage at every meeting.
 When you are about to begin your address, turn first to Baha'u'llah and
 ask for the confirmations of the Holy Spirit, then open your lips and 
say whatever is suggested to your heart; this, however, with the utmost 
courage, dignity and conviction. It is my hope that from day to day your
 gatherings will grow and flourish, and that those who are seeking after
 truth will hearken therein to reasoned arguments and conclusive proofs.
 I am with you heart and soul at every meeting; be sure of this.[1]<br>
 [1 Cf. "Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" [rev. ed] (Haifa: Baha'i World Centre, 1982), sec. 216, pp. 269-70]</p>
<p>	Hold you the Nineteen Day Feasts with utmost dignity.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	933. You must continue to keep the Nineteen Day Feast. It is very 
important; it is very good. But when you present yourselves in the 
meetings, before entering them, free yourselves from all that you have 
in your heart, free your thoughts and your minds from all else save God,
 and speak to your heart. That all may make this a gathering of love, 
make it the cause of illumination, make it a gathering of attraction of 
the hearts, surround this gathering with the Lights of the Supreme 
Concourse, so that you may be gathered together with the utmost love.</p>
<p>	O God! Dispel all those elements which are the cause of discord, and
 prepare for us all those things which are the cause of unity and 
accord! O God! Descend upon us Heavenly Fragrance and change this 
gathering<br>
 into a gathering of Heaven! Grant to us every benefit and every food. 
Prepare for us the Food of Love! Give to us the Food of Knowledge! 
Bestow upon us the Food of Heavenly Illumination!<br>
In your hearts remember these things, and then enter the<br>
Unity Feast.</p>
<p>	Each one of you must think how to make happy and pleased the other 
members of your Assembly, and each one must consider all those who are 
present as better and greater than himself, and each one must consider 
himself less than the rest. Know their station as high, and think of 
your own station as low. Should you act and live according to these 
behests, know verily, of a certainty, that that Feast is the Heavenly 
Food. That Supper is the "Lord's Supper"! I am the Servant of that 
gathering.</p>
<p>	("Star of the West", vol. IV, no. 7 (13 July 1913), p. 120)</p>
<p>	934. The Nineteen Day Feast was inaugurated by the Bab and ratified 
by Baha'u'llah, in His holy book, the Akdas [sic], so that people may 
gather together and outwardly show fellowship and love, that the divine 
mysteries may be disclosed. The object is concord, that through this 
fellowship hearts may become perfectly united, and reciprocity and 
mutual helpfulness be established. Because the members of the world of 
humanity are unable to exist without being banded together, cooperation 
and mutual helpfulness is the basis of human society. Without the 
realization of these two great principles no great movement is pressed 
forward...</p>
<p>	In brief, this is my hope: that the Nineteen Day Feast become the 
cause of great spiritual solidarity between the friends, that it may 
bring believers into the bond of unity, and we will then be so united 
together that love and wisdom will spread from this centre to all parts.
 This Feast is a divine Feast. It is a Lord's supper. It attracts 
confirmation of God like a magnet. It is the cause of the enlightenment 
of hearts.</p>
<p>	Every day great feasts and banquets are being spread with the object
 of material enjoyment and relish of food. People partake of certain 
delicacies and waters from various fountains, that they may have a good 
time. Balls and dances follow. All these are for the body, but this 
fellowship is of the enjoyment of God, for the partaking of spiritual 
food, for the elucidation of spiritual subjects, for the discussion and 
interpretation of the teachings and counsels of God. It is absolute 
spirituality.<br>

</p><p>	It is my hope that the Nineteen Day Feast may become firmly 
established and organized so that the holy realities are behind this 
meeting may leave behind all prejudices and conflict, and make their 
hearts as a treasury of love. Even if there is the slightest feeling 
between certain souls -- a lack of love -- it must be made to entirely 
disappear. There must be the utmost translucency and purity of 
intention.</p>
<p>	They must enjoy the love of God, acquire the power for the promotion
 of the happiness of mankind and the Word of God. With such high mention
 must this Feast become an established institution. When they gather in 
this meeting, all those present must turn their faces toward the Kingdom
 of Abha, and from their hearts supplicate, invoke and entreat toward 
the lofty throne, beg of God's forgiveness for all shortcomings, read 
the teachings and arise to His service.</p>
<p>	Then spread the feast and give refreshments. Assuredly great results
 will be the outcome of such meetings. Material and spiritual benefits 
will be assured. All who are present will be intoxicated with the 
breezes of the Love of God, and the Breath of the Holy Spirit will with 
tremendous power inspire the hearts.</p>
<p>	If this meeting be established on such a rock, it will become a 
power which will attract heavenly confirmations, be the means of the 
appearance of the Light of God, and the reality of every subject will 
become unfolded. Such a meeting will be under the protection of God. It 
is my hope that you will continually hold these meetings and that each 
time it will become more and more the centre of all the virtues, the 
point for the effulgence of God.</p>
<p>     May your hearts be enlightened!<br>
     May your faces become radiant!<br>
     May your spirits be illumined!<br>
     May your thoughts find wider range of vision!<br>
     May your spiritual susceptibilities be increased!<br>
     May the realm of God surround you, and may your<br>
     hearts become the treasury of heaven!<br>
     This is my hope. </p>
<p>	(From a talk by 'Abdu'l-Baha given at a Nineteen Day Feast in 
London, England, 29 December 1912, quoted in "Baha'i News Letter" 33 
(July 1929), pp. 1-2)<br>

</p><p>          2. The Threefold Feast Celebration</p>
<p>	From the Writings of Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	935. Still other factors promoting the development of that Order and
 contributing to its consolidation have been the systematic institution 
of the Nineteen Day Feast, functioning in most Baha'i communities in 
East and West, with its threefold emphasis on the devotional, the 
administrative and the social aspects of Baha'i community life...</p>
<p>	("God Passes By". rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), p. 342)</p>
<p>	From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi[1]<br>
 [1 To individual believers except where noted.]</p>
<p>	936. Regarding the nature of the Nineteen Day Feasts, the Guardian 
feels that the excellent statement on their nature, function and purpose
 published in one of the recent issues of the "News Letter" is so 
comprehensive and faithful in its presentation that he does not find it 
necessary to restate and enlarge upon the matter. He has no objection, 
however, if you feel the need to elaborate the thought expressed in that
 statement, stressing particularly the spiritual, administrative and 
social aspects of this vital Baha'i institution.[1]<br>
 [1 The statement to which reference is made in extract 20 is as follows:<br>
     This institution, established by Baha'u'llah, has been described by
 the Guardian as the foundation of the new World Order. The National 
Spiritual Assembly understands that it is incumbent upon every believer,<br>
unless ill or absent from the city, to attend each of these Feasts.</p>
<p>     In a general letter issued to Local Spiritual Assemblies several years ago, it was pointed out that the<br>
Guardian instructs that the Nineteen Day Feast be held according to the following program: the first part,<br>
entirely spiritual in character, is devoted to readings from Baha'i 
Sacred Writings; the second part consists of general consultation on the
 affairs of the Cause, at which time the Local Spiritual Assembly 
reports its activities to the community, asks for suggestions and 
consultation, and also delivers messages received from the Guardian and 
the National Assembly. The third part is the material feast and social 
meeting of all the friends. Only voting believers are invited to attend 
the Nineteen Day Feasts, but young people of less than twenty-one years 
of age, who are declared believers, especially when members of a Baha'i 
family, can also be present.</p>
<p>     These meetings may be regarded as the very heart of our Baha'i  
community life. When properly conducted, and attended by a Baha'i  
community which fully appreciates their importance, the Nineteen Day  
Feasts serve to renew and deepen our spirit of faith, increase our 
capacity for united action, remove misunderstandings and keep us fully 
informed of all  important Baha'i activities, local, national and 
international in scope.<br>
(Statement of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i News" 75<br>
(July 1933), p. 8)]</p>
<p>	(6 September 1933 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i News" 79 (November 1933), p. 3)<br>

</p><p>	937. As to your question concerning Baha'i Feasts, Shoghi 
Effendi strongly feels that on such occasions the friends should 
emphasize both the spiritual and the administrative elements. For these 
are equally essential to the success of every Baha'i festival. To 
maintain the right balance between them is, therefore, the duty and 
responsibility of every individual Baha'i or group. Until the believers 
learn to combine the two, there can be no hope of their gaining any real
 and permanent benefit from such religious celebrations. A good part of 
the Feast must of course be devoted to the reading of the Holy Words. 
For it is through them that the friends can get the inspiration and the 
vision they need for the successful accomplishment of their work for the
 Cause.</p>
<p>	(27 May 1934)</p>
<p>	938. With regard to your question concerning the Nineteen Day 
Feasts: These gatherings are no doubt of a special importance to the 
friends, as they have both a social and an administrative significance, 
and as such should be regularly attended by all confirmed believers. 
They should also be observed according to the Baha'i calendar every 
nineteen days.</p>
<p>	(12 April 1935)</p>
<p>	939. Concerning the nature of the Nineteen Day Feast: In the 
"Aqdas", Baha'u'llah has clearly revealed the spiritual and social 
character of this institution. Its administrative significance, however,
 has been stressed by the Guardian in direct response to the growing 
needs of the Baha'i community in this formative period of the Baha'i Era
 for better training in the principles and practice of Baha'i 
administration.</p>
<p>	(29 July 1935 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)<br>

</p><p>	940. Regarding the Nineteen Day Feast: in a previous letter to 
the National Spiritual Assembly the Guardian had made it clear that, 
although not a binding ordinance, this Feast has been regarded by 
Baha'u'llah as highly desirable and meritorious. In the "Aqdas" He has 
specially emphasized its spiritual and devotional character, and also 
its social importance in the Baha'i community as a means for bringing 
about closer fellowship and unity among the believers. The 
administrative significance of this Feast has been stated by the 
Guardian in view of the increasing need among the friends for better 
training in the principles and methods of Baha'i Administration.</p>
<p>	The significance of the Nineteen Day Feast is thus threefold. It is a
 gathering of a devotional, social and administrative importance. When 
these three features are all combined, this Feast can and will surely 
yield the best and the maximum of results. The friends, however, should 
be on their guard lest they overstress the significance of this 
institution created by Baha'u'llah. They should also take care not to 
underrate or minimize its importance.</p>
<p>	(2 October 1935 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	941. He was very glad to know you are holding the Feasts, as these 
form a rallying-point for the friends and help to unite them and deepen 
them in the Faith.</p>
<p>	(5 March 1946)</p>
<p>	From Letters Written by or on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	942. A group, of course, is not an administrative body and there is 
no objection to the members of a group making decisions within their 
scope on any occasion when all of them happen to be together, even if 
this should be at a Nineteen Day Feast. The Nineteen Day Feast can only 
be an official administrative occasion where there is a Local Spiritual 
Assembly to take charge of it, present reports to the friends, and 
receive their recommendations. But groups, spontaneous gatherings of the
 friends, and even isolated believers should certainly remember the day 
and say prayers together. In the case of a group, it may well hold the 
Feast<br>
 in the manner in which a Local Spiritual Assembly would do so, 
recognizing of course that it has no official administrative standing.</p>
<p>	(31 October 1972 written by the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Switzerland)</p>
<p>	943. Regarding changing the order of the Feast, it is clear from 
Shoghi Effendi's instructions that the Nineteen Day Feast programme 
should start with the spiritual part, and not with the social part, 
which includes refreshments, or breaking bread together... However, if 
it is found that some sort of association among the friends or the 
serving of food and refreshments will be helpful, if this takes place at
 the outset, there is no objection to this practice, provided it is 
clear that it is not part of the Feast.</p>
<p>	(23 January 1985 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	3. Feast Times</p>
<p>	From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	944. As to your question relative to the last Nineteen Day Feast, 
Shoghi Effendi sees no objection if the friends choose to celebrate it 
on one of the intercalary days. They may also celebrate it during the 
month of fasting, provided they abstain from food.</p>
<p>	(2 August 1934 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	945. Your third question concerns the day on which the Feast should 
be held every month. The Guardian stated in reply that no special day 
has been fixed, but it would be preferable and most suitable if the 
gathering of the friends should be held on the first day of each Baha'i 
month.</p>
<p>	(1 December 1936 to an individual believer - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	946. Regarding the time for the holding of the Nineteen Day Feasts 
and elections: the Guardian would advise your Assembly to urge the 
friends to hold such gatherings on the prescribed day before sunset. If 
impossible, then it is permissible to hold them on the preceding day. In<br>
 connection with the nine holy days however the friends should consider 
it obligatory to celebrate them on the prescribed day before sunset.</p>
<p>	(24 December 1939 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	947. The Naw-Ruz Feast should be held on March 21 before sunset and 
has nothing to do with the Nineteen Day Feast. The Nineteen Day Feast is
 administrative in function whereas the Naw-Ruz is our New Year, a Feast
 of hospitality and rejoicing.</p>
<p>	(5 July 1950 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)</p>
<p>	From a Letter Written by the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	948. As to your questions concerning the times for Feasts and Holy 
Days: The Baha'i Day is from sunset to sunset, therefore if in summer 
the sun sets too late to enable the Nineteen Day Feast to be held on the
 preceding evening, it should be held on the day itself. As long as the 
meeting begins before sunset it is considered to be held on the day 
which comes to an end with that sunset. Naturally Nineteen Day Feasts 
should be held on the first day of the Baha'i month if possible, but if 
it should be difficult to do so, for example if it coincides with a 
regular public meeting evening, it is permissible to hold it on the 
following day, i.e. on a succeeding day of the Baha'i month.</p>
<p>	(23 June 1964 to the National Spiritual Assembly Finland)</p>
<p>	4. Feast Locations</p>
<p>	From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Individual Believers</p>
<p>	949. There is no objection to holding meetings in the open air as long as they are conducted with dignity.</p>
<p>	(22 November 1941)</p>
<p>	950. Each city will have its own Spiritual Assembly, not a number of
 district ones. Naturally, district Nineteen Day Feasts can be held 
where there are very many Baha'is in one city.</p>
<p>	(31 March 1949)<br>

</p><p>	951. The matter of where the Nineteen Day Feasts should be held 
is certainly one for the Spiritual Assembly to decide; but the 
Haziratu'l-Quds seems the logical place on most occasions. Until the 
friends have a place of worship in ..., this building will also be used 
for devotional meetings, as well as for administrative purposes.</p>
<p>	If, under some circumstances, some special Feast is offered in the 
home of one of the believers, with the approval of the Spiritual 
Assembly, there can be no objection; but, generally speaking, he feels 
it is better to use the Haziratu'l-Quds.</p>
<p>	(18 February 1954)</p>
<p>	From Letters Written by or on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	952. We understand and appreciate the problems involved in the 
holding of Nineteen Day Feasts in the large cities such as New York and 
Los Angeles and we have no objection to your Assembly authorizing the 
Local Assembly to provide for the holding of the Feast in different 
localities as an experiment, if the Local Assembly so wishes, bearing in
 mind the following precautions: The tendency in metropolitan areas is 
towards segregation, and therefore the Local Assembly should be alert to
 prevent a similar pattern developing in Baha'i meetings by reason of 
the location of the Feast. The Local Assembly should be watchful that 
neither the unity of the community nor control by the Local Assembly is 
dissipated by this practice.</p>
<p>	(23 January 1967 written by the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	953. Your letter of August 9th posing the problem of holding 
Nineteen Day Feasts and other Baha'i activities in the two communities 
... which have grown so large that it is impossible to conduct such 
activities in homes is welcomed by us, and we hope you will meet this 
problem before long in other communities.</p>
<p>	We leave it to your discretion as to whether these large communities
 should purchase adequate facilities to accommodate the believers at<br>
 Feasts and other Baha'i activities, rent facilities, or hold several simultaneous Feasts, still utilizing homes.</p>
<p>	(21 August 1972 written by the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska)</p>
<p>	954. Difficulties of travelling to the Nineteen Day Feasts, and 
other occasions, which may be met in certain parishes can be overcome by
 your authorizing the Local Assembly in such a parish to hold more than 
one Feast within its area. There is no need to establish rigid 
boundaries for such a purpose, and the friends should be allowed to 
attend the Feast in their parish most convenient to them; but all should
 note that every Feast in the area is a portion of the same Feast under 
the jurisdiction of the Local Spiritual Assembly. Occasions should be 
provided for the entire Baha'i community of the parish to meet together,
 and Feast days need not be excluded from such occasions.</p>
<p>	(14 January 1980 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice
 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Barbados and the Windward 
Islands)</p>
<p>	955. As to the question of holding meetings to commemorate Baha'i 
Holy Days on a regional basis, the House of Justice has ruled that it 
may be desirable in certain areas for the believers in neighbouring 
localities to join together with other communities in observing Holy 
Days and certain events. Such matters should be referred to and 
determined by National Spiritual Assemblies. Observance of the Nineteen 
Day Feasts and other local activities, however, should be held in the 
respective civil areas.</p>
<p>	(20 March 1986 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	956. The problems implied by your inquiry are not insurmountable. 
For instance, the Local Spiritual Assembly could be authorized to 
appoint an administrative committee in each of a number of sub-units of 
the city; and these committees could deal with the urgent needs of the 
friends in these areas on behalf of the Assembly; and if found 
desirable, the Spiritual Assembly could authorize the holding of 
separate Nineteen Day Feasts in several sub- units. In such a 
decentralized system, the Local Spiritual Assembly would have to provide
 for the overall coordination of the efforts of the friends in all sub- 
units of the city.<br>

</p><p>	The sub-division of the city should be seen merely as an 
administrative necessity meant to serve the good of the whole community;
 in this sense, the Assembly should guard strenuously against creating 
too many sub-units, contenting itself with the minimum action in this 
respect. Given the racial and social stratification of large cities, the
 Spiritual Assembly would also have to exert the utmost care not to 
allow the Baha'i community of . . . to become, in effect, racially or 
socially fragmented, even though one race or stratum may be dominant in a
 sub- unit of the city. One of the questions that should remain 
uppermost in the minds of the Assembly, the committees and the 
individual friends is how to uphold at all times. through their 
functions and deeds, the primary principle and goal of our Faith, 
namely, the unity of the human race.</p>
<p>	(20 December 1987 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	5. Attendance of Believers at the Feast</p>
<p>	From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi[1]<br>
 [1 To individual believers except where noted.]</p>
<p>	957. In regard to the Nineteen Day Feasts, Shoghi Effendi is of the 
opinion that the believers should be impressed with the importance of 
attending these gatherings which, in addition to their spiritual 
significance, constitute a vital medium for maintaining close and 
continued contact between the believers themselves, and also between 
them and the body of their elected representatives in the local 
community.</p>
<p>	No radical action, such as the expulsion of any believer from the 
community, should, however, be taken in case anyone fails to attend 
these Feasts. It is for every individual believer to realize what the 
Cause requires from him in this matter. Any threat or menace can be of 
no avail, unless it is based on appeal to individual conscience and 
responsibility.</p>
<p>	(22 December 1934)</p>
<p>	958. Also regarding the Nineteen Day Feasts: these are not strictly 
obligatory, but the believers should endeavour to regularly attend them,
 mainly for the following two reasons: first, because they foster the 
spirit of service and fellowship in the community and secondly, in view 
of the<br>
 fact that they afford the believers a splendid opportunity to fully 
discuss the affairs of the Cause and to find ways and means for 
continued improvement in the conduct of Baha'i activities.</p>
<p>	(30 November 1936)</p>
<p>	959. Attendance at Nineteen Day Feasts is not obligatory, but highly
 desirable, and effort should be made by the friends not to deprive 
themselves of this spiritual and communal rallying-point once in every 
Baha'i month.</p>
<p>	(23 December 1948)</p>
<p>	960. The Guardian has never heard of any ruling by which a believer 
who does not attend three consecutive Nineteen Day Feasts can be 
deprived of his voting rights. He does not consider that such action is 
justifiable at all. The whole question is whether a person considers 
himself a Baha'i or not, and is willing to adhere to the principles of 
the Faith and accept the authority of the Guardian and the 
Administration -- whether that individual is able, or always in a 
condition psychologically to attend Feasts and Baha'i meetings is an 
entirely different subject. If a person makes it quite clear that they 
do not wish to be considered an active member of the Baha'i Community 
and be affiliated with it and exert their voting right, then their name 
should be removed from the voting list; but if a person considers 
himself or herself a Baha'i, and for various reasons is not able to be 
active in the affairs of the Community, then they should certainly not 
be removed from our voting list, least of all at present, when the 
number of the Baha'i Community is so small.</p>
<p>	(2 March 1951 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria)</p>
<p>	961. He fully appreciates the difficult position your Assembly will 
be placed in if you adhere to the principle that the members of an 
Assembly and voting members of a community must live within the civic 
limits. However, he feels that Paris can be no exception to this general
 rule which he wishes the Baha'is to adhere to all over the world, in 
spite of any temporary inconvenience it may cause.</p>
<p>	This does not mean that the Baha'is of Paris living outside the 
civic limits should not attend the Nineteen Day Feast and the Baha'i 
Holy Days; on the contrary, they should take an active part in the 
affairs of the<br>
 community in the sense of assisting with the teaching work, while at 
the same time not being active in the administrative work. He feels sure
 that in the end you will find that, far from having been weakened, your
 community will grow and be strengthened by this adherence to principle.</p>
<p>	(20 February 1953 to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Paris)</p>
<p>	962. It is inconceivable and wholly inadmissible that any Baha'is in
 a Community should be permitted to hold a Feast in their home and 
refuse admission to another believer; and your Assembly should write 
accordingly in very strong terms to the ... Assembly, pointing out that 
the Guardian is not only surprised to learn of this situation, but 
disapproves of it in the strongest terms.</p>
<p>	Any Baha'i may attend a Feast -- a local Baha'i, a Baha'i from out 
of town, certainly an isolated Baha'i from the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>	(27 May 1957 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British 
Isles, published in "Unfolding Destiny: The Message from the Guardian of
 the Baha'i Faith to the Baha'i Community of the British Isles" (London:
 Baha'i Publishing Trust. 1981), p. 380)</p>
<p>	From Letters Written by or on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	963. In reply to your letter of November 8th we feel that all 
friends, whatever their circumstances, should be encouraged to observe 
the Nineteen Day Feast. Obviously it can only be an official 
administrative occasion where there is a Local Spiritual Assembly to 
take charge of it, present reports to the friends, and receive their 
recommendations. But groups, spontaneous gatherings of friends, and even
 isolated believers should certainly remember the day and say prayers 
together. In the case of a group it may well hold the Feast in the 
manner in which a Local Spiritual Assembly would do so, recognizing of 
course that it has no official administrative standing.</p>
<p>	As to visitors to a Nineteen Day Feast, Baha'is from anywhere in the
 world should of course be warmly welcomed, and may take part in 
consultation. However, only members of the local community can vote on 
recommendations to the Local Spiritual Assembly.</p>
<p>	(1 December 1968 written by the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles)<br>

</p><p>	964. It is not quite correct to say that a Nineteen Day Feast is
 changed into a Unity Feast as a result of the presence of non-Baha'is. 
What can happen is that the consultative portion of the Feast has to be 
postponed.... If it is decided to postpone part or all of the 
consultative portion of the Feast, the House of Justice states that it 
is within the discretion of the Local Spiritual Assembly to decide 
whether another meeting should be held during the Baha'i month to 
complete it, or whether it can be postponed until the following Nineteen
 Day Feast.</p>
<p>	(5 September 1983 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany)</p>
<p>	965. A Baha'i who is visiting another community may participate 
fully in the consultation of the Nineteen Day Feast, but has no right to
 vote on recommendations being made to the Local Spiritual Assembly. Out
 of courtesy, however, a visitor would normally refrain from taking too 
much time of the consultation. Any Baha'i, whether an isolated believer 
or a member of a local community or group, may convey his suggestions 
and recommendations to the National Spiritual Assembly at any time and 
thus take part in the consultative aspect of Baha'i community life. 
Isolated believers and the members of groups may also, of course, attend
 the Nineteen Day Feasts of communities when they wish to.</p>
<p>	(23 July 1985 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	966. With respect to your question asking whether a Local Spiritual 
Assembly may cancel its Nineteen Day Feast in order to attend Feast in 
another community, the House of Universal Justice advises that the 
Nineteen Day Feast should not be cancelled. However, there is no 
objection to two or more local communities holding a joint Nineteen Day 
Feast occasionally, although it is not proper to allow such joint Feasts
 to be held on a regular basis. If members of a community find that the 
plan to hold such a joint Feast would produce inconvenience to them, 
they should take the matter up with their Local Spiritual Assembly.</p>
<p>	(26 April 1987 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	6. Restrictions Upon Feast Attendance</p>
<p>	From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	967. As regards your question concerning the Nineteen Day Feasts: 
this is really a matter of secondary importance, and should be decided 
by the Assembly; meetings which have been publicly advertised for a 
certain date cannot, obviously, be cancelled. As to non-Baha'is 
attending: this should by all means be avoided, but if non-believers 
come to a Nineteen Day Feast, they should not be put out, as this might 
hurt their feelings.</p>
<p>	(21 September 1946 to two believers)</p>
<p>	968. The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you concerning 
an action recently taken by your National Assembly, as published in your
 January-February Baha'i News, that non-Baha'is may attend Nineteen Day 
Feasts if "the earnestness of their interest in the Faith" is vouched 
for by a declared believer.</p>
<p>	The Guardian wishes me to direct your attention to the fact that 
none of the institutions of the Faith nor its cardinal principles may be
 changed under any circumstances. The Nineteen Day Feast is an 
institution of the Cause, first established by the Bab, later confirmed 
by Baha'u'llah, and now made a prominent part of the administrative 
order of the Faith. These Nineteen Day Feasts are for the Baha'is, and 
the Baha'is exclusively, and no variation from this principle is 
permitted.</p>
<p>	Thus the Guardian feels you should rescind the action taken by your 
Assembly in opening the Feasts to "near Baha'is", as it is not 
consistent with the spirit of the administrative order for non-Baha'is 
or near Baha'is to attend the Nineteen Day Feasts, particularly the 
administrative portion of the Feast.</p>
<p>	The Guardian realizes that the spirit which animated you in making 
the suggested proposal, in order that the teaching work might go forward
 more aggressively; but he feels in the long run it would be detrimental
 to the Faith, and therefore should be rescinded as indicated above.</p>
<p>	(28 May 1954 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria)<br>

</p><p>	From Letters Written by or on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>969. The principle universally applicable is that non-Baha'is are not
 invited to the Nineteen Day Feast. If in Persia it has happened that 
non-Baha'is are present at a Nineteen Day Feast this is an exception and
 not a rule. It is well understood in Persia that if a non-Baha'i should
 inadvertently attend a Nineteen Day Feast he would be treated 
courteously. However, it is equally important for the friends to 
understand that they should refrain from inviting non-Baha'is to these 
special gatherings, ordained by Baha'u'llah not only for spiritual 
refreshment and unity, but also for consultation between the Spiritual 
Assembly and the body of believers on the domestic affairs of the 
community.</p>
<p>	(4 February 1974 written by the Universal House of Justice a Local Spiritual Assembly)</p>
<p>	970. In reply to your memorandum of 16 November 1975 requesting 
elucidation of a statement from the Guardian published on page 367 of 
Volume IV of "Amr va Khalq", ... later instructions of the beloved 
Guardian clearly forbid attendance at the Nineteen Day Feast by those 
deprived of their voting rights and the quotation published in "Amr va 
Khalq" should therefore be replaced by another statement by the 
Guardian.</p>
<p>	(24 November 1975, memorandum written by the Universal House of Justice to the International Teaching Centre)</p>
<p>	971. The main thing to remember is that a group is not an 
administrative institution within the Baha'i Administrative Order; it 
is, however, the embryo of a Local Spiritual Assembly and while 
remaining under the direct authority of the National Spiritual Assembly 
should obviously be encouraged to prepare itself for the time when it 
will establish that divine institution. There is no objection whatever 
to its electing officers such as a secretary, chairman and treasurer, 
holding Nineteen Day Feasts and observances of the Holy Days, 
undertaking teaching and extension work, so long as it is always 
understood that the directive authority is the National Spiritual 
Assembly and not the group itself.</p>
<p>	(13 June 1974 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Paraguay)<br>

</p><p>	972. It can be explained, in a friendly manner, that the 
Nineteen Day Feast is an entirely private religious and domestic 
occasion for the Baha'i community when its internal affairs are 
discussed and its members meet for personal fellowship and worship. No 
great issue should be made of it for there is certainly nothing secret 
about the Feast but it is organized for Baha'is only.</p>
<p>	(4 November 1967 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Belgium)</p>
<p>	973. Regarding the Nineteen Day Feast, the principle universally 
applicable is that non-Baha'is are not invited to attend, and if you are
 asked about this you can explain that the nature of the Feast is 
essentially domestic and administrative. During the period of 
consultation the Baha'is should be able to enjoy perfect freedom to 
express their views on the work of the Cause, unembarrassed by the 
feeling that all they are saying is being heard by someone who has not 
accepted Baha'u'llah and who might thereby gain a very distorted picture
 of the Faith. It would also be very embarrassing for any sensitive 
Baha'i to find himself plunged into the midst of a discussion of the 
detailed affairs of a Baha'i community of which he is not a part. A 
non-Baha'i who asks to be invited to a Feast will usually understand if 
this matter is explained to him.</p>
<p>	(12 August 1981 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	974. The following guidance on this subject was sent to a believer on 24 March 1970 by the House of Justice: </p>
<p>	... when a non-Baha'i does appear at a Feast he should not be asked 
to leave; rather the Assembly should omit the consultative part of the 
Feast, and the non-Baha'i should be made welcome....</p>
<p>	No doubt you are familiar with this instruction. Likewise, 
occasionally if the Feast is held in the home of the family where the 
spouse is not a Baha'i, it would be discourteous not to allow the 
non-Baha'i member of the family to attend at least the social and 
spiritual parts of the Feast.</p>
<p>	(8 January 1985 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia)<br>

</p><p>	975. ... if a non-Baha'i does appear at a Nineteen Day Feast he 
should be made to feel welcome, but a Baha'i should certainly not invite
 a non-Baha'i to attend. From all of the foregoing it can be seen that, 
basically, the resolution of this difficulty is a matter of loving 
education.</p>
<p>	(23 January 1985 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	7. Youth and Children at Feasts</p>
<p>	From Letters Written by or on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	976. Concerning your inquiry asking if children under fifteen of 
non-Baha'i parents could attend Nineteen Day Feasts or other events held
 exclusively for Baha'is when the children consider themselves as 
Baha'is, such children may be permitted to attend Baha'i functions 
provided that their parents have given their consent. This applies only,
 of course, to children under the age of fifteen years.</p>
<p>	(4 August 1970 written by the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Nicaragua)</p>
<p>	977. Concerning the declaration of young people under the age of 18,
 ... we can accept a child of the age of 15 and over as a Baha'i even if
 his parents do not consent and this remains true even though according 
to the law of Finland they cannot be officially transferred to the 
Baha'i register. You should not, therefore, exclude such believers from 
the Nineteen Day Feasts. However, although such believers should not be 
swayed from their belief by their parents' objections, they should, in 
view of the stress that the Teachings place upon the respect due to 
parents and in view of the law in Finland, obey their parents as far as 
taking part in Baha'i activities is concerned. Their aim should be to 
gradually awaken in their parents' hearts the same love for Baha'u'llah 
that has fired their own and not to antagonize their parents needlessly 
or contribute in any way to disharmony in their families at this crucial
 point in their development.</p>
<p>	(1 March 1972 written by the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Finland)<br>

</p><p>	978. The Universal House of Justice has received your letter of 
11 October 1976 inquiring whether children placed in the home of Baha'is
 for temporary or prolonged care are permitted to attend Baha'i 
functions, and we have been asked to inform you that such children may 
be permitted to attend the Nineteen Day Feasts and other Baha'i 
functions, and that no distinction should be made between them and the 
children of Baha'is in this regard.</p>
<p>	(31 October 1976 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a Baha'i group)</p>
<p>	979. ... the House of Justice has instructed us to say that children
 should be trained to understand the spiritual significance of the 
gatherings of the followers of the Blessed Beauty, and to appreciate the
 honour and bounty of being able to take part in them, whatever their 
outward form may be. It is realized that some Baha'i observances are 
lengthy and it is difficult for very small children to remain quiet for 
so long. In such cases one or other of the parents may have to miss part
 of the meeting in order to care for the child. The Spiritual Assembly 
can also perhaps help the parents by providing for a children's 
observance, suited to their capacities, in a separate room during part 
of the community's observance. Attendance at the whole of the adult 
celebration thus becomes a sign of growing maturity and a distinction to
 be earned by good behaviour.</p>
<p>	In any case, the House of Justice points out that parents are 
responsible for their children and should make them behave when they 
attend Baha'i meetings. If children persist in creating a disturbance 
they should be taken out of the meeting. This is not merely necessary to
 ensure the properly dignified conduct of Baha'i meetings but is an 
aspect of the training of children in courtesy, consideration for 
others, reverence, and obedience to their parents.</p>
<p>	(14 October 1982 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)</p>
<p>	980. It would not be administratively proper for a Baha'i youth 
under 21 years of age to act as Chairman of the Nineteen Day Feast. 
However, no great issue should be made of this as it is a purely private
 matter.</p>
<p>	(22 February 1984 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Italy)<br>

</p><p>	981. In response to the question you have raised in your letter 
of 18 October 1984 concerning the place of children in the community, 
especially with regard to Nineteen Day Feasts, we are asked to share 
with you the following quotation from a letter written on behalf of the 
Universal House of Justice to a National Assembly on the subject. Since 
children of Baha'i parents are considered to be Baha'is, they are to be 
encouraged to attend all Feasts, there to share the reading of the 
Writings and prayers and be bathed in the spirit of the community. It is
 the hope of the House of Justice that every Feast will be a feast of 
love when the children will give and receive the tangible affection of 
the community and its individual members. The House of Justice noted the
 suggestion you have made about holding Feasts on a weekend close to the
 first day of the Baha'i month to facilitate the attendance of children 
and their parents. This is a matter for the Local Assembly to discuss 
and decide upon ...</p>
<p>	(22 November 1984 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	8. The Feast Celebration: Prayers and Scriptural Readings</p>
<p>	From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi[1]<br>
 [1 To individual believers except where noted.]</p>
<p>	982. With regard to your question concerning the use of music in the
 Nineteen Day Feasts, he wishes you to assure all the friends that he 
not only approves of such a practice, but thinks it even advisable that 
the believers should make use in their meetings of hymns composed by 
Baha'is themselves, and also of such hymns, poems and chants as are 
based on the Holy Words.</p>
<p>	(April 1935)</p>
<p>	983. Regarding your questions: the Devotional part of the Nineteen 
Day Feast means the reading of prayers by Baha'u'llah and the Master. 
If, after this, there is a period of reading of the teachings, his [the 
Guardian's] writings may be included, but this does not form part of the
 devotional aspect of the meeting.</p>
<p>	(15 December 1947)<br>

</p><p>	984. Regarding the question you asked him about the Baha'i 
sacred writings: These should be regarded as the writings of the Bab, 
Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, and only these should be read during the 
purely devotional part of the Feast.</p>
<p>	(11 May 1948 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand)</p>
<p>	985. During the devotional part of the Nineteen Day Feast any part 
of the writings of the Bab, Baha'u'llah and the Master can be read, also
 from the Bible and Qur'an, as these are all sacred scriptures. This 
part of the meeting need not be confined to prayers, though prayers can 
and should be read during it.</p>
<p>	(18 October 1948)</p>
<p>	986. The question regarding the devotional part of the Feast has 
been obscured because once he used the term "devotional" in its strict 
sense, which of course means prayer, and once loosely, in the sense in 
which the Baha'is usually understand it, and that is the meeting 
together and reading from the teachings which precedes the 
administrative -- or consultative -- aspect of the Nineteen Day Feast. 
The two statements in no way change the method of holding this part of 
the Feast which, in the East at any rate, is always opened with prayers 
and afterwards Tablets and excerpts from Baha'u'llah's, or the Master's 
or the Guardian's, writings may be read or, for that matter, the Bible 
or Qur'an quoted.</p>
<p>	(11 April 1949 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	987. Music is permitted during the spiritual part -- or any part -- of the Nineteen Day Feast.</p>
<p>	(30 June 1952 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	Regarding the questions you raised in your letter:</p>
<p>	988. First, he feels that, although in principle there is certainly 
no reason why excerpts from other Sacred Scriptures should not be read 
in the spiritual part of our Feasts, as this is particularly an occasion
 when Baha'is get together to deepen their own spiritual life, it is, 
generally speaking, advisable for them to read from their own holy 
Writings in the spiritual part of the Feast.</p>
<p>	(18 February 1954)<br>

</p><p>	989. The Writings of the Bab and Baha'u'llah can certainly be 
read any time at any place; likewise the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha are 
read freely during the spiritual part of the Feast. The Guardian has 
instructed that during the spiritual part of the Feast, his own Writings
 should not be read. In other words, during the spiritual part of the 
Feast, readings should be confined to the Writings of the Bab, 
Baha'u'llah and, to a lesser extent, of the Master; but during that part
 of the Feast the Guardian's Writings should not be read. During the 
period of administrative discussion of the Feast, then the Guardian's 
Writings may be read. Of course during the administrative part of the 
Feast there can be no objection to the reading of the Writings of the 
Bab, Baha'u'llah or 'Abdu'l-Baha.</p>
<p>	(27 April 1956)</p>
<p>	990. Instrumental music may be used at the Baha'i Feasts. There is 
no objection to showing appreciation by the clapping of hands.</p>
<p>	If an individual has a teaching appointment on the same evening as a
 Nineteen Day Feast, it is left to the individual to judge which is the 
most important.</p>
<p>	(20 August 1956)</p>
<p>	From Letters Written by the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	991. We have noted in your Minutes of 27 December, page 1, a 
statement, "It was agreed to advise the friends in ... that it was not 
correct to sing a song composed by a Baha'i at the devotional part of 
the Nineteen Day Feast."</p>
<p>	It is not clear what your framework of reference for consultation 
happened to be, nor if a direct question was referred to your National 
Assembly for decision. However, we feel that it will be helpful to you 
to know that songs whose words are the primary Writings of the Bab, 
Baha'u'llah or 'Abdu'l-Baha are all quite fitting for the devotional 
portion of the Feast. Indeed, the Persian chants are such songs, out of a
 different tradition; they are a way of giving music to the holy Word, 
and each person who chants does it in a way which mirrors his feeling 
and expression of the Words he is uttering. As for songs whose words are
 poetic and the composition of persons other than the Figures of the 
Faith, these may be<br>
 desirable but in their proper place, for, as you know, "music is the language of the spirit."</p>
<p>	Inasmuch as the spirit of our gathering is so much affected by the 
tone and quality of our worship, of our feeling and appreciation of the 
Word of God for this day, we would hope that you would encourage the 
most beautiful possible expression of the human spirits in your 
communities, through music among other modes of feeling.</p>
<p>	(22 February 1971 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Guyana, Surinam and French Guiana)</p>
<p>	992. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that the Persian writings 
of Shoghi Effendi are unique in nature, and many of them, unlike his 
English letters and messages addressed to the western believers, are 
interspersed with supplications, prayers and homilies of a devotional 
character which are suitable for the spiritual part of Baha'i Feasts.</p>
<p>	(15 October 1972 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	[See also extract 71, referring to the use of the Guardian's Persian
 writings in the devotional portion of the Feast in Eastern Baha'i 
communities.]</p>
<p>	9. The Feast Celebration: Consultation</p>
<p>	From Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi</p>
<p>	993. The main purpose of the Nineteen Day Feasts is to enable 
individual believers to offer any suggestion to the Local Assembly, 
which in its turn will pass it to the National Spiritual Assembly. The 
Local Assembly is, therefore, the proper medium through which local 
Baha'i communities can communicate with the body of the national 
representatives. The Convention should be regarded as a temporary 
gathering, having certain specific functions to perform during a limited
 period of time. Its status is thus limited in time to the Convention 
sessions, the function of consultation at all other times being vested 
in the entire body of the believers through the Local Spiritual 
Assemblies.</p>
<p>	(18 November 1933 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada)<br>

</p><p>	994. The chief opportunity which the friends have for discussion
 on administrative questions is during the Nineteen Day Feasts, at which
 time the members of the Assembly can meet with the body of the 
believers and discuss in common the affairs of the Cause, and suggest 
new policies and methods. But even then no reference to individuals 
should be made.</p>
<p>	(27 March 1938 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	995. Now with reference to your last dear letter in which you had 
asked whether the believers have the right to openly express their 
criticism of any Assembly action or policy: it is not only the right, 
but the vital responsibility of every loyal and intelligent member of 
the Community to offer fully and frankly, but with due respect and 
consideration to the authority of the Assembly, any suggestion, 
recommendation or criticism he conscientiously feels he should in order 
to improve and remedy certain existing conditions or trends in his local
 Community, and it is the duty of the Assembly also to give careful 
consideration to any such views submitted to them by any one of the 
believers. The best occasion chosen for this purpose is the Nineteen Day
 Feast, which, besides its social and spiritual aspects, fulfils various
 administrative needs and requirements of the Community, chief among 
them being the need for open and constructive criticism and deliberation
 regarding the state of affairs within the local Baha'i Community. But 
again it should be stressed that all criticisms and discussions of a 
negative character which may result in undermining the authority of the 
Assembly as a body should be strictly avoided. For otherwise the order 
of the Cause itself will be endangered, and confusion and discord will 
reign in the Community.</p>
<p>	(13 December 1939 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	996. The Baha'is must learn to forget personalities and to overcome 
the desire -- so natural in people -- to take sides and fight about it. 
They must also learn to really make use of the great principle of 
consultation. There is a time set aside at the Nineteen Day Feasts for 
the Community to express its views and make suggestions to its Assembly;
 the Assembly and the believers should look forward to this happy period
 of discussion, and neither fear it nor suppress it. Likewise the 
Assembly members should<br>
 fully consult, and in their decisions put the interests of the Cause 
first and not personalities, the will of the majority prevailing.</p>
<p>	(30 June 1949 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria)</p>
<p>	From Letters Written by or on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	997. As you no doubt realize by this time, enrolling large numbers 
of new believers in a short period of time brings with it many problems 
of consolidation, but we are certain that you will be able to handle 
these problems and move on to even greater achievements.</p>
<p>	We note from reading your minutes that the enthusiasm of some of the
 new believers is being tested by the reading of long, wordy letters at 
Nineteen Day Feasts, and we think that something should be done about 
this. While it is important that the believers be informed about 
important messages from the Holy Land and other important items, it is 
true that the reading of messages at Nineteen Day Feasts can become a 
very boring and trying experience particularly for new believers not 
acquainted with many aspects of Baha'i administration. We think you 
should consider other ways and means by which believers could be 
informed of vital and necessary information, such as through bulletins, 
institutes and other meetings.</p>
<p>	(6 September 1971 written by the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Hawaiian Islands)</p>
<p>	998. As cited in Article IV of the By-Laws of a Local Spiritual 
Assembly, "While retaining the sacred right of final decision in all 
matters pertaining to the Baha'i community, the Spiritual Assembly shall
 ever seek the advice and consultation of all members of the community, 
keep the community informed of all its affairs, and invite full and free
 discussion on the part of the community of all matters affecting 
Faith".</p>
<p>	The actual voting on recommendations made at Nineteen Day Feasts to 
decide whether they should be forwarded to the Local Assembly is a 
secondary matter which may be left for decision by the Local Spiritual 
Assemblies themselves. It is not prohibited that the Local Assembly 
secretary record suggestions made at Nineteen Day Feasts for<br>
 consideration by the Assembly. The important point to keep in mind is the provision made in the By-Laws as mentioned above.</p>
<p>	(21 January 1982, memorandum written by the Universal House of Justice to the International Teaching Centre)</p>
<p>	999. Baha'i youth between the ages of 15 and 21 may certainly take 
part in discussions, and should be encouraged to do so, but they may not
 vote on recommendations to the Assembly until they 21.</p>
<p>	(16 September 1979 written on behalf of the Universal House of 
Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United Kingdom)</p>
<p>	1000. As a Local Spiritual Assembly is responsible for the 
organization of Nineteen Day Feasts, and is expected to make a report of
 its activities to the community at the Feast, in addition to responding
 to suggestions submitted to it, a Local Assembly should meet at least 
once a Baha'i month. However, the Universal House of Justice does not 
wish to draw hard and fast rules in this matter, and prefers to leave 
this question to the discretion of each National Assembly.</p>
<p>	If a local community, under the direction of its Local Assembly, 
observes Nineteen Day Feasts regularly, and it occasionally has a joint 
Feast with one or more other communities, you may credit in your 
statistics each Assembly for having held its own Nineteen Day Feast. 
You, of course, realize that joint Feasts do not fulfil the purpose of 
the Nineteen Day Feast in its strict sense, and should not become a 
regular practice among the friends.</p>
<p>	(15 February 1982 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Transkei)</p>
<p>	1001. If the friends at a Nineteen Day Feast agree with a 
recommendation, either unanimously or by a majority, it constitutes a 
recommendation from the Feast to the Assembly. On the other hand, if an 
individual believer makes a suggestion that other friends do not take 
up, it may still be considered by the Assembly....</p>
<p>	(27 July 1982 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany)<br>

</p><p>	1002. There are a number of factors involved in understanding 
the nature of appropriate interaction between a believer and his or her 
Local Spiritual Assembly during the consultative part of the Nineteen 
Day Feast. Chief among these is an appreciation of the purpose of this 
most important Institution of the Cause. 'Abdu'l-Baha described the 
Feast in these terms:</p>
<p>	This Feast is a bringer of joy. It is the groundwork of agreement 
and unity. It is the key to affection and fellowship. It diffuseth the 
oneness of mankind.</p>
<p>	(25 July 1984 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to
 the National Spiritual Assembly of Argentina) [see also extract 4]</p>
<p>	1003. The By-Laws of a Local Spiritual Assembly clearly imply the 
roles of the chairman and vice-chairman for meetings of the Assembly. 
For Feasts, the chairman or an appointed representative of the Spiritual
 Assembly presides during the period of consultation. However, this is 
not specified in the By-Laws and is a secondary matter left to the 
discretion of the National Assembly in each country; that Assembly may 
either adopt a uniform procedure for Local Assemblies to follow, or 
leave the matter to the discretion of the Local Assembly itself....</p>
<p>	(23 December 1986 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	10. The Feast Celebration: Socializing</p>
<p>	From a Memorandum Written by the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	1004. We can understand the desire of some of the friends to provide
 a warm welcome at the Feasts to newly declared believers and 
particularly youth, and we see no objection to the Assembly giving a 
reception before the actual Feast to achieve this purpose. As the Feast 
is frequently held in the evening, the Assembly might consider it 
desirable to arrange for the believers to have a light evening meal 
together before the Feast is held or it could, for example, arrange for 
social activities of an appropriate kind while the friends are gathering
 prior to the actual commencement of the<br>
 Nineteen Day Feast. This should not, however, take the place of the social part of the Feast itself.</p>
<p>	(21 January 1973, to the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land)</p>
<p>	11. The Blending of Cultures in the Feast Celebration</p>
<p>	From Letters written by or on Behalf of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	1005. We have considered your letter of March 11, 1970 concerning 
the difficulties you are experiencing in getting the Indian believers on
 reservations to hold regular Nineteen Day Feasts.</p>
<p>	In applying instructions about Nineteen Day Feasts, as well as other
 matters of administration, to indigenous believers it is important that
 the process of weaning them away from the old forms should be 
accomplished gradually so as not to destroy their spirit, and your 
Assembly should not be too rigid in these matters.</p>
<p>	(3 April 1970 written by the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)</p>
<p>	1006. The International Teaching Centre has sent us a copy of your 
letter of 10 October 1982 asking about language problems brought about 
by the influx of Iranians who do not understand English. It is important
 that the Iranian friends be encouraged to make the effort to learn the 
language used in the country and become integrated into the life and 
activities of the community.</p>
<p>	The Nineteen Day Feasts and other official gatherings of the friends
 should be conducted in whatever is the conventional local language. 
This does not mean, of course, that at such gatherings some of the 
readings could not be in the language of the immigrants, or that, if 
these friends so wish, some classes and conferences may not be held and 
conducted in their own language for their benefit. The essential thing 
is, as stated above, to promote the integration of the immigrants into 
the community and avoid feelings of estrangement or disunity on account 
of language.</p>
<p>	(10 November 1982 written by the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	1007. The Local Spiritual Assembly of ... is correct in its 
decision to conduct the Nineteen Day Feasts in Spanish and to not 
translate the proceedings in Persian, especially in view of the fact 
that some of the Spanish friends are becoming alienated from the 
community. Although the Iranian believers should make every effort to 
attend the Nineteen Day Feasts, they should not expect such meetings to 
be conducted in Persian. They should try to learn Spanish, particularly 
if they are planning to make their home in Spain. There is no objection,
 however, to Persian friends if they so wish having special meetings for
 fellowship and deepening conducted in Persian.</p>
<p>	(6 February 1983 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Spain)</p>
<p>	1008. You have asked for suggestions regarding the preparation of 
the handbook on Baha'i Holy Days which you are planning to publish. It 
is important that notwithstanding whatever details you set forth 
therein, it be made clear that the contents do not constitute procedures
 that must be rigidly adhered to. Dignity and reverence befitting the 
occasion should obviously characterize observances of Baha'i Holy Days 
by the friends, but this does not mean that cultural traditions which do
 not contravene Baha'i principles may not, and cannot, find expression 
in the local observances and meetings of the friends.</p>
<p>	(1 August 1983 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1009. In answer to your question about the presence of pets during 
Baha'i meetings held in homes in Europe, the House of Justice asks us to
 explain that the European attitude to pets is very different from that 
of the people of, for example, North Africa, and that this is a minor 
matter of which no issue should be made.</p>
<p>	(29 August 1983 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1010. Wherever linguistic problems exist, the House of Justice 
welcomes the holding of special classes and gatherings for the Iranian 
friends in addition to the regular community meetings, so that they will
 have the opportunity to study the Holy Writings in their own language 
and will be<br>
 kept informed of what is going on in the Baha'i community of Canada. 
Nineteen Day Feasts and Local Spiritual Assembly meetings should be 
conducted in English or French, as the case may be, since these are the 
languages of your country. If, however, it is possible to make 
arrangements for the Iranians who have not yet learned the language to 
benefit in some way from the topics discussed at such meetings without 
interfering with the smooth running of the meetings, this factor could 
be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>	(7 February 1984 written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)</p>
<p>	1011. The House of Justice has given the advice to Spiritual 
Assemblies faced with questions of possible conflict between tribal 
practices and Baha'i law, that such Assemblies should distinguish 
between aspects of tribal community life which are related to 
fundamental laws (such as monogamy) and matters of lesser importance, 
from which the friends can and should extricate themselves gradually. 
Furthermore, the House of Justice has offered the advice that: The 
institutions of the Faith should be careful not to press the friends to 
arbitrarily discard those local traditions which are harmless and often 
colourful characteristics of particular peoples and tribes. Were a new 
Baha'i suddenly to cease following the customs of his people, it is 
possible that they might misunderstand the true nature of the Baha'i 
Faith, and the Baha'is could be regarded as having turned against the 
traditions of the land ...</p>

</p><p>	SELECTIONS FROM BAHA'I WRITINGS ON SOME ASPECTS OF HEALTH, HEALING, NUTRITION AND RELATED MATTERS</p>
<p>	April 1984 Compiled by: The Research Department of the Universal House of Justice</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH</p>
<p>	1012. Whenever ye fall ill, refer to competent physicians. Verily, 
We have not abolished recourse to material means, rather have We 
affirmed it through this Pen which God hath made the Dawning Place of 
His luminous and resplendent Cause.</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Aqdas" - provisional translation from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	1013. We have granted you permission to study such sciences as will 
benefit you, not those which lead to idle disputes. Better is this for 
you, did ye but know.</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Aqdas" - provisional translation from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	1014. Whatever competent physicians or surgeons prescribe for a 
patient should be accepted and complied with, provided that they are 
adorned with the ornament of justice. If they were to be endued with 
divine understanding, that would certainly be preferable and more 
desirable.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1015. Well is it with the physician who cureth ailments in My hallowed and dearly-cherished Name.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	1016. In all circumstances they should conduct themselves with 
moderation; if the meal be only one course this is more pleasing in the 
sight of God; however, according to their means, they should seek to 
have this single dish be of good quality.</p>
<p>	("Kitab-i-Badi"' - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	1017. Know thou that the soul of man is exalted above, and is 
independent of all infirmities of body or mind. That a sick person 
showeth signs of weakness is due to the hindrances that interpose 
themselves between his soul and his body, for the soul itself remaineth 
unaffected by any bodily ailments. Consider the light of the lamp. 
Though an external object may interfere with its radiance, the light 
itself continueth to shine with undiminished power. In like manner, 
every malady afflicting the body of man is an impediment that preventeth
 the soul from manifesting its inherent might and power. When it leaveth
 the body, however, it will evince such ascendancy, and reveal such 
influence as no force on earth can equal. Every pure, every refined and 
sanctified soul will be endowed with tremendous power, and shall rejoice
 with exceeding gladness.</p>
<p>	("Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1983), sec. 80, pp. 153-54)</p>
<p>	O BEFRIENDED STRANGER!</p>
<p>	1018. The candle of thine heart is lighted by the hand of My power, 
quench it not with the contrary winds of self and passion. The healer of
 all thine ills is remembrance of Me, forget it not. Make My love thy 
treasure and cherish it even as thy very sight and life.</p>
<p>	("The Hidden Words of Baha'u'llah", Persian no. 32, rev. ed. Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1985), p. 43)</p>
<p>	1019. Do not neglect medical treatment when it is necessary, but 
leave it off when health has been restored.... Treat disease through 
diet, by preference, refraining from the use of drugs; and if you find 
what is required in a single herb, do not resort to a compounded 
medicament. Abstain from drugs when the health is good, but administer 
them when necessary.</p>
<p>	(Cited in J. E. Esslemont, "Baha'u'llah and the New Era", 5th rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1987), p. 106)</p>
<p>	1020. Verily the most necessary thing is contentment under all 
circumstances; by this one is preserved from morbid conditions and from 
lassitude. Yield not to grief and sorrow: they cause the greatest 
misery. Jealousy consumeth the body and anger doth burn the liver: avoid
 these two as you would a lion.</p>
<p>	(Cited in "Baha'u'llah and the New Era", p. 108)<br>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS AND UTTERANCES OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA</p>
<p>	1021. Thou shouldst endeavour to study the science of medicine. It 
is extremely useful and serveth as the greatest instrument for the 
dissemination of the Cause. It is absolutely imperative that thou 
acquire this bounty. Strive day and night that thou mayest become highly
 qualified in this science. And when thou wishest to dispense treatment 
set thy heart toward the Abha Kingdom, entreating divine confirmations.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1022. Thou shouldst continue thy profession and at the same time try to serve the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1023. Thou hast written about thy poor sight. According to the 
explicit divine text the sick must refer to the doctor. This decree is 
decisive and everyone is bound to observe it. While thou art there thou 
shouldst consult the most skilled and the most famed eye specialist.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1024. One must obey the command of God and submit to medical 
opinion. Thou hast undertaken this journey to comply with His command 
and not for the sake of healing, since healing is in the hand of God, 
not in the hand of doctors.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1025. That the Most Great Name exerciseth influence over both physical and spiritual matters is sure and certain.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1026. The child must, from the day of his birth, be provided with 
whatever is conducive to his health; and know ye this: so far as 
possible, the mother's milk is best for, more agreeable and better 
suited to the child, unless she should fall ill or her milk should run 
entirely dry....</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	1027. When thou wishest to treat nervous pains turn thy whole 
being to the realm on high with thine heart detached from aught else 
besides Him and thy soul enraptured by the love of God. Then seek 
confirmation of the Holy Spirit from the Abha Kingdom, while touching 
the affected part with utmost love, tenderness and attraction to God. 
When all these things are combined, be assured that healing will take 
place.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet- translated from the Arabic)</p>
<p>	1028. Regarding the eating of animal flesh and abstinence therefrom,
 know thou of a certainty that, in the beginning of creation, God 
determined the food of every living being, and to eat contrary to that 
determination is not approved. For instance, beasts of prey, such as the
 wolf, lion and leopard, are endowed with ferocious, tearing 
instruments, such as hooked talons and claws. From this it is evident 
that the food of such beasts is meat. If they were to attempt to graze, 
their teeth would not cut the grass, neither could they chew the cud, 
for they do not have molars. Likewise, God hath given to the four-footed
 grazing animals such teeth as reap the grass like a sickle, and from 
this we understand that the food of these species of animal is 
vegetable. They cannot chase and hunt down other animals. The falcon 
hath a hooked beak and sharp talons; the hooked beak preventeth him from
 grazing, therefore his food also is meat.</p>
<p>	But now coming to man, we see he hath neither hooked teeth nor sharp
 nails or claws, nor teeth like iron sickles. From this it becometh 
evident and manifest that the food of man is cereals and fruit. Some of 
the teeth of man are like millstones to grind the grain, and some are 
sharp to cut the fruit. Therefore he is not in need of meat, nor is he 
obliged to eat it. Even without eating meat he would live with the 
utmost vigour and energy. For example, the community of the Brahmins in 
India do not eat meat; notwithstanding this they are not inferior to 
other nations in strength, power, vigour, outward senses or intellectual
 virtues. Truly, the killing of animals and the eating of their meat is 
somewhat contrary to pity and compassion, and if one can content oneself
 with cereals, fruit, oil and nuts, such as pistachios, almonds and so 
on, it would undoubtedly be better and more pleasing.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	1029. Thou hast written regarding the four canine teeth in man, 
saying that these teeth, two in the upper jaw and two in the lower, are 
for the purpose of eating meat. Know thou that these four teeth are not 
created for meat- eating, although one can eat meat with them. All the 
teeth of man are made for eating fruit, cereals and vegetables. These 
four teeth, however, are designed for breaking hard shells, such as 
those of almonds. But eating meat is not forbidden or unlawful, nay, the
 point is this, that it is possible for man to live without eating meat 
and still be strong. Meat is nourishing and containeth the elements of 
herbs, seeds and fruits; therefore sometimes it is essential for the 
sick and for the rehabilitation of health. There is no objection in the 
Law of God to the eating of meat if it is required. So if thy 
constitution is rather weak and thou findest meat useful, thou mayest 
eat it.</p>
<p>	(From a Tablet - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1030. Thy letter was received. I hope that thou mayest be protected 
and assisted under the providence of the True One, be occupied always in
 mentioning the Lord and display effort to complete thy profession. Thou
 must endeavour greatly so that thou mayest become unique in thy 
profession and famous in those parts, because attaining perfection in 
one's profession in this merciful period is considered to be worship of 
God. And whilst thou art occupied with thy profession, thou canst 
remember the True One.</p>

<p>	1031. O ye, God's loved ones! Experience hath shown how greatly the 
renouncing of smoking, of intoxicating drink, and of opium, conduceth to
 health and vigour, to the expansion and keenness of the mind and to 
bodily strength. There is today a people[1] who strictly avoid tobacco, 
intoxicating liquor and opium. This people is far and away superior to 
the others, for strength and physical courage, for health, beauty and 
comeliness. A single one of their men can stand up to ten men of another
 tribe. This hath proved true of the entire people: that is, member for 
member, each individual of this community is in every respect superior 
to the individuals of other communities.<br>
 Make ye then a mighty effort, that the purity and sanctity which, above
 all else, are cherished by 'Abdu'l-Baha, shall distinguish the people 
of Baha; that in every kind of excellence the people of God shall 
surpass all other human beings; that both outwardly and inwardly they 
shall prove superior to the rest; that for purity, immaculacy, 
refinement, and the preservation of health, they shall be leaders in the
 vanguard of those who know. And that by their freedom from enslavement,
 their knowledge, their self-control, they shall be first among the 
pure, the free and the wise.<br>
 [1 Possibly 'Abdu'l-Baha was referring to the Sikhs; the description appears to apply to them.]</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 129, p. 150)</p>
<p>	1032. O thou distinguished physician! ... Praise be to God that thou
 hast two powers: one to undertake physical healing and the other 
spiritual healing. Matters related to man's spirit have a great effect 
on his bodily condition. For instance, thou shouldst impart gladness to 
thy patient, give him comfort and joy, and bring him to ecstasy and 
exultation. How often hath it occurred that this hath caused early 
recovery. Therefore, treat thou the sick with both powers. Spiritual 
feelings have a surprising effect on healing nervous ailments.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec. 130, pp. 150-51)</p>
<p>	1033. Although ill health is one of the unavoidable conditions of 
man, truly it is hard to bear. The bounty of good health is the greatest
 of all gifts.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu 'l-Baha", sec. 132, p. 151)</p>
<p>	1034. When giving medical treatment turn to the Blessed Beauty, then
 follow the dictates of thy heart. Remedy the sick by means of heavenly 
joy and spiritual exultation, cure the sorely afflicted by imparting to 
them blissful glad tidings and heal the wounded through His resplendent 
bestowals. When at the bedside of a patient, cheer and gladden his heart
 and enrapture his spirit through celestial power. Indeed, such a 
heavenly breath quickeneth every mouldering bone and reviveth the spirit
 of every sick and ailing one.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha" sec. 131, p. 151)<br>

</p><p>	1035. There are two ways of healing sickness, material means and
 spiritual means. The first is by the treatment of physicians; the 
second consisteth in prayers offered by the spiritual ones to God and in
 turning to Him. Both means should be used and practised.</p>
<p>	Illnesses which occur by reason of physical causes should be treated
 by doctors with medical remedies; those which are due to spiritual 
causes disappear through spiritual means. Thus an illness caused by 
affliction, fear, nervous impressions, will be healed more effectively 
by spiritual rather than by physical treatment. Hence, both kinds of 
treatment should be followed; they are not contradictory. Therefore thou
 shouldst also accept physical remedies inasmuch as these too have come 
from the mercy and favour of God, Who hath revealed and made manifest 
medical science so that His servants may profit from this kind of 
treatment also. Thou shouldst give equal attention to spiritual 
treatments, for they produce marvellous effects.</p>
<p>	Now, if thou wishest to know the true remedy which will heal man 
from all sickness and will give him the health of the divine kingdom, 
know that it is the precepts and teachings of God. Focus thine attention
 upon them.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec 133, pp. 151-52)</p>
<p>	1036. O thou who art attracted to the fragrant breathings of God! I 
have read thy letter addressed to Mrs. Lua Getsinger. Thou hast indeed 
examined with great care the reasons for the incursion of disease into 
the human body. It is certainly the case that sins are a potent cause of
 physical ailments. If humankind were free from the defilements of sin 
and waywardness, and lived according to a natural, inborn equilibrium, 
without following wherever their passions led, it is undeniable that 
diseases would no longer take the ascendant, nor diversify with such 
intensity.</p>
<p>	But man hath perversely continued to serve his lustful appetites, 
and he would not content himself with simple foods. Rather, he prepared 
for himself food that was compounded of many ingredients, of substances 
differing one from the other. With this, and with the perpetrating of 
vile and ignoble acts, his attention was engrossed, and he abandoned the
 temperance and moderation of a natural way of life. The result was the 
engendering of diseases both violent and diverse.<br>

</p><p>	For the animal, as to its body, is made up of the same 
constituent elements as man. Since, however, the animal contenteth 
itself with simple foods and striveth not to indulge its importunate 
urges to any great degree, and committeth no sins, its ailments relative
 to man's are few. We see clearly, therefore, how powerful are sin and 
contumacy as pathogenic factors. And once engendered these diseases 
become compounded, multiply, and are transmitted to others. Such are the
 spiritual, inner causes of sickness.</p>
<p>	The outer, physical causal factor in disease, however, is a 
disturbance in the balance, the proportionate equilibrium of all those 
elements of which the human body is composed. To illustrate: the body of
 man is a compound of many constituent substances, each component being 
present in a prescribed amount, contributing to the essential 
equilibrium of the whole. So long as these constituents remain in their 
due proportion, according to the natural balance of the whole -- that 
is, no component suffereth a change in its natural proportionate degree 
and balance, no component being either augmented or decreased -- there 
will be no physical cause for the incursion of disease.</p>
<p>	For example, the starch component must be present to a given amount,
 and the sugar to a given amount. So long as each remaineth in its 
natural proportion to the whole, there will be no cause for the onset of
 disease. When, however, these constituents vary as to their natural and
 due amounts -- that is, when they are augmented or diminished -- it is 
certain that this will provide for the inroads of disease.</p>
<p>	This question requireth the most careful investigation. The Bab hath
 said that the people of Baha must develop the science of medicine to 
such a high degree that they will heal illnesses by means of foods. The 
basic reason for this is that if, in some component substance of the 
human body, an imbalance should occur, altering its correct, relative 
proportion to the whole, this fact will inevitably result in the onset 
of disease. If, for example, the starch component should be unduly 
augmented, or the sugar component decreased, an illness will take 
control. It is the function of a skilled physician to determine which 
constituent of his patient's body hath suffered diminution, which hath 
been augmented. Once he hath discovered this, he must prescribe a food 
containing the diminished element in considerable amounts, to re- 
establish the body's essential<br>
 equilibrium. The patient, once his constitution is again in balance, will be rid of his disease.</p>
<p>	The proof of this is that while other animals have never studied 
medical science, nor carried on researches into diseases or medicines, 
treatments or cures -- even so, when one of them falleth a prey to 
sickness, nature leadeth it, in fields or desert places, to the very 
plant which, once eaten, will rid the animal of its disease. The 
explanation is that if, as an example, the sugar component in the 
animal's body hath decreased, according to a natural law the animal 
hankereth after a herb that is rich in sugar. Then, by a natural urge, 
which is the appetite, among a thousand different varieties of plants 
across the field, the animal will discover and consume that herb which 
containeth a sugar component in large amounts. Thus the essential 
balance of the substances composing its body is re-established, and the 
animal is rid of its disease.</p>
<p>	This question requireth the most careful investigation. When 
highly-skilled physicians shall fully examine this matter, thoroughly 
and perseveringly, it will be clearly seen that the incursion of disease
 is due to a disturbance in the relative amounts of the body's component
 substances, and that treatment consisteth in adjusting these relative 
amounts, and that this can be apprehended and made possible by means of 
foods.</p>
<p>	It is certain that in this wonderful new age the development of 
medical science will lead to the doctors' healing their patients with 
foods. For the sense of sight, the sense of hearing, of taste, of smell,
 of touch -- all these are discriminative faculties, their purpose being
 to separate the beneficial from whatever causeth harm. Now, is it 
possible that man's sense of smell, the sense that differentiates 
odours, should find some odour repugnant, and that odour be beneficial 
to the human body? Absurd! Impossible! In the same way, could the human 
body, through the faculty of sight -- the differentiator among things 
visible -- benefit from gazing upon a revolting mass of excrement? 
Never! Again, if the sense of taste, likewise a faculty that selecteth 
and rejecteth, be offended by something, that thing is certainly not 
beneficial; and if, at the outset, it may yield some advantage, in the 
long run its harmfulness will be established.</p>
<p>	And likewise, when the constitution is in a state of equilibrium, 
there is no doubt that whatever is relished will be beneficial to 
health. Observe<br>
 how an animal will graze in a field where there are a hundred thousand 
kinds of herbs and grasses, and how, with its sense of smell, it 
snuffeth up the odours of the plants, and tasteth them with its sense of
 taste; then it consumeth whatever herb is pleasurable to these senses, 
and benefitteth therefrom. Were it not for this power of selectivity, 
the animals would all be dead in a single day; for there are a great 
many poisonous plants, and animals know nothing of the pharmacopoeia. 
And yet, observe what a reliable set of scales they have, by means of 
which to differentiate the good from the injurious. Whatever constituent
 of their body hath decreased, they can rehabilitate by seeking out and 
consuming some plant that hath an abundant store of that diminished 
element; and thus the equilibrium of their bodily components is re- 
established, and they are rid of their disease.</p>
<p>	At whatever time highly-skilled physicians shall have developed the 
healing of illnesses by means of foods, and shall make provision for 
simple foods, and shall prohibit humankind from living as slaves to 
their lustful appetites, it is certain that the incidence of chronic and
 diversified illnesses will abate, and the general health of all mankind
 will be much improved. This is destined to come about. In the same way,
 in the character, the conduct and the manners of men, universal 
modifications will be made.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu 'l-Baha", sec. 134, pp. 152-156)</p>
<p>	1037. According to the explicit decree of Baha'u'llah one must not 
turn aside from the advice of a competent doctor. It is imperative to 
consult one even if the patient himself be a well-known and eminent 
physician. In short, the point is that you should maintain your health 
by consulting a highly-skilled physician.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec 135, p. 156)</p>
<p>	1038. It is incumbent upon everyone to seek medical treatment and to
 follow the doctor's instructions, for this is in compliance with the 
divine ordinance, but, in reality, He Who giveth healing is God.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec 136, p. 156)</p>
<p>	1039. O handmaid of God! The prayers which were revealed to ask for 
healing apply both to physical and spiritual healing. Recite them, then,<br>
 to heal both the soul and the body. If healing is right for the 
patient, it will certainly be granted; but for some ailing persons, 
healing would only be the cause of other ills, and therefore wisdom doth
 not permit an affirmative answer to the prayer.</p>
<p>	O handmaid of God! The power of the Holy Spirit healeth both physical and spiritual ailments.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec 139, pp. 161-62)</p>
<p>	1040. ...every branch of learning, conjoined with the love of God, 
is approved and worthy of praise; but bereft of His love, learning is 
barren -- indeed, it bringeth on madness. Every kind of knowledge, every
 science, is as a tree: if the fruit of it be the love of God, then is 
it a blessed tree, but if not, that tree is but dried-up wood, and shall
 only feed the fire.</p>
<p>	O thou loyal servant of God and thou spiritual healer of man! 
Whensoever thou dost attend a patient, turn thy face toward the Lord of 
the heavenly Kingdom, ask the Holy Spirit to come to thine aid, then 
heal thou the sickness.</p>
<p>	("Selections from the Writings of 'Abdu'l-Baha", sec 154, p. 181)</p>
<p>	1041. ...if a doctor consoles a sick man by saying, "Thank God you 
are better, and there is hope of your recovery," though these words are 
contrary to the truth, yet they may become the consolation of the 
patient and the turning point of the illness. This is not blameworthy.</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", 1st pocket-sized ed. Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1984), pp. 215-16)</p>
<p>	1042. If the health and well-being of the body be expended in the 
path of the Kingdom, this is very acceptable and praiseworthy; and if it
 be expended to the benefit of the human world in general -- even though
 it be to their material benefit -- and be a means of doing good, that 
is also acceptable. But if the health and welfare of man be spent in 
sensual desires, in a life on the animal plane, and in devilish pursuits
 -- then disease were better than such health; nay, death itself were 
preferable to such a life. If thou art desirous of health, wish thou 
health for serving the Kingdom. I hope that thou mayest attain perfect 
insight, inflexible resolution, complete health, and spiritual and 
physical strength in order<br>
 that thou mayest drink from the fountain of eternal life and be assisted by the spirit of divine confirmation.</p>
<p>	(Cited in Baha'u'llah and the New Era", pp. 114-15)</p>
<p>	1043. I ever pray on her behalf and beg from God His divine remedy 
and healing. As in this Dispensation consultation with expert doctors is
 highly advisable and acting in accordance with their prescriptions 
obligatory, it is well for her to undergo an operation if deemed 
necessary by such doctors.</p>
<p>	(Cited in "Star of the West", vol. 12, no. 7 July 1921), p. 134)</p>
<p>	1044. Therefore, it is evident that this spirit is different from 
the body, and that the bird is different from the cage, and that the 
power and penetration of the spirit is stronger without the intermediary
 of the body. Now, if the instrument is abandoned, the possessor of the 
instrument continues to act. For example, if the pen is abandoned or 
broken, the writer remains living and present; if a house is ruined, the
 owner is alive and existing. This is one of the logical evidences for 
the immortality of the soul.</p>
<p>	There is another: this body becomes weak or heavy or sick, or it 
finds health; it becomes tired or rested; sometimes the hand or leg is 
amputated, or its physical power is crippled; it becomes blind or deaf 
or dumb; its limbs may become paralyzed; briefly, the body may have all 
the imperfections. Nevertheless, the spirit in its original state, in 
its own spiritual perception, will be eternal and perpetual; it neither 
finds any imperfection, nor will it become crippled. But when the body 
is wholly subjected to disease and misfortune, it is deprived of the 
bounty of the spirit, like a mirror which, when it becomes broken or 
dirty or dusty, cannot reflect the rays of the sun nor any longer show 
its bounties.</p>
<p>	We have already explained that the spirit of man is not in the body 
because it is freed and sanctified from entrance and exit, which are 
bodily conditions. The connection of the spirit with the body is like 
that of the sun with the mirror. Briefly, the human spirit is in one 
condition. It neither becomes ill from the diseases of the body nor 
cured by its health; it does not become sick, nor weak, nor miserable, 
nor poor, nor light, nor small -- that is to say, it will not be injured
 because of the infirmities of the body, and no effect will be visible 
even if the body becomes weak, or<br>
 if the hands and feet and tongue be cut off, or if it loses the power 
of hearing or sight. Therefore, it is evident and certain that the 
spirit is different from the body, and that its duration is independent 
of that of the body; on the contrary, the spirit with the utmost 
greatness rules in the world of the body; and its power and influence, 
like the bounty of the sun in the mirror, are apparent and visible. But 
when the mirror becomes dusty or breaks, it will cease to reflect the 
rays of the sun.</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", pp. 228-29)</p>
<p>	1045. Question. -- Some people heal the sick by spiritual means -- that is to say, without medicine. How is this?</p>
<p>	Answer. -- Know that there are four kinds of curing and healing 
without medicine. Two are due to material causes, and two to spiritual 
causes.</p>
<p>	Of the two kinds of material healing, one is due to the fact that in
 man both health and sickness are contagious. The contagion of disease 
is violent and rapid, while that of health is extremely weak and slow. 
If two bodies are brought into contact with each other, it is certain 
that microbic particles will pass from one to the other. In the same way
 that disease is transferred from one body to another with rapid and 
strong contagion, it may be that the strong health of a healthy man will
 alleviate a very slight malady in a sick person. That is to say, the 
contagion of disease is violent and has a rapid effect, while that of 
health is very slow and has a small effect, and it is only in very 
slight diseases that it has even this small effect. The strong power of a
 healthy body can overcome a slight weakness of a sick body, and health 
results. This is one kind of healing.</p>
<p>	The other kind of healing without medicine is through the magnetic 
force which acts from one body on another and becomes the cause of cure.
 This force also has only a slight effect. Sometimes one can benefit a 
sick person by placing one's hand upon his head or upon his heart. Why? 
Because of the effect of the magnetism, and of the mental impression 
made upon the sick person, which causes the disease to vanish. But this 
effect is also very slight and weak.</p>
<p>	Of the two other kinds of healing which are spiritual -- that is to 
say, where the means of cure is a spiritual power -- one results from 
the entire concentration of the mind of a strong person upon a sick 
person, when the latter expects with all his concentrated faith that a 
cure will be effected<br>
 from the spiritual power of the strong person, to such an extent that 
there will be a cordial connection between the strong person and the 
invalid. The strong person makes every effort to cure the sick patient, 
and the sick patient is then sure of receiving a cure. From the effect 
of these mental impressions an excitement of the nerves is produced, and
 this impression and this excitement of the nerves will become the cause
 of the recovery of the sick person. So when a sick person has a strong 
desire and intense hope for something and hears suddenly the tidings of 
its realization, a nervous excitement is produced which will make the 
malady entirely disappear. In the same way, if a cause of terror 
suddenly occurs, perhaps an excitement may be produced in the nerves of a
 strong person which will immediately cause a malady. The cause of the 
sickness will be no material thing, for that person has not eaten 
anything, and nothing harmful has touched him; the excitement of the 
nerves is then the only cause of the illness. In the same way the sudden
 realization of a chief desire will give such joy that the nerves will 
be excited by it, and this excitement may produce health.</p>
<p>	To conclude, the complete and perfect connection between the 
spiritual doctor and the sick person -- that is, a connection of such a 
kind that the spiritual doctor entirely concentrates himself, and all 
the attention of the sick person is given to the spiritual doctor from 
whom he expects to realize health -- causes an excitement of the nerves,
 and health is produced. But all this has effect only to a certain 
extent, and that not always. For if someone is afflicted with a very 
violent disease, or is wounded, these means will not remove the disease 
nor close and heal the wound -- that is to say, these means have no 
power in severe maladies, unless the constitution helps, because a 
strong constitution often overcomes disease. This is the third kind of 
healing.</p>
<p>	But the fourth kind of healing is produced through the power of the 
Holy Spirit. This does not depend on contact, nor on sight, nor upon 
presence; it is not dependent upon any condition. Whether the disease be
 light or severe, whether there be a contact of bodies or not, whether a
 personal connection be established between the sick person and the 
healer or not, this healing takes place through the power of the Holy 
Spirit.</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", pp. 254-256)<br>

</p><p>	1046. Yesterday at table we spoke of curative treatment and 
spiritual healing, which consists in treating maladies through the 
spiritual powers.</p>
<p>	Now let us speak of material healing. The science of medicine is 
still in a condition of infancy; it has not reached maturity. But when 
it has reached this point, cures will be performed by things which are 
not repulsive to the smell and taste of man -- that is to say, by 
aliments, fruits and vegetables which are agreeable to the taste and 
have an agreeable smell. For the provoking cause of disease -- that is 
to say, the cause of the entrance of disease into the human body -- is 
either a physical one or is the effect of excitement of the nerves.</p>
<p>	But the principal causes of disease are physical, for the human body
 is composed of numerous elements, but in the measure of an especial 
equilibrium. As long as this equilibrium is maintained, man is preserved
 from disease; but if this essential balance, which is the pivot of the 
constitution, is disturbed, the constitution is disordered, and disease 
will supervene.</p>
<p>	For instance, there is a decrease in one of the constituent 
ingredients of the body of man, and in another there is an increase; so 
the proportion of the equilibrium is disturbed, and disease occurs. For 
example, one ingredient must be one thousand grams in weight, and 
another five grams, in order that the equilibrium be maintained. The 
part which is one thousand grams diminishes to seven hundred grams, and 
that which is five grams augments until the measure of the equilibrium 
is disturbed; then disease occurs. When by remedies and treatments the 
equilibrium is reestablished, the disease is banished. So if the sugar 
constituent increases, the health is impaired; and when the doctor 
forbids sweet and starchy foods, the sugar constituent diminishes, the 
equilibrium is reestablished, and the disease is driven off. Now the 
readjustment of these constituents of the human body is obtained by two 
means -- either by medicines or by aliments; and when the constitution 
has recovered its equilibrium, disease is banished. All the elements 
that are combined in man exist also in vegetables; therefore, if one of 
the constituents which compose the body of man diminishes, and he 
partakes of foods in which there is much of that diminished constituent,
 then the equilibrium will be established, and a cure will be obtained. 
So long as the aim is the readjustment of the constituents of the body, 
it can be effected either by medicine or by food.<br>

</p><p>	The majority of the diseases which overtake man also overtake 
the animal, but the animal is not cured by drugs. In the mountains, as 
in the wilderness, the animal's physician is the power of taste and 
smell. The sick animal smells the plants that grow in the wilderness; he
 eats those that are sweet and fragrant to his smell and taste, and is 
cured. The cause of his healing is this. When the sugar ingredient has 
become diminished in his constitution, he begins to long for sweet 
things; therefore, he eats an herb with a sweet taste, for nature urges 
and guides him; its smell and taste please him, and he eats it. The 
sugar ingredient in his nature will be increased, and health will be 
restored.</p>
<p>	It is, therefore, evident that it is possible to cure by foods, 
aliments and fruits; but as today the science of medicine is imperfect, 
this fact is not yet fully grasped. When the science of medicine reaches
 perfection, treatment will be given by foods, aliments, fragrant fruits
 and vegetables, and by various waters, hot and cold in temperature. 
This discourse is brief; but, if God wills, at another time, when the 
occasion is suitable, this question will be more fully explained.</p>
<p>	("Some Answered Questions", pp. 257-59)</p>
<p>	1047. We should all visit the sick. When they are in sorrow and 
suffering, it is a real help and benefit to have a friend come. 
Happiness is a great healer to those who are ill. In the East it is the 
custom to call upon the patient often and meet him individually. The 
people in the East show the utmost kindness and compassion to the sick 
and suffering. This has greater effect than the remedy itself. You must 
always have this thought of love and affection when you visit the ailing
 and afflicted.</p>

<p>	1048. All true healing comes from God! There are two causes for 
sickness, one is material, the other spiritual. If the sickness is of 
the body, a material remedy is needed, if of the soul, a spiritual 
remedy.</p>
<p>	If the heavenly benediction be upon us while we are being healed 
then only can we be made whole, for medicine is but the outward and 
visible means through which we obtain the heavenly healing. Unless the<br>
 spirit be healed, the cure of the body is worth nothing. All is in the 
hands of God, and without Him there can be no health in us!</p>
<p>	There have been many men who have died at last of the very disease 
of which they have made a special study. Aristotle, for instance, who 
made a special study of the digestion, died of a gastronomic malady. 
Aviseu was a specialist of the heart, but he died of heart disease. God 
is the great compassionate Physician who alone has the power to give 
true healing.</p>

gently, tenderly, free from prejudice and believing in the solidarity of
 the human race, he is giving praise.</p>
<p>	("Paris Talks: Addresses given by 'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris in 1911-1912", p. 177)</p>
<p>	1051. The healing that is by the power of the Holy Spirit needs no 
special concentration or contact. It is through the wish or desire and 
the prayer of the holy person. The one who is sick may be in the East 
and the healer in the West, and they may not have been acquainted with 
each other, but as soon as that holy person turns his heart to God and 
begins to pray, the sick one is healed. This is a gift belonging to the 
Holy Manifestations and those who are in the highest station.</p>
<p>	(Cited in "Baha'u'llah and the New Era" p. 109)</p>
<p>	1052. "What will be the food of the future?" "Fruit and grains. The 
time will come when meat will no longer be eaten. Medical science is 
only in its infancy, yet it has shown that our natural diet is that 
which grows out of the ground. The people will gradually develop up to 
the condition of this natural food."</p>
<p>	(Julia M. Grundy. "Ten Days in the Light of 'Akka", rev. ed. (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1979), pp. 8-9)<br>

</p><p>	EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF SHOGHI EFFENDI</p>
<p>	(The following are from letters to individual believers unless otherwise stated)</p>
<p>	1053. In regard to the question as to whether people ought to kill 
animals for food or not, there is no explicit statement in the Baha'i 
Sacred Scriptures (as far as I know) in favour or against it. It is 
certain, however, that if man can live on a purely vegetarian diet and 
thus avoid killing animals, it would be much preferable. This is, 
however, a very controversial question and the Baha'is are free to 
express their views on it.</p>
<p>	(9 July 1931)</p>
<p>	1054. 'Abdu'l-Baha does often state that the medical science will 
much improve. With the appearance of every Revelation a new insight is 
created in man and this in turn expresses itself in the growth of 
science. This has happened in past dispensations and we find its 
earliest fruits in our present day. What we see however is only the 
beginning. With the spiritual awakening of man this force will develop 
and marvelous results will become manifest.</p>
<p>	(14 January 1932 to two believers)</p>
<p>	1055. Baha'u'llah tells us that in case of disease we should pray 
but at the same time refer to competent physicians, and abide by their 
considered decision. Shoghi Effendi wishes you therefore to find whether
 your son has really become ill, and if he is, then follow the 
directions of the doctor. Being versed in the medical sciences they can 
treat better than even a loving mother can. You can render your 
assistance by praying for him and at the same time helping the 
physicians to treat him.</p>
<p>	(9 April 1933)</p>
<p>	1056. In the "Book of Aqdas" Baha'u'llah urges us that when we 
obtain any physical ailment we should refer to the doctor and abide by 
his decision. Physical and spiritual forces have both to be used to 
secure the speedy recovery of the patients; no partial treatment is 
sufficient....</p>
<p>	(1 June 1933)<br>

</p><p>	1057. Healing through purely spiritual forces is undoubtedly as 
inadequate as that which materialist physicians and thinkers vainly seek
 to obtain by resorting entirely to mechanical devices and methods. The 
best result can be obtained by combining the two processes: spiritual 
and physical.</p>
<p>	(12 March 1934)</p>
<p>	1058. With regard to your question concerning spiritual healing: 
Such a healing constitutes, indeed, one of the most effective methods of
 relieving a person from either his mental or physical pains and 
sufferings. 'Abdu'l-Baha has in His "Paris Talks" emphasized its 
importance by stating that it should be used as an essential means for 
effecting a complete physical cure. Spiritual healing, however, is not 
and cannot be a substitute for material healing, but it is a most 
valuable adjunct to it. Both are, indeed, essential and complementary.</p>
<p>	(16 February 1935)</p>
<p>	1059. With reference to your question concerning spiritual healing: 
Its importance, as you surely know, has been greatly emphasized by 
'Abdu'l-Baha, Who considered it, indeed, as an essential part of 
physical processes of healing. Physical healing cannot be complete and 
lasting unless it is reinforced by spiritual healing. And this last one 
can be best obtained through obedience to the laws and commandments of 
God as revealed to us through His Manifestations. Individual believers, 
however, can also help by imparting healing to others. But the success 
of their efforts depends entirely on their strict adherence to the 
Teachings, and also on the manner in which they impart them to others. 
According to Baha'u'llah man cannot obtain full guidance directly from 
God. He must rather seek it through His Prophets. Provided this 
principle is clearly understood and explained, the Guardian sees no harm
 that the friends should try to effect spiritual healing in others. Any 
such cure effected, however, should be done in the name of Baha'u'llah 
and in accordance with His teachings. For God, and God alone, is the 
Supreme and Almighty Physician, and all else are but instruments in His 
hands.</p>
<p>	(23 May 1935)</p>
<p>	1060. As to your question concerning the meaning of physical 
suffering and its relation to mental and spiritual healing: Physical 
pain is a necessary<br>
 accompaniment of all human existence, and as such is unavoidable. As 
long as there will be life on earth, there will be also suffering, in 
various forms and degrees. But suffering, although an inescapable 
reality, can nevertheless be utilized as a means for the attainment of 
happiness. This is the interpretation given to it by all the Prophets 
and saints, who, in the midst of severe tests and trials, felt happy and
 joyous and experienced what is best and holiest in life. Suffering is 
both a reminder and a guide. It stimulates us to better adapt ourselves 
to our environmental conditions, and thus leads the way to self- 
improvement. In every suffering one can find a meaning and a wisdom. But
 it is not always easy to find the secret of that wisdom. It is 
sometimes only when all our suffering has passed that we become aware of
 its usefulness. What man considers to be evil turns often to be a cause
 of infinite blessings. And this is due to his desire to know more than 
he can. God's wisdom is, indeed, inscrutable to us all, and it is no use
 pushing too far trying to discover that which shall always remain a 
mystery to our mind.</p>
<p>	(29 May 1935)</p>
<p>	1061. Regarding your questions concerning the condition of the soul 
during illness: The passages in the "Gleanings" make it quite clear that
 physical ailments, no matter how severe, cannot bring any change in the
 inherent condition of the soul. As Baha'u'llah says: "The spirit is 
permanent and steadfast in its station".[1] The veil or hindrance that 
interposes between soul and body during physical disease is sickness 
itself. Sickness reveals a lack of balance in the human organism, an 
absence of equilibrium in the forces essential for the normal 
functioning of the human body.<br>
 [1 The words quoted here are from a translation appearing in Baha'i 
Scriptures  p. 228. The passage as translated by Shoghi Effendi appears 
in Gleanings  section LXXX, as follows: "...the soul itself remaineth 
unaffected by any bodily ailments."]</p>
<p>	(8 March 1936)</p>
<p>	1062. As to your question regarding the possibility of an artificial
 production of life by means of an incubator: this is essentially a 
matter that concerns science, and as such should be investigated and 
studied by scientists.</p>
<p>	(31 December 1937)<br>

</p><p>	1063. As to the possibility of conception without the presence 
of a male sperm in the future: this is a question which lies entirely 
within the province of science, and which future scientists will have to
 investigate.</p>
<p>	(27 February 1938)</p>
<p>	1064. The Teachings bear no reference to the question of telepathy. It is a matter that concerns psychology.</p>
<p>	(28 February 1938)</p>
<p>	1065. The eating of pork is not forbidden in the Baha'i Teachings.</p>
<p>	(27 March 1938)</p>
<p>	1066. These investigations you have so painstakingly pursued in the 
field of medical science, and on a subject which is still puzzling the 
minds of all the leading scientists in the world, cannot but be of a 
captivating interest and of a great value to all medical research 
workers.</p>
<p>	It is significant that you as a believer should have undertaken a 
work of this nature, as we all know that the powers released by the 
Manifestation of Baha'u'llah in this day are destined in the course of 
time to reveal themselves through the instrumentality of His followers, 
and in every conceivable field of human endeavour.</p>
<p>	That you should increasingly prove, through your continued 
researches in the domain of medicine, to be one of those instruments is 
the fervent hope of our beloved Guardian....</p>
<p>	(29 November 1938)</p>
<p>	1067. Such hindrances, no matter how severe and insuperable they may
 at first seem, can and should be effectively overcome through the 
combined and sustained power of prayer and of determined and continued 
effort....</p>
<p>	(6 February 1939)</p>
<p>	1068. The Baha'i Teachings do not only encourage marital life, 
considering it the natural and normal way of existence for every sane, 
healthy and socially- conscious and responsible person, but raise 
marriage to the status of a divine institution, its chief and sacred 
purpose being the perpetuation of the human race -- which is the very 
flower of the entire creation -- and its elevation to the true station 
destined for it by God.<br>

</p><p>	That there should be, however, certain individuals who by reason
 of some serious deficiency, physical or mental, would be incapacitated 
to contract marriage and enjoy the blessings of an enduring and 
successful marital life is only too evident, but these constitute only a
 very small section of humanity, and are therefore merely an exception, 
and their condition cannot possibly invalidate what an all-wise and 
loving Providence has decreed to be the normal way to a fruitful and 
constructive social existence.</p>
<p>	The exact conditions and circumstances under which such 
incapacitated individuals should be advised or even prevented perhaps 
from entering into any sort of marital existence have not been specified
 in the Baha'i Writings, but will have to be defined later on by the 
Universal House of Justice. In the mean time, those believers who 
consider themselves as falling into the above category would do well, 
before taking any final decision themselves, to consult medical experts,
 who are both conscientious and competent, and to abide by their 
recommendation.</p>
<p>	(15 April 1939)</p>
<p>	1069. Also with regard to the practice of circumcision; the 
Teachings bear no reference to this matter, and it is therefore not 
enjoined upon the believers.</p>
<p>	(14 December 1940 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1070. Regarding your question about vaccination: these are technical
 matters which have not been specifically mentioned in the teachings, 
and consequently the Guardian cannot make any statement about them. No 
doubt medical science will progress tremendously as time goes by, and 
the treatment of disease become more perfect.</p>
<p>	(22 January 1944)</p>
<p>	1071. As to your question about healing: although there is no 
objection to your helping others to regain their health, he does not 
feel you should associate the name Baha'i with your work, as it gives a 
wrong impression; we have no "Baha'i healers" as Christian Science and 
various other sects have. You are a Baha'i and a healer, and that is 
quite different.</p>
<p>	(13 December 1945)<br>

</p><p>	1072. The Tablet to a Physician was addressed to a man who was a
 student of the old type of healing prevalent in the East and familiar 
with the terminology used in those days, and He addresses him in terms 
used by the medical men of those days. These terms are quite different 
from those used by modern medicine, and one would have to have a deep 
knowledge of this former school of medicine to understand the questions 
Baha'u'llah was elucidating.</p>
<p>	The Guardian never goes into technical matters, as this is not his 
work. Baha'u'llah has recommended that people seek the help and advice 
of experts and doctors; He does not say which school they should belong 
to.</p>
<p>	Likewise there is nothing in the teachings about whether people 
should eat their food cooked or raw; exercise or not exercise; resort to
 specific therapies or not; nor is it forbidden to eat meat.</p>
<p>	Baha'u'llah says teaching is the greatest of all services, but He does not mean one should give up medicine to teach.</p>
<p>	(18 December 1945)</p>
<p>	1073. The greatest form of healing which the Baha'is can practice is
 to heal the spiritually sick souls of men by giving this greatest of 
all Messages to them. We can also try to help them, both physically and 
spiritually, through prayer.</p>
<p>	(25 March 1946)</p>
<p>	1074. There is nothing in the teachings which would forbid a Baha'i 
to bequeath his eyes to another person or for a Hospital; on the 
contrary it seems a noble thing to do.</p>
<p>	(6 September 1946)</p>
<p>	1075. He feels you should certainly think of your future and earning
 your living, and if chiropractic is the work you wish to go in for, you
 should continue your education; when you are finished it would be 
highly meritorious to enter the pioneer field, as for many years to come
 Baha'i teachers will be needed in distant lands.</p>
<p>	(31 March 1947)<br>

</p><p>	1076. ...you should not neglect your health, but consider it the
 means which enables you to serve. It -- the body -- is like a horse 
which carries the personality and spirit, and as such should be well 
cared for so it can do its work! You should certainly safeguard your 
nerves, and force yourself to take time, and not only for prayer and 
meditation, but for real rest and relaxation....</p>
<p>	(23 November 1947)</p>
<p>	1077. Very little is as yet known about the mind and its workings. 
But one thing is certain: Baha'is can and do receive a very remarkable 
help and protection in this world, one which often surprises their 
doctors very much!</p>
<p>	(9 April 1948)</p>
<p>	1078. The Guardian knows nothing about your kind of healing, nor 
would he care to go into the question in detail, as he has no time for 
such matters. But he can lay down for your guidance certain broad 
principles: there is no such thing as Baha'i healers or a Baha'i type of
 healing. In His Most Holy Book (the Aqdas) Baha'u'llah says to consult 
the best physicians, in other words doctors who have studied a 
scientific system of medicine; He never gave us to believe He Himself 
would heal us through 'healers', but rather through prayer and the 
assistance of medicine and approved treatments.</p>
<p>	Now, as long as your healing is in no opposition to these 
principles, as long as you do not try and take the place of a regular 
doctor in trying to heal others, but only give them your kind of help 
through constructive suggestion -- or whatever it may be -- and do not 
associate this help with being a channel of the direct grace of 
Baha'u'llah, the Guardian sees no harm in your continuing your 
assistance to others. But you must conscientiously decide whether in 
view of the above you are really justified in continuing. He will pray 
for your guidance and happiness.</p>
<p>	(8 June 1948)</p>
<p>	1079. He does not feel that you should try to do anything special 
about the capacity you feel to help people when they are ill. This does 
not mean you should not use it, when the occasion arises, such as it did
 recently. But he<br>
 means you should not become a "healer" such as the Christian Scientists have, and we Baha'is do not have.</p>
<p>	(25 December 1949)</p>
<p>	1080. We have no reason to believe that the healing of the Holy 
Spirit cannot be attracted by ordinary human beings. But this is rare, a
 mystery, and a gift of God.</p>
<p>	(26 March 1950)</p>
<p>	1081. There is nothing in our teachings about Freud and his method. 
Psychiatric treatment in general is no doubt an important contribution 
to medicine, but we must believe it is still a growing rather than a 
perfected science. As Baha'u'llah has urged us to avail ourselves of the
 help of good physicians Baha'is are certainly not only free to turn to 
psychiatry for assistance but should, when advisable, do so. This does 
not mean psychiatrists are always wise or always right, it means we are 
free to avail ourselves of the best medicine has to offer us.</p>
<p>	(15 June 1950 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the British Isles)</p>
<p>	1082. ...as we are a religion and not qualified to pass on 
scientific matters we cannot sponsor different treatments. We are 
certainly free to pass on what we have found beneficial to others.</p>
<p>	(30 September 1950)</p>
<p>	1083. The Guardian sees no reason why you should not continue to 
help sick people. As he wrote some of the believers regarding this 
matter previously, as long as you do not say you are healing them as a 
Baha'i, or because you are a Baha'i (because we have no "healers" in the
 Cause as such) there can be certainly no objection to your doing it. On
 the contrary, to be able to help another soul who is in suffering is a 
great bounty from God.</p>
<p>	(5 October 1950)</p>
<p>	1084. There is nothing in the Teachings about chiropractic as a 
method of healing. People are free to turn to it if they please and find
 help through it.</p>
<p>	(10 February 1951)<br>

</p><p>	1085. Regarding your question: there are very few people who can
 get along without eight hours sleep. If you are not one of those, you 
should protect your health by sleeping enough. The Guardian himself 
finds that it impairs his working capacity if he does not try and get a 
minimum of seven or eight hours.</p>
<p>	(15 September 1951 to two believers)</p>
<p>	1086. There is nothing in the teachings about Socialized Medicine. All these details are for the House of Justice to decide.</p>
<p>	(18 February 1951)</p>
<p>	1087. Every day medical science is progressing, and it is quite 
possible that some new form of treatment or some new doctor may be able 
to get you on your feet. He will certainly pray that this may be so.</p>
<p>	(24 February 1952)</p>
<p>	1088. So you see he cannot possibly pronounce on the merits of 
Dianetics. The believers are free to investigate new things, and use 
them if they prove of real value and no harm.</p>
<p>	(30 August 1952)</p>
<p>1089. He was sorry to hear you have been ill, and urges<br>
you to cooperate fully with your doctors in order to<br>
regain your health as soon as possible and be free to<br>
serve the Cause. (19 July 1953)</p>
<p>	1090. The beloved Guardian says that the question of circumcision 
has nothing to do with the Baha'i Teachings; and the believers are free 
to do as they please in the matter.</p>
<p>	(27 March 1954)</p>
<p>	1091. He is pleased to see that you are feeling better, and will 
certainly pray for your full recovery. Before having any serious 
operation, you should consult more than one qualified physician.</p>
<p>	(8 April 1954)<br>

</p><p>	1092. Regarding various matters raised in your letters: There is
 nothing in the Teachings to prevent a Baha'i from willing his body for 
medical research after death. However, it should be made clear that the 
remains must be buried eventually and not cremated, as this is according
 to Baha'i law.</p>
<p>	(26 June 1956 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada)</p>
<p>	1093. There is nothing in the Teachings against leaving our bodies 
to medical science. The only thing we should stipulate is that we do not
 wish to be cremated, as it is against our Baha'i Laws.</p>
<p>	As many people make arrangements to leave their bodies to medical 
science for investigation, he suggests that you inquire, either through 
some lawyer friend or through some hospital, how you could do this, and 
then make the necessary provision in your will, stipulating that you 
wish your body be of service to mankind in death, and that, being a 
Baha'i, you request that your remains not be cremated and not be taken 
more than an hour's journey from the place you die.</p>
<p>	The spirit has no more connection with the body after it departs, 
but, as the body was once the temple of the spirit, we Baha'is are 
taught that it must be treated with respect.</p>
<p>	(22 March 1957)</p>
<p>	EXTRACTS OF LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE</p>
<p>	(The following are from letters to individual believers unless otherwise stated)</p>
<p>	1094. One of the friends of Persia wrote to Shoghi Effendi and asked
 this question: "Is it true that 'Abdu'l-Baha has said that biochemical 
homeopathy, which is a form of food medicine, is in conformity with the 
Baha'i medical concept?" The beloved Guardian's reply to this question 
in a letter dated 25th November, 1944 was as follows: "This statement is
 true, and the truth thereof will be revealed in the future."</p>
<p>	(The question and answer are translated from the Persian.)</p>
<p>	The Universal House of Justice has also asked us to inform you that 
it does not wish the above statement to be circulated in isolation from 
the many and varied other texts in the Writings on medicine. However, 
you may share it with any of your friends who are interested.</p>
<p>	(12 November 1975)<br>

</p><p>	1095. No specific school of nutrition or medicine has been 
associated with the Baha'i teachings. What we have are certain 
guidelines, indications and principles which will be carefully studied 
by experts and will, in the years ahead, undoubtedly prove to be 
invaluable sources of guidance and inspiration in the development of 
these medical sciences. Moreover, in this connection the Guardian's 
secretary has stated on his behalf that "It is premature to try and 
elaborate on the few general references to health and medicine made in 
our Holy Scriptures." The believers must guard against seizing upon any 
particular text which may appeal to them and which they may only 
partially or even incorrectly understand....</p>
<p>	In the Kitab-i-Aqdas Baha'u'llah has stated: </p>
<p>	"Whenever ye fall ill, refer to competent physicians. Verily, We 
have not abolished recourse to material means, rather have We affirmed 
it through this Pen which God hath made the Dawning Place of His 
luminous and resplendent Cause." The secretaries of the Guardian have 
conveyed his guidance on this point in many letters to individual 
believers in passages such as these: "...refer to competent physicians, 
and abide by their considered decisions"; "...invariably consult and 
follow the treatment of competent and conscientious physicians..." and 
"...consult the best physicians ... doctors who have studied a 
scientific system of medicine." Thus the obligation to consult 
physicians and to distinguish between doctors who are well trained in 
medical sciences and those who are not is clear, but the Faith should 
not be associated with any particular school of medical theory or 
practice. It is left to each believer to decide for himself which 
doctors he should consult, bearing in mind the principles enunciated 
above.</p>
<p>	In matters of diet, as in medicine, the Universal House of Justice 
feels that the believers should be aware that a huge body of scientific 
knowledge has been accumulated as a guide to our habits and practices. 
Here too, as in all other things, the believers should be conscious of 
the two principles of moderation and courtesy in the way they express 
their opinions and in deciding whether they should refuse food offered 
to them or request special foods.<br>

</p><p>	There are, of course, instances where a believer would be fully 
justified in abstaining from or eating only certain foods for some 
medical reason, but this is a different matter and would be understood 
by any reasonable person.</p>
<p>	(24 January 1977)</p>
<p>	1096. In matters of health, particularly regarding diet and 
nutrition, the House of Justice advises the friends to seek the help and
 advice of experts and doctors. This is what Baha'u'llah has recommended
 and He does not indicate which school of thought or practice they 
should belong to. However, as you particularly ask about references in 
the Old Testament as they relate to meat and fish, the House of Justice 
has asked us to quote for you the following excerpt taken from a letter 
written on behalf of the beloved Guardian by his secretary to an 
individual believer:</p>
<p>	"...there is nothing in the teachings about whether people should 
eat their food cooked or raw; exercise or not exercise; resort to 
specific therapies or not; nor is it forbidden to eat meat."</p>
<p>	(19 June 1977)</p>
<p>	1097. The Universal House of Justice has received your letter of 
19th January 1978 enquiring the Baha'i point of view on the vivisection 
of animals. The beloved Guardian was asked a similar question to which 
his secretary replied on his behalf, on 29 November 1955: "As there is 
no definite and conclusive statement on Vivisection in the Baha'i 
Teachings, this is a matter which the International House of Justice 
will have to pass upon in the future."</p>
<p>	The House of Justice does not wish to legislate upon this matter at 
the present time. It is left to the consciences of the individual 
friends, who should make their decisions in light of the teachings 
concerning animals and their treatment.</p>
<p>	In this connection the House of Justice instructs us to say that in a
 Tablet in which He stresses the need for kindness to animals, 
'Abdu'l-Baha states that it would be permissible to perform an operation
 on a living animal for the purposes of research even if the animal were
 killed thereby, but that the animal must be well anaesthetized and that
 the utmost care must be exercised that it does not suffer.</p>
<p>	(9 March 1978 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Italy)<br>

</p><p>	1098. In matters of diet, as in medicine, the Universal House of
 Justice feels that the believers should be aware that a huge body of 
scientific knowledge has been accumulated as a guide to our habits and 
practices. But it must be clearly understood that no specific school of 
nutrition or medicine has been associated with the Baha'i teachings. 
What we have are certain guidelines, indications and principles which 
will be carefully studied by experts and will, in the years ahead, 
undoubtedly prove to be invaluable sources of guidance and inspiration 
in the development of these medical sciences. Moreover, in this 
connection the Guardian's secretary has stated on his behalf that "It is
 premature to try and elaborate on the few general references to health 
and medicine made in our Holy Scriptures."</p>
<p>	The believers must guard against seizing upon any particular text 
which may appeal to them and which they may only partially or even in 
correctly understand.</p>

<p>	Revised July 1990<br>

</p><p>	I. EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF BAHA'U'LLAH [1]<br>
 [1 All passages are extracts from previously untranslated Tablets.]</p>
<p>	1099. O Zayn! Upon thee be My glory and My loving- kindness. Nothing
 that existeth in the world of being hath ever been or ever will be 
worthy of mention. However, if a person be graciously favoured to offer a
 penny-worth -- nay even less -- in the path of God, this would in His 
sight be preferable and superior to all the treasures of the earth. It 
is for this reason that the one true God -- exalted be His glory -- hath
 in all his heavenly Scriptures praised those who observe His precepts 
and bestow their wealth for His sake. Beseech ye God that He may enable 
everyone to discharge the obligation of Huquq, inasmuch as the progress 
and promotion of the cause of God depend on material means. If His 
faithful servants could realize how meritorious are benevolent deeds in 
these days, they would all arise to do that which is meet and seemly. In
 His hand is the source of authority and He ordaineth as He willeth. He 
is the Supreme Ruler, the Bountiful, the Equitable the Revealer, the 
All-Wise.</p>
<p>	1100. The one true God -- exalted be His glory -- hath ever been and
 will continue to be exalted above every expression of praise and is 
sanctified from the world of existence and all the riches therein. 
Whatsoever proceedeth from Him produceth a fruit the benefits of which 
revert to the individuals themselves. Ere long will they perceive the 
truth of that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered aforetime and 
will utter hereafter. And such benefits will indeed accrue if the Huquq 
is offered with the utmost joy and radiance and in the spirit of perfect
 humility and lowliness.</p>
<p>	1101. Entreat thou the one true God to enable his faithful servants 
fulfil that which is conducive to the good of this world and the world 
to come. This is the commandment of God that hath been prescribed in His
 weighty and inviolable Book. Today is the Day of God when the 
preservation of the dignity of His Cause must be given precedence over 
all other things. He ordaineth that which will confer benefit on all 
mankind. Verily He is the Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. In this 
connection the Pen of Glory hath revealed that which will enable every<br>
 man of perception to inhale the fragrance of His loving- kindness and 
bounty. In truth the benefits arising from the above-mentioned 
injunction revert to the individuals themselves. Unto this every 
discerning one that observeth His precepts will bear witness.</p>
<p>	1102. It is incumbent upon everyone to discharge the obligation of 
Huquq. The advantages gained from this deed revert to the persons 
themselves. However the acceptance of the offerings dependeth on the 
spirit of joy, fellowship and contentment that the righteous souls who 
fulfil this injunction will manifest. If such is the attitude acceptance
 is permissible, and not otherwise. Verify thy Lord is the 
All-Sufficing, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>	1103. O Zayn! Such souls as comply with the injunction of God 
prescribed in the Book are regarded as most excellent in the same 
estimation of God. There can be no doubt whatsoever is revealed from the
 heaven of divine commandment is by virtue of His wisdom and is in the 
best interests of the people themselves. Moreover, although these 
insignificant amounts are not worthy of mention, they are well pleasing,
 since the donors offer them for the sake of God. If the offering be but
 a single grain it is regarded as the crowning glory of all the harvests
 of the world.</p>
<p>	1104. It is clear and evident that the payment of the Right of God 
is conducive to prosperity, to blessing, and to honour and divine 
protection. Well is it with them that comprehend and recognize this 
truth and woe betide them that believe not. And this is on condition 
that the individual should observe the injunctions prescribed in the 
Book with the utmost radiance, gladness and willing acquiescence. It 
behoveth you to counsel the friends to do that which is right and 
praiseworthy. Whoso hearkeneth to this call, it is to his own behoof, 
and whoso faileth bringeth loss upon himself. Verily our Lord of Mercy 
is the All-Sufficing, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>	1105. Huququ'llah is indeed a great law. It is incumbent upon all to
 make this offering, because it is the source of grace, abundance, and 
of all good. It is a bounty which shall remain with every soul in every 
world of the worlds of God, the All-Possessing, the All-Bountiful.<br>

</p><p>	1106. As to the question of Huquq: Reference to this matter is 
in no wise permissible. We have formerly enjoined upon you and 
Jinab-i-Amin that which will redound to the glory and dignity of the 
Word of God and of His Cause. Touching on this particular subject We 
have bidden thus: Ye may relinquish the whole world but must not allow 
the detraction of even one jot or tittle from the dignity of the Cause 
of God. Jinab-i-Amin -- upon him be My glory -- must also refrain from 
mentioning this matter, for it is entirely dependent upon the 
willingness of the individuals themselves. They are well acquainted with
 the commandment of God and are familiar with that which was revealed in
 the Book. Let him who wisheth observe it, and let him who wisheth 
ignore it. Verily, thy Lord is the Self-Sufficing, the All-Praised. 
Indeed, independence of all things is a door of guidance unto His 
faithful servants. Well is it with them that have severed themselves 
from the world and have arisen to serve His Cause. Verily, they are 
numbered with the people of Baha at the court of His resplendent Beauty.</p>
<p>1107. O Abu'l Hasan:[1]<br>
 [1  Known as Jinab-i-Amin, Trustee of the Huquq in the days of Baha'u'llah.]</p>
<p>	May my Glory rest upon thee! Fix thy gaze upon the glory of the 
Cause. Speak forth that which will attract the hearts and the minds. To 
demand the Huquq is in no wise permissible. This command was revealed in
 the Book of God for various necessary matters ordained by God to be 
dependent upon material means. Therefore, if someone, with utmost 
pleasure and gladness, nay with insistence, wisheth to partake of this 
blessing, thou mayest accept. Otherwise, acceptance is not permissible.</p>
<p>	1108. Should a person acquire one hundred mithqals[1] of gold, 
nineteen mithqals thereof belong unto God, the Creator of earth and 
heaven. Take heed, O people, lest ye deprive yourselves of this great 
bounty. We have prescribed this law unto you while We are wholly 
independent of you and of all that are in the heavens and on the earth. 
Indeed there lie concealed in this command, mysteries and benefits which
 are beyond the comprehension of anyone save God, the All-Knowing, the 
All-Informed. Say, through this injunction God desireth to purify your 
possessions and<br>
 enable you to draw nigh unto such stations as none can attain, except 
those whom God may please. Verily, He is the Generous, the Gracious, the
 Bountiful.<br>
 [1 See section 105]</p>
<p>	O people! Act not treacherously in the matter of Huququ'llah and 
dispose not of it, except by His leave. Thus hath it been ordained in 
His Epistles as well as in this glorious Tablet.</p>
<p>	Whoso dealeth dishonestly with God will in justice be exposed, and 
whoso fulfilleth the things he hath been commanded, divine blessings 
will descend upon him from the heaven of the bounty of his Lord, the 
Bestower, the Bountiful, the Most Generous, the Ancient of Days. Verily 
He desireth for you the things that are inscrutable to you at present, 
though the people themselves will readily discover them when their souls
 take their flight and the trappings of their earthly gaieties are 
rolled up. Thus warneth you the Author of the Preserved tablet.</p>
<p>	1109. Question: Payment of Huququ'llah hath been revealed in the 
Aqdas. Are the residence, its appendages and necessary furniture among 
those possessions on which the Huquq is payable?</p>
<p>	Answer: It hath been said in the Laws revealed in Persian: "... in 
this most great Dispensation We have exempted the residence and the 
household furnishings, that is, such furnishings as are needful."</p>
<p>	1110. Question: Is Huququ'llah payable on such equipment of a store 
as is necessary for the carrying on of business or is such equipment 
treated as are the household furnishings?</p>
<p>	Answer: It is under the same ruling as the household furnishings.</p>
<p>	1111. Question: If the deceased hath left the Huquq or his debts 
unpaid, shall payment be made proportionately from his residence, 
personal clothing and other property or are the residence and personal 
clothing set apart for the male off-spring and shall the debts be paid 
out of remaining property; if such property is insufficient, what shall 
be done with the debts?</p>
<p>	Answer: The debts of Huquq shall be paid out of the remaining 
property; should the property be insufficient, payment shall be made out
 of the residence and personal clothing.<br>

</p><p>	1112. Question: It hath been revealed in the divine Tablets that
 if a person acquireth the equivalent of nineteen mithqals of gold, he 
must pay the Right of God on that sum. How much of that sum shall be 
paid?</p>
<p>	Answer: God hath commanded that nineteen be paid out of every 
hundred. This should be the basis of computation. The sum due on 
nineteen can then be determined.</p>
<p>	1113. Question: When the possessions exceed nineteen, must they 
equal another nineteen before the Huquq is again payable, or is the 
Huquq due on any exceeding sum?</p>
<p>	Answer: The Huquq is not payable on any exceeding sum, unless it reacheth another nineteen.</p>
<p>	1114. Question: If a person hath, for example, one hundred 
tumans,[1] payeth the Huquq on this, loseth half the sum in unsuccessful
 transactions and then regaineth the amount on which the Huquq is 
payable, must he offer the Huquq or not?<br>
 [1 Tuman is a Persian unit of currency.]</p>
<p>	Answer: In such an event the Huquq is not payable.</p>
<p>	1115. Question: If, after payment of the Huquq, the original sum is 
entirely lost, and then in the course of business transactions it is 
regained, must the Huquq be paid a second time?</p>
<p>	Answer: In this event as well the Huquq is not payable.</p>
<p>	1116. The minimum amount subject to Huququ'llah is reached when 
one's possessions are worth the number of Vahid (19); that is, whenever 
one owneth 19 mithqals of gold, or acquireth possessions attaining this 
value, after having deducted therefrom the yearly expenses, the Huquq 
becometh applicable and its payment is obligatory.</p>
<p>	1117. As to the question thou has asked concerning the minimum 
amount of property on which Huquq is payable, this was mentioned in His 
exalted and glorious presence and the following is what the Tongue of 
Grandeur uttered in reply: This matter was revealed in the Most Holy 
Book in conformity with the pronouncement in the Bayan. Later, however, 
as a<br>
 token of wisdom on Our part, We laid down the ruling whereby the 
minimum amount of property liable to the payment of Huquq is fixed at 
Nineteen. The purpose underlying this law is to ensure that the General 
Treasury is strengthened in the future. Further details may be furnished
 later.</p>
<p>	1118. According to that which is revealed in the Most Holy Book, 
Huququ'llah is fixed at the rate of 19 mithqals out of every 100 
mithqals worth of gold. This applies to possessions in gold, in silver 
or other properties.</p>
<p>	Moreover certain rights have been fixed for the House of Justice. 
However before its establishment and the appearance of its members, the 
appropriation of such funds is and will be subject to the approval of 
Him Who is the Eternal Truth. Beseech ye God -- exalted be His glory -- 
to enable the people to honour the obligation of Huquq, for had everyone
 perceived the advantage of such a deed and desisted from withholding 
the right of God, the friends in that region would not have experienced 
any hardship.</p>
<p>	1119. Question: May a person designate in his will certain of his 
properties to be spent after his death for charitable purposes, apart 
from the Huquq and his other obligations; or hath he no right to 
anything except the expenses of enshrouding, transportation and burial, 
and is everything else for the inheritors as commanded by God?</p>
<p>	Answer: A person is free in the disposition of his possessions. If 
he hath paid the Huquq and is not in debt to others, whatever he writeth
 in his will and testifieth to is acceptable. God hath permitted him to 
do as he willeth with what God hath bestowed on him.</p>
<p>	1120. A number of people in various regions are at present illumined
 with the light of faith, but with the exception of a few, they have not
 been privileged as yet to observe the injunctions revealed from His 
presence.</p>
<p>	Previously We wrote to thee[1] that had the friends there observed 
the payment of Huququ'llah, the people of that region would have enjoyed
 ease and comfort. Before this law was revealed there was no obligation 
on<br>
 the part of any soul. The Pen of Glory held back from revealing laws 
and ordinances for a number of years, and this was a token of His 
heavenly grace. Were the people of the world to recognize what 
inestimable benefits the ordinances of the All-Merciful would bring 
forth, they would arise to fulfil His commandments and would observe His
 bidding ...<br>
 [1 Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin]</p>
<p>	The Pen of the Most High hath ordained that the Huququ'llah is 
payable on nineteen mithqals of gold. That is, the Huquq is levied on 
money equalling this amount. As to other possessions in silver or 
otherwise, it is payable when they equal this in value, not in number. 
The Huququ'llah is payable only once; for example if a person acquireth a
 thousand mithqals in gold and payeth the Huquq thereof, the Right of 
God ceaseth to be applicable to that amount, except in regard to what 
accrueth to it through commerce and transactions; when such profits 
reach the prescribed minimum, one must carry out what God hath decreed. 
When, however, the original sum changeth hands, the Huquq is again 
payable as it was the first time; in this event the Right of God must be
 given.</p>
<p>	Beseech ye God -- magnified be His glory -- to grant that His loved 
ones may be privileged to take a portion from the ocean of His 
good-pleasure, for this would serve as the means for the salvation of 
mankind, and may of their own accordance carry out that which would 
purify them and cause them to attain everlasting life ...</p>
<p>	The Primal Point hath said that they should pay Huququ'llah on the 
value of whatsoever they possess, but notwithstanding, We have in this 
greatest Dispensation exempted the residence and household furnishings; 
that is, such furnishings as are needful.</p>
<p>	Thou has asked which is to take precedence: the Huququ'llah, the 
debts of the deceased, or the cost of burial. It is God's command that 
the cost of burial take precedence, then payment of debts, then the 
Right of God. Verily He is the One Who will pay due recompense, the All-
 Rewarding, the All-Generous. If the property is not equal to the debts,
 the estate must be distributed in direct proportion to each debt. The 
settlement of debts is a most important command set forth in the Book. 
Well is it with him who ascendeth unto God, without any obligations to 
Huququ'llah and to His servants. It is evident that the Huququ'llah hath
 priority over all other liabilities; however, as a token of mercy, He 
Who is<br>
 the Dawning-Place of Revelation hath commanded that which hath been 
revealed by His life-giving and omniscient Pen in this Tablet.</p>
<p>	1121. It hath been decreed by God that a property which is not 
lucrative, that is, yieldeth no profit, is not subject to the payment of
 Huquq. Verily He is the Ordainer, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>	1122. The payment of the Right of God is conditional upon one's 
financial ability. If a person is unable to meet his obligation, God 
will verily excuse him. He is the All- Forgiving, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>	1123. This is the Book of Generosity which hath been revealed by the
 King of Eternity. Whoso adorneth himself with this virtue hath 
distinguished himself and will be blessed by the All-Merciful from His 
exalted Kingdom of Glory. However, despite his high rank and prominent 
position, were he to pass beyond the limits, he would be regarded among 
the prodigal by the All-Knowing, the All- Wise. Cling ye unto 
moderation. This is the commandment that He Who is the All-Possessing, 
the Most High hath enjoined upon you in His Generous Book. O ye that are
 the exponents of generosity and the manifestations thereof! Be generous
 unto them whom ye find in manifest poverty. O ye that are possessed of 
riches! Take heed lest outward appearance deter you from benevolent 
deeds in the path of God, the Lord of all mankind.</p>
<p>	Say: I swear by God! No one is despised in the sight of the Almighty
 for being poor. Rather is he exalted, if he is found to be of them who 
are patient. Blessed are the poor that are steadfast in patience, and 
woe betide the rich that hold back Huququ'llah and fail to observe that 
which is enjoined upon them in His Preserved Tablet. Say: Pride not 
yourselves on earthly riches ye possess. Reflect upon your end and upon 
the recompense of your works that hath been ordained in the Book of God,
 the Exalted, the Mighty. Blessed is the rich man whom earthly 
possessions have been powerful to hinder from turning unto God, the Lord
 of all names. Verily he is accounted among the most distinguished of 
men before God, the Gracious, the All- Knowing.</p>
<p>	Say: The appointed Day is come. This is the Springtime of benevolent
 deeds, were ye of them that comprehend. Strive ye with all your might, O<br>
 people, that ye may bring forth that which will truly profit you in the worlds of your Lord, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>	Say: Hold ye fast unto praiseworthy characteristics and goodly deeds
 and be not of them that tarry. It behoveth everyone to cleave 
tenaciously unto that which is conducive to the exaltation of the Cause 
of God, your Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>	Say: Behold ye not the world, its changes and chances, and its 
varying colours? Wherefore are ye satisfied with it and with all the 
things therein? Open your eyes and be of them that are endued with 
insight. The day is fast approaching when all these things will have 
vanished as fast as the lightning, nay even faster. Unto this beareth 
witness the Lord of the Kingdom in this wondrous Tablet. Wert thou to be
 enraptured by the uplifting ecstasy of the verses of God, thou wouldst 
yield thanks unto thy Lord and say: "Praise be unto Thee, O Desire of 
the hearts of them that hasten to meet Thee!" Rejoice then with 
exceeding gladness, inasmuch as the Pen of Glory hath turned unto thee 
and hath revealed in thy honour that which the tongues of creation and 
the tongues of transcendence are powerless to describe.</p>
<p>	1124. They that have kept their promises, fulfilled their 
obligations, redeemed their pledges and vows, rendered the Trust of God 
and His Right unto Him -- these are numbered among the inmates of the 
all-highest Paradise. Thus from His mighty Prison doth the Wronged One 
announce unto them this glad-tiding. Blessed are the servants and 
maidservants that have performed their deeds and blessed is the man that
 hath cleaved tenaciously unto praiseworthy acts and fulfilled that 
which is enjoined upon him in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>	1125. For a number of years Huquq was not accepted. How numerous the
 offerings that on reaching Our presence were returned to the donors, 
because they were not needed then. However in recent years We have, in 
view of the exigencies of the times, accepted the payment of the Huquq, 
but have forbidden solicitation thereof. Everyone must have the utmost 
regard for the dignity of the Word of God and for the exaltation of His 
Cause. Were a person to offer all the treasures of the earth at the cost
 of debasing the honour of the Cause of God, were it even less than a 
grain of mustard, such an offering would not be permissible. All the 
world hath<br>
 belonged and will always belong to God. If one spontaneously offereth 
Huquq with the utmost joy and radiance it will be acceptable, and not 
otherwise. The benefit of such deeds reverteth unto the individuals 
themselves. This measure hath been ordained in view of the necessity for
 material means, for "averse is God from putting aught into effect 
through its means." Thus instructions were given to receive the Huquq.</p>
<p>	1126. Well is it with those who have met their obligations in 
respect of the Right of God and observed that which is prescribed in the
 Book ... This payment of Huquq is conclusively established in the Book 
of God, yet for a number of years it had been forbidden to receive it. 
Later, however, in view of certain considerations and in order to 
arrange some essential matters, permission was granted to accept such 
payments. Verily He is the Ordainer, the Compassionate, the Forgiving, 
the Bountiful.</p>
<p>	1127. As to the Huququ'llah: This is the source of blessings, and 
the mainspring of God's loving-kindness and tender love vouchsafed unto 
men. Verily He can dispense with whatsoever hath been and will be. Until
 two years ago the matter of Huquq was undisclosed. When it was revealed
 it was by virtue of His grace. If a person be privileged to fulfil that
 which is prescribed in the Most Holy Book, it would assuredly be better
 for him, and to his greater behoof. However the observation of this 
injunction dependeth upon one's circumstances. Verily He speaketh the 
truth and guideth aright.</p>
<p>	1128. Thou has written concerning the minimum amount of property on 
which Huququ'llah is payable. This is as set forth to 
Jinab-i-Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin -- upon him be the glory of the Most 
Glorious. The minimum sum liable to Huquq is based on the number 
Nineteen, in accordance with the text of the blessed, the Most Holy 
Book. Therein reference is made to the amount of Huquq payable and not 
to the minimum sum on which Huquq falls due. Verily, He is the Expounder
 both in the Beginning and in the End. Until the present year no mention
 had been made regarding the Huququ'llah. To wit, this servant[1] had 
never heard a single word uttered by the Tongue of Holiness as being<br>
 indicative of payment of Huquq. However in this year.[2] His binding 
decree hath been put into effect and His commandment hath shone forth 
above the horizon of divine Revelation. Thus whosoever is willing to 
offer Huququ'llah spontaneously and in a spirit of radiant acquiescence 
it would be graciously accepted.<br>
 [1 The amanuensis of Huququ'llah]<br>
 [2 1295 A.H. -- 1878 A.D.]</p>
<p>	The Trustees should receive these offerings and, as instructed, 
notify His Holy Presence. Although the Most Holy Book had been revealed 
some years ago with the injunction concerning the Right of God clearly 
set forth therein, nevertheless the permission authorizing receipt of 
Huquq was not granted until this year. Verily He is the Ordainer, the 
Omnipotent, the Gracious, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>	1129. Thine intention to pay a visit to the blessed House is 
acceptable and well-pleasing in the sight of this Wronged One, provided 
it is accomplished in a spirit of joy and radiance and would not prove 
contrary to the dictates of wisdom.</p>
<p>	Say: O people, the first duty is to recognize the one true God -- 
magnified be his Glory -- the second is to show forth constancy in His 
Cause and, after these, one's duty is to purify one's riches and earthly
 possessions according to that which is prescribed by God. Therefore it 
beseemeth thee to meet thine obligation to the Right of God first, then 
to direct thy steps toward His blessed House. This hath been brought to 
thine attention as a sign of favour.</p>
<p>	1130. Whoso is privileged to pay the Right of God will be numbered 
with such as have observed the ordinances of the one true God -- 
magnified be His glory -- and have fulfilled that which is set down by 
the All-Glorious Pen.</p>
<p>	Time and again have We written and commanded that no one should 
solicit such payment. The offering of every person that voluntarily 
tendereth the Huququ'llah with the utmost joy and pleasure may be 
accepted, otherwise acceptance was not and is not permissible. Those 
that are oblivious of their duty should be briefly reminded. Deeds must 
be performed with willingness and in all circumstances high regard must 
be given to the dignity of the Cause of God. Formerly We have mentioned<br>
 that were a person to possess the whole world and would tender his 
possessions at the cost of degrading the honour of the Cause, even to 
the extent of a grain of mustard, it would be essential and imperative 
to refuse to accept such wealth. Such is the Cause of God, eternal in 
the past, eternal in the future. Well is it with them that act 
accordingly.</p>
<p>	The ordinance prescribing the payment of Huquq is but a favour 
vouchsafed by the one true God -- exalted be His glory -- and the 
benefits arising therefrom shall fall to the donors themselves. It 
behoveth all to render thanks unto God, the Most Exalted, Who hath 
graciously enabled them to meet the obligation of Huquq. We held back 
the Pen for a long period during which no instruction was issued in this
 respect, until such time as the requirements of His inscrutable wisdom 
demanded the acceptance of Huquq. "Averse is God from putting aught into
 effect except through its means." It is essential for certain people to
 receive aid, and others need attention and care, but all this must take
 place by the leave of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>	1131. O thou that bearest My Name! God grant that everyone may be 
graciously aided to honour the Huquq. The Huquq is exclusively assigned 
unto Him Who is the sovereign Truth, but, as you are aware, there are at
 present many individuals diligently engaged in the service of the Cause
 in various regions, who are unable to earn their living. And inasmuch 
as God hath made the achievement of everything conditional upon material
 means, therefore the injunction prescribing payment of the Huquq hath 
been revealed from the heaven of His Will, and the blessings flowing 
from this deed shall fall to the donors themselves.</p>
<p>	1132. In this day it is incumbent upon everyone to serve the Cause 
of God, while He who is the Eternal Truth -- exalted be His glory -- 
hath made the fulfilment of every undertaking on earth dependent on 
material means. Hence it is enjoined upon every individual to offer that
 which is the Right of God.</p>
<p>	1133. If a person is willing to offer the Right of God, such 
offering should be received by the Trustees, to whom reference hath been
 made in the Book of God. This ordinance hath, in view of certain 
considerations, been revealed from the heaven of divine Revelation as a 
token of His grace.<br>
 The advantages arising therefrom shall fall to the individuals 
themselves. Verily He speaketh the truth and there is none other God but
 Him, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>	The Trustees are present in the land of Ya (Yazd). Whosoever 
desireth to fulfil that which is enjoined upon him in the Book may refer
 to them. Any amount received by them will be transmitted. Great is the 
blessedness of them that observe His bidding.</p>
<p>	1134. It is indeed a most excellent favour, a boundless grace 
vouchsafed unto whosoever is privileged in this day to render service to
 the Cause of God and to offer the Right of God, for its goodly results 
and the fruits thereof will last as long as the kingdom of earth and 
heaven will endure.</p>
<p>	1135. O Zayn! It behoveth thee to entreat God to graciously enable 
His faithful servants to meet the obligation of Huquq. The world is 
evanescent, and one's life fleeting. Therefore if one is privileged to 
offer that which is binding upon him, such an act hath ever been and 
will be nearer to piety and righteousness ... It is incumbent upon 
everyone to fulfil that which hath been set forth in the Book of God -- 
exalted be His glory.</p>
<p>	1136. The Right of God is an obligation upon everyone. This 
commandment hath been revealed and set down in the Book by the Pen of 
Glory. However, it is not permissible to solicit or demand it. If one is
 privileged to pay the Huquq, and doeth so in a spirit of joy and 
radiance, such an act is acceptable, and not otherwise. As a reminder to
 the friends, a general appeal should be made once at the meeting, and 
that should suffice. They that are assured, steadfast and endowed with 
insight will act spontaneously and observe what hath been prescribed by 
God, thereby reaping the benefit of their own deed. Verily, God is 
independent of all mankind.</p>
<p>	The people of God should not be grieved. By the righteousness of 
God, that which is destined for them is far beyond the power of 
reckoners to reckon.</p>
<p>	1137. Great God! In this glorious Dispensation the treasures laid up
 by kings and queens are not worthy of mention, nor will they be 
acceptable<br>
 in the presence of God. However, a grain of mustard offered by His 
loved ones will be extolled in the exalted court of His holiness and 
invested with the ornament of His acceptance. Immeasurably exalted is 
His bounty, immeasurably glorified is His majesty. And yet, when an 
offering was adorned with the glory of His acceptance and reported by 
Jinab-i-Amin, twice that amount was ordered to be paid out to the poor 
and the needy. Unto this beareth witness every fair-minded man of 
insight, and those that are truthful and trustworthy.</p>
<p>	1138. The benefits accruing from benevolent works shall fall to the 
individuals concerned. In such matters only a word would suffice. Should
 anyone offer Huquq with utmost joy and radiance, manifesting a spirit 
of resignation and content, his offering shall be acceptable before God,
 otherwise He can dispense with all the peoples of the earth ... Well is
 it with them that have fulfilled that which is prescribed in the Book 
of God. It is incumbent upon everyone to observe that which God hath 
purposed, for whatsoever hath been set forth in the Book by the Pen of 
Glory is an effective means for the purging, the purification and 
sanctification of the souls of men and the source of prosperity and 
blessing. Happy are they that have observed His commandments.</p>
<p>	Whenever they make reference to the Huquq, let them confine 
themselves to a mere word uttered for the sake of God and this will 
suffice; coercion is unnecessary, inasmuch as God hath never wished that
 those engaged in His service should experience any hardship. Verily He 
is the Forgiving, the Merciful, The Gracious, the All- Bountiful.... No 
goodly deed was or will ever be lost, for benevolent acts are treasures 
preserved with God for the benefit of those who act. Blessed the servant
 and the maidservant who have fulfilled their obligation in the path of 
God our Lord, the Lord of all worlds ... The Right of God must be paid 
whenever possible and should be offered in a spirit of joy and radiance.
 Those that are unable to pay will be invested with the ornament of His 
forgiveness.</p>
<p>	1139. In this day it is incumbent upon everyone to meet the 
obligation of the Right of God as far as it lieth in his power. For a 
number of years it was not permitted to accept the payment of Huquq. 
Recently, however, We have issued instructions to receive it. Therefore 
the friends in that region should, as far as possible, collect the 
payments, and remit the<br>
 amounts either to Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin -- upon him be the glory of God --
 in Hadba' (Mosul) or to the Trustee of God in the land of Ya (Yazd) who
 will forward them. The observance of this ordinance hath been and will 
always be conducive to prosperity, to divine increase and to salvation. 
Great is the blessedness of him who hath observed that which is 
prescribed in the Book of God, the Gracious, the Mighty.</p>
<p>	1140. And now concerning what thou has mentioned regarding the 
Huquq. This hath been ordained especially for the one true God -- 
exalted be His glory -- and should be forwarded to the court of His Holy
 Presence. In His grasp is the source of authority. He doeth what He 
pleaseth and ordaineth what He chooseth.</p>
<p>	Since thou hast enquired about this subject, the following answer was revealed from the heaven of His tender mercy:</p>
<p>	This ordinance is binding upon everyone, and by observing it one 
will be raised to honour inasmuch as it will serve to purify one's 
possessions and will impart blessing, and added prosperity. However, the
 people are as yet ignorant of its significance. They continually 
endeavour to amass riches by lawful or unlawful means in order to 
transmit them to their heirs, and this to what advantage, no one can 
tell. Say: In this day the true Heir is the Word of God, since the 
underlying purpose of inheritance is the preservation of the name and 
traces of men. It is indubitably clear that the passing of centuries and
 ages will obliterate these signs, while every word that hath streamed 
from the Pen of Glory in honour of a certain individual will last as 
long as the dominions of earth and heaven will endure.</p>
<p>	1141. If the people had not withheld the Right of God they owe but 
rather had paid what was due, or would pay it now, they could be 
recipients of God's loving-kindness. We entreat God to graciously grant 
them abundance.</p>
<p>	1142. This Huquq which hath been mentioned, and the command of which
 hath issued forth from the horizon of God's Holy Tablet, hath benefits 
which are the prescribed lot of the individuals themselves. By God! Were
 the people to know what hath been concealed from their eyes and become 
fully aware of the ocean of grace which lieth hid within this divine<br>
 command, all the people of the world would offer everything they 
possess in order to be mentioned by Him. Blessed is the man who hath 
been privileged to observe that which he hath been commanded by God, the
 All-Knowing, the All-Wise....</p>
<p>	As bidden by Him, no one is allowed to solicit payment of the Huquq.
 In the Book of God everyone is enjoined to offer the Huquq 
spontaneously and in a spirit of joy and fellowship. I beseech Him, the 
Most Exalted, to graciously enable everyone to do that which is pleasing
 and acceptable unto Him.</p>
<p>	And now concerning the poor, thou has written to ask whether it is 
permissible to pay them out of the Right of God. This is conditional 
upon permission having been granted. In each locality where the Right of
 God is being received, details of it must be submitted to His exalted 
presence together with a statement describing the position of the needy 
ones. Verily He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth. If
 permission were to be given universally it would lead to strife and 
give rise to trouble.</p>
<p>	1143. It is indubitably clear and evident that whatsoever hath been 
sent down from the heaven of divine commandment- -magnified be His glory
 -- is intended to confer benefits upon His servants. The question of 
Huquq is highly significant. It hath been and will always be conductive 
to divine increase, prosperity, dignity and honour.... It is obvious and
 manifest that the whole world is devoid of any real value. On numerous 
occasions -- and to this everyone here would testify -- large sums have 
been sent to His holy court but were not adorned with the ornament of 
His acceptance. At present, however, in view of the ingathering of the 
friends and the requirements of the time, payment of the Huquq is 
accepted. The object is to show that this acceptance is but a token of 
divine favour and a proof of His loving-kindness and tender compassion.</p>
<p>	1144. To discharge one's obligations is highly praiseworthy in the 
sight of God. However, it is not permitted to solicit Huquq from anyone.
 Beseech ye the one true God to enable His loved ones to offer that 
which is the Right of God, inasmuch as the observance of this injunction
 would cause one's possessions to be purified and protected and would 
become the means of attracting goodly gifts and heavenly blessings.<br>

</p><p>	1145. O Samandar! How many are the souls who with the utmost 
endeavour and effort, collect a handful of worldly goods and greatly 
rejoice in this act and yet in reality the Pen of the Most High hath 
decreed this wealth for others; that is, it is not meant to be their lot
 or it may even fall into the hands of their enemies! We seek shelter in
 God from such an evident loss. One's life is wasted; by day and by 
night, troubles are endured, and wealth becometh a source of affliction.
 Most of the wealth of men is not pure. Should they follow what is 
revealed by God, they would, in all circumstances, be protected under 
His bounty and blessed by His mercy.</p>
<p>	1146. There can be no doubt that whatsoever hath been revealed from 
the All-Glorious Pen, be it ordinances of prohibitions, conferreth 
benefits upon the believers themselves. For example, among the 
commandments is that of the Huququ'llah. If the people attain the 
privileges of paying the Huquq, the one true God, exalted by His glory, 
will of a certainty confer blessing upon them. Moreover, such payment 
will enable them and their offspring to benefit from their possessions. 
As thou dost observe, large portions of people's wealth are lost to them
 as God causeth strangers, or heirs in comparison with whom strangers 
would have been preferable, to lay hands on their possessions.</p>
<p>	God's consummate wisdom is far beyond any description or fitting 
mention. Verily, people see with their own eyes and yet deny; they are 
aware, yet they pretend not to know. Had they observed the ordinance of 
God they would have attained the good of this world and the next.</p>
<p>	1147. Someone must needs remind the servants of God, that perchance 
they may be privileged to meet their obligations of Huquq, thus 
attaining a sublime station and gaining a reward that would last for 
ever. The payments for the Huquq should be kept in the custody of a 
trusted person and a report submitted so that steps may be taken 
according to the good-pleasure of God.</p>
<p>	1148. The question of the Huquq dependeth on the willingness of the 
individuals themselves. From every true believer who is willing to 
tender the Right of God spontaneously and with the utmost joy and 
radiance, the offering is graciously accepted, but not otherwise. 
Verily, thy Lord is independent of all mankind. Consider that which the 
All-Merciful hath<br>
 revealed in the Qur'an: "O men! Ye are but paupers in need of God, but God is the Self-Sufficient, the All- Praised."[1]<br>
 [1 Qur'an 35:12]</p>
<p>	At all times one must have the utmost regard for the dignity and honour of the Cause of God.</p>
<p>	1149. No one should demand the Huququ'llah. Its payment should 
depend on the volition of the individuals themselves, namely such souls 
that are devout, faithful and well disposed, who would make their 
offerings of Huququ'llah in a spirit of willing submission and 
contentment.</p>
<p>	1150. It is not permissible to solicit [Huquq]. If anyone offereth 
something of his own volition, thou mayest accept it, but it is not 
thine to demand anything from anyone. Verily thy Lord is the 
All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>	1151. As to what thou hast written concerning the Right of God: The 
binding injunction of God is set forth in the Book, but this matter is 
conditional upon the willingness of the individual themselves; inasmuch 
as the one true God -- magnified be His glory -- hath, by reason of His 
all- encompassing mercy, acquainted everyone with that which is enjoined
 in the Book. Well is it with them that act accordingly.</p>
<p>	Demanding the Huquq hath never been regarded with favour. Every deed
 must be performed in a spirit of joy and radiance. If a person is 
willing to make his offering with utmost contentment, its acceptance is 
permissible, otherwise our merciful Lord is independent of all mankind. 
In this day one must observe that which is conductive to the glory, 
loftiness and exaltation of the Cause of God. Thus hath spoken the Lord 
of Truth, the knower of things unseen....</p>
<p>	O My friend! Were the people to perceive the sweetness of the 
commandments enjoined by God and to discover the benefits arising 
therefrom, they would certainly, one and all, carry them out with the 
utmost joy and eagerness. We entreat the one true God to aid everyone to
 observe that which is pleasing and acceptable unto Him. Verily, He is 
the Helper, the Confirmer, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>	It hath been enjoined that whatsoever the loved ones of God may 
offer as gifts for His holy court, should be treated as the donor 
wisheth, lest the<br>
 hearts of the faithful and the souls of the true believers be obscured 
by the dust of despondency and sorrow. But in the case of gifts that are
 offered as Huquq it is permissible to have them sold....</p>
<p>	At all times and under all conditions one must have high regard for 
the dignity of the Cause. Solicitation of Huquq is in no wise permitted.
 Whoso is willing to tender payments for Huquq with the utmost joy, 
radiance and good- pleasure, his offering may be accepted; otherwise God
 is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised.</p>
<p>	Consider that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur'an -- 
exalted in His Word: "Some of them injure themselves through evil deeds,
 others follow a middle course, and others vie with each other in 
charitable works".[1] Indeed any benefits arising from praiseworthy 
deeds shall fall to the individuals that have performed them. Were the 
people to comprehend this truth, they would compete with each other in 
benevolent works....<br>
 [1 Qur'an 35:32]</p>
<p>	Ye may relinquish the whole world, but must not forgo even one jot 
of the dignity of the Cause of God. Such is the divine exhortation that 
hath been inscribed in the Crimson Book by the Pen of the Most High. 
Well is it with them that accordingly....</p>
<p>	1152. It is the binding command of God that in every locality 
whatever hath been or will be made available for the Huququ'llah should 
be submitted to His holy presence. Any instructions issued in this 
respect should be observed accordingly, so that all matters may be 
well-ordered.</p>
<p>	It is highly pleasing if whatever is prescribed in the Most Holy 
Book be observed, so that everyone may be invested with the ornament of 
the purpose of the Best Beloved of the world.</p>
<p>	1153. There is no objection to offering for sale that which is 
donated in the name of Huquq. Thus proclaimeth the All-Glorious Pen from
 His noble habitation at the behest of the King of Eternity.</p>
<p>	1154. Whoso desireth to offer Huququ'llah with the utmost joy and 
eagerness should pay it to trustworthy persons like unto thyself[1] and 
obtain<br>
 a receipt, so that whatsoever is effected may conform to His sanction and permission. Verily He is Knowing, the Wise.<br>
 [1 Haji Abu'l-Hasan-i-Ardikani]</p>
<p>	1155. Thou has written that they have pledged themselves to observe 
maximum austerity in their lives with a view to forwarding the remainder
 of their income to His exalted presence. This matter was mentioned at 
His holy court. He said: Let them act with moderation and not impose 
hardship upon themselves. We would like them both to enjoy a life that 
is well-pleasing.</p>
<p>	1156. Payments for the Huququ'llah cannot be handed over to every 
person. These words have been uttered by Him Who is the sovereign Truth.
 The Huququ'llah should be kept in the custody of trusted individuals 
and forwarded to His holy court through the Trustees of God.</p>
<p>	1157. There is a prescribed ruling for the Huququ'llah. After the 
House of Justice hath come into being, the law thereof will be made 
manifest, in conformity with the Will of God.</p>
<p>	1158. Magnified art Thou, O Lord of the entire creation, the One 
unto Whom all things must turn. With my inner and outer tongues I bear 
witness that Thou hast manifested and revealed Thyself, sent down Thy 
signs, and proclaimed Thy testimonies. I testify to Thy self-sufficiency
 from aught else except Thee, and Thy sanctity above all earthly things.
 I entreat Thee by the transcendent glory of Thy Cause and the supreme 
potency of Thy Word to grant confirmation unto him who desireth to offer
 what Thou hast prescribed unto him in Thy Book and to observe that 
which will shed forth the fragrance of Thine acceptance. Verily Thou art
 the All-Mighty, the All-Gracious, the All- Forgiving, the All-Generous.</p>
<p>	II. EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA</p>
<p>	1159. As preordained by the Fountainhead of Creation, the temple of 
the world hath been fashioned after the image and likeness of the human 
body. In fact each mirroreth forth the image of the other, wert thou but
 to observe with discerning eyes. By this is meant that even as the 
human<br>
 body is this world which is outwardly composed of different limbs and 
organs, is in reality a closely integrated, coherent entity, similarly 
the structure of the physical world is like unto a single being whose 
limbs and members are inseparably linked together.</p>
<p>	Were one to observe with an eye that discovereth the realities of 
all things, it would become clear that the greatest relationship that 
bindeth the world of being together lieth in the range of created things
 themselves, and that co-operation, mutual aid and reciprocity are 
essential characteristics in the unified body of the world of being, 
inasmuch as all created things are closely related together and each is 
influenced by the other or deriveth benefit therefrom, either directly 
or indirectly.</p>
<p>	Consider for instance how one group of created things constituteth 
the vegetable kingdom, and another the animal kingdom. Each of these two
 maketh use of certain elements in the air on which its own life 
dependeth, while each increaseth the quantity of such elements as are 
essential for the life of the other. In other words, the growth and 
development of the vegetable world is impossible without the existence 
of the animal kingdom, and the maintenance of animal life is 
inconceivable without the co-operation of the vegetable kingdom. Of like
 kind are the relationships that exist among all created things. Hence 
it was stated that co-operation and reciprocity are essential properties
 which are inherent in the unified system of the world of existence, and
 without which the entire creation would be reduced to nothingness.</p>
<p>	In surveying the vast range of creation thou shalt perceive that the
 higher a kingdom of created things is on the arc of ascent, the more 
conspicuous are the signs and evidences of the truth that co-operation 
and reciprocity at the level of a higher order are greater than those 
that exist at the level of a lower order. For example the evident signs 
of this fundamental reality are more discernible in the vegetable 
kingdom than in the mineral, and still more manifest in the animal world
 than in the vegetable.</p>
<p>	And thus when contemplating the human world thou beholdest this 
wondrous phenomenon shining resplendent from all sides with the utmost 
perfection, inasmuch as in this station acts of co-operation, mutual 
assistance and reciprocity are not confined to the body and to things 
that pertain to the material world, but for all conditions, whether 
physical or<br>
 spiritual, such as those related to minds, thoughts, opinions, manners,
 customs, attitudes, understandings, feelings or other human 
susceptibilities. In all these thou shouldst find these binding 
relationships securely established. The more this inter-relationship is 
strengthened and expanded, the more will human society advance in 
progress and prosperity. Indeed without these vital ties it would be 
wholly impossible for the world of humanity to attain true felicity and 
success.</p>
<p>	Now consider, if among the people who are merely the manifestations 
of the world of being this significant matter is of such importance, how
 much greater must be the spirit of co-operation and mutual assistance 
among those who are the essences of the world of creation, who have 
sought the sheltering shadow of the heavenly Tree, and are favoured by 
the manifestations of divine grace; and how the evidences of this spirit
 should, through their earnest endeavour, their fellowship and concord, 
become manifest in every sphere of their inner and outer lives, in the 
realm of the spirit and divine mysteries and in all things related to 
this world and the next. Thus there can be no doubt that they must be 
willing even to offer up their lives for each other.</p>
<p>	This is the basic principle on which the institution of Huququ'llah 
is established, inasmuch as its proceeds are dedicated to the 
furtherance of these ends. Otherwise the one true God hath ever been and
 will always be independent of all else beside Him. Even as He hath 
enabled all created things to partake of His boundless grace and 
loving-kindness, likewise is He able to bestow riches upon His loved 
ones out of the treasuries of His power. However, the wisdom of this 
command is that the act of giving is well-pleasing in the sight of God. 
Consider how well-pleasing must this mighty act be in His estimation 
that He hath ascribed it unto His Own Self. Rejoice ye then, O people of
 generosity!</p>
<p>	We earnestly hope that in this Most Great Cycle the wondrous 
attributes of the All-Merciful may, through the infinite bounty and 
blessings of the King of Glory, find expression in the lives of the 
servants of God in such wise that the sweet savours thereof will shed 
fragrance upon all regions.</p>
<p>	This matter needeth further details, but We have treated it in brief.</p>
<p>	1160. O my heavenly friends! It is certain and evident that the 
Incomparable One is always praised for His absolute wealth, 
distinguished<br>
 for His all-embracing mercy, characterized by His eternal grace, and 
known for His gifts to the world of existence. Nonetheless, in 
accordance with His inscrutable wisdom and in order to apply a unique 
test to distinguish the friend from the stranger, He hath enjoined the 
Huquq upon His servants and made it obligatory.</p>
<p>	Those who have observed this weighty ordinance have received 
heavenly blessings and in both worlds their faces have shone radiantly 
and their nostrils perfumed by the sweet savours of God's tender mercy. 
One of the tokens of His consummate wisdom is that the payment of the 
Huquq will enable the donors to become firm and steadfast and will exert
 a great influence on their hearts and souls. Furthermore the Huquq will
 be used to charitable purposes.</p>
<p>	1161. O friends of 'Abdu'l-Baha! The Lord, as a sign of His infinite
 bounties, hath graciously favoured His servants by providing for a 
fixed money offering (Huquq), to be dutifully presented unto Him, though
 He, the True One and His servants have been at all times independent of
 all created things, and God verily is the All-Possessing, exalted above
 the need of any gift from His creatures. This fixed money offering, 
however, causeth the people to become firm and steadfast and draweth 
Divine increase upon them.</p>
<p>	(The Will &amp; Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha page 15)</p>
<p>	1162. As regards the Huquq which hath been explicitly prescribed in 
the Book: This is intended for the benefit and prosperity of the 
individuals themselves and is conducive to their happiness and 
constancy. Otherwise the one true God hath been and will always be 
self-sufficient in all things.</p>
<p>	1163. Thou has enquired about the Huquq. From one's annual income, 
all expenses during the year are deductible, and on what is left 19% is 
payable to the Huquq. Thus, a person hath earned 1,000 income out of his
 business. After deducting his annual expenses of say 600, he would have
 a surplus of 400 on which Huquq is payable at the rate of 19%. This 
would amount to 76 to be offered for charitable purposes to the Huquq.</p>
<p>	The Huquq is not levied on one's entire possessions each year. A 
person's wealth may be worth 100,000. How can he be expected to pay 
Huquq on this property every year? For instance, whatever income thou<br>
 hast earned in a particular year, you should deduct from it your 
expenses during that year. The Huquq will then be payable on the 
remainder. Possessions on which Huquq was paid the previous year will be
 exempt from further payment.</p>
<p>	1164. In brief, after having deducted the yearly expenses, if there 
is still any surplus left, then Huquq will be applicable to this surplus
 at the rate of 19% and no further payment of Huquq will fall due on it.
 In the following year however, after the annual expenses, if there is 
still an excess of income over the expenditure of that second year, then
 Huquq will be applicable to the amount of the excess only.</p>
<p>	1165. As to the Huquq, it is payable on whatever is left over after 
deducting one's yearly expenses. However, any money or possession which 
is necessary in producing income for one's subsistence, and on which 
Huquq hath once been paid is exempt from Huquq. This exemption also 
applieth to a property on which Huquq hath already been paid, and the 
income of which doth not exceed one's needs.... Disposition of the 
Huquq, wholly or partly, is permissible, but this should be done by 
permission of the authority in the Cause to whom all must turn.</p>
<p>	1166. Huquq is applied on everything one possesseth. However, if a 
person hath paid the Huquq on a certain property, and the income from 
that property is equal to his needs, no Huquq is payable by that person.
 Huquq is not payable on agricultural tools and equipment, and on 
animals used in ploughing the land, to the extent that these are 
necessary.</p>
<p>	1167. As to the way the Huquq must be paid: Having deducted the 
expenses incurred during the year, any excess of income derived from 
one's property, profession or business is subject to the payment of 
Huquq.</p>
<p>	1168. As to the question of Huquq: In no wise shouldst thou make 
statements requiring any person to pay the Huquq. However if a devoted 
and self-sacrificing soul freely and spontaneously offereth thee 
something in the name of Huquq or for the poor then thou mayest accept.<br>

</p><p>	1169. According to the explicit text of the Most Holy Book the 
amounts offered for the Huquq should be deposited in a place and be 
disbursed, as necessary. However, thou shouldst not require anyone there
 to offer the Huquq unless someone is prepared to do so willingly and of
 his own free choice.</p>
<p>	1170. The Blessed Beauty -- may my life be offered up for His Dust 
-- hath emphasized through His decisive Word that the utmost honesty 
hath to be observed in matters related to the Huquq. The institution of 
Huquq is sacred.</p>
<p>	1171. A third requisite [for them that take counsel together] is the
 promulgation of the divine commandments among the friends, such as the 
Obligatory Prayers, Fasting, Pilgrimage, Huququ'llah and all the other 
ordinances.</p>
<p>	1172. Since the loved ones of God in Persia are regarded as veteran 
friends, it is by virtue of the tremendous affection I cherish for them 
that their offerings for Huquq are accepted. They must rejoice 
exceedingly for having been invested with such a bounty.</p>
<p>	1173. Render thou thanks unto God, for He hath graciously enabled 
thee to observe the injunction set forth in His Most Holy Book, inasmuch
 as thou hast arisen to fulfil the obligation of Huquq, and God hath 
accepted thy goodly deed. Know thou, moreover, that those who faithfully
 serve the All-Merciful will be enriched by Him out of His heavenly 
treasury, and that the Huquq offering is but a test applied by Him unto 
His servants and maidservants. Thus every true and sincere believer will
 offer Huquq to be expended for the relief of the poor, the disabled, 
the needy, and the orphans, and for other vital needs of the Cause of 
God, even as Christ did establish a Fund for benevolent purposes.</p>
<p>	1174. It behoveth thee to render thanks unto God, inasmuch as He 
hath aided thee to fulfil the obligations of Huquq. This is a 
confirmation that God hath vouchsafed unto thee. Therefore yield thou 
praise unto Him<br>
 for the bounty of this divine ordinance which is prescribed in the 
Epistles of thy Lord, the Ancient of Days. Verily He is the Clement, the
 Bountiful.</p>
<p>	1175. As regards the donation thou hast offered as Huquq, We have 
received this as if it were a treasure, inasmuch as it was tendered with
 profound love and devotion. We shall use it soon for His Holy Shrine, 
that thy name may thereby be immortalized for ever.</p>
<p>	III. EXTRACTS FROM AN UTTERANCE OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA</p>
<p>	1176. Question: As to the matter of Huquq, does it mean 1/19th of 
one's net income or one's gross income? For example, in America, there 
is a tax on the gross income, after certain exemptions are made. How is 
the Huquq to be worked out? Answer:The substance of 'Abdu'l-Baha's 
explanation was: After one has paid all his necessary expenses 19% of 
what is left is then taken by him and given as Huquq. For example, if a 
person has 100 piastres left after all his expenses have been paid, then
 19 piastres are taken as Huquq for the Cause of God. This is done at 
the end of the year after he has ascertained what his expenses are. For 
every hundred piastres, 19 are taken for Huquq.</p>
<p>	He pays this once, then there is no more Huquq to be paid on that 
sum. It is finished. Next year he will pay on the amount he has left 
over in his possession after his expenses have been deducted, and after 
the amount he paid Huquq on the previous year is also deducted.</p>
<p>	For example, at the end of the first year a man who has 1000 
piastres left after all his expenses are paid, then 190 piastres are 
taken as Huquq: at the end of the next year after all expenses are 
determined, he may have 2000 piastres left. As he has already paid Huquq
 on 1000 piastres the previous year this sum is deducted from the 2000 
and he pays Huquq on 1000 piastres (or 190 piastres). The third year the
 net amount of what he owns may be 2500 piastres, he deducts 2000 
piastres from this amount and pays 19 per cent on 500 piastres or 95 
piastres. If at the end of the 4th year he has 2500 Piastres, no Huquq 
is taken.<br>

</p><p>	Question: In the deduction of our necessary expenses, are 
contributions to the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, teaching and other activities of
 the Cause considered a part of Huquq or should they be taken 
separately?</p>
<p>	Answer: 'Abdu'l-Baha replied that Huquq was separate and independent
 of these and came first. After that had been determined then the other 
affairs could be looked after. He smiled and said when Huquq is given 
'Abdu'l-Baha will ascertain how much of it is for the Mashriqu'l- 
Adhkar, how much for teaching and how much for the needy, etc.</p>
<p>	IV EXTRACT FROM A LETTER OF SHOGHI EFFENDI</p>
<p>	1177. To offer contributions towards this end [in support of the 
activities of the Spiritual Assembly] is one of the pressing 
requirements of the Cause of God, is deemed highly essential, and is of 
fundamental importance. Next to the payment of the Huquq it is the 
obligation of every Baha'i.</p>
<p>	(27 February 1923- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	V. EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF SHOGHI EFFENDI</p>
<p>	1178. Regarding the Huququ'llah...this is applied to one's 
merchandise, property and income. After deducting the necessary 
expenses, whatever is left as profit, and is an addition to one's 
capital, such a sum is subject to Huquq. When one has paid Huquq once on
 a particular sum, that sum is no longer subject to Huquq, unless it 
should pass from one person to another. One's residence, and the 
household furnishings are exempt from Huquq...Huququ'llah is paid to the
 Centre of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(4 April - 3 May 1927 - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1179. You will find reference to the Huquq in the Book of Aqdas, 
manuscript copies of which I believe are to be found among a few 
believers in America. All matters not specifically provided by 
Baha'u'llah are to be referred to the Universal House of Justice.</p>
<p>	(26 December 1927)<br>

</p><p>	1180. Concerting Huquq, the guardian wishes me to inform you 
that at present it is not obligatory for the friends to pay, but that 
they should be urged to contribute to the local and national funds.</p>
<p>	(19 September 1929)</p>
<p>	1181. As regards Huquq, it is really 19 per cent of one's income payable to the Guardian. But it is not obligatory now.</p>
<p>	(19 December 1929, Dawn of the New Day page 2 7)</p>
<p>	1182. You enquired concerning the Huquq. Shoghi Effendi would much 
prefer if the friends in America concentrate their financial resources 
towards the completion of the Temple, rather then dissipate their energy
 along channels that do not as yet call for immediate attention. When 
the time comes that the Cause would need the enforcement of this 
religious donation, Shoghi Effendi would say it and would set forth the 
amount prescribed. It is only gradually that the teachings of 
Baha'u'llah can be enforced. The time has to become ripe if the desired 
result is to be obtained.</p>
<p>	(15 February 1932)</p>
<p>	1183. With reference to your question concerning the "Huquq", Shoghi
 Effendi wishes me to inform you that, although it has been prescribed 
by Baha'u'llah and referred to by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His Will and 
Testament, he is nevertheless reluctant to emphasize it, in view of the 
paramount necessity of preserving the dignity of the Cause, and also in 
view of the increasing national expenses of the Faith.</p>
<p>	(10 February 1935)</p>
<p>	1184. Regarding the subject of Huquq; Shoghi Effendi is reluctant to
 emphasize it at present, in view of the urgent needs of the Cause in 
America. But when the time comes for him to explain it to the friends, 
he will not fail to do so; suffice it to say that the Huquq constitutes 
nineteen per cent of one's income, and not nine as some seem to think.</p>
<p>	(31 May 1937)<br>

</p><p>	1185. One mithqal consists of nineteen nakhuds. The weight of 
twenty-four nakhuds equals four and three-fifths grammes. Calculations 
may be made on this basis.</p>
<p>	(17 November 1937)</p>
<p>	1186. Concerning your question whether the heirs to whom the 
principal residence, furniture and clothing of the deceased are 
transferred by way of inheritance will be exempt from the payment of 
Huquq or not, he said: Since the residence, furniture and the tools of 
trade have, in accordance with the explicit Text, been granted exemption
 from the Huquq, therefore when the transfer of ownership takes place 
such possessions continue to be exempt.</p>
<p>	(29 September 1942 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1187. Regarding the questions raised in your letters: The Huquq is a
 conscientious obligation; but the Guardian has not felt the time was 
ripe to stress this in the West.</p>
<p>	(24 March 1945)</p>
<p>	1188. Great is the recompense that God has ordained for the true and
 devoted souls, the pure and detached beings who have spontaneously 
bequeathed a portion of their earthly possessions to the Cause of God, 
either during their own lifetimes or through their wills, and have had 
the privilege and honour of discharging their obligations to 
Huququ'llah. Give assurance on my behalf to the donors and to the 
survivors of those who have ascended unto God, affirming that these 
efforts and donations are bound to attract divine confirmations, 
heavenly blessings and incalculable favours, and to promote the manifold
 interests of the International Baha'i Community. Well is it with them, 
inasmuch as God has enabled them to fulfil that which shall elevate 
their stations in this world and in the world to come.</p>
<p>	(23 June 1945 - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1189. The Guardian does not wish at present to go into the subject 
of Huquq; but the general principle is that once you have paid on your 
capital you don't have to pay it again.</p>
<p>	(28 July 1946)<br>

</p><p>	1190. The paying of the Huquq is a spiritual obligation; the 
friends must not be obliged by the assemblies to pay it, but they should
 be encouraged to fulfil this spiritual obligation laid upon them in the
 Aqdas.</p>
<p>	(12 October 1946 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India)</p>
<p>	1191. The Huquq is payable to the Guardian individually by the 
believers; but he has not, in view of the many financial demands of the 
work the American believers are accomplishing, thought it timely to 
stress this point. They are free to do as they wish in this matter; 
later, when the time comes, he will explain fully to them the details of
 this matter.</p>
<p>	(27 March 1949)</p>
<p>	1192. Huquq is at the present time the same as the International 
Fund, and therefore I am sending you a receipt stating it is for the 
international interests of the Faith.</p>
<p>	(8 June 1947)</p>
<p>	1193. As regards Huquq: it is the payment of 19 per cent, not one 19th.</p>
<p>	(4 October 1950)</p>
<p>	VI. EXTRACTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE</p>
<p>	1194. Since the Huququ'llah has, according to the injunction in the 
Book, been designated as one of the institutions of the Cause, and 
inasmuch as the fulfilment of this obligation is binding on the people 
of Baha, therefore it is deemed appropriate that your Spiritual Assembly
 should fully familiarize the dear friends in Persia with the 
significance of this momentous responsibility and to promulgate 
gradually in the entire community such ordinances related to Huququ'llah
 as are laid down in His perspicuous Book. Obviously in pursuance of the
 explicit Texts solicitation of the Huququ'llah is not permissible, but 
it is the responsibility of those Trustees of the Cause to address 
appeals of a general character to the dear friends, so that they may 
become more informed about this essential obligation. God willing, 
through the occasional reminders issued by your Assembly, they may gain 
the privilege<br>
 and honour of achieving this benevolent deed -- a deed that draws forth
 heavenly blessings, serves as a means of purifying the earthly 
possessions of the devoted friends, and promotes the international 
activities of the people of Baha.</p>
<p>	The Trustee of the Huququ'llah, the Hand of the Cause of God Dr. 
'Ali-Muhammad Varqa, has been asked to designate, whenever advisable, 
certain representatives for the Huququ'llah in various townships, 
provinces and neighbouring countries, so that the offering of the 
Huququ'llah may be facilitated for the friends in those regions.</p>
<p>	It is evident to those Trustees of the Merciful that this Body, by 
virtue of the explicit Text of the sacred Writings, is the Body to which
 all things must be referred, and the Huququ'llah can be used to promote
 the interests of the Cause throughout the Baha'i world only with the 
permission of the Authority in the Cause to which all must turn.</p>
<p>	(27 October 1963, to the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1195. The payment of the Huququ'llah is one of the essential 
spiritual obligations that the wondrous Pen of Baha'u'llah has laid down
 in the Most Holy Book.</p>
<p>	It would be preferable and more fitting if these two accounts, 
namely contributions to the Funds and payments of the Huququ'llah were 
to be kept separate. This means that in the first instance you should 
pay your Huququ'llah, and then you may offer your devoted contributions 
at your own discretion to the International Fund which is now being used
 for achieving the goals of the Nine-Year Plan.</p>
<p>	(18 August 1965- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1196. Recently one of the friends asked the following question: Were
 a person to offer his property, partly or wholly, to the Baha'i Funds, 
what responsibility does he still have for payment of the Huququ'llah?</p>
<p>	This is what was stated in reply: The payment of Huququ'llah is one 
of the essential spiritual obligations of the people of Baha which has 
been revealed in the Most Holy Book by the Pen of Glory. Therefore the 
friends should separate the account of Huququ'llah from that of their 
other contributions. Thus they must first settle their obligations 
concerning Huququ'llah, then they may make other contributions at their 
own<br>
 discretion, inasmuch as the disposition of the funds of the Huququ'llah
 is subject to decision by the Authority in the Cause to which ail must 
turn, whereas the purposes of contributions to other Funds may be 
determined by the donors themselves.</p>
<p>	(22 August 1966 - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1197. Undoubtedly the friends are illumined with the light of the 
fear of God and are fully conscious of the need to purify and protect 
their possessions in accordance with the decisive Words revealed by our 
Lord, the Most High.</p>
<p>	In these turbulent days, we that yearn for Him, fervently turn in 
prayer to the court of the Lord of mankind that He may graciously enable
 that august Assembly to repeatedly remind the lovers of the Beauty of 
the All- Merciful of the vital importance and the binding character of 
this sacred and heavenly injunction. Through issuing announcements, 
distributing leaflets and in gatherings, schools and conferences held by
 the followers of our Zealous Lord, they should be guided and encouraged
 to observe strictly and conscientiously that which His divine 
commandment has enjoined upon them, so that those believers who are 
adorned with the fear of God may be shielded from the dire consequences 
foreshadowed in His ominous warnings, may become the recipients of His 
assured blessings and be enabled to partake of the outpourings of His 
infallible spiritual grace. </p>
<p>	(12 September 1969 - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1198. Some of the dear friends who observe their Huququ'llah 
obligations have written asking about the relationship that exists 
between contribution to the Funds and the payment of Huququ'llah. That 
is, if a person who intends to meet his Huququ'llah obligations offers 
contributions to other Funds and projects instead, would be exempted 
from the payment of Huququ'llah or not?</p>
<p>	The Holy Texts relevant to this matter are clear but, since this 
question has been repeatedly asked by the friends, it was decided to 
elucidate it for their information.</p>
<p>	Payment of Huququ'llah is a spiritual obligation binding on the 
people of Baha. The injunction is laid down in the Most Holy Book, and 
clear and conclusive explanations are embodied in various Tablets.<br>

</p><p>	Every devoted believer who is able to meet the specified 
conditions, must pay the Huququ'llah, without any exception. Indeed 
according to the explicit Text of the Most Holy Book, failure to comply 
with this injunction is regarded as a betrayal of trust, and the divine 
call: "Whoso dealeth dishonestly with God will in justice be exposed," 
is a clear reference to such people.</p>
<p>	The Centre of the Covenant has affirmed the obligation of Huquq in 
these words: "The Lord as a sign of His infinite bounties hath 
graciously favoured His servants by providing for a fixed money offering
 [Huquq], to be dutifully presented unto Him though He, the True One and
 His servants have been at all times independent of all created things."</p>
<p>	This weighty ordinance, as testified by the Pen of Glory is invested
 with incalculable benefit and wisdom. It purifies one's possessions, 
averts loss and disaster, conduces to prosperity and honour and imparts 
divine increase and blessing. It is a sacrifice offered for and related 
to God, and an act of servitude leading to the promotion of His Cause. 
As affirmed by the Centre of the Covenant, Huquq offerings constitute a 
test for the believers and enable the friends to become firm and 
steadfast in faith and certitude.</p>
<p>	In brief, payment of Huququ'llah is one of the binding spiritual 
responsibilities of the followers of Baha'u'llah and the proceeds 
thereof revert to the Authority in the Cause to whom all must turn. 
Moreover, the Ancient Beauty -- magnified be His praise -- has affirmed 
that after the establishment of the Universal House of Justice necessary
 rulings would be enacted in this connection in conformity with that 
which God has purposed, and that no one, except the Authority to which 
all must turn, has the right to dispose of this Fund. In other words, 
whatever portion of one's wealth is due to the Huququ'llah belongs to 
the World Centre of the Cause of God, not to the individuals concerned.</p>
<p>	Thus the friends should not follow their own volition and judgement 
in using any of the funds set aside for Huququ'llah for any other 
purpose, even for charitable contributions of the Faith.</p>
<p>	We earnestly hope that everyone may be privileged to observe this 
sacred and blessed obligation which would ensure the attainment of true 
happiness and would serve to promote the execution of Baha'i enterprises
 throughout the world.<br>

</p><p>	Verily God is Self-Sufficient above the need of His creatures.</p>
<p>	(25 October 1970 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran -translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1199. 'Abdu'l-Baha in one of His Tablets has stated: "Disposition of
 the Huquq, wholly or partly, is permissible, but this should be done by
 permission of the authority in the Cause to whom all must turn." The 
provision in His Will and Testament that the Huququ'llah "is to be 
offered through the guardian of the Cause of God..." is clearly in 
accord with this principle. In another Tablet 'Abdu'l-Baha referred to 
the Universal House of Justice as "the authority to whom all must turn" 
and it is clear that in the absence of the Guardian it is the supreme 
and central institution of the Cause. Moreover, before 'Abdu'l-Baha, 
Baha'u'llah had revealed the following: "There is a prescribed ruling 
for the Huququ'llah. After the House of Justice hath come into being the
 law thereof will be made manifest, in conformity with the Will of God."
 In accordance with these explicit texts it is clearly within the 
jurisdiction of the Universal House of Justice to decide about the 
receipt and disbursement of Huququ'llah at the present time.</p>
<p>	(2 March 1972 to the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land)</p>
<p>	1200. Payment of Huququ'llah has not yet been applied to the western
 world. It will undoubtedly be universal at some future time but at 
present the believers in the West are able to discharge their material 
obligations to the Cause by contribution to the Funds.</p>
<p>	(12 July 1972)</p>
<p>	1201. We are deeply touched by your loving letter of 27 December, 
1972 expressing the wish to follow the law of Huququ'llah with respect 
to your inheritance from your mother. Although, as you correctly state, 
this Law is not at present applicable to the friends in the West, any 
believer is free to observe it if he wishes.</p>
<p>	This Law of the Aqdas stipulates that nineteen per cent of one's 
capital is payable as Huququ'llah when such capital has reached an 
amount of at least "nineteen mithqals in gold" .... In determining the 
amount a believer should pay, he should first deduct any debts and 
expenses he<br>
 may have, and pay nineteen per cent of the remainder of his capital if it is equal to at least nineteen mithqals of gold.</p>
<p>	If you decide that you wish to observe this Law of the Aqdas at the 
present time, you should determine the total value of your inheritance 
in cash and other assets less any expenses or debts you may have, and 
consider the circumstances under which you may be able to pay 
Huququ'llah on the net value of your inheritance. The time and 
conditions of payment are left to each individual. For example, if one's
 assets include property or shares in addition to cash, he may find it 
disadvantageous or inconvenient to pay nineteen per cent of the value of
 the non-cash assets until they are disposed of, at which time he would 
prefer to fulfil this spiritual obligation. Any expenses that may be 
involved in disposing of one's assets should be deducted before 
calculating the net value on which Huququ'llah is payable.</p>
<p>	(21 January 1973)</p>
<p>	1202. ... The devoted believer who is privileged to pay "the Right 
of God", far from seeking excuses for evading this spiritual obligation,
 will do his utmost to meet it. On the other hand, inasmuch as obedience
 to this Law is a matter of conscience, and payment of Huququ'llah is a 
voluntary act, it would not be seemly to go beyond informing the Persian
 friends of their spiritual obligation, and leaving to them to decide 
what they wish to do about it.</p>
<p>	The same principle applies to those friends who spend lavishly on 
their families, who purchase or build residences and furnish them far in
 excess of their needs, and rationalize these expenditures in their 
desire to avoid payment of Huququ'llah. Likewise those friends who marry
 non-Persians and reside in Europe or other countries should not be 
pressed, but informed and left to decide for themselves.</p>
<p>	(26 February 1973)</p>
<p>	1203. ... many details in the computation of Huququ'llah have been 
left by Baha'u'llah to the judgement and conscience of the individual 
believer. For example, He exempts such household equipment and 
furnishings as are needful, but He leaves it to the individual to decide
 which items are necessary and which are not. Contributions to the funds
 of the Faith cannot be considered as part of one's payment of 
Huququ'llah;<br>
 moreover, if one owes Huququ'llah and cannot afford to both to pay it 
and to make contributions to the Fund, the payment of Huququ'llah should
 take priority over making contributions. But as to whether 
contributions to the Fund may be treated as expenses in calculating the 
amount of one's assets on which Huququ'llah is payable; this is left to 
the judgement of each individual in the light of his own circumstances.</p>
<p>	The Guardian's secretary wrote on his behalf that "one mithqal 
consists of nineteen nakhuds. The weight of twenty-four nakhuds equals 
four and three-fifths grammes. Calculations may be made on this basis". 
Nineteen mithqals therefore equal 69.191667 grammes. One troy ounce 
equals 31.103486 grammes, thus 19 mithqals equal 2.224563 oz. At the 
current rate of $339.10 per ounce, 19 mithqals of gold would amount to 
$754.35. Thus on a savings of $754.35 an amount of $143.33 (i.e 19%) 
would be payable as Huququ'llah.</p>
<p>	(16 September 1979)</p>
<p>	1204. It is clear from the Writings that a person is exempt from 
paying Huququ'llah on his residence and such household and professional 
equipment as are needful. It is left to the discretion of the individual
 to decide which items are necessary and which are not. It is obvious 
that the friends should not spend lavishly on residences and furnishings
 and rationalize on these expenditures in their desire to avoid payment 
of Huququ'llah. No specific text has been found exempting capital used 
to earn income. The Universal House of Justice leaves such matters to 
the consciences of individual believers.</p>
<p>	(9 April 1980)</p>
<p>	1205. The House of Justice further points out that however weighty 
are the obligations resting upon the believers to pay the Huququ'llah 
and to support the other funds of the Faith, these are spiritual 
obligations which are to be fulfilled voluntarily, and under no 
circumstances may contributions to any of these funds, even the 
Huququ'llah, be demanded or solicited from individual believers. Appeals
 and exhortations must always be made to the generality of the friends, 
not to individuals.</p>
<p>	(7 May 1980)<br>

</p><p>	1206. He who after setting aside his annual expenses owns a 
surplus worth at least nineteen mithqals of gold is liable to the 
payment of Huququ'llah.</p>
<p>	(20 October 1981- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1207. As to your second question asking whether, where there is 
perfect understanding between husband and wife and she is empowered to 
manage her husband's property as well as her own, she could pay the 
amount of Huququ'llah applicable to all their possessions or, since the 
husband owns a portion of the property, she could pay only the amount of
 Huququ'llah on her own share of the property.</p>
<p>	In answering this question one should remember that the Huququ'llah 
is payable on possessions that are indisputably recognized as being 
one's own and not on property that one merely controls or uses. However,
 in cases similar to the one you have mentioned above, it is incumbent 
on husband and wife to take counsel together and to define precisely the
 limits of their personal belongings, then they should either jointly or
 individually render to the Huquq the amount they consider to be their 
binding obligation.</p>
<p>	As regards Mrs...., since her husband is an American and the law of 
Huququ'llah does not apply at this time to the friends in the West, the 
payment of Huququ'llah on the part of her husband is neither binding nor
 prohibited.</p>
<p>	(10 January 1982- translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1208. The Universal House of Justice has received your letter of 10 
September, 1982 enquiring about the responsibility of a Baha'i couple to
 pay Huququ'llah where one partner is American and the other Persian, 
and we have been instructed to provide you with the following 
clarification.</p>
<p>	1. Your letter refers to basing the calculation of Huququ'llah on 
one's income. As you will realize from a study of the texts, however, 
the computation is made on the net value of one's possessions after 
deducting a number of exempt items such as residence and necessary 
furnishings, and on subsequent annual increases to this net property 
arising from surplus income after the payment of necessary expenses. It 
is, moreover, calculated on<br>
 units of property equal in value to 19 mithqals of gold (2.22456 troy ounces).</p>
<p>	2. No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the share of a 
couple's property on which Huququ'llah should be paid where one partner 
is a westerner and the other a Persian. This depends upon the way the 
husband and wife themselves regard the ownership of the family's 
property. Thus it is basically a matter for consultation between husband
 and wife and, as stated previously, Baha'u'llah has left many of the 
details of computation of Huququ'llah to the judgement of the individual
 believers.</p>
<p>	(11 October 1982)</p>
<p>	1209. As to the question raised by Mr...., kindly inform him that in
 a letter to an individual believer the beloved Guardian explained that 
Huququ'llah is payable only once on a given property, whether personal 
or real, but should this property pass from one person to another, such 
as through inheritance, it becomes again subject to the payment of 
Huququ'llah. This in effect means that heirs receiving a share of their 
inheritance from an estate must pay Huququ'llah, if the share they are 
receiving increases their wealth to a level calling for the discharge of
 this sacred obligation.</p>
<p>	(1 June 1983 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	1210. As regards your question concerning the principal residence 
and subsidiary rulings relevant to it, we wish to let you know that in 
these days it is not deemed advisable to enact detailed rulings for 
Huququ'llah. Thus the friends are left free, and whenever no definite 
rulings exist they may fulfil in each case that which they understand 
from the tests, and may honour their Huququ'llah obligations according 
to their own judgement and the promptings of their own conscience.</p>
<p>	(4 March 1984 - translated from the Persian)<br>

</p><p>	VII. EXTRACT FROM A LETTER WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE</p>
<p>	1211. As you state, the obligation to Huququ'llah rests on 
individual believers, not on corporate bodies, even if these are wholly 
owned by Baha'is.</p>
<p>	On the other hand, if the owners of a company which is entirely 
Baha'i-owned wish their company to make a donation to Huququ'llah, such a
 contribution is acceptable. It does not, of course, reduce the 
obligation of the individual believers concerned to pay their own 
Huququ'llah.</p>
<p>	There is no objection in principle to a Baha'i's paying money to an 
agent, requesting that agent to issue a cheque on his behalf in payment 
of his Huququ'llah, whether the agent be an individual, a bank, a 
limited company or a firm. Such a cheque should be accepted. However, 
the individual who is thereby fulfilling his obligation to Huququ'llah 
should make clear that this is what he is doing, and the receipt should 
be issued in his name, not in that of the agent.</p>
<p>	(30 March 1989 to an individual believer)<br>

</p><p>	BAHA'I FUNDS AND CONTRIBUTIONS[1]<br>
 [1 Extracts are taken from letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi unless otherwise noted.]</p>
<p>	I. Importance of giving</p>
<p>	1212. We must be like the fountain or spring that is continually 
emptying itself of all that it has and is continually being refilled 
from an invisible source. To be continually giving out for the good of 
our fellows undeterred by fear of poverty and reliant on the unfailing 
bounty of the Source of all wealth and all good -- this is the secret of
 right living.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, cited in "Baha'i News" 13 (September 1926), p. 1)</p>
<p>	1213. And as the progress and extension of spiritual activities is 
dependent and conditioned upon material means, it is of absolute 
necessity that immediately after the establishment of local as well as 
national Spiritual Assemblies, a Baha'i Fund be established, to be 
placed under the exclusive control of the Spiritual Assembly. All 
donations and contributions should be offered to the Treasurer of the 
Assembly, for the express purpose of promoting the interests of the 
Cause, throughout that locality or country. It is the sacred obligation 
of every conscientious and faithful servant of Baha'u'llah, who desires 
to see His Cause advance, to contribute freely and generously for the 
increase of that Fund. The members of the Spiritual Assembly will at 
their own discretion expend it to promote the Teaching Campaign, to help
 the needy, to establish educational Baha'i institutions, to extend in 
every way possible their sphere of service. I cherish the hope that all 
the friends, realizing the necessity of this measure, will bestir 
themselves and contribute, however modestly at first, towards the speedy
 establishment and the increase of that Fund.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter dated 12 March 1923 to the Baha'is of
 the West, published in "Baha'i Administration: Selected Messages 
1922-1932" [rev. ed.], (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1980), pp. 
41-42)</p>
<p>	1214. That you may reinforce this Teaching Campaign -- so vitally 
needed in these days -- and conduct, properly and efficiently, the rest 
of your manifold activities, spiritual as well as humanitarian, it is 
urgently necessary to establish that Central Fund, which if generously 
supported<br>
 and upheld by individual friends and Local Assemblies, will soon enable you to execute your plans with promptness and vigour.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter dated 6 May 1923 to the National 
Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, published in 
"Baha'i' Administration", p. 49)</p>
<p>	1215. With regard to the Baha'i Fund, recently established amongst 
the friends, I trust that the matter now stands clear to every one 
throughout the country. As I have previously intimated, although 
individual friends and Local Assemblies are absolutely free to specify 
the object and purpose of their donations to the National Spiritual 
Assembly, yet, in my opinion, I regard it of the utmost vital importance
 that individuals, as well as Local Assemblies, throughout the land 
should, in view of the paramount importance of National Teaching and as 
an evidence of their absolute confidence in their national 
representatives, endeavour, however small at first, to contribute freely
 towards the upkeep and the increase of the National Baha'i Fund, so 
that the members of the National Assembly may at their full discretion 
expend it for whatever they deem urgent and necessary.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter dated 26 November 1923 to the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, published 
in "Baha'i Administration", pp. 53-54)</p>
<p>	1216. ...It is for the National Assembly... to exercise its 
judgement as to what extent the resources at their disposal enable them 
to aid financially the individual undertakings of the friends. Should 
the response of the friends and Assemblies to the appeals made on behalf
 of the National Fund be prompt, sustained, and generous, the National 
Assembly will, I am certain,justify its sympathy, goodwill and genuine 
co-operation with every individual Baha'i enterprise. I would, however, 
at this early stage of our work, strongly urge, nay entreat, the friends
 not to dissipate their efforts, but to seek, after frank, mature, and 
continuous deliberation, to arrive at a common conclusion as to the most
 urgent requirements and needs of the hour, and having unified their 
views to strive to uphold and enforce them with promptitude, whole- 
heartedness, and understanding.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter dated 16 January 1925 to the National
 Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, published in 
"Baha'i Administration", pp. 76-77)<br>

</p><p>	1217. ...That the work of the National Spiritual Assemblies may 
be efficiently conducted, it is incumbent upon their members to seek if 
feasible the establishment of an adequate and permanent centre for their
 activities which would be widely and officially advertised and be 
recognized as the headquarters of their Secretariat. To it all 
communications from individual friends and Local Assemblies within its 
province, from the Holy Land and from foreign countries should be 
directly addressed. It would be its first duty to keep in close and 
constant touch, without exception, discrimination or favour, with the 
various localities and isolated believers in its jurisdiction, and 
diligently and promptly distribute to them as well as to the friends 
abroad any matter of common concern and general interest.</p>
<p>	That this cherished aim may materialize and the standard of 
efficiency be maintained, the institution of the National Fund is of 
paramount importance. I would unceasingly urge the individual believers 
as well as the Local Assemblies throughout India and Burma to arise with
 heart and soul and generously and regularly contribute toward the 
upkeep and the extension of a Fund upon which will greatly depend the 
success of their endeavours.</p>
<p>	I am personally instructing the... Assembly, whose past services, 
moral as well as financial, to the Cause of Baha'u'llah in India and 
elsewhere are graven upon my heart, to concentrate their energies upon, 
and uphold with their resources the twin institutions of the National 
Spiritual Assembly and the National Fund. I trust that these may soon be
 enabled to shoulder the burden that is now weighing upon the 
self-sacrificing friends of....</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter dated 25 March 1925 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma)</p>
<p>	1218. As to material sacrifices towards the welfare of the Cause, he
 wishes you to understand that the general interests of the Cause take 
precedence over the interests of the particular individuals. For 
instance contributions to the welfare of individuals are secondary to 
contributions towards the National and Local Funds and that of the 
Temple.</p>
<p>	This is a general instruction. Of course helping the individuals in 
case one is able to help, is also desirable and merits appreciation.</p>
<p>	(24 November 1925 to two believers)<br>

</p><p>	1219. In connection with the institution of the National Fund 
and the budgetary system set forth in the minutes of the National 
Spiritual Assembly, I feel urged to remind you of the necessity of ever 
bearing in mind the cardinal principle that all contributions to the 
Fund are to be purely and strictly voluntary in character. It should be 
made clear and evident to every one that any form of compulsion, however
 slight and indirect, strikes at the very root of the principle 
underlying the formation of the Fund ever since its inception. While 
appeals of a general character, carefully-worded and moving and 
dignified in tone are welcome under all circumstances, it should be left
 entirely to the discretion of every conscientious believer to decide 
upon the nature, the amount, and purpose of his or her contribution for 
the propagation of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter dated 10 January 1926 to the National
 Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada, published in 
"Baha'i Administration", p. 101)</p>
<p>	1220. ...The National Fund must be firmly established, generously 
supported and universally and continuously upheld, for it is the 
prerequisite of future progress and achievement. The "News Letter" 
should be extended, widely distributed and utilized as a means to supply
 information, co-ordinate activities and secure the support of all the 
believers to the institutions of the Cause. I strongly urge you to 
ensure the success of these two primary and essential organs of our 
work.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 25 May 1926 written on his behalf to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1221. In times of disappointment, stress and anxiety, which we must 
inevitably encounter, we should remember the sufferings of our departed 
Master. Your work, your energy, your vigilance and care, your 
loving-kindness are assets that I greatly value and prize. Keep on, 
persevere, redouble in your efforts, repeat and rewrite the admonitions 
and instructions of our Beloved in your communications with individuals 
and Assemblies until they sink in their hearts and minds. This was truly
 our Beloved's way and method and none better can we ever pursue. Your 
present pioneer work will surely be remembered and extolled by future 
generations. My prayers will always be offered for you. In matters of 
contribution we should not use any compulsion whatsoever and ascertain<br>
 clearly the desire of the donor. We should appeal to but not coerce the friends.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 9 July 1926 written on his behalf to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1222. As Baha'is we should follow the prophet's method. We know that
 the Cause will ultimately conquer and its ranks be fully united. We 
know that the Master's promises will ultimately be realized, therefore 
why be discouraged by trivial oppositions we see on our way. We should 
rather add to our zeal and persist in our prayers and endeavours. Shoghi
 Effendi has taken the available measures, and, by letter as well as 
cable, has urged the... friends to give a moral and material support to 
the National fund. It always takes time for a people to change from one 
administration to another. Up to the present they have been accustomed 
to think of the Local Assemblies as next only to the Centre of the 
Cause, and it will take some time and training before they can admit 
another superior. The same problem existed in America and for some time 
the work of the National body seemed to be paralysed but through 
personal contact and Shoghi Effendi's incessant reminding that problem 
has been solved and now we see the National Assembly considered as the 
only body to undertake matters that are beyond the purely local 
jurisdiction of the Local Assemblies.</p>
<p>	(7 September 1926 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and 
Burma, published in "Dawn of a New Day" (New Delhi: Baha'i Publishing 
Trust, [1970]), pp. 13-14)</p>
<p>	1223. ...I have urged them to support consistently and 
whole-heartedly the very essential and vital institutions of the 
National Fund and the National Assembly. It must be made clear to them 
all that continuous support to these twin institutions is the 
corner-stone of all future achievements, the mainspring from which all 
future blessings will flow.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to the above letter)</p>
<p>	1224. ...we should, I feel, regard it as an axiom and guiding 
principle of Baha'i administration that in the conduct of every specific
 Baha'i activity, as different from undertakings of a humanitarian, 
philanthropic, or charitable character, which may in future be conducted
 under Baha'i<br>
 auspices, only those who have already identified themselves with the 
Faith and are regarded as its avowed and unreserved supporters should be
 invited to join and collaborate. For apart from the consideration of 
embarrassing complications which the association of non- believers in 
the financing of institutions of a strictly Baha'i character may 
conceivably engender in the administration of the Baha'i community of 
the future, it should be remembered that these specific Baha'i 
institutions, which should be viewed in the light of Baha'u'llah's gifts
 bestowed upon the world, can best function and most powerfully exert 
their influence in the world only if reared and maintained solely by the
 support of those who are fully conscious of, and are unreservedly 
submissive to, the claims inherent in the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. In 
cases, however, when a friend or sympathizer of the Faith eagerly 
insists on a monetary contribution for the promotion of the Faith, such 
gifts should be accepted and duly acknowledged by the elected 
representatives of the believers with the express understanding that 
they would be utilized by them only to reinforce that section of the 
Baha'i Fund exclusively devoted to philanthropic or charitable purposes.
 For as the Faith of Baha'u'llah extends in scope and in influence, and 
the resources of Baha'i communities correspondingly multiply, it will 
become increasingly desirable to differentiate between such departments 
of the Baha'i treasury as minister to the needs of the world at large, 
and those that are specifically designed to promote the direct interests
 of the Faith itself. From this apparent divorce between Baha'i and 
humanitarian activities it must not however be inferred that the 
animating purpose of the Faith of Baha'u'llah stands at variance with 
the aims and objects of the humanitarian and philanthropic institutions 
of the day. Nay, it should be realized by every judicious promoter of 
the Faith that at such an early stage in the evolution and 
crystallization of the Cause such discriminating and precautionary 
measures are inevitable and even necessary if the nascent institutions 
of the Faith are to emerge triumphant and unimpaired from the present 
welter of confused and often conflicting interests with which they are 
surrounded. This note of warning may not be thought inappropriate at a 
time when, inflamed by a consuming passion to witness the early 
completion of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, we may not only be apt to acquiesce
 in the desire of those who as yet uninitiated into the Cause are 
willing to lend financial assistance to its institutions,<br>
 but may even feel inclined to solicit from them such aid as it is in 
their power to render. Ours surely is the paramount duty so to acquit 
ourselves in the discharge of our most sacred task that in the days to 
come neither the tongue of the slanderer nor the pen of the malevolent 
may dare to insinuate that so beauteous, so significant an Edifice has 
been reared by anything short of the unanimous, the exclusive, and the 
self-sacrificing strivings of the small yet determined body of the 
convinced supporters of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. How delicate our task,
 how pressing the responsibility that weighs upon us, who are called 
upon on one hand to preserve inviolate the integrity and the identity of
 the regenerating Faith of Baha'u'llah, and to vindicate on the other 
its broad, its humanitarian, its all-embracing principles!</p>
<p>	True, we cannot fail to realize at the present stage of our work the
 extremely limited number of contributors qualified to lend financial 
support to such a vast, such an elaborate and costly enterprise. We are 
fully aware of the many issues and varied Baha'i activities that are 
unavoidably held in abeyance pending the successful conclusion of the 
Plan of Unified Action. We are only too conscious of the pressing need 
of some sort of befitting and concrete embodiment of the spirit 
animating the Cause that would stand in the heart of the American 
Continent both as a witness and as a rallying centre to the manifold 
activities of a fast growing Faith. But spurred by these reflections may
 we not bestir ourselves and resolve as we have never resolved before to
 hasten by every means in our power the consummation of this 
all-absorbing yet so meritorious a task? I beseech you, dear friends, 
not to allow considerations of number, or the consciousness of the 
limitation of our resources, or even the experience of inevitable 
set-backs which every mighty undertaking is bound to encounter, to blur 
your vision, to dim your hopes, or to paralyse your efforts in the 
prosecution of your divinely appointed task. Neither, do I entreat you, 
to suffer the least deviation into the paths of expediency and 
compromise to obstruct those channels of vivifying grace that can alone 
provide the inspiration and strength vital not only to the successful 
conduct of its material construction, but to the fulfilment of its high 
destiny.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter dated 25 October 1929 to the Baha'is 
of the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i Administration", 
pp. 182-84)<br>

</p><p>	1225. You asked concerning some plans whereby funds could be 
gathered for the Temple. Shoghi Effendi believes that the best and 
noblest method is to have free donations that are made spontaneously and
 with the sense of making some sacrifice in furthering the Cause. It is 
with sacrifice that this Temple is to be built. This is the truly worthy
 method. This principle therefore excludes any method whereby the help 
of non-Baha'is is included. A Baha'i Temple should be built by the 
Baha'is alone; it is not an ordinary humanitarian activity in which the 
help of any person could be solicited. Anyhow Shoghi Effendi has fully 
explained these matters to the National Spiritual Assembly and you could
 easily refer to them as to further light on the subject.</p>
<p>	(14 April 1932 to the Spiritual Assembly of Kenosha, Wisconsin, published in "Baha'i News"[64] (July 1932), p. 4)</p>
<p>	1226. Even though Shoghi Effendi would urge every believer to 
sacrifice as much as possible for the sake of contributing towards the 
fund of the National Assembly, yet he would discourage the friends to 
incur debts for that purpose. We are asked to give what we have, not 
what we do not possess, especially if such an act causes suffering to 
others. In such matters we should use judgement and wisdom and take into
 our confidence other devoted Baha'is.</p>
<p>	(4 May 1932 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1227. Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your 
letter dated May 8th 1932 telling him of some incidents that transpired 
during the Convention this year, especially when funds were collected 
for the Temple. He was very glad to learn of the wonderful spirit that 
prevailed in those gatherings; for it is only through such a spirit of 
devotion and sacrifice that the Cause can prosper and its message 
embrace the whole world.</p>
<p>	It was also wonderful to see the interest shown by the public in the
 general gatherings that formed part of the Convention programme. Shoghi
 Effendi hopes that as the Temple is gradually completed this interest 
will increase and they will try to share in the spirit that motivates 
the friends and, accepting the Faith of Baha'u'llah, arise to serve it, 
and dedicate their life to its spread.<br>

</p><p>	Such gatherings for collection of funds are permissible if it is
 done with a true spirit of sacrifice, not when the audience is 
especially aroused to a frenzy and mob psychology is used to induce them
 to pay. Shoghi Effendi has repeatedly stated that no pressure should be
 used upon the friends, and psychological pressure falls under that 
category. But there is much difference between such gatherings, often 
used by religious bodies, and a true quiet, prayerful atmosphere when a 
person is of his own accord aroused to make some sacrifice. The 
distinction is very delicate, but it is for the chairman to use his 
power to see that one desirable form is not corrupted into the other. 
All the activities of the Cause should be carried through in a dignified
 manner. Shoghi Effendi is sure that the funds gathered at the last 
Convention were not due to the play of mob psychology but to the 
prayerful attitude of the friends and their desire to make further 
sacrifice.</p>
<p>	(28 May 1932 to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 67 (October 1932), p. 5)</p>
<p>	1228. ...Your donations to the Temple as well as the remarkable 
manner in which you are assisting the believers in their efforts to 
widen the scope of their publicity work are real and abiding 
contributions you have made to the Faith. And although at present you 
are unable to contribute financially as much as you did in former years 
you should not feel discouraged, much less disappointed. For the best 
way in which you can effectively support the Temple cause is not through
 material means but by the moral help which is your primary obligation 
to extend to those who are in charge of the building of that sacred and 
unique Edifice. It is devotion, sincerity and genuine enthusiasm which 
in the long run can ensure the completion of our beloved Temple. 
Material considerations, though essential, are not the most vital by any
 means. Had it been otherwise the Temple would have never reached the 
stage of progress which it has already so well attained. For the 
resources of the community are limited, and have been severely affected 
during the last two years by an unprecedented and world-wide economic 
crisis. But despite all these material obstacles the Temple has made a 
steady progress and this alone is sufficient to convince every unbiased 
observer of the divine potency<br>
 animating the Faith -- a potency before which all material difficulties must inevitably wane.</p>
<p>	(30 December 1933 to two believers)</p>
<p>	1229. ...He wishes you particularly to impress the believers with 
the necessity of maintaining the flow of their contributions to the 
Temple, and also to stress the importance of the institution of the 
national Baha'i Fund, which, in these early days of the administrative 
development of the Faith, is the indispensable medium for the growth and
 expansion of the Movement. Contributions to this fund constitute, in 
addition, a practical and effective way whereby every believer can test 
the measure and character of his faith, and prove in deeds the intensity
 of his devotion and attachment to the Cause.</p>
<p>	(25 September 1934 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i News" 88 (November 1934), pp. 
1-2)</p>
<p>	1230. ...the Guardian would advise your Assembly to continue 
impressing upon the believers the necessity of their contributing 
regularly to the national fund, irrespective of whether there is an 
emergency to be met or not. Nothing short of a continuous flow of 
contributions to that fund can, indeed, ensure the financial stability 
upon which so much of the progress of the institutions of the Faith must
 now inevitably depend.</p>
<p>	(29 July 1935 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i News" 95 (October 1935), p. 1)</p>
<p>	1231. As the activities of the American Baha'i community expand, and
 its world-wide prestige correspondingly increases, the institution of 
the national Fund, the bedrock on which all other institutions must 
necessarily rest and be established, acquires added importance, and 
should be increasingly supported by the entire body of the believers, 
both in their individual capacities, and through their collective 
efforts, whether organized as groups or as Local Assemblies. The supply 
of funds, in support of the national Treasury, constitutes, at the 
present time, the life-blood of these nascent institutions which you are
 labouring to erect. Its importance cannot surely be overestimated. 
Untold blessings shall no doubt crown every effort directed to that end.
 I am eagerly and prayerfully<br>
 awaiting the news of an unprecedented expansion in so vital an organ of the Administrative Order of our Faith.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to the above letter)</p>
<p>	1232. With regard to your question concerning contributions to the 
Temple fund: the friends should certainly be encouraged and even urged 
to support financially this, as well as other national institutions of 
the Cause. But they should, under no circumstances, be required to do 
so. As to the idea of "giving what one can afford": this does by no 
means put a limit or even exclude the possibility of self-sacrifice. 
There can be no limit to one's contributions to the national fund. The 
more one can give the better it is, especially when such offerings 
necessitate the sacrifice of other wants and desires on the part of the 
donor. The harder the sacrifice the more meritorious will it be, of 
course, in the sight of God. For after all it is not so much the 
quantity of one's offerings that matters, but rather the measure of 
deprivation that such offerings entail. It is the spirit, not the mere 
fact of contributing, that we should always take into account when we 
stress the necessity for a universal and whole-hearted support of the 
various funds of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(31 December 1935 to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 250 (December 1951), p 1)</p>
<p>	1233. Above all he wishes through you to reiterate his wish, already
 expressed in his recent cable to the National Spiritual Assembly, that 
the National Fund, which undoubtedly constitutes the bedrock upon which 
all the activities of the Cause ultimately rest, should receive the 
continued and whole-hearted support of all the believers. Both the Local
 Assemblies and the individual believers should realize that unless they
 contribute regularly and generously to that Fund the progress of the 
Faith in India and Burma will not only be considerably retarded, but 
will inevitably come to a standstill. There should be a continual flow 
of funds to the national treasury of the National Spiritual Assembly, if
 that body wishes to properly administer the manifold and ever- 
increasing activities of the Faith. Every Baha'i, no matter how poor, 
must realize what a grave responsibility he has to shoulder in this 
connection, and should have confidence that his spiritual progress as a 
believer in the World Order of Baha'u'llah will<br>
 largely depend upon the measure in which he proves, in deeds, his 
readiness to support materially the divine institutions of His Faith.</p>
<p>	(17 July 1937 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India and Burma, published in "Dawn of a New Day", p. 68)</p>
<p>	1234. ...Each and every believer, undaunted by the uncertainties, 
the perils and the financial stringency afflicting the nation, must 
arise and ensure, to the full measure of his or her capacity, that 
continuous and abundant flow of funds into the national Treasury, on 
which the successful prosecution of the Plan must chiefly depend.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 30
 January 1938 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the United States and Canada, published in "Messages to America: 
Selected Letters and Cablegrams Addressed to the Baha'is of North 
America 1932-1946" (Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Committee, 1947), p. 11)</p>
<p>	1235. Regarding the state of the National Fund, which you have 
reported is suffering from a general slackness in contributions from 
both individual believers and the Local Assemblies and groups: It is 
only evident that unless the flow of donations is regularly maintained 
by means of generous and continual support by all the believers, 
individually and collectively, the National Fund will never be able to 
meet the needs and requirements of the Cause, particularly in these days
 when the national activities of the American believers are assuming 
such wide and increasing proportions.</p>
<p>	(3 February 1941 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i News" 143 (May 1941), p. 3)</p>
<p>	1236. Indeed the splendid spirit that animates the American 
believers these days is a great source of joy and inspiration of the 
Guardian, and as the good news comes in of new victories won and new 
sacrifices made, one can see his spirits rise and a wave of new strength
 sweep over him -- tired and over-burdened as he so often is.</p>
<p>	In this connection the letter you so thoughtfully enclosed from that
 dear Baha'i who gave the difference in the price of a cheap or 
expensive coffin to the Fund of the Cause, greatly touched him. Such 
sacrifices<br>
 prove the caliber of the friends and insure the very foundations of the Faith.</p>
<p>	(4 May 1941 to the Treasurer of the National Spiritual Assembly of 
the United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i News" 144 (June 
1941), pp. 2-3)</p>
<p>	1237. Conscious of the state of the National Fund, and realizing the
 urgency of the task facing its administrators, I have felt the urge to 
devote the offering of the American believers to the International Fund 
to the work which is now vitally facing and challenging the friends in 
the teaching field. Much as I appreciated the spirit prompting you and 
your fellow- members to make this monthly contribution to the Cause at 
its World Centre, I felt that it was my duty to consecrate this 
offering, while the Seven Year Plan is still operating, to that vital 
aspect of teaching upon which its success must ultimately depend. May 
the friends, in view of the vastness of the field that stretches before 
them, and the potentialities of their labours within it, and of the 
glowing promise of future blessings which such a labour must yield, rise
 to still greater heights of self- sacrifice and evince nobler 
manifestations of solidarity in the face of the critical situation that 
so insistently demands their support.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 26
 October 1941 to the Treasurer of the National Spiritual Assembly of the
 United States and Canada, published in "Baha'i News" 149 (December 
1941), p. 2)</p>
<p>	1238. ...There is no objection to the... Spiritual Assembly keeping a
 record of the names of contributors, and sums received; but no pressure
 must ever be brought on the Baha'is to contribute, it must be 
voluntary, and should be considered confidential, unless the friends 
themselves wish to mention it openly.</p>
<p>	(26 October 1945 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1239. Regarding your questions: He does not feel that it is 
desirable to lay down any conditions for giving to the Baha'i Fund. This
 is an entirely personal matter, and each believer must act according to
 his own judgement and the needs of the Faith. In times of crisis, 
whether in the affairs of the Cause or in one's own family, people 
naturally behave<br>
 differently than under normal circumstances. But decisions in these matters must rest with each individual Baha'i.</p>
<p>	(19 October 1947 to an individual believer, published in "Unfolding 
Destiny: The Messages from the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith to the 
Baha'i Community of the British Isles" (London. Baha'i Publishing Trust,
 1981), pp. 447-48)</p>
<p>	1240. Regarding the question you raised: in the first place every 
believer is free to follow the dictates of his own conscience as regards
 the manner in which he should spend his own money. Secondly, we must 
always bear in mind that there are so few Baha'is in the world, relative
 to the world's population, and so many people in need, that even if all
 of us gave all we had, it would not alleviate more than an 
infinitesimal amount of suffering. This does not mean we must not help 
the needy, we should; but our contributions to the Faith are the surest 
way of lifting once and for all time the burden of hunger and misery 
from mankind, for it is only through the System of Baha'u'llah- -Divine 
in origin -- that the world can be gotten on its feet and want, fear, 
hunger, war, etc., be eliminated. Non-Baha'is cannot contribute to our 
work or do it for us; so really our first obligation is to support our 
own teaching work, as this will lead to the healing of the nations.</p>
<p>	(8 December 1947 to an individual believer, published in "Baha'i News" 210 (August 1948), p. 3)</p>
<p>	1241. Regarding your question about contributions: it is up to the 
individual to decide; if he wishes to devote a sum to a specific 
purpose, he is free to do so; but the friends should recognize the fact 
that too much labelling of contributions will tie the hands of the 
Assembly and prevent it from meeting its many obligations in various 
fields of Baha'i activity.</p>
<p>	(23 June 1950 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada, 
published in "Messages to Canada" ([Toronto]: National Spiritual 
Assembly of the Baha'is of Canada, 1965), p. 15)</p>
<p>	1242. ...He suggests you give the sum you would spend on a world 
tour to the Cause in memory of your son. Baha'u'llah says that deeds of 
this nature aid the progress of the soul of the loved, departed one, in 
the world beyond. Your son died in suffering, in his youth. Perhaps to 
still have a<br>
 part in the most constructive work of this world would bring him extra peace and joy.</p>
<p>	(19 September 1951 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1243. As to your question: the friends can give their contributions 
to the treasurer, or, if they wish to remain anonymous and give small 
sums, a receptacle can be provided. The Local Assembly can decide this 
matter.</p>
<p>	(29 September 1951 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1244. The Guardian feels sure that the contribution which has been 
made by your friend who has not been active in the Cause for a short 
time will be the means of stimulating her to renewed service. There is 
nothing that brings success in the Faith like service. Service is the 
magnet which draws the divine confirmations. Thus, when a person is 
active, they are blessed by the Holy Spirit. When they are inactive, the
 Holy Spirit cannot find a repository in their being, and thus they are 
deprived of its healing and quickening rays.</p>
<p>	(12 July 1952 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1245. ...Now is the time to build the World Centre of the Faith, and
 the friends are not only free, but encouraged to contribute directly to
 the International and Shrine of the Bab Funds.</p>
<p>	Of course it has never been the Guardian's idea that in contributing
 to the International Funds, the friends would neglect their 
responsibilities to the Local and National Funds; but it certainly was 
not his intent that the friends must contribute first to the Local and 
then the National Funds, before contributing to the international 
activities of the Faith, which at this time are of paramount importance.</p>
<p>	The general principle of contribution by the friends is unchanged, 
namely, that everyone is free to contribute to whatever funds they wish,
 and to the degree their conscience and feeling of sacrifice moves them.
 At this time, however, we must actively bear in mind the many 
instructions of the Guardian, that we must now build up the 
international activities of the Faith, and consequently, the 
International Funds.</p>
<p>	(25 March 1953 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)<br>

</p><p>	1246. In your letter of September 28,1953, you mentioned the sum
 of... as being included in the... allocated from your Assembly's Budget
 to the World Centre. The principle involved is as follows: The Guardian
 feels that your Assembly when allocating its annual budget, and having 
stipulated what sum is for the purposes of the International Centre of 
the Faith, should immediately pigeon-hole that sum to be at the 
Guardian's disposal. Any monies received as contributions from the 
Baha'is for the International Centre should not be credited to this 
account which represents a national joint contribution, and has nothing 
to do with individual or local contributions forwarded to the World 
Centre in your care.</p>
<p>	(20 June 1954 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	1247. The contribution which you have made to the International Fund
 in memory of Mrs.... is greatly appreciated. This will be the means of 
much happiness to her, that her name will now be connected with the work
 at the World Centre.</p>
<p>	(10 August 1956 to the Spiritual Assembly of Ann Arbor, Michigan)</p>
<p>	1248. ...The Guardian feels that now that the new National Assembly 
has been established, with headquarters in Kampala, the Assembly should 
establish its own Bank Account. When this is done the moneys you have 
received for the Kampala Temple should be turned over to them, for 
deposit in their account. This applies not only to the munificent 
contribution of Mr...., but also to past contributions which you have 
received, and any which you may receive in the future.</p>
<p>	(10 June 1956 to the Hand of the Cause of God in Africa, Musa Banani)</p>
<p>	1249. In the November Minutes of the National Assembly Meeting, page
 28, the Guardian has noticed that the National Assembly plans to make a
 contribution of ... dollars to the Australia and New Zealand Assembly 
for their Temple. He wishes to know whether this is the contribution 
that Mrs. Collins has made for that purpose, or whether this is another 
contribution given from the funds of the National Assembly. If it is 
Mrs. Collins's contribution, then it should naturally be given under her
 name.</p>
<p>	(15 December 1956 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)<br>

</p><p>	1250. ...The institution of the National Fund, so vital and 
essential for the uninterrupted progress of these activities must, in 
particular, be assured of the whole- hearted, the ever-increasing and 
universal support of the mass of believers, for whose welfare, and in 
whose name, these beneficent activities have been initiated and have 
been conducted. All, no matter how modest their resources, must 
participate.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 8 
August 1957 written on his behalf to the National Spiritual Assembly of 
Central and East Africa)</p>
<p>	II. The Responsibility of Assemblies in Administering Baha'i Funds</p>
<p>	1251. ...The financial questions that confront the Cause are all 
very pressing and important. They need a judicious administration and 
wise policy. We should study the needs of the Cause, find which field 
will give the greatest yield, and then appropriate the necessary funds. 
And such a task is surely most difficult and responsible.</p>
<p>	(19 December 1929 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1252. Regarding his special contribution to the Teaching Fund: he 
feels that this is a matter to be left entirely to the discretion of the
 National Spiritual Assembly. He believes that the continuous 
expenditure of a considerable sum to provide for travelling expenses of 
teachers who are in need constitutes in these days the chief obligation 
of the national fund. An effort should be made to facilitate, as much as
 possible, the extension of the teaching work by helping those who are 
financially unable to reach their destination, and once there to 
encourage them to settle and earn the means of their livelihood.</p>
<p>	(14 November 1936 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United 
States and Canada, published in "Baha'i News" 105 (February 1937), p. 1)</p>
<p>	1253. With regard to your question concerning the National Baha'i 
Fund: there is nothing in the Declaration of Trust or the By-Laws which 
prevents the allocation of any funds to any individual who is in dire 
financial need. But it should be emphasized and clearly understood by 
the friends that the national interests and requirements of the Cause 
take absolute precedence over individual and private needs. It is the 
duty of the National Spiritual Assembly to so dispose of the national 
Fund as not to<br>
 allow the national interests of the Faith to be jeopardized by 
individual considerations that are obviously transient when compared to 
the lasting interests of the Cause of God. In rare and exceptional 
cases, when a believer has absolutely no other means of material 
sustenance, the National Spiritual Assembly may either contribute 
towards his expenses from the national Fund, or make a special appeal to
 the body of the believers to that effect. It is for the family, the 
civil community and the Local Assembly to administer to such local and 
private needs of the individual. But in case none of these sources has 
the means to do so, the National Spiritual Assembly may, if it is 
convinced of the gravity, urgency and justice of the case, appropriate a
 part of its fund for that purpose.</p>
<p>	(17 July 1937 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1254. ...The Guardian can only outline to you the principle, which 
is that Baha'i funds should not be invested in building up a place that 
has dear associations for a number of the friends, but is not going to 
really serve a large group of the believers....</p>
<p>	The Guardian's point is that National Bodies, when creating national
 institutions, should use sound judgement, because of the financial 
investment involved. This is only reasonable.</p>
<p>	(8 June 1952 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada, published in "Messages to Canada" p. 28)</p>
<p>	1255. He urges your Assembly, in addition to expediting the Temple 
work as much as reasonably possible, to carefully supervise expenditures
 and prevent the architect from getting extravagant ideas. It is only 
through a wise economy, the elimination of non-essentials, concentration
 on essentials and a careful supervision, that the Guardian himself has 
been able to build the Shrine and the International Archives at the 
World ('entre, and surround the Holy Places here by what appear in the 
eyes of the public to be lavish gardens, but are in reality the result 
of rigorous and economical planning. This will not only ensure that the 
budget of the Temple is adhered to, but will be a salutary example to 
the African Baha'is, who must not be led to believe that because the 
Baha'is of the world are building for them a Temple in the heart of 
their homelands, our resources are infinite and that the affairs of the 
Cause can be supported from abroad. The more they see that economy and 
intelligent<br>
 supervision of the work is carried on in connection with their own 
Temple, the more they will be encouraged to feel some financial 
responsibility toward their National Body. Having very little 
themselves, it is a delicate matter, and as he already informed your 
Assembly, under no circumstances should a heavy budget be imposed upon 
such weak communities, and thus discourage them from the outset, or lead
 them to believe that like the Missions, our money comes from abroad.</p>
<p>	(8 August 1957 to the National Spiritual Assembly of Central and East Africa)</p>
<p>	III. Who can contribute to the Fund?</p>
<p>	1256. To offer contributions towards this end [in support of the 
activities of the Spiritual Assembly] is one of the pressing 
requirements of the Cause of God, is deemed highly essential, and is of 
fundamental importance. Next to the payment of the Huquq, it is the 
obligation of every Baha'i.</p>
<p>	(Shoghi Effendi, from a letter dated 27 February 1927 to the Baha'is of the East - translated from the Persian)</p>
<p>	1257. I feel that only such goods as are owned by believers, whether
 made by Baha'is or non-Baha'is, may be sold in the interests of the 
Temple or any other Baha'i institutions, thus maintaining the general 
principle that non-believers are not, whether directly or indirectly, 
expected to contribute to the support of institutions that are of a 
strictly Baha'i character. As to the manner of the disposal of Baha'i 
property for such purposes, and the channel through which the sale may 
be effected, I feel that no rigid rule should be imposed. Individual 
Baha'is are free to seek the help of private individuals or of Spiritual
 Assemblies to act as intermediary for such transactions. We should 
avoid confusion on one hand and maintain efficiency on the other, and 
lay no unnecessary restrictions that would fetter individual initiative 
and enterprise.</p>
<p>	(In the handwriting of Shoghi Effendi, appended to a letter dated 4 
January 1929 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and
 Canada, published in "Baha'i News"31 (April 1929), p. 6)</p>
<p>	1258. In regard to Miss...'s contribution to the fund, Shoghi 
Effendi wishes you to make it quite clear to her that her 
money-offerings should be made to the Baha'i fund, and not to any 
individual. This being an important<br>
 principle governing all Baha'i publications and publishing societies, 
it should be duly emphasized and clearly understood, so that no 
difficulty may appear in the future. Of course, contributions should be 
accepted only when made by the Baha'is themselves. You should, 
therefore, first ascertain whether Miss... is a true Baha'i, and then 
and only then accept her contributions to your book fund.</p>
<p>	(14 April 1934 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1259. The question you have raised in connection with the 
recommendation made by the Convention delegates this year to the effect 
of installing a Radio sending station in the Temple involves a 
fundamental principle governing the Temple Fund which the Guardian has 
already explained in several communications. He wishes me to stress 
again that under no circumstances should the believers accept any 
financial help from non-Baha'is for use in connection with specific 
administrative activities of the Faith such as the Temple construction 
fund, and other local or national Baha'i administrative funds. The 
reason for this is twofold: First because the institutions which the 
Baha'is are gradually building are in the nature of gifts from 
Baha'u'llah to the world; and secondly the acceptance of funds from 
non-believers for specific Baha'i use would, sooner or later, involve 
the Baha'is in unforeseen complications and difficulties with others, 
and thus cause incalculable harm to the body of the Cause.</p>
<p>	(14 April 1934 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1260. You may not perhaps know that in connection with all National 
Assemblies the Guardian is advising that rules and regulations should 
not be multiplied and new statements on "procedure" issued; we should be
 elastic in details and rigid in principles; consequently he does not 
want your Assembly to issue statements of a binding nature unless 
absolutely necessary. In this connection he will answer your questions 
about sanctions: there is nothing to object to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 
of your letter of March 4th, but no. 3 is incorrect; it is only those 
who have been spiritually excommunicated by the Guardian with whom the 
believers are forbidden to associate, and not a person who is being 
punished by being deprived of his voting rights. As contributions to 
Baha'i Funds are used to support the administration of the Faith, they 
should not be accepted<br>
 from those who are deprived of their voting rights; but such believers 
should not be prevented from being buried in a Baha'i Cemetery or 
receiving charity -- which we even give to non-Baha'is...</p>
<p>	(8 May 1947 to the National Spiritual Assembly of India, Pakistan, and Burma, published in "Dawn of a New Day", p. 123)</p>
<p>	1261. ...Any Baha'i can give to the Cause's Funds, adult or child. 
No statement is required on this subject; Baha'i children have always 
given to the Cause, everywhere. Whatever situation may arise in a class 
which non-Baha'i children attend is for the teacher of the class to 
solve. No ruling should be made to cover such things.</p>
<p>	(18 August 1949 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	1262. Regarding Mr....'s bequest to the Temple: your Assembly should
 inform his widow that, because he was not a Baha'i, we cannot use his 
money for our purposes, as we consider our Faith and its institutions 
our free gift to humanity; you can, however, and indeed should, accept 
it for charity and expend it in his name.</p>
<p>	(5 July 1950 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, published in "Baha'i News" 236 (October 1950), p. 2)</p>
<p>	1263. ...Thank you for the report you enclosed in your letter 
regarding the Fund, and in this connection he wishes to answer your 
question about Mrs....'s Trust Fund: We cannot accept money from 
non-Baha'is for the Cause. It would seem if the family of Mrs.... wish 
to do this for her (and it is certainly a highly praiseworthy idea) they
 must take action during her lifetime to establish such a Trust as the 
property of Mrs...., otherwise the Cause could only accept to use the 
money for charitable purposes, for Baha'i and non-Baha'i.</p>
<p>	(4 October 1950 to an individual believer)</p>
<p>	1264. As regards the question of the Baha'i School in India: As this
 institution is run by Baha'is but for the benefit of both Baha'is and 
any other group sending its children there, he sees no reason why a 
school concert should not receive money from the public attending, and 
use it<br>
 for the school itself. It is not the same as a bazaar where the things sold are solely for the Baha'i Fund.</p>
<p>	(30 June 1952 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States)</p>
<p>	1265. As regards the question of accepting contributions from people
 whose voting rights are suspended, the Guardian says this is not 
permissible.</p>
