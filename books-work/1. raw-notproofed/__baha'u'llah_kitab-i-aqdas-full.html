<p>In 1953 Shoghi
Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, included as one of the
goals of his Ten Year Plan the preparation of a Synopsis and
Codification of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas as an
essential prelude to its translation. He himself worked on the
codification, but had not finished it when he died in 1957. The task
was continued on the basis of his work, and the resulting volume was
released in 1973. That publication included, in addition to the
Synopsis and Codification itself and explanatory notes, a compilation
of the passages from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas which had already been
translated by Shoghi Effendi and published in various books. The
Synopsis and Codification covered the text of both the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
and the Questions and Answers which constitutes an appendix to the
Aqdas. In 1986 the Universal House of Justice decided that the time
had come when the preparation of an English translation of the
complete text of the Most Holy Book was both possible and essential
and made its accomplishment a goal of the Six Year Plan 1986–1992.
Its publication in English will be followed by translations in other
languages.</p>
<p>
It has been recognized that the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, being Sacred
Scripture, should be presented in a form which can be read with ease
and inspiration, uncluttered with the footnotes and index numbers
that are common in scholarly texts. Nonetheless, to assist the reader
in following the flow of the text and its changing themes, paragraph
divisions have been added — such divisions not being common in works
of Arabic literature — and these paragraphs have then been numbered
for ease of access and indexing, as well as for uniformity of
reference in all the languages in which the work will be published.</p>
<p>
Following the text of the Aqdas is a brief compilation of Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh which are supplementary to the Most Holy Book, and
a translation of the Questions and Answers published here for the
first time.</p>
<p>
Shoghi Effendi had stated that the English translation of the Aqdas
should be “copiously annotated.” The policy followed in preparing
the notes has been to concentrate on those points which might strike
a non-Arabic-speaking reader as obscure or which, for various
reasons, require elucidation or background information. They are not
intended to be a comprehensive commentary on the text beyond these
fundamental requirements.</p>
<p>
The notes, which are placed following the Synopsis and Codification,
are numbered sequentially. Each is preceded by a quotation of the
passage to which it relates, and indicates the number of the
paragraph in which this appears. This facilitates cross-reference
between the text and the notes, while making it possible for readers
to study the notes without repeatedly consulting the text, if they so
prefer. It is hoped in this way to meet the needs of readers of a
wide range of backgrounds and interests.</p>
<p>
The index provides a guide to subjects in all sections of the volume.</p>
<p>
The significance and character of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the range of
subjects it contains have been graphically depicted by Shoghi Effendi
in his history of the first Bahá’í century entitled <i>God Passes
By</i>. As an assistance to the reader, these passages are provided
in the section that immediately follows the introduction. The
Synopsis and Codification, which is republished in this volume,
serves as another aid for obtaining an overview of the Book. </p>

<p>This year, the
149th of the Bahá’í era, marks the Centenary of the Ascension of
Bahá’u’lláh, Bearer of the universal Revelation of God destined
to lead humanity to its collective coming of age. That this occasion
should be observed by a community of believers representing a
cross-section of the entire human race and established, in the course
of a century and a half, in the most remote corners of the globe, is
a token of the forces of unity released by Bahá’u’lláh’s
advent. A further testimony to the operation of these same forces can
be seen in the extent to which Bahá’u’lláh’s vision has
prefigured contemporary human experience in so many of its aspects.
It is a propitious moment for the publication of this first
authorized translation into English of the Mother Book of His
Revelation, His “Most Holy Book,” the Book in which He sets forth
the Laws of God for a Dispensation destined to endure for no less
than a thousand years.</p>
<p>
Of the more than one hundred volumes comprising the sacred Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is of unique importance. <i>“To
build anew the whole world”</i> is the claim and challenge of His
Message, and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is the Charter of the future world
civilization that Bahá’u’lláh has come to raise up. Its
provisions rest squarely on the foundation established by past
religions, for, in the words of Bahá’u’lláh, <i>“This is the
changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future.”</i>
In this Revelation the concepts of the past are brought to a new
level of understanding, and the social laws, changed to suit the age
now dawning, are designed to carry humanity forward into a world
civilization the splendors of which can as yet be scarcely imagined.</p>
<p>
In its affirmation of the validity of the great religions of the
past, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas reiterates those eternal truths enunciated
by all the Divine Messengers: the unity of God, love of one’s
neighbor, and the moral purpose of earthly life. At the same time it
removes those elements of past religious codes that now constitute
obstacles to the emerging unification of the world and the
reconstruction of human society.</p>
<p>
The Law of God for this Dispensation addresses the needs of the
entire human family. There are laws in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas which are
directed primarily to the members of a specific section of humanity
and can be immediately understood by them but which, at first
reading, may be obscure to people of a different culture. Such, for
example, is the law prohibiting the confession of sins to a fellow
human being which, though understandable by those of Christian
background, may puzzle others. Many laws relate to those of past
Dispensations, especially the two most recent ones, those of Muḥammad
and the Báb embodied in the Qur’án and the Bayán. Nevertheless,
although certain ordinances of the Aqdas have such a focused
reference, they also have universal implications. Through His Law,
Bahá’u’lláh gradually unveils the significance of the new
levels of knowledge and behavior to which the peoples of the world
are being called. He embeds His precepts in a setting of spiritual
commentary, keeping ever before the mind of the reader the principle
that these laws, no matter the subject with which they deal, serve
the manifold purposes of bringing tranquillity to human society,
raising the standard of human behavior, increasing the range of human
understanding, and spiritualizing the life of each and all.
Throughout, it is the relationship of the individual soul to God and
the fulfillment of its spiritual destiny that is the ultimate aim of
the laws of religion. <i>“Think not,”</i> is Bahá’u’lláh’s
own assertion, <i>“that We have revealed unto you a mere code of
laws. Nay, rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers
of might and power.”</i> His Book of Laws is His <i>“weightiest
testimony unto all people, and the proof of the All-Merciful unto all
who are in heaven and all who are on earth.”</i></p>
<p>
An introduction to the spiritual universe unveiled in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas would fail in its purpose if it did not acquaint the
reader with the interpretive and legislative institutions that
Bahá’u’lláh has indissolubly linked with the system of law thus
revealed. At the foundation of this guidance lies the unique role
which Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings — indeed the text of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas itself — confer on His eldest son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
This unique figure is at once the Exemplar of the pattern of life
taught by His Father, the divinely inspired authoritative Interpreter
of His Teachings and the Center and Pivot of the Covenant which the
Author of the Bahá’í Revelation made with all who recognize Him.
The twenty-nine years of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry endowed
the Bahá’í world with a luminous body of commentary that opens
multiple vistas of understanding on His Father’s purpose.</p>
<p>
In His Will and Testament ‘Abdu’l-Bahá conferred the
mantle of Guardian of the Cause and infallible Interpreter of its
teachings upon His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, and confirmed the
authority and guarantee of divine guidance decreed by Bahá’u’lláh
for the Universal House of Justice on all matters <i>“which have
not outwardly been revealed in the Book.”</i> The Guardianship and
the Universal House of Justice can thus be seen to be, in the words
of Shoghi Effendi, the “Twin Successors” of Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They are the supreme institutions of the
Administrative Order which was founded and anticipated in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas and elaborated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will.</p>
<p>
During the thirty-six years of his ministry, Shoghi Effendi raised up
the structure of elected Spiritual Assemblies — the Houses of Justice
referred to in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, now in their embryonic stage — and
with their collaboration initiated the systematic implementation of
the Divine Plan that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had laid out for the
diffusion of the Faith throughout the world. He also set in motion,
on the basis of the strong administrative structure that had been
established, the processes which were an essential preparation for
the election of the Universal House of Justice. This body, which came
into existence in April 1963, is elected through secret ballot and
plurality vote in a three-stage election by adult Bahá’ís
throughout the world. The revealed Word of Bahá’u’lláh,
together with the interpretations and expositions of the Center of
the Covenant and the Guardian of the Cause, constitute the binding
terms of reference of the Universal House of Justice and are its
bedrock foundation.</p>
<p>
As to the laws themselves, a careful scrutiny discloses that they
govern three areas: the individual’s relationship to God, physical
and spiritual matters which benefit the individual directly, and
relations among individuals and between the individual and society.
They can be grouped under the following headings: prayer and fasting;
laws of personal status governing marriage, divorce and inheritance;
a range of other laws, ordinances and prohibitions, as well as
exhortations; and the abrogation of specific laws and ordinances of
previous Dispensations. A salient characteristic is their brevity.
They constitute the kernel of a vast range of law that will arise in
centuries to come. This elaboration of the law will be enacted by the
Universal House of Justice under the authority conferred upon it by
Bahá’u’lláh Himself. In one of His Tablets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
elucidates this principle:</p>

<p>
<i>Those matters of major importance which constitute the foundation
of the Law of God are explicitly recorded in the Text, but subsidiary
laws are left to the House of Justice. The wisdom of this is that the
times never remain the same, for change is a necessary quality and an
essential attribute of this world, and of time and place. Therefore
the House of Justice will take action accordingly…</i></p>
<p>
<i>Briefly, this is the wisdom of referring the laws of society to
the House of Justice. In the religion of Islám, similarly, not every
ordinance was explicitly revealed; nay not a tenth part of a tenth
part was included in the Text; although all matters of major
importance were specifically referred to, there were undoubtedly
thousands of laws which were unspecified. These were devised by the
divines of a later age according to the laws of Islamic
jurisprudence, and individual divines made conflicting deductions
from the original revealed ordinances. All these were enforced. Today
this process of deduction is the right of the body of the House of
Justice, and the deductions and conclusions of individual learned men
have no authority, unless they are endorsed by the House of Justice.
The difference is precisely this, that from the conclusions and
endorsements of the body of the House of Justice whose members are
elected by and known to the worldwide Bahá’í community, no
differences will arise; whereas the conclusions of individual divines
and scholars would definitely lead to differences, and result in
schism, division, and dispersion. The oneness of the Word would be
destroyed, the unity of the Faith would disappear, and the edifice of
the Faith of God would be shaken.</i></p>

<p>
Although the Universal House of Justice is explicitly authorized to
change or repeal its own legislation as conditions change, thus
providing Bahá’í law with an essential element of flexibility, it
cannot abrogate or change any of the laws which are explicitly laid
down in the sacred Text.</p>
<p>
The society for which certain of the laws of the Aqdas are designed
will come only gradually into being, and Bahá’u’lláh has
provided for the progressive application of Bahá’í law:</p>

<p>
<i>Indeed, the laws of God are like unto the ocean and the children
of men as fish, did they but know it. However, in observing them one
must exercise tact and wisdom… Since most people are feeble and
far-removed from the purpose of God, therefore one must observe tact
and prudence under all conditions, so that nothing might happen that
could cause disturbance and dissension or raise clamor among the
heedless. Verily, His bounty hath surpassed the whole universe and
His bestowals encompassed all that dwell on earth. One must guide
mankind to the ocean of true understanding in a spirit of love and
tolerance. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas itself beareth eloquent testimony to
the loving providence of God.</i></p>

<p>
The principle governing this progressive application was enunciated
in a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National
Spiritual Assembly in 1935:</p>

<p>
The laws revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in the Aqdas are, whenever
practicable and not in direct conflict with the Civil Law of the
land, absolutely binding on every believer or Bahá’í institution
whether in the East or in the West. Certain … laws should be
regarded by all believers as universally and vitally applicable at
the present time. Others have been formulated in anticipation of a
state of society destined to emerge from the chaotic conditions that
prevail today… What has not been formulated in the Aqdas, in
addition to matters of detail and of secondary importance arising out
of the application of the laws already formulated by Bahá’u’lláh,
will have to be enacted by the Universal House of Justice. This body
can supplement but never invalidate or modify in the least degree
what has already been formulated by Bahá’u’lláh. Nor has the
Guardian any right whatsoever to lessen the binding effect much less
to abrogate the provisions of so fundamental and sacred a Book.</p>

<p>
The number of laws binding on Bahá’ís is not increased by the
publication of this translation. When it is deemed timely, the Bahá’í
community will be advised which additional laws are binding upon
believers, and any guidance or supplementary legislation necessary
for their application will be provided.</p>
<p>
In general, the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are stated succinctly. An
example of this conciseness can be seen in the fact that many are
expressed only as they apply to a man, but it is apparent from the
Guardian’s writings that, where Bahá’u’lláh has given a law
as between a man and a woman, it applies <i>mutatis mutandis</i>
between a woman and a man unless the context makes this impossible.
For example, the text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas forbids a man to marry
his father’s wife (i.e. his stepmother), and the Guardian has
indicated that likewise a woman is forbidden to marry her stepfather.
This understanding of the implications of the Law has far-reaching
effects in light of the fundamental Bahá’í principle of the
equality of the sexes, and should be borne in mind when the sacred
Text is studied. That men and women differ from one another in
certain characteristics and functions is an inescapable fact of
nature and makes possible their complementary roles in certain areas
of the life of society; but it is significant that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
has stated that in this Dispensation <i>“Equality of men and women,
except in some negligible instances, has been fully and categorically
announced.”</i></p>
<p>
Mention has already been made of the intimate relationship between
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Holy Books of previous Dispensations.
Especially close is the relationship to the Bayán, the Book of Laws
revealed by the Báb. It is elucidated in the following excerpts from
letters written on behalf of the Guardian:</p>

<p>
Shoghi Effendi feels that the unity of the Bahá’í Revelation as
one complete whole embracing the Faith of the Báb should be
emphasized… The Faith of the Báb should not be divorced from that
of Bahá’u’lláh. Though the teachings of the Bayán have been
abrogated and superseded by the laws of the Aqdas, yet due to the
fact that the Báb considered Himself as the Forerunner of
Bahá’u’lláh, we would regard His Dispensation together with
that of Bahá’u’lláh as forming one entity, the former being
introductory to the advent of the latter.</p>
<p>
The Báb states that His laws are provisional and depend upon the
acceptance of the future Manifestation. This is why in the Book of
Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh sanctions some of the laws found in the
Bayán, modifies others and sets aside many.</p>

<p>
Just as the Bayán had been revealed by the Báb at about the
midpoint of His Ministry, Bahá’u’lláh revealed the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas around 1873, some twenty years after He had received,
in the Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál of Ṭihrán, the intimation of His
Revelation. In one of His Tablets He indicates that even after its
revelation the Aqdas was withheld by Him for some time before it was
sent to the friends in Iran. Thereafter, as Shoghi Effendi has
related:</p>

<p>
The formulation by Bahá’u’lláh, in His Kitáb-i-Aqdas, of the
fundamental laws of His Dispensation was followed, as His Mission
drew to a close, by the enunciation of certain precepts and
principles which lie at the very core of His Faith, by the
reaffirmation of truths He had previously proclaimed, by the
elaboration and elucidation of some of the laws He had already laid
down, by the revelation of further prophecies and warnings, and by
the establishment of subsidiary ordinances designed to supplement the
provisions of His Most Holy Book. These were recorded in unnumbered
Tablets, which He continued to reveal until the last days of His
earthly life…</p>

<p>
Among such works is the Questions and Answers, a compilation made by
Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín, the most eminent of the transcribers of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings. Consisting of answers revealed by
Bahá’u’lláh to questions put to Him by various believers, it
constitutes an invaluable appendix to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. In 1978 the
most noteworthy of the other Tablets of this nature were published in
English as a compilation entitled <i>Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh
revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i>.</p>
<p>
Some years after the revelation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh
had manuscript copies sent to Bahá’ís in Iran, and in the year
1308 A.H. (1890–91 A.D.), towards the end of His life, He arranged
for the publication of the original Arabic text of the Book in
Bombay.</p>
<p>
A word should be said about the style of language in which the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas has been rendered into English. Bahá’u’lláh
enjoyed a superb mastery of Arabic, and preferred to use it in those
Tablets and other Writings where its precision of meaning was
particularly appropriate to the exposition of basic principle. Beyond
the choice of language itself, however, the style employed is of an
exalted and emotive character, immensely compelling, particularly to
those familiar with the great literary tradition out of which it
arose. In taking up his task of translation, Shoghi Effendi faced the
challenge of finding an English style which would not only faithfully
convey the exactness of the text’s meaning, but would also evoke in
the reader the spirit of meditative reverence which is a
distinguishing feature of response to the original. The form of
expression he selected, reminiscent of the style used by the
seventeenth-century translators of the Bible, captures the elevated
mode of Bahá’u’lláh’s Arabic, while remaining accessible to
the contemporary reader. His translations, moreover, are illumined by
his uniquely inspired understanding of the purport and implications
of the originals.</p>
<p>
Although both Arabic and English are languages with rich vocabularies
and varied modes of expression, their forms differ widely from one
another. The Arabic of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is marked by intense
concentration and terseness of expression. It is a characteristic of
this style that if a connotation is obvious it should not be
explicitly stated. This presents a problem for a reader whose
cultural, religious and literary background is entirely different
from that of Arabic. A literal translation of a passage which is
clear in the Arabic could be obscure in English. It therefore becomes
necessary to include in the English translation of such passages that
element of the Arabic sentence which is obviously implicit in the
original. At the same time, it is vital to avoid extrapolating this
process to the point where it would add unjustifiably to the original
or limit its meaning. Striking the right balance between beauty and
clarity of expression on the one hand, and literalness on the other,
is one of the major issues with which the translators have had to
grapple and which has caused repeated reconsideration of the
rendering of certain passages. Another major issue is the legal
implication of certain Arabic terms which have a range of meanings
different from those of similar terms in English.</p>
<p>
Sacred Scripture clearly requires especial care and faithfulness in
translation. This is supremely important in the case of a Book of
Laws, where it is vital that the reader not be misled or drawn into
fruitless disputation. As had been foreseen, the translation of the
Most Holy Book has been a work of the utmost difficulty, requiring
consultation with experts in many lands. Since some one-third of the
text had already been translated by Shoghi Effendi, it was necessary
to strive for three qualities in the translation of the remaining
passages: accuracy of meaning, beauty of English, and conformity of
style with that used by Shoghi Effendi.</p>
<p>
We are now satisfied that the translation has reached a point where
it represents an acceptable rendering of the original. Nevertheless,
it will undoubtedly give rise to questions and suggestions which may
shed further light on its content. We are profoundly grateful for the
assiduous and meticulous labors of the members of the Committees whom
we commissioned to prepare and review this translation of the Aqdas
and to compose the annotations. We are confident that this first
authorized English edition of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas will enable its
readers to obtain at least an inkling of the splendor of the Mother
Book of the Bahá’í Dispensation.</p>
<p>
Our world has entered the dark heart of an age of fundamental change
beyond anything in all of its tumultuous history. Its peoples, of
whatever race, nation, or religion, are being challenged to
subordinate all lesser loyalties and limiting identities to their
oneness as citizens of a single planetary homeland. In Bahá’u’lláh’s
words: <i>“the well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are
unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.”</i>
May the publication of this translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas lend a
fresh impulse to the realization of this universal vision, opening
vistas of a worldwide regeneration.</p>

    <div class='subtitle smaller'>Taken from <i>God Passes By</i>, his history of the first Bahá’í century</div>
  </div> <!-- section_header -->


<p>Unique and
stupendous as was this Proclamation, it proved to be but a prelude to
a still mightier revelation of the creative power of its Author, and
to what may well rank as the most signal act of His ministry — the
promulgation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Alluded to in the Kitáb-i-Íqán,
the principal repository of that Law which the Prophet Isaiah had
anticipated, and which the writer of the Apocalypse had described as
the <i>“new heaven”</i> and the <i>“new earth,”</i> as <i>“the
Tabernacle of God,”</i> as the <i>“Holy City,”</i> as the
<i>“Bride,”</i> the <i>“New Jerusalem coming down from God,”</i>
this <i>“Most Holy Book,”</i> whose provisions must remain
inviolate for no less than a thousand years, and whose system will
embrace the entire planet, may well be regarded as the brightest
emanation of the mind of Bahá’u’lláh, as the Mother Book of His
Dispensation, and the Charter of His New World Order.</p>
<p>
Revealed soon after Bahá’u’lláh had been transferred to the
house of ‘Údí <u>Kh</u>ammár (circa 1873), at a time when He was
still encompassed by the tribulations that had afflicted Him, through
the acts committed by His enemies and the professed adherents of His
Faith, this Book, this treasury enshrining the priceless gems of His
Revelation, stands out, by virtue of the principles it inculcates,
the administrative institutions it ordains and the function with
which it invests the appointed Successor of its Author, unique and
incomparable among the world’s sacred Scriptures. For, unlike the
Old Testament and the Holy Books which preceded it, in which the
actual precepts uttered by the Prophet Himself are nonexistent;
unlike the Gospels, in which the few sayings attributed to Jesus
Christ afford no clear guidance regarding the future administration
of the affairs of His Faith; unlike even the Qur’án which, though
explicit in the laws and ordinances formulated by the Apostle of God,
is silent on the all-important subject of the succession, the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, revealed from first to last by the Author of the
Dispensation Himself, not only preserves for posterity the basic laws
and ordinances on which the fabric of His future World Order must
rest, but ordains, in addition to the function of interpretation
which it confers upon His Successor, the necessary institutions
through which the integrity and unity of His Faith can alone be
safeguarded.</p>
<p>
In this Charter of the future world civilization its Author — at once
the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Unifier and Redeemer of
mankind — announces to the kings of the earth the promulgation of the
<i>“Most Great Law”</i>; pronounces them to be His vassals;
proclaims Himself the <i>“King of Kings”</i>; disclaims any
intention of laying hands on their kingdoms; reserves for Himself the
right to <i>“seize and possess the hearts of men”</i>; warns the
world’s ecclesiastical leaders not to weigh the <i>“Book of God”</i>
with such standards as are current amongst them; and affirms that the
Book itself is the <i>“Unerring Balance”</i> established amongst
men. In it He formally ordains the institution of the <i>“House of
Justice,”</i> defines its functions, fixes its revenues, and
designates its members as the <i>“Men of Justice,”</i> the
<i>“Deputies of God,”</i> the <i>“Trustees of the
All-Merciful”</i>; alludes to the future Center of His Covenant,
and invests Him with the right of interpreting His holy Writ;
anticipates by implication the institution of Guardianship; bears
witness to the revolutionizing effect of His World Order; enunciates
the doctrine of the <i>“Most Great Infallibility”</i> of the
Manifestation of God; asserts this infallibility to be the inherent
and exclusive right of the Prophet; and rules out the possibility of
the appearance of another Manifestation ere the lapse of at least one
thousand years.</p>
<p>
In this Book He, moreover, prescribes the obligatory prayers;
designates the time and period of fasting; prohibits congregational
prayer except for the dead; fixes the Qiblih; institutes the
Ḥuqúqu’lláh (Right of God); formulates the law of inheritance;
ordains the institution of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár;
establishes the Nineteen Day Feast, the Bahá’í festivals and the
Intercalary Days; abolishes the institution of priesthood; prohibits
slavery, asceticism, mendicancy, monasticism, penance, the use of
pulpits and the kissing of hands; prescribes monogamy; condemns
cruelty to animals, idleness and sloth, backbiting and calumny;
censures divorce; interdicts gambling, the use of opium, wine and
other intoxicating drinks; specifies the punishments for murder,
arson, adultery and theft; stresses the importance of marriage and
lays down its essential conditions; imposes the obligation of
engaging in some trade or profession, exalting such occupation to the
rank of worship; emphasizes the necessity of providing the means for
the education of children; and lays upon every person the duty of
writing a testament and of strict obedience to one’s government.</p>
<p>
Apart from these provisions Bahá’u’lláh exhorts His followers
to consort, with amity and concord and without discrimination, with
the adherents of all religions; warns them to guard against
fanaticism, sedition, pride, dispute and contention; inculcates upon
them immaculate cleanliness, strict truthfulness, spotless chastity,
trustworthiness, hospitality, fidelity, courtesy, forbearance,
justice and fairness; counsels them to be <i>“even as the fingers
of one hand and the limbs of one body”</i>; calls upon them to
arise and serve His Cause; and assures them of His undoubted aid. He,
furthermore, dwells upon the instability of human affairs; declares
that true liberty consists in man’s submission to His commandments;
cautions them not to be indulgent in carrying out His statutes;
prescribes the twin inseparable duties of recognizing the <i>“Dayspring
of God’s Revelation”</i> and of observing all the ordinances
revealed by Him, neither of which, He affirms, is acceptable without
the other.</p>
<p>
The significant summons issued to the Presidents of the Republics of
the American continent to seize their opportunity in the Day of God
and to champion the cause of justice; the injunction to the members
of parliaments throughout the world, urging the adoption of a
universal script and language; His warnings to William I, the
conqueror of Napoleon III; the reproof He administers to Francis
Joseph, the Emperor of Austria; His reference to <i>“the
lamentations of Berlin”</i> in His apostrophe to <i>“the banks of
the Rhine”</i>; His condemnation of <i>“the throne of tyranny”</i>
established in Constantinople, and His prediction of the extinction
of its <i>“outward splendor”</i> and of the tribulations destined
to overtake its inhabitants; the words of cheer and comfort He
addresses to His native city, assuring her that God had chosen her to
be <i>“the source of the joy of all mankind”</i>; His prophecy
that <i>“the voice of the heroes of <u>Kh</u>urásán”</i>
will be raised in glorification of their Lord; His assertion that men
<i>“endued with mighty valor”</i> will be raised up in Kirmán
who will make mention of Him; and finally, His magnanimous assurance
to a perfidious brother who had afflicted Him with such anguish, that
an <i>“ever-forgiving, all-bounteous”</i> God would forgive him
his iniquities were he only to repent — all these further enrich the
contents of a Book designated by its Author as <i>“the source of
true felicity,”</i> as the <i>“Unerring Balance,”</i> as the
<i>“Straight Path,”</i> and as the <i>“quickener of mankind.”</i></p>
<p>
The laws and ordinances that constitute the major theme of this Book,
Bahá’u’lláh, moreover, has specifically characterized as <i>“the
breath of life unto all created things,”</i> as <i>“the mightiest
stronghold,”</i> as the <i>“fruits”</i> of His <i>“Tree,”</i>
as <i>“the highest means for the maintenance of order in the world
and the security of its peoples,”</i> as <i>“the lamps of His
wisdom and loving-providence,”</i> as <i>“the sweet-smelling
savor of His garment,”</i> and the <i>“keys”</i> of His <i>“mercy”</i>
to His creatures. <i>“This Book,”</i> He Himself testifies, <i>“is
a heaven which We have adorned with the stars of Our commandments and
prohibitions.”</i> <i>“Blessed the man,”</i> He, moreover, has
stated, <i>“who will read it, and ponder the verses sent down in it
by God, the Lord of Power, the Almighty. Say, O men! Take hold of it
with the hand of resignation … By My life! It hath been sent down
in a manner that amazeth the minds of men. Verily, it is My
weightiest testimony unto all people, and the proof of the
All-Merciful unto all who are in heaven and all who are on earth.”</i>
And again: <i>“Blessed the palate that savoreth its sweetness, and
the perceiving eye that recognizeth that which is treasured therein,
and the understanding heart that comprehendeth its allusions and
mysteries. By God! Such is the majesty of what hath been revealed
therein, and so tremendous the revelation of its veiled allusions
that the loins of utterance shake when attempting their description.”</i>
And finally: <i>“In such a manner hath the Kitáb-i-Aqdas been
revealed that it attracteth and embraceth all the divinely appointed
Dispensations. Blessed those who peruse it! Blessed those who
apprehend it! Blessed those who meditate upon it! Blessed those who
ponder its meaning! So vast is its range that it hath encompassed all
men ere their recognition of it. Erelong will its sovereign power,
its pervasive influence and the greatness of its might be manifested
on earth.”</i></p>

<div class='par' id='1.1' data-ref='ka_en-1-1'>
  <div class='preamble'>In
  the name of Him Who is the Supreme Ruler over all that hath been and
  all that is to be</div>
  <div class='dropcap'>
  The first duty
  prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of Him Who is
  the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Fountain of His laws, Who
  representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the
  world of creation. Whoso achieveth this duty hath attained unto all
  good; and whoso is deprived thereof hath gone astray, though he be
  the author of every righteous deed. It behooveth everyone who
  reacheth this most sublime station, this summit of transcendent
  glory, to observe every ordinance of Him Who is the Desire of the
  world. These twin duties are inseparable. Neither is acceptable
  without the other. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Source
  of Divine inspiration. </div>
</div>


<p id='1.2' data-ref='ka_en-1-2'>
They whom God hath endued with insight will readily recognize that
the precepts laid down by God constitute the highest means for the
maintenance of order in the world and the security of its peoples. He
that turneth away from them is accounted among the abject and
foolish. We, verily, have commanded you to refuse the dictates of
your evil passions and corrupt desires, and not to transgress the
bounds which the Pen of the Most High hath fixed, for these are the
breath of life unto all created things. The seas of Divine wisdom and
Divine utterance have risen under the breath of the breeze of the
All-Merciful. Hasten to drink your fill, O men of understanding! They
that have violated the Covenant of God by breaking His commandments,
and have turned back on their heels, these have erred grievously in
the sight of God, the All-Possessing, the Most High. </p>


<p id='1.3' data-ref='ka_en-1-3'>
O ye peoples of the world! Know assuredly that My commandments are
the lamps of My loving providence among My servants, and the keys of
My mercy for My creatures. Thus hath it been sent down from the
heaven of the Will of your Lord, the Lord of Revelation. Were any man
to taste the sweetness of the words which the lips of the
All-Merciful have willed to utter, he would, though the treasures of
the earth be in his possession, renounce them one and all, that he
might vindicate the truth of even one of His commandments, shining
above the Dayspring of His bountiful care and loving-kindness. </p>


<p id='1.4' data-ref='ka_en-1-4'>
Say: From My laws the sweet-smelling savor of My garment can be
smelled, and by their aid the standards of Victory will be planted
upon the highest peaks. The Tongue of My power hath, from the heaven
of My omnipotent glory, addressed to My creation these words:
“Observe My commandments, for the love of My beauty.” Happy is
the lover that hath inhaled the divine fragrance of his Best-Beloved
from these words, laden with the perfume of a grace which no tongue
can describe. By My life! He who hath drunk the choice wine of
fairness from the hands of My bountiful favor will circle around My
commandments that shine above the Dayspring of My creation. </p>


<p id='1.5' data-ref='ka_en-1-5'>
Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay,
rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might
and power. To this beareth witness that which the Pen of Revelation
hath revealed. Meditate upon this, O men of insight! </p>


<p id='1.6' data-ref='ka_en-1-6'>
We have enjoined obligatory prayer upon you, with nine rak‘ahs, to
be offered at noon and in the morning and the evening unto God, the
Revealer of Verses. We have relieved you of a greater number, as a
command in the Book of God. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the
Omnipotent, the Unrestrained. When ye desire to perform this prayer,
turn ye towards the Court of My Most Holy Presence, this Hallowed
Spot that God hath made the Center round which circle the Concourse
on High, and which He hath decreed to be the Point of Adoration for
the denizens of the Cities of Eternity, and the Source of Command
unto all that are in heaven and on earth; and when the Sun of Truth
and Utterance shall set, turn your faces towards the Spot that We
have ordained for you. He, verily, is Almighty and Omniscient. </p>


<p id='1.7' data-ref='ka_en-1-7'>
Everything that is hath come to be through His irresistible decree.
Whenever My laws appear like the sun in the heaven of Mine utterance,
they must be faithfully obeyed by all, though My decree be such as to
cause the heaven of every religion to be cleft asunder. He doeth what
He pleaseth. He chooseth, and none may question His choice.
Whatsoever He, the Well-Beloved, ordaineth, the same is, verily,
beloved. To this He Who is the Lord of all creation beareth Me
witness. Whoso hath inhaled the sweet fragrance of the All-Merciful,
and recognized the Source of this utterance, will welcome with his
own eyes the shafts of the enemy, that he may establish the truth of
the laws of God amongst men. Well is it with him that hath turned
thereunto, and apprehended the meaning of His decisive decree. </p>


<p id='1.8' data-ref='ka_en-1-8'>
We have set forth the details of obligatory prayer in another Tablet.
Blessed is he who observeth that whereunto he hath been bidden by Him
Who ruleth over all mankind. In the Prayer for the Dead six specific
passages have been sent down by God, the Revealer of Verses. Let one
who is able to read recite that which hath been revealed to precede
these passages; and as for him who is unable, God hath relieved him
of this requirement. He, of a truth, is the Mighty, the Pardoner. </p>


<p id='1.9' data-ref='ka_en-1-9'>
Hair doth not invalidate your prayer, nor aught from which the spirit
hath departed, such as bones and the like. Ye are free to wear the
fur of the sable as ye would that of the beaver, the squirrel, and
other animals; the prohibition of its use hath stemmed, not from the
Qur’án, but from the misconceptions of the divines. He, verily, is
the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing. </p>


<p id='1.10' data-ref='ka_en-1-10'>
We have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of
maturity; this is ordained by God, your Lord and the Lord of your
forefathers. He hath exempted from this those who are weak from
illness or age, as a bounty from His Presence, and He is the
Forgiving, the Generous. God hath granted you leave to prostrate
yourselves on any surface that is clean, for We have removed in this
regard the limitation that had been laid down in the Book; God,
indeed, hath knowledge of that whereof ye know naught. Let him that
findeth no water for ablution repeat five times the words “In the
Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure,” and then proceed to his
devotions. Such is the command of the Lord of all worlds. In regions
where the days and nights grow long, let times of prayer be gauged by
clocks and other instruments that mark the passage of the hours. He,
verily, is the Expounder, the Wise. </p>


<p id='1.11' data-ref='ka_en-1-11'>
We have absolved you from the requirement of performing the Prayer of
the Signs. On the appearance of fearful natural events call ye to
mind the might and majesty of your Lord, He Who heareth and seeth
all, and say “Dominion is God’s, the Lord of the seen and the
unseen, the Lord of creation.” </p>


<p id='1.12' data-ref='ka_en-1-12'>
It hath been ordained that obligatory prayer is to be performed by
each of you individually. Save in the Prayer for the Dead, the
practice of congregational prayer hath been annulled. He, of a truth,
is the Ordainer, the All-Wise. </p>


<p id='1.13' data-ref='ka_en-1-13'>
God hath exempted women who are in their courses from obligatory
prayer and fasting. Let them, instead, after performance of their
ablutions, give praise unto God, repeating ninety-five times between
the noon of one day and the next “Glorified be God, the Lord of
Splendor and Beauty.” Thus hath it been decreed in the Book, if ye
be of them that comprehend. </p>


<p id='1.14' data-ref='ka_en-1-14'>
When traveling, if ye should stop and rest in some safe spot, perform
ye — men and women alike — a single prostration in place of each
unsaid Obligatory Prayer, and while prostrating say “Glorified be
God, the Lord of Might and Majesty, of Grace and Bounty.” Whoso is
unable to do this, let him say only “Glorified be God”; this
shall assuredly suffice him. He is, of a truth, the all-sufficing,
the ever-abiding, the forgiving, compassionate God. Upon completing
your prostrations, seat yourselves cross-legged — men and women
alike — and eighteen times repeat “Glorified be God, the Lord of
the kingdoms of earth and heaven.” Thus doth the Lord make plain
the ways of truth and guidance, ways that lead to one way, which is
this Straight Path. Render thanks unto God for this most gracious
favor; offer praise unto Him for this bounty that hath encompassed
the heavens and the earth; extol Him for this mercy that hath
pervaded all creation. </p>


<p id='1.15' data-ref='ka_en-1-15'>
Say: God hath made My hidden love the key to the Treasure; would that
ye might perceive it! But for the key, the Treasure would to all
eternity have remained concealed; would that ye might believe it!
Say: This is the Source of Revelation, the Dawning-place of Splendor,
Whose brightness hath illumined the horizons of the world. Would that
ye might understand! This is, verily, that fixed Decree through which
every irrevocable decree hath been established. </p>


<p id='1.16' data-ref='ka_en-1-16'>
O Pen of the Most High! Say: O people of the world! We have enjoined
upon you fasting during a brief period, and at its close have
designated for you Naw-Rúz as a feast. Thus hath the Daystar of
Utterance shone forth above the horizon of the Book as decreed by Him
Who is the Lord of the beginning and the end. Let the days in excess
of the months be placed before the month of fasting. We have ordained
that these, amid all nights and days, shall be the manifestations of
the letter Há, and thus they have not been bounded by the limits of
the year and its months. It behooveth the people of Bahá, throughout
these days, to provide good cheer for themselves, their kindred and,
beyond them, the poor and needy, and with joy and exultation to hail
and glorify their Lord, to sing His praise and magnify His Name; and
when they end — these days of giving that precede the season of
restraint — let them enter upon the Fast. Thus hath it been ordained
by Him Who is the Lord of all mankind. The traveler, the ailing,
those who are with child or giving suck, are not bound by the Fast;
they have been exempted by God as a token of His grace. He, verily,
is the Almighty, the Most Generous. </p>


<p id='1.17' data-ref='ka_en-1-17'>
These are the ordinances of God that have been set down in the Books
and Tablets by His Most Exalted Pen. Hold ye fast unto His statutes
and commandments, and be not of those who, following their idle
fancies and vain imaginings, have clung to the standards fixed by
their own selves, and cast behind their backs the standards laid down
by God. Abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sundown, and
beware lest desire deprive you of this grace that is appointed in the
Book. </p>


<p id='1.18' data-ref='ka_en-1-18'>
It hath been ordained that every believer in God, the Lord of
Judgment, shall, each day, having washed his hands and then his face,
seat himself and, turning unto God, repeat “Alláh-u-Abhá”
ninety-five times. Such was the decree of the Maker of the Heavens
when, with majesty and power, He established Himself upon the thrones
of His Names. Perform ye, likewise, ablutions for the Obligatory
Prayer; this is the command of God, the Incomparable, the
Unrestrained. </p>


<p id='1.19' data-ref='ka_en-1-19'>
Ye have been forbidden to commit murder or adultery, or to engage in
backbiting or calumny; shun ye, then, what hath been prohibited in
the holy Books and Tablets. </p>


<p id='1.20' data-ref='ka_en-1-20'>
We have divided inheritance into seven categories: to the children,
We have allotted nine parts comprising five hundred and forty shares;
to the wife, eight parts comprising four hundred and eighty shares;
to the father, seven parts comprising four hundred and twenty shares;
to the mother, six parts comprising three hundred and sixty shares;
to the brothers, five parts or three hundred shares; to the sisters,
four parts or two hundred and forty shares; and to the teachers,
three parts or one hundred and eighty shares. Such was the ordinance
of My Forerunner, He Who extolleth My Name in the night season and at
the break of day. When We heard the clamor of the children as yet
unborn, We doubled their share and decreased those of the rest. He,
of a truth, hath power to ordain whatsoever He desireth, and He doeth
as He pleaseth by virtue of His sovereign might. </p>


<p id='1.21' data-ref='ka_en-1-21'>
Should the deceased leave no offspring, their share shall revert to
the House of Justice, to be expended by the Trustees of the
All-Merciful on the orphaned and widowed, and on whatsoever will
bring benefit to the generality of the people, that all may give
thanks unto their Lord, the All-Gracious, the Pardoner. </p>


<p id='1.22' data-ref='ka_en-1-22'>
Should the deceased leave offspring, but none of the other categories
of heirs that have been specified in the Book, they shall receive
two-thirds of the inheritance and the remaining third shall revert to
the House of Justice. Such is the command which hath been given, in
majesty and glory, by Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High. </p>


<p id='1.23' data-ref='ka_en-1-23'>
If the deceased should leave none of the specified heirs, but have
among his relatives nephews and nieces, whether on his brother’s or
his sister’s side, two-thirds of the inheritance shall pass to
them; or, lacking these, to his uncles and aunts on both his father’s
and his mother’s side, and after them to their sons and daughters.
The remaining third of the inheritance shall, in any case, revert to
the Seat of Justice. Thus hath it been laid down in the Book by Him
Who ruleth over all men. </p>


<p id='1.24' data-ref='ka_en-1-24'>
Should the deceased be survived by none of those whose names have
been recorded by the Pen of the Most High, his estate shall, in its
entirety, revert to the aforementioned Seat that it may be expended
on that which is prescribed by God. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the
Omnipotent. </p>


<p id='1.25' data-ref='ka_en-1-25'>
We have assigned the residence and personal clothing of the deceased
to the male, not female, offspring, nor to the other heirs. He,
verily, is the Munificent, the All-Bountiful. </p>


<p id='1.26' data-ref='ka_en-1-26'>
Should the son of the deceased have passed away in the days of his
father and have left children, they will inherit their father’s
share, as prescribed in the Book of God. Divide ye their share
amongst them with perfect justice. Thus have the billows of the Ocean
of Utterance surged, casting forth the pearls of the laws decreed by
the Lord of all mankind. </p>


<p id='1.27' data-ref='ka_en-1-27'>
If the deceased should leave children who are under age, their share
of the inheritance must be entrusted to a reliable individual, or to
a company, that it may be invested on their behalf in trade and
business until they come of age. The trustee should be assigned a due
share of the profit that hath accrued to it from being thus employed. </p>


<p id='1.28' data-ref='ka_en-1-28'>
Division of the estate should take place only after the Ḥuqúqu’lláh
hath been paid, any debts have been settled, the expenses of the
funeral and burial defrayed, and such provision made that the
deceased may be carried to his resting-place with dignity and honor.
Thus hath it been ordained by Him Who is Lord of the beginning and
the end. </p>


<p id='1.29' data-ref='ka_en-1-29'>
Say: This is that hidden knowledge which shall never change, since
its beginning is with nine, the symbol that betokeneth the concealed
and manifest, the inviolable and unapproachably exalted Name. As for
what We have appropriated to the children, this is a bounty conferred
on them by God, that they may render thanks unto their Lord, the
Compassionate, the Merciful. These, verily, are the Laws of God;
transgress them not at the prompting of your base and selfish
desires. Observe ye the injunctions laid upon you by Him Who is the
Dawning-place of Utterance. The sincere among His servants will
regard the precepts set forth by God as the Water of Life to the
followers of every faith, and the Lamp of wisdom and loving
providence to all the denizens of earth and heaven. </p>


<p id='1.30' data-ref='ka_en-1-30'>
The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be
established wherein shall gather counselors to the number of Bahá,
and should it exceed this number it doth not matter. They should
consider themselves as entering the Court of the presence of God, the
Exalted, the Most High, and as beholding Him Who is the Unseen. It
behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and
to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that
dwell on earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together
and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His
sake, even as they regard their own interests, and to choose that
which is meet and seemly. Thus hath the Lord your God commanded you.
Beware lest ye put away that which is clearly revealed in His Tablet.
Fear God, O ye that perceive. </p>


<p id='1.31' data-ref='ka_en-1-31'>
O people of the world! Build ye houses of worship throughout the
lands in the name of Him Who is the Lord of all religions. Make them
as perfect as is possible in the world of being, and adorn them with
that which befitteth them, not with images and effigies. Then, with
radiance and joy, celebrate therein the praise of your Lord, the Most
Compassionate. Verily, by His remembrance the eye is cheered and the
heart is filled with light. </p>


<p id='1.32' data-ref='ka_en-1-32'>
The Lord hath ordained that those of you who are able shall make
pilgrimage to the sacred House, and from this He hath exempted women
as a mercy on His part. He, of a truth, is the All-Bountiful, the
Most Generous. </p>


<p id='1.33' data-ref='ka_en-1-33'>
O people of Bahá! It is incumbent upon each one of you to engage in
some occupation — such as a craft, a trade or the like. We have
exalted your engagement in such work to the rank of worship of the
one true God. Reflect, O people, on the grace and blessings of your
Lord, and yield Him thanks at eventide and dawn. Waste not your hours
in idleness and sloth, but occupy yourselves with what will profit
you and others. Thus hath it been decreed in this Tablet from whose
horizon hath shone the daystar of wisdom and utterance. The most
despised of men in the sight of God are they who sit and beg. Hold ye
fast unto the cord of means and place your trust in God, the Provider
of all means. </p>


<p id='1.34' data-ref='ka_en-1-34'>
The kissing of hands hath been forbidden in the Book. This practice
is prohibited by God, the Lord of glory and command. To none is it
permitted to seek absolution from another soul; let repentance be
between yourselves and God. He, verily, is the Pardoner, the
Bounteous, the Gracious, the One Who absolveth the repentant. </p>


<p id='1.35' data-ref='ka_en-1-35'>
O ye servants of the Merciful One! Arise to serve the Cause of God,
in such wise that the cares and sorrows caused by them that have
disbelieved in the Dayspring of the Signs of God may not afflict you.
At the time when the Promise was fulfilled and the Promised One made
manifest, differences have appeared amongst the kindreds of the earth
and each people hath followed its own fancy and idle imaginings. </p>


<p id='1.36' data-ref='ka_en-1-36'>
Amongst the people is he who seateth himself amid the sandals by the
door whilst coveting in his heart the seat of honor. Say: What manner
of man art thou, O vain and heedless one, who wouldst appear as other
than thou art? And among the people is he who layeth claim to inner
knowledge, and still deeper knowledge concealed within this
knowledge. Say: Thou speakest false! By God! What thou dost possess
is naught but husks which We have left to thee as bones are left to
dogs. By the righteousness of the one true God! Were anyone to wash
the feet of all mankind, and were he to worship God in the forests,
valleys, and mountains, upon high hills and lofty peaks, to leave no
rock or tree, no clod of earth, but was a witness to his worship — yet,
should the fragrance of My good pleasure not be inhaled from him, his
works would never be acceptable unto God. Thus hath it been decreed
by Him Who is the Lord of all. How many a man hath secluded himself
in the climes of India, denied himself the things that God hath
decreed as lawful, imposed upon himself austerities and
mortifications, and hath not been remembered by God, the Revealer of
Verses. Make not your deeds as snares wherewith to entrap the object
of your aspiration, and deprive not yourselves of this Ultimate
Objective for which have ever yearned all such as have drawn nigh
unto God. Say: The very life of all deeds is My good pleasure, and
all things depend upon Mine acceptance. Read ye the Tablets that ye
may know what hath been purposed in the Books of God, the
All-Glorious, the Ever-Bounteous. He who attaineth to My love hath
title to a throne of gold, to sit thereon in honor over all the
world; he who is deprived thereof, though he sit upon the dust, that
dust would seek refuge with God, the Lord of all Religions. </p>


<p id='1.37' data-ref='ka_en-1-37'>
Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from God, ere the
expiration of a full thousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying
impostor. We pray God that He may graciously assist him to retract
and repudiate such claim. Should he repent, God will, no doubt,
forgive him. If, however, he persisteth in his error, God will,
assuredly, send down one who will deal mercilessly with him.
Terrible, indeed, is God in punishing! Whosoever interpreteth this
verse otherwise than its obvious meaning is deprived of the Spirit of
God and of His mercy which encompasseth all created things. Fear God,
and follow not your idle fancies. Nay, rather, follow the bidding of
your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Erelong shall clamorous voices
be raised in most lands. Shun them, O My people, and follow not the
iniquitous and evilhearted. This is that of which We gave you
forewarning when We were dwelling in ‘Iráq, then later while in
the Land of Mystery, and now from this Resplendent Spot. </p>

Be not dismayed, O peoples of the world, when the daystar of My
beauty is set, and the heaven of My tabernacle is concealed from your
eyes. Arise to further My Cause, and to exalt My Word amongst men. We
are with you at all times, and shall strengthen you through the power
of truth. We are truly almighty. Whoso hath recognized Me will arise
and serve Me with such determination that the powers of earth and
heaven shall be unable to defeat his purpose. </p>

The peoples of the world are fast asleep. Were they to wake from
their slumber, they would hasten with eagerness unto God, the
All-Knowing, the All-Wise. They would cast away everything they
possess, be it all the treasures of the earth, that their Lord may
remember them to the extent of addressing to them but one word. Such
is the instruction given you by Him Who holdeth the knowledge of
things hidden, in a Tablet which the eye of creation hath not seen,
and which is revealed to none except His own Self, the omnipotent
Protector of all worlds. So bewildered are they in the drunkenness of
their evil desires, that they are powerless to recognize the Lord of
all being, Whose voice calleth aloud from every direction: “There
is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Wise.” </p>

Say: Rejoice not in the things ye possess; tonight they are yours,
tomorrow others will possess them. Thus warneth you He Who is the
All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say: Can ye claim that what ye own is
lasting or secure? Nay! By Myself, the All-Merciful, ye cannot, if ye
be of them who judge fairly. The days of your life flee away as a
breath of wind, and all your pomp and glory shall be folded up as
were the pomp and glory of those gone before you. Reflect, O people!
What hath become of your bygone days, your lost centuries? Happy the
days that have been consecrated to the remembrance of God, and
blessed the hours which have been spent in praise of Him Who is the
All-Wise. By My life! Neither the pomp of the mighty, nor the wealth
of the rich, nor even the ascendancy of the ungodly will endure. All
will perish, at a word from Him. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the
All-Compelling, the Almighty. What advantage is there in the earthly
things which men possess? That which shall profit them, they have
utterly neglected. Erelong, they will awake from their slumber, and
find themselves unable to obtain that which hath escaped them in the
days of their Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Did they but know
it, they would renounce their all, that their names may be mentioned
before His throne. They, verily, are accounted among the dead. </p>


<p id='1.41' data-ref='ka_en-1-41'>
Amongst the people is he whose learning hath made him proud, and who
hath been debarred thereby from recognizing My Name, the
Self-Subsisting; who, when he heareth the tread of sandals following
behind him, waxeth greater in his own esteem than Nimrod. Say: O
rejected one! Where now is his abode? By God, it is the nethermost
fire. Say: O concourse of divines! Hear ye not the shrill voice of My
Most Exalted Pen? See ye not this Sun that shineth in refulgent
splendor above the All-Glorious Horizon? For how long will ye worship
the idols of your evil passions? Forsake your vain imaginings, and
turn yourselves unto God, your Everlasting Lord. </p>

Endowments dedicated to charity revert to God, the Revealer of Signs.
None hath the right to dispose of them without leave from Him Who is

to the A<u>gh</u>ṣán, and after them to the House of
Justice — should it be established in the world by then — that they
may use these endowments for the benefit of the Places which have
been exalted in this Cause, and for whatsoever hath been enjoined
upon them by Him Who is the God of might and power. Otherwise, the
endowments shall revert to the people of Bahá who speak not except
by His leave and judge not save in accordance with what God hath
decreed in this Tablet — lo, they are the champions of victory

Shave not your heads; God hath adorned them with hair, and in this

the limit of the ears. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the
Lord of all worlds. </p>

Exile and imprisonment are decreed for the thief, and, on the third
offense, place ye a mark upon his brow so that, thus identified, he
may not be accepted in the cities of God and His countries. Beware
lest, through compassion, ye neglect to carry out the statutes of the
religion of God; do that which hath been bidden you by Him Who is
compassionate and merciful. We school you with the rod of wisdom and
laws, like unto the father who educateth his son, and this for naught
but the protection of your own selves and the elevation of your
stations. By My life, were ye to discover what We have desired for
you in revealing Our holy laws, ye would offer up your very souls for
this sacred, this mighty, and most exalted Faith. </p>

Whoso wisheth to make use of vessels of silver and gold is at liberty
to do so. Take heed lest, when partaking of food, ye plunge your
hands into the contents of bowls and platters. Adopt ye such usages
as are most in keeping with refinement. He, verily, desireth to see
in you the manners of the inmates of Paradise in His mighty and most
sublime Kingdom. Hold ye fast unto refinement under all conditions,
that your eyes may be preserved from beholding what is repugnant both
to your own selves and to the dwellers of Paradise. Should anyone
depart therefrom, his deed shall at that moment be rendered vain; yet
should he have good reason, God will excuse him. He, in truth, is the
Gracious, the Most Bountiful. </p>

He Who is the Dawning-place of God’s Cause hath no partner in the
Most Great Infallibility. He it is Who, in the kingdom of creation,
is the Manifestation of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth.” God
hath reserved this distinction unto His own Self, and ordained for
none a share in so sublime and transcendent a station. This is the
Decree of God, concealed ere now within the veil of impenetrable
mystery. We have disclosed it in this Revelation, and have thereby
rent asunder the veils of such as have failed to recognize that which
the Book of God set forth and who were numbered with the heedless. </p>


<p id='1.48' data-ref='ka_en-1-48'>
Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and
daughter in the art of reading and writing and in all that hath been
laid down in the Holy Tablet. He that putteth away that which is
commanded unto him, the Trustees are then to take from him that which
is required for their instruction if he be wealthy and, if not, the
matter devolveth upon the House of Justice. Verily have We made it a
shelter for the poor and needy. He that bringeth up his son or the
son of another, it is as though he hath brought up a son of Mine;
upon him rest My glory, My loving-kindness, My mercy, that have
compassed the world. </p>


<p id='1.49' data-ref='ka_en-1-49'>
God hath imposed a fine on every adulterer and adulteress, to be paid
to the House of Justice: nine mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold, to be doubled
if they should repeat the offense. Such is the penalty which He Who
is the Lord of Names hath assigned them in this world; and in the
world to come He hath ordained for them a humiliating torment. Should
anyone be afflicted by a sin, it behooveth him to repent thereof and
return unto his Lord. He, verily, granteth forgiveness unto
whomsoever He willeth, and none may question that which it pleaseth
Him to ordain. He is, in truth, the Ever-Forgiving, the Almighty, the
All-Praised. </p>

We have made it lawful for you to listen to music and singing. Take
heed, however, lest listening thereto should cause you to overstep
the bounds of propriety and dignity. Let your joy be the joy born of
My Most Great Name, a Name that bringeth rapture to the heart, and
filleth with ecstasy the minds of all who have drawn nigh unto God.
We, verily, have made music as a ladder for your souls, a means
whereby they may be lifted up unto the realm on high; make it not,
therefore, as wings to self and passion. Truly, We are loath to see
you numbered with the foolish. </p>

We have decreed that a third part of all fines shall go to the Seat
of Justice, and We admonish its men to observe pure justice, that

O ye Men of Justice! Be ye, in the realm of God, shepherds unto His
sheep and guard them from the ravening wolves that have appeared in
disguise, even as ye would guard your own sons. Thus exhorteth you
the Counselor, the Faithful. </p>

Should differences arise amongst you over any matter, refer it to God
while the Sun still shineth above the horizon of this Heaven and,
when it hath set, refer ye to whatsoever hath been sent down by Him.
This, verily, is sufficient unto the peoples of the world. Say: Let
not your hearts be perturbed, O people, when the glory of My Presence
is withdrawn, and the ocean of My utterance is stilled. In My
presence amongst you there is a wisdom, and in My absence there is
yet another, inscrutable to all but God, the Incomparable, the
All-Knowing. Verily, We behold you from Our realm of glory, and will

O peoples of the earth! God, the Eternal Truth, is My witness that
streams of fresh and soft-flowing waters have gushed from the rocks

Unconstrained; and still ye slumber. Cast away that which ye possess,
and, on the wings of detachment, soar beyond all created things. Thus
biddeth you the Lord of creation, the movement of Whose Pen hath
revolutionized the soul of mankind. </p>


<p id='1.55' data-ref='ka_en-1-55'>
Know ye from what heights your Lord, the All-Glorious, is calling?
Think ye that ye have recognized the Pen wherewith your Lord, the
Lord of all names, commandeth you? Nay, by My life! Did ye but know
it, ye would renounce the world, and would hasten with your whole
hearts to the presence of the Well-Beloved. Your spirits would be so
transported by His Word as to throw into commotion the Greater
World — how much more this small and petty one! Thus have the showers
of My bounty been poured down from the heaven of My loving-kindness,
as a token of My grace, that ye may be of the thankful. </p>


<p id='1.56' data-ref='ka_en-1-56'>
The penalties for wounding or striking a person depend upon the
severity of the injury; for each degree the Lord of Judgment hath
prescribed a certain indemnity. He is, in truth, the Ordainer, the
Mighty, the Most Exalted. We shall, if it be Our Will, set forth
these payments in their just degrees — this is a promise on Our part,
and He, verily, is the Keeper of His pledge, the Knower of all
things. </p>


<p id='1.57' data-ref='ka_en-1-57'>
Verily, it is enjoined upon you to offer a feast, once in every

hearts together, albeit through both earthly and heavenly means. </p>


<p id='1.58' data-ref='ka_en-1-58'>
Beware lest the desires of the flesh and of a corrupt inclination
provoke divisions among you. Be ye as the fingers of one hand, the
members of one body. Thus counseleth you the Pen of Revelation, if ye
be of them that believe. </p>


<p id='1.59' data-ref='ka_en-1-59'>
Consider the mercy of God and His gifts. He enjoineth upon you that
which shall profit you, though He Himself can well dispense with all
creatures. Your evil doings can never harm Us, neither can your good
works profit Us. We summon you wholly for the sake of God. To this
every man of understanding and insight will testify. </p>


<p id='1.60' data-ref='ka_en-1-60'>
If ye should hunt with beasts or birds of prey, invoke ye the Name of
God when ye send them to pursue their quarry; for then whatever they
catch shall be lawful unto you, even should ye find it to have died.
He, verily, is the Omniscient, the All-Informed. Take heed, however,
that ye hunt not to excess. Tread ye the path of justice and equity
in all things. Thus biddeth you He Who is the Dawning-place of
Revelation, would that ye might comprehend. </p>


<p id='1.61' data-ref='ka_en-1-61'>
God hath bidden you to show forth kindliness towards My kindred, but
He hath granted them no right to the property of others. He, verily,
is self-sufficient, above any need of His creatures. </p>


<p id='1.62' data-ref='ka_en-1-62'>
Should anyone intentionally destroy a house by fire, him also shall
ye burn; should anyone deliberately take another’s life, him also
shall ye put to death. Take ye hold of the precepts of God with all
your strength and power, and abandon the ways of the ignorant. Should
ye condemn the arsonist and the murderer to life imprisonment, it
would be permissible according to the provisions of the Book. He,
verily, hath power to ordain whatsoever He pleaseth. </p>


<p id='1.63' data-ref='ka_en-1-63'>
God hath prescribed matrimony unto you. Beware that ye take not unto
yourselves more wives than two. Whoso contenteth himself with a
single partner from among the maidservants of God, both he and she
shall live in tranquillity. And he who would take into his service a
maid may do so with propriety. Such is the ordinance which, in truth
and justice, hath been recorded by the Pen of Revelation. Enter into
wedlock, O people, that ye may bring forth one who will make mention
of Me amid My servants. This is My bidding unto you; hold fast to it
as an assistance to yourselves. </p>


<p id='1.64' data-ref='ka_en-1-64'>
O people of the world! Follow not the promptings of the self, for it
summoneth insistently to wickedness and lust; follow, rather, Him Who
is the Possessor of all created things, Who biddeth you to show forth
piety, and manifest the fear of God. He, verily, is independent of
all His creatures. Take heed not to stir up mischief in the land
after it hath been set in order. Whoso acteth in this way is not of
Us, and We are quit of him. Such is the command which hath, through
the power of truth, been made manifest from the heaven of Revelation. </p>


<p id='1.65' data-ref='ka_en-1-65'>
It hath been laid down in the Bayán that marriage is dependent upon
the consent of both parties. Desiring to establish love, unity and
harmony amidst Our servants, We have conditioned it, once the
couple’s wish is known, upon the permission of their parents, lest
enmity and rancor should arise amongst them. And in this We have yet
other purposes. Thus hath Our commandment been ordained. </p>


<p id='1.66' data-ref='ka_en-1-66'>
No marriage may be contracted without payment of a dowry, which hath
been fixed for city dwellers at nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of pure
gold, and for village dwellers at the same amount in silver. Whoso
wisheth to increase this sum, it is forbidden him to exceed the limit
of ninety-five mi<u>th</u>qáls. Thus hath the command been writ in
majesty and power. If he content himself, however, with a payment of
the lowest level, it shall be better for him according to the Book.
God, verily, enricheth whomsoever He willeth through both heavenly
and earthly means, and He, in truth, hath power over all things. </p>


<p id='1.67' data-ref='ka_en-1-67'>
It hath been decreed by God that, should any one of His servants
intend to travel, he must fix for his wife a time when he will return
home. If he return by the promised time, he will have obeyed the
bidding of his Lord and shall be numbered by the Pen of His behest
among the righteous; otherwise, if there be good reason for delay, he
must inform his wife and make the utmost endeavor to return to her.
Should neither of these eventualities occur, it behooveth her to wait
for a period of nine months, after which there is no impediment to
her taking another husband; but should she wait longer, God, verily,
loveth those women and men who show forth patience. Obey ye My
commandments, and follow not the ungodly, they who have been reckoned
as sinners in God’s Holy Tablet. If, during the period of her
waiting, word should reach her from her husband, she should choose
the course that is praiseworthy. He, of a truth, desireth that His
servants and His handmaids should be at peace with one another; take
heed lest ye do aught that may provoke intransigence amongst you.
Thus hath the decree been fixed and the promise come to pass. If,
however, news should reach her of her husband’s death or murder,
and be confirmed by general report, or by the testimony of two just
witnesses, it behooveth her to remain single; then, upon completion
of the fixed number of months, she is free to adopt the course of her
choosing. Such is the bidding of Him Who is mighty and powerful in
His command. </p>


<p id='1.68' data-ref='ka_en-1-68'>
Should resentment or antipathy arise between husband and wife, he is
not to divorce her but to bide in patience throughout the course of
one whole year, that perchance the fragrance of affection may be
renewed between them. If, upon the completion of this period, their
love hath not returned, it is permissible for divorce to take place.
God’s wisdom, verily, hath encompassed all things. The Lord hath
prohibited, in a Tablet inscribed by the Pen of His command, the
practice to which ye formerly had recourse when thrice ye had
divorced a woman. This He hath done as a favor on His part, that ye
may be accounted among the thankful. He who hath divorced his wife
may choose, upon the passing of each month, to remarry her when there
is mutual affection and consent, so long as she hath not taken
another husband. Should she have wed again, then, by this other
union, the separation is confirmed and the matter is concluded
unless, clearly, her circumstances change. Thus hath the decree been
inscribed with majesty in this glorious Tablet by Him Who is the
Dawning-place of Beauty. </p>


<p id='1.69' data-ref='ka_en-1-69'>
If the wife accompany her husband on a journey, and differences arise
between them on the way, he is required to provide her with her
expenses for one whole year, and either to return her whence she came
or to entrust her, together with the necessaries for her journey, to
a dependable person who is to escort her home. Thy Lord, verily,
ordaineth as He pleaseth, by virtue of a sovereignty that
overshadoweth the peoples of the earth. </p>


<p id='1.70' data-ref='ka_en-1-70'>
Should a woman be divorced in consequence of a proven act of
infidelity, she shall receive no maintenance during her period of
waiting. Thus hath the daystar of Our commandment shone forth
resplendent from the firmament of justice. Truly, the Lord loveth
union and harmony and abhorreth separation and divorce. Live ye one
with another, O people, in radiance and joy. By My life! All that are
on earth shall pass away, while good deeds alone shall endure; to the
truth of My words God doth Himself bear witness. Compose your
differences, O My servants; then heed ye the admonition of Our Pen of
Glory and follow not the arrogant and wayward. </p>


<p id='1.71' data-ref='ka_en-1-71'>
Take heed lest the world beguile you as it beguiled the people who
went before you! Observe ye the statutes and precepts of your Lord,
and walk ye in this Way which hath been laid out before you in
righteousness and truth. They who eschew iniquity and error, who
adhere to virtue, are, in the sight of the one true God, among the
choicest of His creatures; their names are extolled by the Concourse
of the realms above, and by those who dwell in this Tabernacle which
hath been raised in the name of God. </p>


<p id='1.72' data-ref='ka_en-1-72'>
It is forbidden you to trade in slaves, be they men or women. It is
not for him who is himself a servant to buy another of God’s
servants, and this hath been prohibited in His Holy Tablet. Thus, by
His mercy, hath the commandment been recorded by the Pen of justice.
Let no man exalt himself above another; all are but bondslaves before
the Lord, and all exemplify the truth that there is none other God
but Him. He, verily, is the All-Wise, Whose wisdom encompasseth all
things. </p>


<p id='1.73' data-ref='ka_en-1-73'>
Adorn yourselves with the raiment of goodly deeds. He whose deeds
attain unto God’s good pleasure is assuredly of the people of Bahá
and is remembered before His throne. Assist ye the Lord of all
creation with works of righteousness, and also through wisdom and
utterance. Thus, indeed, have ye been commanded in most of the
Tablets by Him Who is the All-Merciful. He, truly, is cognizant of
what I say. Let none contend with another, and let no soul slay
another; this, verily, is that which was forbidden you in a Book that
hath lain concealed within the Tabernacle of glory. What! Would ye
kill him whom God hath quickened, whom He hath endowed with spirit
through a breath from Him? Grievous then would be your trespass
before His throne! Fear God, and lift not the hand of injustice and
oppression to destroy what He hath Himself raised up; nay, walk ye in
the way of God, the True One. No sooner did the hosts of true
knowledge appear, bearing the standards of Divine utterance, than the
tribes of the religions were put to flight, save only those who
willed to drink from the stream of everlasting life in a Paradise
created by the breath of the All-Glorious. </p>


<p id='1.74' data-ref='ka_en-1-74'>
God hath decreed, in token of His mercy unto His creatures, that
semen is not unclean. Yield thanks unto Him with joy and radiance,
and follow not such as are remote from the Dawning-place of His
nearness. Arise ye, under all conditions, to render service to the
Cause, for God will assuredly assist you through the power of His
sovereignty which overshadoweth the worlds. Cleave ye unto the cord
of refinement with such tenacity as to allow no trace of dirt to be
seen upon your garments. Such is the injunction of One Who is
sanctified above all refinement. Whoso falleth short of this standard
with good reason shall incur no blame. God, verily, is the Forgiving,
the Merciful. Wash ye every soiled thing with water that hath
undergone no alteration in any one of the three respects; take heed
not to use water that hath been altered through exposure to the air
or to some other agent. Be ye the very essence of cleanliness amongst
mankind. This, truly, is what your Lord, the Incomparable, the
All-Wise, desireth for you. </p>


<p id='1.75' data-ref='ka_en-1-75'>
God hath, likewise, as a bounty from His presence, abolished the
concept of “uncleanness,” whereby divers things and peoples have
been held to be impure. He, of a certainty, is the Ever-Forgiving,
the Most Generous. Verily, all created things were immersed in the
sea of purification when, on that first day of Riḍván, We shed
upon the whole of creation the splendors of Our most excellent Names
and Our most exalted Attributes. This, verily, is a token of My
loving providence, which hath encompassed all the worlds. Consort ye
then with the followers of all religions, and proclaim ye the Cause
of your Lord, the Most Compassionate; this is the very crown of
deeds, if ye be of them who understand. </p>


<p id='1.76' data-ref='ka_en-1-76'>
God hath enjoined upon you to observe the utmost cleanliness, to the
extent of washing what is soiled with dust, let alone with hardened
dirt and similar defilement. Fear Him, and be of those who are pure.
Should the garb of anyone be visibly sullied, his prayers shall not
ascend to God, and the celestial Concourse will turn away from him.
Make use of rose water, and of pure perfume; this, indeed, is that
which God hath loved from the beginning that hath no beginning, in
order that there may be diffused from you what your Lord, the
Incomparable, the All-Wise, desireth. </p>


<p id='1.77' data-ref='ka_en-1-77'>
God hath relieved you of the ordinance laid down in the Bayán
concerning the destruction of books. We have permitted you to read
such sciences as are profitable unto you, not such as end in idle
disputation; better is this for you, if ye be of them that

<p id='1.78' data-ref='ka_en-1-78'>
O kings of the earth! He Who is the sovereign Lord of all is come.
The Kingdom is God’s, the omnipotent Protector, the
Self-Subsisting. Worship none but God, and, with radiant hearts, lift
up your faces unto your Lord, the Lord of all names. This is a
Revelation to which whatever ye possess can never be compared, could
ye but know it. </p>


<p id='1.79' data-ref='ka_en-1-79'>
We see you rejoicing in that which ye have amassed for others and
shutting out yourselves from the worlds which naught except My
guarded Tablet can reckon. The treasures ye have laid up have drawn
you far away from your ultimate objective. This ill beseemeth you,
could ye but understand it. Wash from your hearts all earthly
defilements, and hasten to enter the Kingdom of your Lord, the
Creator of earth and heaven, Who caused the world to tremble and all
its peoples to wail, except them that have renounced all things and
clung to that which the Hidden Tablet hath ordained. </p>


<p id='1.80' data-ref='ka_en-1-80'>
This is the Day in which He Who held converse with God hath attained
the light of the Ancient of Days, and quaffed the pure waters of
reunion from this Cup that hath caused the seas to swell. Say: By the
one true God! Sinai is circling round the Dayspring of Revelation,
while from the heights of the Kingdom the Voice of the Spirit of God
is heard proclaiming: “Bestir yourselves, ye proud ones of the
earth, and hasten ye unto Him.” Carmel hath, in this Day, hastened
in longing adoration to attain His court, whilst from the heart of
Zion there cometh the cry: “The promise is fulfilled. That which
had been announced in the holy Writ of God, the Most Exalted, the
Almighty, the Best-Beloved, is made manifest.” </p>


<p id='1.81' data-ref='ka_en-1-81'>
O kings of the earth! The Most Great Law hath been revealed in this
Spot, this scene of transcendent splendor. Every hidden thing hath

He Who hath ushered in the Last Hour, through Whom the Moon hath been
cleft, and every irrevocable decree expounded. </p>


<p id='1.82' data-ref='ka_en-1-82'>
Ye are but vassals, O kings of the earth! He Who is the King of Kings
hath appeared, arrayed in His most wondrous glory, and is summoning
you unto Himself, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Take heed
lest pride deter you from recognizing the Source of Revelation, lest
the things of this world shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is
the Creator of heaven. Arise, and serve Him Who is the Desire of all
nations, Who hath created you through a word from Him, and ordained
you to be, for all time, the emblems of His sovereignty. </p>


<p id='1.83' data-ref='ka_en-1-83'>
By the righteousness of God! It is not Our wish to lay hands on your
kingdoms. Our mission is to seize and possess the hearts of men. Upon
them the eyes of Bahá are fastened. To this testifieth the Kingdom
of Names, could ye but comprehend it. Whoso followeth his Lord will
renounce the world and all that is therein; how much greater, then,
must be the detachment of Him Who holdeth so august a station!
Forsake your palaces, and haste ye to gain admittance into His
Kingdom. This, indeed, will profit you both in this world and in the
next. To this testifieth the Lord of the realm on high, did ye but
know it. </p>

Him by Whom every house is exalted and every lofty gate unlocked. We,
verily, made it a place whereunto the world should turn, that they
might remember Me, and yet thou hast rejected Him Who is the Object
of this remembrance, when He appeared with the Kingdom of God, thy
Lord and the Lord of the worlds. We have been with thee at all times,
and found thee clinging unto the Branch and heedless of the Root. Thy
Lord, verily, is a witness unto what I say. We grieved to see thee
circle round Our Name, whilst unaware of Us, though We were before

Vision, and recognize Him Whom thou invokest in the daytime and in

assailed him from all sides, and he went down to dust in great loss.
Think deeply, O King, concerning him, and concerning them who, like

attain the presence of Him Whom We shall make manifest, beseech ye
God, in His bounty, to grant that He might deign to seat Himself upon
your couches, for that act in itself would confer upon you matchless
and surpassing honor. Should He drink a cup of water in your homes,
this would be of greater consequence for you than your proffering

All-Merciful wafting from the direction of this Prison and will, with

Thus hath it been sent down by your Lord, the God of Mercy, if ye be

He Whom God will make manifest; whenever He moveth, it moveth, until
He shall come to rest.” Thus was it set down by the Supreme
Ordainer when He desired to make mention of this Most Great Beauty.
Meditate on this, O people, and be not of them that wander distraught
in the wilderness of error. If ye reject Him at the bidding of your
idle fancies, where then is the Qiblih to which ye will turn, O

Let none, in this Day, hold fast to aught save that which hath been

of old have been adorned. Such is the admonition of the Lord,
aforetime and hereafter — an admonition wherewith the preamble to the
Book of Life hath been embellished, did ye but perceive it. Such is
the commandment of the Lord, aforetime and hereafter; beware lest ye
choose instead the part of ignominy and abasement. Naught shall avail
you in this Day but God, nor is there any refuge to flee to save Him,
the Omniscient, the All-Wise. Whoso hath known Me hath known the Goal
of all desire, and whoso hath turned unto Me hath turned unto the
Object of all adoration. Thus hath it been set forth in the Book, and
thus hath it been decreed by God, the Lord of all worlds. To read but
one of the verses of My Revelation is better than to peruse the
Scriptures of both the former and latter generations. This is the
Utterance of the All-Merciful, would that ye had ears to hear! Say:
This is the essence of knowledge, did ye but understand. </p>

And now consider what hath been revealed in yet another passage, that
perchance ye may forsake your own concepts and set your faces towards
God, the Lord of being. He <a data-fnid='1.4'></a>

believer in the Bayán. Should only one party to a marriage embrace
this Cause, his or her possessions will become unlawful to the other,
until such time as the latter hath converted. This law, however, will
only take effect after the exaltation of the Cause of Him Whom We
shall manifest in truth, or of that which hath already been made
manifest in justice. Ere this, ye are at liberty to enter into
wedlock as ye wish, that haply by this means ye may exalt the Cause
of God.” Thus hath the Nightingale sung with sweet melody upon the
celestial bough, in praise of its Lord, the All-Merciful. Well is it

entered it before the letters B and E were joined and knit together.”
Such is the language of Our servants in Our Kingdom; consider what
the tongue of the dwellers of Our exalted Dominion would utter, for
We have taught them Our knowledge and have revealed to them whatever
had lain hidden in God’s wisdom. Imagine then what the Tongue of
Might and Grandeur would utter in His All-Glorious Abode! </p>


<p id='1.178' data-ref='ka_en-1-178'>
This is not a Cause which may be made a plaything for your idle
fancies, nor is it a field for the foolish and faint of heart. By
God, this is the arena of insight and detachment, of vision and
upliftment, where none may spur on their chargers save the valiant
horsemen of the Merciful, who have severed all attachment to the
world of being. These, truly, are they that render God victorious on
earth, and are the dawning-places of His sovereign might amidst
mankind. </p>


<p id='1.179' data-ref='ka_en-1-179'>
Beware lest aught that hath been revealed in the Bayán should keep
you from your Lord, the Most Compassionate. God is My witness that
the Bayán was sent down for no other purpose than to celebrate My
praise, did ye but know! In it the pure in heart will find only the
fragrance of My love, only My Name that overshadoweth all that seeth
and is seen. Say: Turn ye, O people, unto that which hath proceeded
from My Most Exalted Pen. Should ye inhale therefrom the fragrance of
God, set not yourselves against Him, nor deny yourselves a portion of
His gracious favor and His manifold bestowals. Thus doth your Lord
admonish you; He, verily, is the Counselor, the Omniscient. </p>


<p id='1.180' data-ref='ka_en-1-180'>
Whatsoever ye understand not in the Bayán, ask it of God, your Lord
and the Lord of your forefathers. Should He so desire, He will
expound for you that which is revealed therein, and disclose to you
the pearls of Divine knowledge and wisdom that lie concealed within
the ocean of its words. He, verily, is supreme over all names; no God
is there but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. </p>


<p id='1.181' data-ref='ka_en-1-181'>
The world’s equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating
influence of this most great, this new World Order. Mankind’s
ordered life hath been revolutionized through the agency of this
unique, this wondrous System — the like of which mortal eyes have
never witnessed. </p>


<p id='1.182' data-ref='ka_en-1-182'>
Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words, that ye may unravel its
secrets, and discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its
depths. Take heed that ye do not vacillate in your determination to
embrace the truth of this Cause — a Cause through which the
potentialities of the might of God have been revealed, and His
sovereignty established. With faces beaming with joy, hasten ye unto
Him. This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past,
eternal in the future. Let him that seeketh, attain it; and as to him
that hath refused to seek it — verily, God is Self-Sufficient, above
any need of His creatures. </p>


<p id='1.183' data-ref='ka_en-1-183'>
Say: This is the infallible Balance which the Hand of God is holding,
in which all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth are
weighed, and their fate determined, if ye be of them that believe and
recognize this truth. Say: This is the Most Great Testimony, by which
the validity of every proof throughout the ages hath been
established, would that ye might be assured thereof. Say: Through it
the poor have been enriched, the learned enlightened, and the seekers
enabled to ascend unto the presence of God. Beware lest ye make it a
cause of dissension amongst you. Be ye as firmly settled as the
immovable mountain in the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. </p>


<p id='1.184' data-ref='ka_en-1-184'>
Say: O source of perversion! Abandon thy willful blindness, and speak
forth the truth amidst the people. I swear by God that I have wept
for thee to see thee following thy selfish passions and renouncing
Him Who fashioned thee and brought thee into being. Call to mind the
tender mercy of thy Lord, and remember how We nurtured thee by day
and by night for service to the Cause. Fear God, and be thou of the
truly repentant. Granted that the people were confused about thy
station, is it conceivable that thou thyself art similarly confused?
Tremble before thy Lord and recall the days when thou didst stand
before Our throne, and didst write down the verses that We dictated
unto thee — verses sent down by God, the Omnipotent Protector, the
Lord of might and power. Beware lest the fire of thy presumptuousness
debar thee from attaining to God’s Holy Court. Turn unto Him, and
fear not because of thy deeds. He, in truth, forgiveth whomsoever He
desireth as a bounty on His part; no God is there but Him, the
Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bounteous. We admonish thee solely for the
sake of God. Shouldst thou accept this counsel, thou wilt have acted
to thine own behoof; and shouldst thou reject it, thy Lord, verily,
can well dispense with thee, and with all those who, in manifest
delusion, have followed thee. Behold! God hath laid hold on him who
led thee astray. Return unto God, humble, submissive and lowly;
verily, He will put away from thee thy sins, for thy Lord, of a
certainty, is the Forgiving, the Mighty, the All-Merciful. </p>


<p id='1.185' data-ref='ka_en-1-185'>
This is the Counsel of God; would that thou mightest heed it! This is
the Bounty of God; would that thou mightest receive it! This is the
Utterance of God; if only thou wouldst apprehend it! This is the
Treasure of God; if only thou couldst understand! </p>


<p id='1.186' data-ref='ka_en-1-186'>
This is a Book which hath become the Lamp of the Eternal unto the
world, and His straight, undeviating Path amidst the peoples of the
earth. Say: This is the Dayspring of Divine knowledge, if ye be of
them that understand, and the Dawning-place of God’s commandments,
if ye be of those who comprehend. </p>


<p id='1.187' data-ref='ka_en-1-187'>
Burden not an animal with more than it can bear. We, truly, have
prohibited such treatment through a most binding interdiction in the
Book. Be ye the embodiments of justice and fairness amidst all
creation. </p>


<p id='1.188' data-ref='ka_en-1-188'>
Should anyone unintentionally take another’s life, it is incumbent
upon him to render to the family of the deceased an indemnity of one
hundred mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold. Observe ye that which hath been
enjoined upon you in this Tablet, and be not of those who overstep
its limits. </p>


<p id='1.189' data-ref='ka_en-1-189'>
O members of parliaments throughout the world! Select ye a single
language for the use of all on earth, and adopt ye likewise a common
script. God, verily, maketh plain for you that which shall profit you
and enable you to be independent of others. He, of a truth, is the
Most Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This will be the
cause of unity, could ye but comprehend it, and the greatest
instrument for promoting harmony and civilization, would that ye
might understand! We have appointed two signs for the coming of age
of the human race: the first, which is the most firm foundation, We
have set down in other of Our Tablets, while the second hath been
revealed in this wondrous Book. </p>


<p id='1.190' data-ref='ka_en-1-190'>
It hath been forbidden you to smoke opium. We, truly, have prohibited
this practice through a most binding interdiction in the Book. Should
anyone partake thereof, assuredly he is not of Me. Fear God, O ye
endued with understanding! </p>

  </div> <!-- section_header -->


<p class='editor-note blockquote noid nodropcap' id='ka_supplement_note'>
  A number of Tablets revealed by Bahá’u’lláh after the
  Kitáb-i-Aqdas contain passages supplementary to the provisions of
  the Most Holy Book. The most noteworthy of these have been published
  in <i>Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh revealed after the
  Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i>. Included in
  this section is an extract from the Tablet of I<u>sh</u>ráqát.
  The text of the three Obligatory Prayers referred to in Questions and
  Answers and the Prayer for the Dead mentioned in the Text are,
  likewise, reprinted here. </p>

<h3 class='subhead' id='ka_supplement-ishraq' data-title=''>The Tablet of I<u>sh</u>ráqát</h3>
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='ka_supplement-ishraq8' data-title=''>The Eighth I<u>sh</u>ráq</h3>

<p id='2.1.1' data-ref='ka_en-2-1-p1'>
<i>The eighth I<u>sh</u>ráq</i>:
 This passage, now written by the Pen of Glory, is accounted as part
of the Most Holy Book: The men of God’s House of Justice have been
charged with the affairs of the people. They, in truth, are the
Trustees of God among His servants and the daysprings of authority in
His countries.</p>

<p id='2.1.2' data-ref='ka_en-2-1-p2'>
O people of God! That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is
upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are
the sources of life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a
new problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs
should be referred to the House of Justice that the members thereof
may act according to the needs and requirements of the time. They
that, for the sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the
recipients of divine inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. It is
incumbent upon all to be obedient unto them. All matters of State
should be referred to the House of Justice, but acts of worship must
be observed according to that which God hath revealed in His Book.</p>

<p id='2.1.3' data-ref='ka_en-2-1-p3'>
O people of Bahá! Ye are the dawning-places of the love of God and
the daysprings of His loving-kindness. Defile not your tongues with
the cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against
that which is not seemly. Set forth that which ye possess. If it be
favorably received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain.
Leave that soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the
Self-Subsisting. Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and
strife. The hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in
the shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance
with that which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree and
the drops of one ocean.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='ka_supplement-long-oblig' data-title=''>Long Obligatory Prayer</h3>
<h3 class='subhead smaller' data-title=''>To be recited once in twenty-four hours</h3>

<p id='2.2.1' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p1' class='blockquote italic nodropcap'>
Whoso wisheth to recite this
prayer, let him stand up and turn unto God, and, as he standeth in
his place, let him gaze to the right and to the left, as if awaiting
the mercy of his Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Then let
him say:</p>

<p id='2.2.2' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p2' class='dropcap'>
O Thou Who art the Lord of all names and the Maker of the heavens! I
beseech Thee by them Who are the Daysprings of Thine invisible
Essence, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, to make of my prayer a
fire that will burn away the veils which have shut me out from Thy
beauty, and a light that will lead me unto the ocean of Thy Presence.</p>

<p id='2.2.3' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p3' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then raise his hands
in supplication toward God — blessed and exalted be He — and say:</p>

<p id='2.2.4' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p4'>
O Thou the Desire of the world and the Beloved of the nations! Thou
seest me turning toward Thee, and rid of all attachment to anyone
save Thee, and clinging to Thy cord, through whose movement the whole
creation hath been stirred up. I am Thy servant, O my Lord, and the
son of Thy servant. Behold me standing ready to do Thy will and Thy
desire, and wishing naught else except Thy good pleasure. I implore
Thee by the Ocean of Thy mercy and the Daystar of Thy grace to do
with Thy servant as Thou willest and pleasest. By Thy might which is
far above all mention and praise! Whatsoever is revealed by Thee is
the desire of my heart and the beloved of my soul. O God, my God!
Look not upon my hopes and my doings, nay rather look upon Thy will
that hath encompassed the heavens and the earth. By Thy Most Great
Name, O Thou Lord of all nations! I have desired only what Thou didst
desire, and love only what Thou dost love.</p>

<p id='2.2.5' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p5' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then kneel, and
bowing his forehead to the ground, let him say:</p>

<p id='2.2.6' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p6'>
Exalted art Thou above the description of anyone save Thyself, and
the comprehension of aught else except Thee.</p>

<p id='2.2.7' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p7' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then stand and say:</p>

<p id='2.2.8' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p8'>
Make my prayer, O my Lord, a fountain of living waters whereby I may
live as long as Thy sovereignty endureth, and may make mention of
Thee in every world of Thy worlds.</p>

<p id='2.2.9' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p9' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him again raise his
hands in supplication, and say:</p>

<p id='2.2.10' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p10'>
O Thou in separation from Whom hearts and souls have melted, and by
the fire of Whose love the whole world hath been set aflame! I
implore Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the whole
creation, not to withhold from me that which is with Thee, O Thou Who
rulest over all men! Thou seest, O my Lord, this stranger hastening
to his most exalted home beneath the canopy of Thy majesty and within
the precincts of Thy mercy; and this transgressor seeking the ocean
of Thy forgiveness; and this lowly one the court of Thy glory; and
this poor creature the orient of Thy wealth. Thine is the authority
to command whatsoever Thou willest. I bear witness that Thou art to
be praised in Thy doings, and to be obeyed in Thy behests, and to
remain unconstrained in Thy bidding.</p>

<p id='2.2.11' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p11' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then raise his
hands, and repeat three times the Greatest Name. Let him then bend
down with hands resting on the knees before God — blessed and exalted
be He — and say:</p>

<p id='2.2.12' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p12'>
Thou seest, O my God, how my spirit hath been stirred up within my
limbs and members, in its longing to worship Thee, and in its
yearning to remember Thee and extol Thee; how it testifieth to that
whereunto the Tongue of Thy Commandment hath testified in the kingdom
of Thine utterance and the heaven of Thy knowledge. I love, in this
state, O my Lord, to beg of Thee all that is with Thee, that I may
demonstrate my poverty, and magnify Thy bounty and Thy riches, and
may declare my powerlessness, and manifest Thy power and Thy might.</p>

<p id='2.2.13' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p13' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then stand and raise
his hands twice in supplication, and say:</p>

<p id='2.2.14' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p14'>
There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. There is
no God but Thee, the Ordainer, both in the beginning and in the end.
O God, my God! Thy forgiveness hath emboldened me, and Thy mercy hath
strengthened me, and Thy call hath awakened me, and Thy grace hath
raised me up and led me unto Thee. Who, otherwise, am I that I should
dare to stand at the gate of the city of Thy nearness, or set my face
toward the lights that are shining from the heaven of Thy will? Thou
seest, O my Lord, this wretched creature knocking at the door of Thy
grace, and this evanescent soul seeking the river of everlasting life
from the hands of Thy bounty. Thine is the command at all times, O
Thou Who art the Lord of all names; and mine is resignation and
willing submission to Thy will, O Creator of the heavens!</p>

<p id='2.2.15' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p15' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then raise his hands
thrice, and say:</p>

<p id='2.2.16' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p16'>
Greater is God than every great one!</p>

<p id='2.2.17' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p17' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then kneel and,
bowing his forehead to the ground, say:</p>

<p id='2.2.18' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p18'>
Too high art Thou for the praise of those who are nigh unto Thee to
ascend unto the heaven of Thy nearness, or for the birds of the
hearts of them who are devoted to Thee to attain to the door of Thy
gate. I testify that Thou hast been sanctified above all attributes
and holy above all names. No God is there but Thee, the Most Exalted,
the All-Glorious.</p>

<p id='2.2.19' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p19' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then seat himself and say:</p>

<p id='2.2.20' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p20'>
I testify unto that whereunto have testified all created things, and
the Concourse on high, and the inmates of the all-highest Paradise,
and beyond them the Tongue of Grandeur itself from the all-glorious
Horizon, that Thou art God, that there is no God but Thee, and that
He Who hath been manifested is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured
Symbol, through Whom the letters B and E (Be) have been joined and
knit together. I testify that it is He whose name hath been set down
by the Pen of the Most High, and Who hath been mentioned in the Books
of God, the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below.</p>

<p id='2.2.21' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p21' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then stand erect and say:</p>

<p id='2.2.22' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p22'>
O Lord of all being and Possessor of all things visible and
invisible! Thou dost perceive my tears and the sighs I utter, and
hearest my groaning, and my wailing, and the lamentation of my heart.
By Thy might! My trespasses have kept me back from drawing nigh unto
Thee; and my sins have held me far from the court of Thy holiness.
Thy love, O my Lord, hath enriched me, and separation from Thee hath
destroyed me, and remoteness from Thee hath consumed me. I entreat
Thee by Thy footsteps in this wilderness, and by the words “Here am
I. Here am I” which Thy chosen Ones have uttered in this immensity,
and by the breaths of Thy Revelation, and the gentle winds of the
Dawn of Thy Manifestation, to ordain that I may gaze on Thy beauty
and observe whatsoever is in Thy Book. </p>

<p id='2.2.23' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p23' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then repeat the
Greatest Name thrice, and bend down with hands resting on the knees,
and say:</p>

<p id='2.2.24' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p24'>
Praise be to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast aided me to remember Thee
and to praise Thee, and hast made known unto me Him Who is the
Dayspring of Thy signs, and hast caused me to bow down before Thy
Lordship, and humble myself before Thy Godhead, and to acknowledge
that which hath been uttered by the Tongue of Thy grandeur.</p>

<p id='2.2.25' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p25' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then rise and say:</p>

<p id='2.2.26' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p26'>
O God, my God! My back is bowed by the burden of my sins, and my
heedlessness hath destroyed me. Whenever I ponder my evil doings and
Thy benevolence, my heart melteth within me, and my blood boileth in
my veins. By Thy Beauty, O Thou the Desire of the world! I blush to
lift up my face to Thee, and my longing hands are ashamed to stretch
forth toward the heaven of Thy bounty. Thou seest, O my God, how my
tears prevent me from remembering Thee and from extolling Thy
virtues, O Thou the Lord of the Throne on high and of earth below! I
implore Thee by the signs of Thy Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy
Dominion to do with Thy loved ones as becometh Thy bounty, O Lord of
all being, and is worthy of Thy grace, O King of the seen and the
unseen!</p>

<p id='2.2.27' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p27' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then repeat the
Greatest Name thrice, and kneel with his forehead to the ground, and
say:</p>

<p id='2.2.28' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p28'>
Praise be unto Thee, O our God, that Thou hast sent down unto us that
which draweth us nigh unto Thee, and supplieth us with every good
thing sent down by Thee in Thy Books and Thy Scriptures. Protect us,
we beseech Thee, O my Lord, from the hosts of idle fancies and vain
imaginations. Thou, in truth, art the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p id='2.2.29' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p29' class='blockquote italic'>
Let him then raise his head,
and seat himself, and say:</p>

<p id='2.2.30' data-ref='ka_en-2-2-p30'>
I testify, O my God, to that whereunto Thy chosen Ones have
testified, and acknowledge that which the inmates of the all-highest
Paradise and those who have circled round Thy mighty Throne have
acknowledged. The kingdoms of earth and heaven are Thine, O Lord of
the worlds!</p>

<span class='question'>Question: Should a man go on a journey without
specifying a time for his return without indicating, in other words,
the expected period of his absence — and should no word be heard of
him thereafter, and all trace of him be lost, what course should be
followed by his wife?</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> Should he have omitted to fix a time for his return
despite being aware of the stipulation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in this
regard, his wife should wait for one full year, after which she shall
be free either to adopt the course that is praiseworthy, or to choose
for herself another husband. If, however, he be unaware of this
stipulation, she should abide in patience until such time as God
shall please to disclose to her his fate. By the course that is
praiseworthy in this connection is meant the exercise of patience.</span></p>

<p id='3.5' data-ref='ka_en-3-5' class='nodropcap'>
<span class='question'>Question: Concerning the holy verse: “When We
heard the clamor of the children as yet unborn, We doubled their
share and decreased those of the rest.”</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> According to the Book of God, the estate of the
deceased is divided into 2,520 shares, which number is the lowest
common multiple of all integers up to nine, and these shares are then
distributed into seven portions, each of which is allocated, as
mentioned in the Book, to a particular category of heirs. The
children, for example, are allotted nine blocks of 60 shares,
comprising 540 shares in all. The meaning of the statement “We
doubled their share” is thus that the children receive a further
nine blocks of 60 shares, entitling them to a total of 18 blocks all
told. The extra shares that they receive are deducted from the
portions of the other categories of heirs, so that, although it is
revealed, for instance, that the spouse is entitled to “eight parts
comprising four hundred and eighty shares,” which is the equivalent
of eight blocks of 60 shares, now, by virtue of this rearrangement,
one and a half blocks of shares, comprising 90 shares in all, have
been subtracted from the spouse’s portion and reallocated to the
children, and similarly in the case of the others. The result is that
the total amount subtracted is equivalent to the nine extra blocks of
shares allotted to the children.</span></p>

<p id='3.6' data-ref='ka_en-3-6' class='nodropcap'>
<span class='question'>Question: Is it necessary that the brother, in order
to qualify for his portion of the inheritance, be descended from both
the father and the mother of the deceased, or is it sufficient merely
that there be one parent in common?</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> If the brother be descended from the father he shall
receive his share of the inheritance in the prescribed measure
recorded in the Book; but if he be descended from the mother, he
shall receive only two-thirds of his entitlement, the remaining third
reverting to the House of Justice. This ruling is also applicable to
the sister.</span></p>

<p id='3.7' data-ref='ka_en-3-7' class='nodropcap'>
<span class='question'>Question: Amongst the provisions concerning
inheritance it hath been laid down that, should the deceased leave no
offspring, their share of the estate is to revert to the House of
Justice. In the event of other categories of heirs, such as the
father, mother, brother, sister and teacher being similarly absent,
do their shares of the inheritance also revert to the House of
Justice, or are they dealt with in some other fashion? </span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> The sacred verse sufficeth. He saith, exalted be His
Word: “Should the deceased leave no offspring, their share shall
revert to the House of Justice” etc. and “Should the deceased
leave offspring, but none of the other categories of heirs that have
been specified in the Book, they shall receive two-thirds of the
inheritance and the remaining third shall revert to the House of
Justice” etc. In other words, where there are no offspring, their
allotted portion of the inheritance reverteth to the House of
Justice; and where there are offspring but the other categories of
heirs are lacking, two-thirds of the inheritance pass to the
offspring, the remaining third reverting to the House of Justice.
This ruling hath both general and specific application, which is to
say that whenever any category of this latter class of heirs is
absent, two-thirds of their inheritance pass to the offspring and the
remaining third to the House of Justice.</span></p>

<p id='3.8' data-ref='ka_en-3-8' class='nodropcap'>
<span class='question'>Question: Concerning the basic sum on which
Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable.</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> The basic sum on which Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable is
nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold. In other words, when money to the
value of this sum hath been acquired, a payment of Ḥuqúq falleth
due. Likewise Ḥuqúq is payable when the value, not the number, of
other forms of property reacheth the prescribed amount. Ḥuqúqu’lláh
is payable no more than once. A person, for instance, who acquireth a
thousand mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold, and payeth the Ḥuqúq, is not
liable to make a further such payment on this sum, but only on what
accrueth to it through commerce, business and the like. When this
increase, namely the profit realized, reacheth the prescribed sum,
one must carry out what God hath decreed. Only when the principal
changeth hands is it once more subject to payment of Ḥuqúq, as it
was the first time. The Primal Point hath directed that Ḥuqúqu’lláh
must be paid on the value of whatsoever one possesseth; yet, in this
Most Mighty Dispensation, We have exempted the household furnishings,
that is such furnishings as are needed, and the residence itself.</span></p>

<span class='question'>Question: Which is to take precedence: the
Ḥuqúqu’lláh, the debts of the deceased or the cost of the
funeral and burial?</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> The funeral and burial take precedence, then
settlement of debts, then payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh. Should the
property of the deceased prove insufficient to cover his debts, the
remainder of his estate should be distributed among these debts in
proportion to their size.</span></p>

<span class='question'>Question: If intercourse take place between a couple
during their year of patience, and they become estranged again
thereafter, must they recommence their year of patience, or may the
days preceding the intercourse be included in the reckoning of the
year? And once divorce hath taken place, is it necessary that a
further period of waiting be observed?</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> Should affection be renewed between the couple during
their year of patience, the marriage tie is valid, and what is
commanded in the Book of God must be observed; but once the year of
patience hath been completed and that which is decreed by God taketh
place, a further period of waiting is not required. Sexual
intercourse between husband and wife is forbidden during their year
of patience, and whoso committeth this act must seek God’s
forgiveness, and, as a punishment, render to the House of Justice a
fine of nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold.</span></p>

<span class='question'>Question: Should antipathy develop between a couple
after the Marriage Verses have been read and the dowry paid, may
divorce take place without observance of the year of patience?</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> Divorce may legitimately be sought after the reading
of the Marriage Verses and payment of the dowry, but before the
consummation of the marriage. In such circumstances there is no need
for observance of a year of patience, but recovery of the dowry
payment is not permissible.</span></p>

parents of both parties to the marriage, and in this respect it
maketh no difference whether the bride be a virgin or otherwise.</span></p>

burial taketh place, however, the more fitting and acceptable will it

<span class='question'>Question: What procedure should be followed on the
discovery of lost property?</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> If such property be found in the town, its discovery
is to be announced once by the town crier. If the owner of the
property is then found, it should be delivered up to him. Otherwise,
the finder of the property should wait one year, and if, during this
period, the owner cometh to light, the finder should receive from him
the crier’s fee and restore to him his property; only if the year
should pass without the owner’s being identified may the finder
take possession of the property himself. If the value of the property
is less than or equal to the crier’s fee, the finder should wait a
single day from the time of its discovery, at the end of which, if
the owner hath not come to light, he may himself appropriate it; and
in the case of property discovered in an uninhabited area, the finder
should observe a three days’ wait, on the passing of which period,
if the identity of the owner remain unknown, he is free to take
possession of his find.</span></p>

divorce, and should his preparations for the journey extend until a
year hath passed, may this period be counted as the year of patience,
or should the day the couple part be regarded as the starting point
of that year?</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> The starting point for computation is the day the
couple part, and if, therefore, they have separated a year before the
husband’s departure, and if the fragrance of affection hath not
been renewed between the couple, divorce may take place. Otherwise
the year must be counted from the day of his departure, and the

<span class='question'>Question: Concerning disparities between certain

  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> Many Tablets were revealed and dispatched in their
original form without being checked and reviewed. Consequently, as
bidden, they were again read out in the Holy Presence, and brought
into conformity with the grammatical conventions of the people in
order to forestall the cavils of opponents of the Cause. Another
reason for this practice is that the new style inaugurated by the
Herald, may the souls of all else but Him be offered up for His sake,
was seen to be marked by substantial latitude in adherence to the
rules of grammar; sacred verses therefore were then revealed in a
style which is for the most part in conformity with current usage for
ease of understanding and concision of expression.</span></p>

  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> Whatever hath been constructed for the worship of the
one true God, such as mosques, chapels and temples, must not be used
for any purpose other than the commemoration of His Name. This is an
ordinance of God, and he who violateth it is verily of those who have
transgressed. No harm attacheth to the builder, for he hath performed
his deed for the sake of God, and hath received and will continue to
receive his just reward.</span></p>

  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> Regarding the written question on the exchange of
property held in trust to guard against depreciation and loss, such
exchange is permissible on condition that the substitute will be

<p id='3.98' data-ref='ka_en-3-98' class='nodropcap'>
<span class='question'>Question: A further question on divorce.</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> Since God, exalted be His glory, doth not favor
divorce, nothing was revealed on this issue. However, from the
beginning of the separation until the end of one year, two people or
more must remain informed as witnesses; if, by the end, there is no
reconciliation, divorce taketh place. This must be recorded in the
registry by the religious judicial officer of the city appointed by
the Trustees of the House of Justice. Observance of this procedure is
essential lest those that are possessed of an understanding heart be
saddened.</span></p>

<span class='question'>Question: Concerning consultation.</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> If consultation among the first group of people
assembled endeth in disagreement, new people should be added, after
which persons to the number of the Greatest Name, or fewer or more,
shall be chosen by lot. Whereupon the consultation shall be renewed,
and the outcome, whatever it is, shall be obeyed. If, however, there
is still disagreement, the same procedure should be repeated once
more, and the decision of the majority shall prevail. He, verily,
guideth whomsoever He pleaseth to the right way.</span></p>

<span class='question'>Question: Concerning inheritance.</span>
  <span class='answer'><i>Answer:</i> Regarding inheritance, that which the Primal Point
hath ordained — may the souls of all else but Him be offered up for
His sake — is well pleasing. The existing heirs should receive their
allotted shares of the inheritance, while a statement of the
remainder must be submitted to the Court of the Most High. In His
hand is the source of authority; He ordaineth as He pleaseth. In this
regard, a law was revealed in the Land of Mystery, <a data-fnid='3.10'></a>
temporarily awarding the missing heirs’ inheritance to the existing
heirs until such time as the House of Justice shall be established,
when the decree concerning this will be promulgated. The inheritance,
however, of those who emigrated in the same year as the Ancient
Beauty, hath been awarded to their heirs, and this is a bounty of God
bestowed upon them.</span></p>

right of the discoverer, and the other two-thirds should be expended
by the men of the House of Justice for the welfare of all people.
This shall be done after the establishment of the House of Justice,

And in
another Tablet, these exalted words have been revealed:</i> O
Muḥammad! The Ancient of Days hath turned His countenance towards
thee, making mention of thee, and exhorting the people of God to
educate their children. Should a father neglect this most weighty
commandment laid down in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas by the Pen of the Eternal
King, he shall forfeit rights of fatherhood, and be accounted guilty
before God. Well is it with him who imprinteth on his heart the
admonitions of the Lord, and steadfastly cleaveth unto them. God, in
truth, enjoineth on His servants what shall assist and profit them,
and enable them to draw nigh unto Him. He is the Ordainer, the
Everlasting. </p>

<p id='3.106' data-ref='ka_en-3-106' class='nodropcap answer'>
He is God,
exalted be He, the Lord of majesty and power! The Prophets and Chosen
Ones have all been commissioned by the One True God, magnified be His
glory, to nurture the trees of human existence with the living waters
of uprightness and understanding, that there may appear from them
that which God hath deposited within their inmost selves. As may be
readily observed, each tree yieldeth a certain fruit, and a barren
tree is but fit for fire. The purpose of these Educators, in all they
said and taught, was to preserve man’s exalted station. Well is it
with him who in the Day of God hath laid fast hold upon His precepts
and hath not deviated from His true and fundamental Law. The fruits
that best befit the tree of human life are trustworthiness and
godliness, truthfulness and sincerity; but greater than all, after
recognition of the unity of God, praised and glorified be He, is
regard for the rights that are due to one’s parents. This teaching
hath been mentioned in all the Books of God, and reaffirmed by the
Most Exalted Pen. Consider that which the Merciful Lord hath revealed
in the Qur’án, exalted are His words: “Worship ye God, join with
Him no peer or likeness; and show forth kindliness and charity
towards your parents…” Observe how loving-kindness to one’s
parents hath been linked to recognition of the one true God! Happy
they who are endued with true wisdom and understanding, who see and
perceive, who read and understand, and who observe that which God
hath revealed in the Holy Books of old, and in this incomparable and
wondrous Tablet.</p>

what hath been revealed in the Qur’án.</p>

				The husband must fix for his wife the time of his return when

				If antipathy or resentment develop on the part of either the
				husband or the wife, divorce is permissible, only after the lapse

				must be testified by two or more witnesses. The act of divorce
				should be registered by the judicial officer representing the

				Remarrying the wife whom one has divorced is permissible,

				<li/>
<p><a name="ka_en-4-2-4-3-2-6"></a>
				If at any time during the waiting period affection should recur,

				will have to be commenced.</p>

<p><a name="ka_en-4-2-4-3-2-7"></a>

<b>1. the sweet-smelling savor
of My garment <a href="#ka_en-1-4">¶4</a></p>
<p>This is an
allusion to the story of Joseph in the Qur’án and the Old
Testament, in which Joseph’s garment, brought by his brothers to
Jacob, their father, enabled Jacob to identify his beloved long-lost
son. The metaphor of the fragrant <i>“garment”</i> is frequently
used in the Bahá’í Writings to refer to the recognition of the
Manifestation of God and His Revelation.</p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh, in one of His Tablets, describes Himself as the
<i>“Divine Joseph”</i> Who has been <i>“bartered away”</i> by
the heedless <i>“for the most paltry of prices.”</i> The Báb, in
the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, identifies Bahá’u’lláh as the <i>“true
Joseph”</i> and forecasts the ordeals that He would endure at the
hands of His treacherous brother (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-190">190</a>).
Likewise, Shoghi Effendi draws a parallel between the intense
jealousy which the preeminence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had aroused
in His half-brother, Mírzá Muḥammad-‘Alí, and the deadly envy
“which the superior excellence of Joseph had kindled in the hearts
of his brothers.”</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-2"></a>
<b>2. We have unsealed the
choice Wine with the fingers of might and power.
<a href="#ka_en-1-5">¶5</a></p>
<p>The consumption of
wine and other intoxicants is prohibited in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (see
notes <a href="#ka_en-5-144">144</a> and <a href="#ka_en-5-170">170</a>).</p>
<p>
Reference to the use of “wine” in an allegorical sense — such as
being the cause of spiritual ecstasy — is found, not only in the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, but in the Bible, in the Qur’án,
and in ancient Hindu traditions.</p>
<p>
For example, in the Qur’án the righteous are promised that they
will be given to drink of the <i>“choice sealed wine.”</i> In His
Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh identifies the <i>“choice Wine”</i>
with His Revelation whose <i>“musk-laden fragrance”</i> has been
wafted <i>“upon all created things.”</i> He states that He has
<i>“unsealed”</i> this <i>“Wine,”</i> thereby disclosing
spiritual truths that were hitherto unknown, and enabling those who
quaff thereof to <i>“discern the splendors of the light of divine
unity”</i> and to <i>“grasp the essential purpose underlying the
Scriptures of God.”</i></p>
<p>
In one of His meditations, Bahá’u’lláh entreats God to supply
the believers with <i>“the choice Wine of Thy mercy, that it may
cause them to be forgetful of anyone except Thee, and to arise to
serve Thy Cause, and to be steadfast in their love for Thee.”</i></p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-3"></a>
<b>3. We have enjoined
obligatory prayer upon you
<a href="#ka_en-1-6">¶6</a></p>
<p>In Arabic, there
are several words for prayer. The word “ṣalát,” which appears
here in the original, refers to a particular category of prayers, the
recitation of which at specific times of the day is enjoined on the
believers. To differentiate this category of prayers from other
kinds, the word has been translated as <i>“obligatory prayer.”</i></p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh states that <i>“obligatory prayer and fasting
occupy an exalted station in the sight of God”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-93">93</a>).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá affirms that such prayers are <i>“conducive
to humility and submissiveness, to setting one’s face towards God
and expressing devotion to Him,”</i> and that through these prayers
<i>“man holdeth communion with God, seeketh to draw near unto Him,
converseth with the true Beloved of his heart, and attaineth
spiritual stations.”</i></p>
<p>
The Obligatory Prayer (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-9">9</a>) referred
to in this verse has been superseded by the three Obligatory Prayers
later revealed by Bahá’u’lláh (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-63">63</a>).
The texts of the three prayers currently in use, together with
instructions regarding their recital, are to be found in this volume
in Some Texts Supplementary to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.</p>
<p>
A number of the items in Questions and Answers deal with aspects of
the three new Obligatory Prayers. Bahá’u’lláh clarifies that
the individual is permitted to choose any one of the three Obligatory
Prayers (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-65">65</a>). Other provisions are
elucidated in Questions and Answers, numbers <a href="#ka_en-3-66">66</a>,
<a href="#ka_en-3-67">67</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-81">81</a>, and <a href="#ka_en-3-82">82</a>.</p>
<p>
The details of the law concerning obligatory prayer are summarized in
section IV.A.1.–17. of the Synopsis and Codification.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-4"></a>
<b>4. nine rak‘ahs
<a href="#ka_en-1-6">¶6</a></p>
<p>A rak‘ah is the
recitation of specifically revealed verses accompanied by a
prescribed set of genuflections and other movements.</p>
<p>
The Obligatory Prayer originally enjoined by Bahá’u’lláh upon
His followers consisted of nine rak‘ahs. The precise nature of this
prayer and the specific instructions for its recitation are unknown,
as the prayer has been lost. (See note <a href="#ka_en-5-9">9</a>.)</p>
<p>
In a Tablet commenting on the presently binding Obligatory Prayers,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that <i>“in every word and
movement of the Obligatory Prayer there are allusions, mysteries and
a wisdom that man is unable to comprehend, and letters and scrolls
cannot contain.”</i></p>
<p>
Shoghi Effendi explains that the few simple directions given by
Bahá’u’lláh for the recital of certain prayers not only have a
spiritual significance but that they also help the individual “to
fully concentrate when praying and meditating.”</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-5"></a>
<b>5. at noon and in the
morning and the evening
<a href="#ka_en-1-6">¶6</a></p>
<p>Regarding the
definition of the words <i>“morning,”</i> <i>“noon”</i> and
<i>“evening,”</i> at which times the currently binding medium
Obligatory Prayer is to be recited, Bahá’u’lláh has stated that
these coincide with <i>“sunrise, noon and sunset”</i> (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-83">83</a>). He specifies that the <i>“allowable
times for Obligatory Prayers are from morning till noon, from noon
till sunset, and from sunset till two hours thereafter.”</i>
Further, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stated that the morning
Obligatory Prayer may be said as early as dawn.</p>
<p>
The definition of <i>“noon”</i> as the period <i>“from noon
till sunset”</i> applies to the recitation of the short Obligatory
Prayer as well as the medium one.</p>

<b>6. We have relieved you of

<p>The requirements
for obligatory prayer called for in the Bábí and Islamic
Dispensations were more demanding than those for the performance of
the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak‘ahs that was
prescribed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-4">4</a>).</p>
<p>
In the Bayán, the Báb prescribed an Obligatory Prayer consisting of
nineteen rak‘ahs which was to be performed once in a
twenty-four-hour period — from noon of one day to noon of the next.</p>
<p>
The Muslim prayer is recited five times a day, namely, in the early
morning, at midday, in the afternoon and evening, and at night. While
the number of rak‘ahs varies according to the time of recitation, a
total of seventeen rak‘ahs are offered in the course of a day.</p>

<b>7. When ye desire to

Presence, this Hallowed Spot that God hath … decreed to be the
Point of Adoration for the denizens of the Cities of Eternity
<a href="#ka_en-1-6">¶6</a></p>
<p>The <i>“Point of
Adoration,”</i> that is, the point to which the worshiper should
turn when offering obligatory prayer, is called the Qiblih. The
concept of Qiblih has existed in previous religions. Jerusalem in the
past had been fixed for this purpose. Muḥammad changed the Qiblih
to Mecca. The Báb’s instructions in the Arabic Bayán were:</p>

<p>
<i>The Qiblih is indeed He Whom God will make manifest; whenever He
moveth, it moveth, until He shall come to rest.</i></p>

<p>
This passage is quoted by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
(<a href="#ka_en-1-137">¶137</a>) and confirmed by Him in the
above-noted verse. He has also indicated that facing in the direction
of the Qiblih is a <i>“fixed requirement for the recitation of
obligatory prayer”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-14">14</a> and
<a href="#ka_en-3-67">67</a>). However, for other prayers and
devotions the individual may face in any direction.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-8"></a>
<b>8. and when the Sun of
Truth and Utterance shall set, turn your faces towards the Spot that
We have ordained for you
<a href="#ka_en-1-6">¶6</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
ordains His resting-place as the Qiblih after His passing. The Most
Holy Tomb is at Bahjí, ‘Akká. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes
that Spot as the <i>“luminous Shrine,”</i> <i>“the place around
which circumambulate the Concourse on High.”</i></p>
<p>
In a letter written on his behalf, Shoghi Effendi uses the analogy of
the plant turning in the direction of the sun to explain the
spiritual significance of turning towards the Qiblih:</p>

<p>
…just as the plant stretches out to the sunlight — from which it
receives life and growth — so we turn our hearts to the Manifestation
of God, Bahá’u’lláh, when we pray; … we turn our faces … to
where His dust lies on this earth as a symbol of the inner act.</p>

<b>9. We have set forth the

<a href="#ka_en-1-8">¶8</a></p>
<p>The original
Obligatory Prayer had <i>“for reasons of wisdom”</i> been
revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in a separate Tablet (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-63">63</a>).
It was not released to the believers in His lifetime, having been
superseded by the three Obligatory Prayers now in use.</p>
<p>
Shortly after the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, the text of this
prayer, along with a number of other Tablets, was stolen by
Muḥammad-‘Alí, the Arch-breaker of His Covenant.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-10"></a>
<b>10. the Prayer for the Dead
<a href="#ka_en-1-8">¶8</a></p>
<p>The Prayer for the
Dead (see Some Texts Supplementary to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas) is the only
Bahá’í obligatory prayer which is to be recited in congregation;
it is to be recited by one believer while all present stand in
silence (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-19">19</a>). Bahá’u’lláh
has clarified that the Prayer for the Dead is required only when the
deceased is an adult (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-70">70</a>), that the
recital should precede the interment of the deceased, and that there
is no requirement to face the Qiblih when saying this prayer (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-85">85</a>).</p>
<p>
Further details concerning the Prayer for the Dead are summarized in
the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.A. 13.–14.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-11"></a>
<b>11. six specific passages
have been sent down by God, the Revealer of Verses
<a href="#ka_en-1-8">¶8</a></p>
<p>The passages that
form part of the Prayer for the Dead comprise the repetition of the
greeting “Alláh-u-Abhá” (God is the All-Glorious) six times,
each followed by nineteen repetitions of one of six specifically
revealed verses. These verses are identical with those in the Prayer
for the Dead revealed by the Báb in the Bayán. Bahá’u’lláh
added a supplication to precede these passages.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-12"></a>
<b>12. Hair doth not
invalidate your prayer, nor aught from which the spirit hath
departed, such as bones and the like. Ye are free to wear the fur of
the sable as ye would that of the beaver, the squirrel, and other
animals <a href="#ka_en-1-9">¶9</a></p>
<p>In some earlier
religious Dispensations, the wearing of the hair of certain animals
or having certain other objects on one’s person was held to
invalidate one’s prayer. Bahá’u’lláh here confirms the Báb’s
pronouncement in the Arabic Bayán that such things do not invalidate
one’s prayer.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-13"></a>
<b>13. We have commanded you
to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity
<a href="#ka_en-1-10">¶10</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
defines the “age of maturity with respect to religious duties” as
<i>“fifteen for both men and women”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-20">20</a>).
For details of the period of fasting, see note <a href="#ka_en-5-25">25</a>. </p>

<b>14. He hath exempted from
this those who are weak from illness or age
<a href="#ka_en-1-10">¶10</a></p>
<p>The exemption of
those who are weak due to illness or advanced age from offering the
Obligatory Prayers and from fasting is explained in Questions and
Answers. Bahá’u’lláh indicates that in <i>“time of ill health
it is not permissible to observe these obligations”</i> (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-93">93</a>). He defines old age, in this context,
as being from seventy (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-74">74</a>). In
answer to a question, Shoghi Effendi has clarified that people who
attain the age of seventy are exempt, whether or not they are weak.</p>
<p>
Exemption from fasting is also granted to the other specific
categories of people listed in the Synopsis and Codification, section
IV.B.5. See notes <a href="#ka_en-5-20">20</a>, <a href="#ka_en-5-30">30</a>
and <a href="#ka_en-5-31">31</a> for additional discussion.</p>

<b>15. God hath granted you
leave to prostrate yourselves on any surface that is clean, for We
have removed in this regard the limitation that had been laid down in
the Book <a href="#ka_en-1-10">¶10</a></p>
<p>The requirements
of prayer in previous Dispensations have often included prostration.
In the Arabic Bayán the Báb called upon the believers to lay their
foreheads on surfaces of crystal when prostrating. Similarly, in
Islám, certain restrictions are imposed with regard to the surface
on which Muslims are permitted to prostrate. Bahá’u’lláh
abrogates such restrictions and simply specifies <i>“any surface
that is clean.”</i></p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-16"></a>
<b>16. Let him that findeth no
water for ablution repeat five times the words “In the Name of God,
the Most Pure, the Most Pure,” and then proceed to his devotions.
<a href="#ka_en-1-10">¶10</a></p>
<p>Ablutions are to
be performed by the believer in preparation for the offering of
obligatory prayer. They consist of washing the hands and face. If
water is unavailable, the repetition five times of the specifically
revealed verse is prescribed. See note <a href="#ka_en-5-34">34</a>
for a general discussion of ablutions.</p>
<p>
Antecedents in earlier Dispensations for the provision of substitute
procedures to be followed when no water is available are found in the
Qur’án and in the Arabic Bayán.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-17"></a>
<b>17. In regions where the
days and nights grow long, let times of prayer be gauged by clocks

<a href="#ka_en-1-10">¶10</a></p>
<p>This refers to
territories situated in the extreme north or south, where the
duration of days and nights varies markedly (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-64">64</a>
and <a href="#ka_en-3-103">103</a>). This provision applies also to
fasting.</p>

<b>18. We have absolved you
from the requirement of performing the Prayer of the Signs.
<a href="#ka_en-1-11">¶11</a></p>
<p>The Prayer of the
Signs is a special form of Muslim obligatory prayer that was ordained
to be said in times of natural events, like earthquakes, eclipses,
and other such phenomena, which may cause fear and are taken to be
signs or acts of God. The requirement of performing this prayer has
been annulled. In its place a Bahá’í may say, <i>“Dominion is
God’s, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of creation,”</i>
but this is not obligatory (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-52">52</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-19"></a>
<b>19. Save in the Prayer for
the Dead, the practice of congregational prayer hath been annulled.
<a href="#ka_en-1-12">¶12</a></p>
<p>Congregational
prayer, in the sense of formal obligatory prayer which is to be
recited in accordance with a prescribed ritual as, for example, is
the custom in Islám where Friday prayer in the mosque is led by an
imám, has been annulled in the Bahá’í Dispensation. The Prayer
for the Dead (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-10">10</a>) is the only
congregational prayer prescribed by Bahá’í law. It is to be
recited by one of those present while the remainder of the party
stands in silence; the reader has no special status. The congregation
is not required to face the Qiblih (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-85">85</a>).</p>
<p>
The three daily Obligatory Prayers are to be recited individually,
not in congregation.</p>
<p>
There is no prescribed way for the recital of the many other Bahá’í
prayers, and all are free to use such non-obligatory prayers in
gatherings or individually as they please. In this regard, Shoghi
Effendi states that</p>

<p>
…although the friends are thus left to follow their own
inclination, … they should take the utmost care that any manner
they practice should not acquire too rigid a character, and thus
develop into an institution. This is a point which the friends should
always bear in mind, lest they deviate from the clear path indicated
in the Teachings.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-20"></a>
<b>20. God hath exempted women
who are in their courses from obligatory prayer and fasting.
<a href="#ka_en-1-13">¶13</a></p>
<p>Exemption from
obligatory prayer and fasting is granted to women who are
menstruating; they should, instead, perform their ablutions (see note
<a href="#ka_en-5-34">34</a>) and repeat 95 times a day between one
noon and the next, the verse <i>“Glorified be God, the Lord of
Splendor and Beauty.”</i> This provision has its antecedent in the
Arabic Bayán, where a similar dispensation was granted.</p>
<p>
In some earlier religious Dispensations, women in their courses were
considered ritually unclean and were forbidden to observe the duties
of prayer and fasting. The concept of ritual uncleanness has been
abolished by Bahá’u’lláh (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-106">106</a>).</p>
<p>
The Universal House of Justice has clarified that the provisions in
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas granting exemptions from certain duties and
responsibilities are, as the word indicates, exemptions and not
prohibitions. Any believer is, therefore, free to avail himself or
herself of an applicable exemption if he or she so wishes. However,
the House of Justice counsels that, in deciding whether to do so or
not, the believer should use wisdom and realize that Bahá’u’lláh
has granted these exemptions for good reason.</p>
<p>
The prescribed exemption from obligatory prayer, originally related
to the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak‘ahs, is now
applicable to the three Obligatory Prayers which superseded it.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-21"></a>

<p>Exemption from
obligatory prayer is granted to those who find themselves in such a
condition of insecurity that the saying of the Obligatory Prayers is
not possible. The exemption applies whether one is traveling or at
home, and it provides a means whereby Obligatory Prayers which have
remained unsaid on account of these insecure circumstances may be
compensated for.</p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh has made it clear that obligatory prayer <i>“is
not suspended during travel”</i> so long as one can find a <i>“safe
spot”</i> in which to perform it (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-58">58</a>).</p>

<b>23. Say: God hath made My
hidden love the key to the Treasure
<a href="#ka_en-1-15">¶15</a></p>
<p>There is a
well-known Islamic tradition concerning God and His creation: </p>

<p>
I was a Hidden Treasure. I wished to be made known, and thus I called
creation into being in order that I might be known.</p>

<p>References and
allusions to this tradition are found throughout the Bahá’í
Writings. For example, in one of His prayers, Bahá’u’lláh
reveals:</p>

<p>
<i>Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I testify that Thou wast a
hidden Treasure wrapped within Thine immemorial Being and an
impenetrable Mystery enshrined in Thine own Essence. Wishing to
reveal Thyself, Thou didst call into being the Greater and the Lesser
Worlds, and didst choose Man above all Thy creatures, and didst make
Him a sign of both of these worlds, O Thou Who art our Lord, the Most
Compassionate!</i></p>
<p>
<i>Thou didst raise Him up to occupy Thy throne before all the people
of Thy creation. Thou didst enable Him to unravel Thy mysteries, and
to shine with the lights of Thine inspiration and Thy Revelation, and
to manifest Thy names and Thine attributes. Through Him Thou didst
adorn the preamble of the book of Thy creation, O Thou Who art the
Ruler of the universe Thou hast fashioned!</i> (<i>Prayers and
Meditations by Bahá’u’lláh</i>, XXXVIII)</p>

<p>Likewise, in the
Hidden Words, He states:</p>

<p>
<i>O Son of Man! I loved thy creation, hence I created thee.
Wherefore, do thou love Me, that I may name thy name and fill thy
soul with the Spirit of life.</i></p>

<p>‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
in His commentary on the above-cited tradition, wrote:</p>

<p>
<i>O wayfarer in the path of the Beloved! Know thou that the main
purpose of this holy tradition is to make mention of the stages of
God’s concealment and manifestation within the Embodiments of
Truth, They who are the Dawning-places of His All-Glorious Being. For
example, before the flame of the undying fire is lit and manifest, it
existeth by itself within itself in the hidden identity of the
universal Manifestations, and this is the stage of the “Hidden
Treasure.” And when the blessed Tree is kindled by itself within
itself, and that Divine fire burneth by its essence within its
essence, this is the stage of “I wished to be made known.” And
when it shineth forth from the Horizon of the universe with infinite
Divine Names and Attributes upon the contingent and placeless worlds,
this constituteth the emergence of a new and wondrous creation which
correspondeth to the stage of “Thus I called creation into being.”
And when the sanctified souls rend asunder the veils of all earthly
attachments and worldly conditions, and hasten to the stage of gazing
on the beauty of the Divine Presence and are honored by recognizing
the Manifestation and are able to witness the splendor of God’s
Most Great Sign in their hearts, then will the purpose of creation,
which is the knowledge of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, become
manifest.</i></p>

<b>25. We have enjoined upon
you fasting during a brief period
<a href="#ka_en-1-16">¶16</a></p>
<p>Fasting and
obligatory prayer constitute the two pillars that sustain the
revealed Law of God. Bahá’u’lláh in one of His Tablets affirms
that He has revealed the laws of obligatory prayer and fasting so
that through them the believers may draw nigh unto God.</p>
<p>
Shoghi Effendi indicates that the fasting period, which involves
complete abstention from food and drink from sunrise till sunset, is</p>

<p>
…essentially a period of meditation and prayer, of spiritual
recuperation, during which the believer must strive to make the
necessary readjustments in his inner life, and to refresh and
reinvigorate the spiritual forces latent in his soul. Its
significance and purpose are, therefore, fundamentally spiritual in
character. Fasting is symbolic, and a reminder of abstinence from
selfish and carnal desires.</p>

<p>
Fasting is enjoined on all the believers once they attain the age of
15 and until they reach the age of 70 years.</p>
<p>
A summary of the detailed provisions concerning the law of fasting
and of the exemptions granted to certain categories of people is
contained in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.B.1.–6. For
a discussion of the exemptions from fasting see notes <a href="#ka_en-5-14">14</a>,
<a href="#ka_en-5-20">20</a>, <a href="#ka_en-5-30">30</a> and <a href="#ka_en-5-31">31</a>.</p>
<p>
The nineteen-day period of fasting coincides with the Bahá’í
month of ‘Alá’, usually 2–20 March, immediately after the
termination of the Intercalary Days (see notes <a href="#ka_en-5-27">27</a>
and <a href="#ka_en-5-147">147</a>), and is followed by the feast of
Naw-Rúz (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-26">26</a>).</p>

<b>26. and at its close have
designated for you Naw-Rúz as a feast
<a href="#ka_en-1-16">¶16</a></p>
<p>The Báb
introduced a new calendar, known now as the Badí‘ or Bahá’í
calendar (see notes <a href="#ka_en-5-27">27</a> and <a href="#ka_en-5-147">147</a>).
According to this calendar, a day is the period from sunset to
sunset. In the Bayán, the Báb ordained the month of ‘Alá’ to
be the month of fasting, decreed that the day of Naw-Rúz should mark
the termination of that period, and designated Naw-Rúz as the Day of
God. Bahá’u’lláh confirms the Badí‘ calendar wherein Naw-Rúz
is designated as a feast.</p>
<p>
Naw-Rúz is the first day of the new year. It coincides with the
spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, which usually occurs on 21
March. Bahá’u’lláh explains that this feast day is to be
celebrated on whatever day the sun passes into the constellation of
Aries (i.e. the vernal equinox), even should this occur one minute
before sunset (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-35">35</a>). Hence Naw-Rúz
could fall on 20, 21, or 22 March, depending on the time of the
equinox.</p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh has left the details of many laws to be filled in
by the Universal House of Justice. Among these are a number of
matters affecting the Bahá’í calendar. The Guardian has stated
that the implementation, worldwide, of the law concerning the timing
of Naw-Rúz will require the choice of a particular spot on earth
which will serve as the standard for the fixing of the time of the
spring equinox. He also indicated that the choice of this spot has
been left to the decision of the Universal House of Justice.</p>

<b>27. Let the days in excess

<a href="#ka_en-1-16">¶16</a></p>
<p>The Badí‘
calendar is based on the solar year of 365 days, 5 hours, and 50 odd
minutes. The year consists of 19 months of 19 days each (i.e. 361
days), with the addition of four extra days (five in a leap year).
The Báb did not specifically define the place for the intercalary
days in the new calendar. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas resolves this question
by assigning the <i>“excess”</i> days a fixed position in the
calendar immediately preceding the month of ‘Alá’, the period of
fasting. For further details see the section on the Bahá’í
calendar in <i>The Bahá’í World</i>, volume XVIII.</p>

is an Arabic phrase meaning “God the All-Glorious.” It is a form
of the Greatest Name of God (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-137">137</a>).
In Islám there is a tradition that among the many names of God, one
was the greatest; however, the identity of this Greatest Name was
hidden. Bahá’u’lláh has confirmed that the Greatest Name is
“Bahá.”</p>
<p>
The various derivatives of the word “Bahá” are also regarded as
the Greatest Name. Shoghi Effendi’s secretary writing on his behalf
explains that</p>

<p>
The Greatest Name is the Name of Bahá’u’lláh. “Yá
Bahá’u’l-Abhá” is an invocation meaning: “O Thou Glory of
Glories!” “Alláh-u-Abhá” is a greeting which means: “God
the All-Glorious.” Both refer to Bahá’u’lláh. By Greatest
Name is meant that Bahá’u’lláh has appeared in God’s Greatest
Name, in other words, that He is the supreme Manifestation of God.</p>

<p>
The greeting “Alláh-u-Abhá” was adopted during the period of
Bahá’u’lláh’s exile in Adrianople.</p>
<p>
The repetition of “Allah-u-Abhá” ninety-five times is to be
preceded by the performance of ablutions (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-34">34</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-34"></a>
<b>34. Perform ye …
ablutions for the Obligatory Prayer
<a href="#ka_en-1-18">¶18</a></p>
<p>Ablutions are
specifically associated with certain prayers. They must precede the
offering of the three Obligatory Prayers, the daily recitation of
“Alláh-u-Abhá” ninety-five times, and the recital of the verse
prescribed as an alternative to obligatory prayer and fasting for
women in their courses (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-20">20</a>).</p>
<p>
The prescribed ablutions consist of washing the hands and the face in
preparation for prayer. In the case of the medium Obligatory Prayer,
this is accompanied by the recitation of certain verses (see Some
Texts Revealed by Bahá’u’lláh Supplementary to the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas).</p>
<p>
That ablutions have a significance beyond washing may be seen from
the fact that even should one have bathed oneself immediately before
reciting the Obligatory Prayer, it would still be necessary to
perform ablutions (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-18">18</a>).</p>
<p>
When no water is available for ablutions, a prescribed verse is to be
repeated five times (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-16">16</a>), and this
provision is extended to those for whom the use of water would be
physically harmful (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-51">51</a>).</p>
<p>
The detailed provisions of the law concerning ablutions are set out
in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.A.10.a.–g., as well as
in Questions and Answers numbers <a href="#ka_en-3-51">51</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-62">62</a>,

<p>The prohibition
against taking another’s life is repeated by Bahá’u’lláh in

Penalties are prescribed for premeditated murder (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-86">86</a>).
In the case of manslaughter, it is necessary to pay a specified
indemnity to the family of the deceased (see Kitáb-i-Aqdas, <a href="#ka_en-1-188">¶188</a>).</p>

<a href="#ka_en-1-19">¶19</a></p>
<p>The Arabic word
“ziná,” here translated as <i>“adultery,”</i> signifies both
fornication and adultery. It applies not only to sexual relations
between a married person and someone who is not his or her spouse,
but also to extramarital sexual intercourse in general. One form of
“ziná” is rape. The only penalty prescribed by Bahá’u’lláh
is for those who commit fornication (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-77">77</a>);
penalties for other kinds of sexual offense are left to the Universal
House of Justice to determine.</p>

<b>37. backbiting or calumny
<a href="#ka_en-1-19">¶19</a></p>
<p>Backbiting,
slander and dwelling on the faults of others have been repeatedly
condemned by Bahá’u’lláh. In the Hidden Words, He clearly
states: <i>“O Son of Being! How couldst thou forget thine own
faults and busy thyself with the faults of others? Whoso doeth this
is accursed of Me.”</i> And again: <i>“O Son of Man! Breathe not
the sins of others so long as thou art thyself a sinner. Shouldst
thou transgress this command, accursed wouldst thou be, and to this I
bear witness.”</i> This strong admonition is further reiterated in
His last work, <i>“the Book of My Covenant”</i>: <i>“Verily I
say, the tongue is for mentioning what is good, defile it not with
unseemly talk. God hath forgiven what is past. Henceforward everyone
should utter that which is meet and seemly, and should refrain from
slander, abuse and whatever causeth sadness in men.”</i></p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-38"></a>
<b>38. We have divided
inheritance into seven categories
<a href="#ka_en-1-20">¶20</a></p>
<p>The Bahá’í
laws of inheritance apply only in case of intestacy, that is, when
the individual dies without leaving a will. In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
(<a href="#ka_en-1-109">¶109</a>), Bahá’u’lláh instructs every
believer to write a will. He elsewhere clearly states that the
individual has full jurisdiction over his property and is free to
determine the manner in which his or her estate is to be divided and
to designate, in the will, those, whether Bahá’í or non-Bahá’í,
who should inherit (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-69">69</a>). In this
connection, a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi explains
that:</p>

<p>
…even though a Bahá’í is permitted in his will to dispose of
his wealth in the way he wishes, yet he is morally and
conscientiously bound to always bear in mind, while writing his will,
the necessity of his upholding the principle of Bahá’u’lláh
regarding the social function of wealth, and the consequent necessity
of avoiding its overaccumulation and concentration in a few
individuals or groups of individuals.</p>

<p>
This verse of the Aqdas introduces a lengthy passage in which
Bahá’u’lláh elaborates the Bahá’í law of inheritance. In
reading this passage one should bear in mind that the law is
formulated with the presumption that the deceased is a man; its
provisions apply, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, when the deceased is a
woman.</p>
<p>
The system of inheritance which provides for distribution of the
deceased’s estate among seven categories of heirs (children,
spouse, father, mother, brothers, sisters, and teachers) is based on
the provisions set out by the Báb in the Bayán. The major features
of the Bahá’í laws of inheritance in the case of intestacy are:</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p>If the
	deceased is a father and his estate includes a personal residence,
	such residence passes to the eldest son (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-34">34</a>).</p>
	<li/>
<p>If the
	deceased has no male descendants, two-thirds of the residence pass
	to his female descendants and the remaining third passes to the
	House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-41">41</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-72">72</a>).
	See note <a href="#ka_en-5-42">42</a> concerning the levels of the
	institution of the House of Justice to which this law applies. (See
	also note <a href="#ka_en-5-44">44</a>.)</p>
	<li/>
<p>The
	remainder of the estate is divided among the seven categories of
	heirs. For details of the number of shares to be received by each
	group, see Questions and Answers, number <a href="#ka_en-3-5">5</a>,
	and Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.3.a.</p>
	<li/>
<p>In case
	there is more than one heir in any category the share allotted to
	that class should be divided between them equally, be they male or
	female.</p>
	<li/>
<p>In cases
	where there is no issue, the share of the children reverts to the
	House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-7">7</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-41">41</a>).</p>
	<li/>
<p>Should one
	leave offspring, but either part or all of the other categories of
	heirs be nonexistent, two-thirds of their shares revert to the
	offspring and one-third to the House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-7">7</a>).</p>
	<li/>
<p>Should none
	of the specified categories exist, two-thirds of the estate revert
	to the nephews and nieces of the deceased. If these do not exist,
	the same shares revert to the aunts and uncles; lacking these, to
	their sons and daughters. In any case the remaining third reverts to
	the House of Justice.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Should one
	leave none of the aforementioned heirs, the entire estate reverts to
	the House of Justice.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
	states that non-Bahá’ís have no right to inherit from their
	Bahá’í parents or relatives (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-34">34</a>).
	Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf indicates that this
	restriction applies “only to such cases when a Bahá’í dies
	without leaving a will and when, therefore, his property will have
	to be divided in accordance with the rules set forth in the Aqdas.
	Otherwise, a Bahá’í is free to bequeath his property to any
	person, irrespective of religion, provided however he leaves a will,
	specifying his wishes.” It is always possible, therefore, for a
	Bahá’í to provide for his or her non-Bahá’í partner,
	children or relatives by leaving a will.</p>
</ol>

<p>
Additional details of the laws of inheritance are summarized in the
Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.3.a.–o.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-39"></a>
<b>39. to the brothers, five
parts … to the sisters, four parts
<a href="#ka_en-1-20">¶20</a></p>
<p>Questions and
Answers amplifies the provisions of the law as it relates to the
shares of the inheritance allocated to the brothers and sisters of
the deceased. If the brother or sister is from the same father as the
deceased, he or she will inherit his or her full allotted share. If,
however, the brother or sister is from another father he or she will
inherit only two-thirds of the allotted share, the remaining
one-third reverting to the House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-6">6</a>).
Further, in the case where the deceased has full brothers or full
sisters among his heirs, half-brothers and half-sisters from the
mother’s side do not inherit (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-53">53</a>).
The half-brothers and half-sisters will, of course, be due to receive
inheritance from their own father’s estate.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-40"></a>
<b>40. the teachers
<a href="#ka_en-1-20">¶20</a></p>
<p>In a Tablet,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá compares teachers who are involved with the
spiritual education of the child to the <i>“spiritual father”</i>
who <i>“endoweth his child with everlasting life.”</i> He
explains that this is the reason that <i>“teachers are listed among
the heirs”</i> in the <i>“law of God.”</i></p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh specifies the conditions under which the teacher
inherits and the share he or she receives (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-33">33</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-41"></a>
<b>41. When We heard the
clamor of the children as yet unborn, We doubled their share and
decreased those of the rest.
<a href="#ka_en-1-20">¶20</a></p>
<p>In the Báb’s
laws of inheritance the children of the deceased were allotted nine
parts consisting of 540 shares. This allocation constituted less than
a quarter of the whole estate. Bahá’u’lláh doubled their
portion to 1,080 shares and reduced those allotted to the other six
categories of heirs. He also outlines the precise intention of this
verse and its implications for the distribution of the inheritance
(Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-5">5</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-42"></a>
<b>42. the House of Justice
<a href="#ka_en-1-21">¶21</a></p>
<p>In referring to
the House of Justice in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh does
not always explicitly distinguish between the Universal House of
Justice and the Local House of Justice, both of which institutions
are ordained in that Book. He usually refers simply to <i>“the
House of Justice,”</i> leaving open for later clarification the
level or levels of the whole institution to which each law would
apply.</p>
<p>
In a Tablet enumerating the revenues of the local treasury,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá includes those inheritances for which there
are no heirs, thus indicating that the House of Justice referred to
in these passages of the Aqdas relating to inheritance is the local
one.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-43"></a>
<b>43. Should the deceased
leave offspring, but none of the other categories of heirs
<a href="#ka_en-1-22">¶22</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
clarifies that <i>“This ruling hath both general and specific
application, which is to say that whenever any category of this
latter class of heirs is absent, two-thirds of their inheritance pass
to the offspring and the remaining third to the House of Justice”</i>
(Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-7">7</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-44"></a>
<b>44. We have assigned the
residence and personal clothing of the deceased to the male, not
female, offspring, nor to the other heirs.
<a href="#ka_en-1-25">¶25</a></p>
<p>In a Tablet,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that the residence and personal
clothing of a deceased man remain in the male line. They pass to the
eldest son and in the absence of the eldest son, they pass to the
second-eldest son, and so on. He explains that this provision is an
expression of the law of primogeniture, which has invariably been
upheld by the Law of God. In a Tablet to a follower of the Faith in
Persia He wrote: <i>“In all the Divine Dispensations the eldest son
hath been given extraordinary distinctions. Even the station of
prophethood hath been his birthright.”</i> With the distinctions
given to the eldest son, however, go concomitant duties. For example,
he has the moral responsibility, for the sake of God, to care for his
mother and also to consider the needs of the other heirs.</p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh clarifies various aspects of this part of the law
of inheritance. He specifies that if there be more than one
residence, the principal and most important one passes to the male
offspring. The remaining residences will, together with the other
possessions of the deceased, have to be divided among the heirs (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-34">34</a>), and He indicates that in the absence
of male offspring, two-thirds of the principal residence and the
personal clothing of the deceased father will revert to the female
issue and one-third to the House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-72">72</a>).
Further, when the deceased is a woman, Bahá’u’lláh states that
all her used clothing is to be equally divided amongst her daughters.
Her unworn clothing, jewels and property must be divided among her
heirs, as well as her used clothing if she leaves no daughter (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-37">37</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-45"></a>
<b>45. Should the son of the
deceased have passed away in the days of his father and have left
children, they will inherit their father’s share
<a href="#ka_en-1-26">¶26</a></p>
<p>This aspect of the
law applies only in the case of the son who predeceases his father or
mother. If the daughter of the deceased be dead and leave issue, her
share will have to be divided according to the seven categories
specified in the Most Holy Book (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-54">54</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-46"></a>
<b>46. If the deceased should
leave children who are under age, their share of the inheritance must
be entrusted to a reliable individual
<a href="#ka_en-1-27">¶27</a></p>
<p>The word “amín,”
translated in this paragraph as <i>“reliable individual”</i> and
<i>“trustee,”</i> conveys in Arabic a wide range of meanings
connected principally with the idea of trustworthiness, but
signifying also such qualities as reliability, loyalty, faithfulness,
uprightness, honesty, and so forth. Used in legal parlance “amín”
denotes, among other things, a trustee, guarantor, custodian,
guardian, and keeper.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-47"></a>
<b>47. Division of the estate
should take place only after the Ḥuqúqu’lláh hath been paid,
any debts have been settled, the expenses of the funeral and burial
defrayed <a href="#ka_en-1-28">¶28</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
specifies that the order of precedence for payment of these expenses
is first the funeral and burial expenses, then the debts of the
deceased, then the Ḥuqúqu’lláh (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-125">125</a>)
(Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-9">9</a>). He also specifies that when
applying the estate to these, payment must first be made out of the
residue of the estate and then, if this is insufficient, out of the
residence and personal clothing of the deceased (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-80">80</a>).</p>

<b>48. This is that hidden
knowledge which shall never change, since its beginning is with nine
<a href="#ka_en-1-29">¶29</a></p>
<p>In the Arabic
Bayán the Báb described His inheritance law as being <i>“in
accordance with a hidden knowledge in the Book of God — a knowledge
that shall never change or be replaced.”</i> He also stated that
the numbers by which the division of the inheritance was expressed
had been invested with a significance intended to aid in the
recognition of Him Whom God will make manifest.</p>
<p>
The <i>“nine”</i> mentioned here is represented in the Arabic
text by the letter “Ṭá,” which is its equivalent in the abjad
notation (see Glossary). It is the first element of the Báb’s
division of inheritance, where He designates <i>“nine parts”</i>
as the share of the children. The significance of nine lies in its
being the numerical equivalent of the Greatest Name “Bahá,”
alluded to in the next part of this verse as <i>“the concealed and
manifest, the inviolable and unapproachably exalted Name.”</i> (See
also note <a href="#ka_en-5-33">33</a>.)</p>

<b>49. The Lord hath ordained

<a href="#ka_en-1-30">¶30</a></p>
<p>The institution of
the House of Justice consists of elected councils which operate at
the local, national and international levels of society. Bahá’u’lláh
ordains both the Universal House of Justice and the Local Houses of
Justice in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in His Will
and Testament, provides for the Secondary (National or Regional)
Houses of Justice and outlines the method to be pursued for the
election of the Universal House of Justice.</p>
<p>
In the verse cited above, the reference is to the Local House of
Justice, an institution which is to be elected in a locality whenever
there are nine or more resident adult Bahá’ís. For this purpose,
the definition of adult was temporarily fixed at the age of 21 years
by the Guardian, who indicated it was open to change by the Universal
House of Justice in the future.</p>
<p>
Local and Secondary Houses of Justice are, for the present, known as
Local Spiritual Assemblies and National Spiritual Assemblies. Shoghi
Effendi has indicated that this is a “temporary appellation”
which, </p>

<p>
…as the position and aims of the Bahá’í Faith are better
understood and more fully recognized, will gradually be superseded by
the permanent and more appropriate designation of House of Justice.
Not only will the present-day Spiritual Assemblies be styled
differently in future, but they will be enabled also to add to their
present functions those powers, duties, and prerogatives necessitated
by the recognition of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, not merely as
one of the recognized religious systems of the world, but as the
State Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power.</p>

His Faith and has exhorted the believers to <i>“take counsel
together in all matters.”</i> He describes consultation as <i>“the
lamp of guidance which leadeth the way”</i> and as <i>“the
bestower of understanding.”</i> Shoghi Effendi states that the
“principle of consultation … constitutes one of the basic laws”
of the Bahá’í Administrative Order.</p>
<p>In Questions and

outlines an approach to consultation and stresses the importance of
achieving unanimity in decision making, failing which the majority
decision must prevail. The Universal House of Justice has clarified
that this guidance concerning consultation was revealed before
Spiritual Assemblies had been established and was in answer to a
question about the Bahá’í teachings on consultation. The House of
Justice affirms that the emergence of Spiritual Assemblies, to which
the friends may always turn for assistance, in no way prohibits them
from following the procedure outlined in Questions and Answers. This
approach may be used by the friends, should they wish, when they
desire to consult on their personal problems.</p>

indicates that it exemplifies in tangible form the integration of
“Bahá’í worship and service.” Anticipating the future
development of this institution, Shoghi Effendi envisages that the
House of Worship and its dependencies <i>“shall afford relief to

are covered by this ordinance, the House of the Báb in <u>Sh</u>íráz
and the House of Bahá’u’lláh in Ba<u>gh</u>dád. Bahá’u’lláh
has specified that pilgrimage to either of these two Houses fulfills
the requirement of this passage (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-25">25</a>,

Súriy-Ḥajj (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-10">10</a>), Bahá’u’lláh
has prescribed specific rites for each of these pilgrimages. In this
sense, the performance of a pilgrimage is more than simply visiting
these two Houses.</p>
<p>
After the passing of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
designated the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh at Bahjí as a place of
pilgrimage. In a Tablet, He indicates that the <i>“Most Holy
Shrine, the Blessed House in Ba<u>gh</u>dád and the
venerated House of the Báb in <u>Sh</u>íráz”</i>
are <i>“consecrated to pilgrimage,”</i> and that it is
<i>“obligatory”</i> to visit these places <i>“if one can afford

this law, and the mutual responsibility of the individual and society
for its implementation are explained in a letter written on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi:</p>

<p>
With reference to Bahá’u’lláh’s command concerning the
engagement of the believers in some sort of profession: the Teachings
are most emphatic on this matter, particularly the statement in the
Aqdas to this effect which makes it quite clear that idle people who
lack the desire to work can have no place in the new World Order. As
a corollary of this principle, Bahá’u’lláh further states that
mendicity should not only be discouraged but entirely wiped out from
the face of society. It is the duty of those who are in charge of the
organization of society to give every individual the opportunity of
acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of profession, and also
the means of utilizing such a talent, both for its own sake and for
the sake of earning the means of his livelihood. Every individual, no
matter how handicapped and limited he may be, is under the obligation
of engaging in some work or profession, for work, especially when
performed in the spirit of service, is according to Bahá’u’lláh
a form of worship. It has not only a utilitarian purpose, but has a
value in itself, because it draws us nearer to God, and enables us to
better grasp His purpose for us in this world. It is obvious,
therefore, that the inheritance of wealth cannot make anyone immune
from daily work.</p>

<p>
In one of His Tablets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that <i>“if a
person is incapable of earning a living, is stricken by dire poverty
or becometh helpless, then it is incumbent on the wealthy or the
Deputies to provide him with a monthly allowance for his
subsistence.… By ‘Deputies’ is meant the representatives of the
people, that is to say the members of the House of Justice.”</i>
(See also note <a href="#ka_en-5-162">162</a> on mendicancy.)</p>
<p>
In response to a question concerning whether Bahá’u’lláh’s
injunction requires a wife and mother, as well as her husband, to
work for a livelihood, the Universal House of Justice has explained
that Bahá’u’lláh’s directive is for the friends to be engaged
in an occupation which will profit themselves and others, and that
homemaking is a highly honorable and responsible work of fundamental
importance to society.</p>
<p>
Concerning the retirement from work for individuals who have reached
a certain age, Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf
stated that “this is a matter on which the International House of
Justice will have to legislate as there are no provisions in the
Aqdas concerning it.”</p>

<b>57. The kissing of hands
hath been forbidden in the Book.
<a href="#ka_en-1-34">¶34</a></p>
<p>In a number of
earlier religious Dispensations and in certain cultures the kissing
of the hand of a religious figure or of a prominent person was
expected as a mark of reverence and deference to such persons and as
a token of submission to their authority. Bahá’u’lláh prohibits
the kissing of hands and, in His Tablets, He also condemns such
practices as prostrating oneself before another person and other
forms of behavior that abase one individual in relation to another.
(See note <a href="#ka_en-5-58">58</a>.)</p>

<b>58. To none is it permitted
to seek absolution from another soul
<a href="#ka_en-1-34">¶34</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
prohibits confession to, and seeking absolution of one’s sins from,
a human being. Instead one should beg forgiveness from God. In the
Tablet of Bi<u>sh</u>árát, He states that <i>“such confession
before people results in one’s humiliation and abasement,”</i>
and He affirms that God <i>“wisheth not the humiliation of His
servants.”</i></p>
<p>
Shoghi Effendi sets the prohibition into context. His secretary has
written on his behalf that we</p>

<p>
…are forbidden to confess to any person, as do the Catholics to
their priests, our sins and shortcomings, or to do so in public, as
some religious sects do. However, if we spontaneously desire to
acknowledge we have been wrong in something, or that we have some
fault of character, and ask another person’s forgiveness or pardon,
we are quite free to do so.</p>

<p>
The Universal House of Justice has also clarified that Bahá’u’lláh’s
prohibition concerning the confession of sins does not prevent an
individual from admitting transgressions in the course of
consultations held under the aegis of Bahá’í institutions.
Likewise, it does not preclude the possibility of seeking advice from
a close friend or of a professional counselor regarding such matters.</p>

<a href="#ka_en-1-36">¶36</a></p>
<p>Traditionally in
the East it has been the practice to remove sandals and shoes before
entering a gathering. The part of a room farthest from the entrance
is regarded as the head of the room and a place of honor where the
most prominent among those present are seated. Others sit in
descending order towards the door, by which the shoes and sandals
have been left and where the most lowly would sit.</p>

attachment to such knowledge veils them from the Revelation of the
Manifestation of God. Elsewhere Bahá’u’lláh affirms: <i>“They
that are the worshipers of the idol which their imaginations have
carved, and who call it Inner Reality, such men are in truth
accounted among the heathen.”</i></p>

<p>These verses
constitute the prohibition of monasticism and asceticism. See the
Synopsis and Codification, section IV.D. 1.y.iii.-iv. In the Words of
Paradise Bahá’u’lláh amplifies these provisions. He states:
<i>“Living in seclusion or practicing asceticism is not acceptable
in the presence of God,”</i> and He calls upon those involved to
<i>“observe that which will cause joy and radiance.”</i> He
instructs those who have taken up <i>“their abodes in the caves of
the mountains”</i> or who have <i>“repaired to graveyards at
night”</i> to abandon these practices, and He enjoins them not to
deprive themselves of the <i>“bounties”</i> of this world which
have been created by God for humankind. And in the Tablet of
Bi<u>sh</u>árát, while acknowledging the <i>“pious deeds”</i>
of monks and priests, Bahá’u’lláh calls upon them to <i>“give
up the life of seclusion and direct their steps towards the open
world and busy themselves with that which will profit themselves and
others.”</i> He also grants them leave <i>“to enter into wedlock
that they may bring forth one who will make mention of God.”</i></p>

<p>The Dispensation
of Bahá’u’lláh will last until the coming of the next
Manifestation of God, Whose advent will not take place before at
least <i>“a full thousand years”</i> will have elapsed.
Bahá’u’lláh cautions against ascribing to <i>“this verse”</i>
anything other than its <i>“obvious meaning,”</i> and in one of
His Tablets, He specifies that <i>“each year”</i> of this
thousand year period consists of <i>“twelve months according to the
Qur’án, and of nineteen months of nineteen days each, according to
the Bayán.”</i></p>
<p>
The intimation of His Revelation to Bahá’u’lláh in the
Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál of Ṭihrán, in October 1852, marks the birth
of His Prophetic Mission and hence the commencement of the one
thousand years or more that must elapse before the appearance of the
next Manifestation of God.</p>

<b>66. A<u><b>gh</u><b>ṣán
<a href="#ka_en-1-42">¶42</a></p>
<p>“A<u>gh</u>ṣán”
(plural of <u>Gh</u>uṣn) is the Arabic word for “Branches.”
This term is used by Bahá’u’lláh to designate His male
descendants. It has particular implications not only for the
disposition of endowments but also for the succession of authority
following the passing of Bahá’u’lláh (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-145">145</a>)
and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Bahá’u’lláh, in the Book of His
Covenant, appointed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, His eldest son, as the
Center of His Covenant and the Head of the Faith. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
in His Will and Testament, appointed Shoghi Effendi, His eldest
grandson, as the Guardian and Head of the Faith.</p>
<p>
This passage of the Aqdas, therefore, anticipates the succession of
chosen A<u>gh</u>ṣán and thus the institution of the Guardianship
and envisages the possibility of a break in their line. The passing
of Shoghi Effendi in 1957 precipitated the very situation provided
for in this passage, in that the line of A<u>gh</u>ṣán ended
before the Universal House of Justice had been established (see note
<a href="#ka_en-5-67">67</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-67"></a>
<b>67. revert to the people of

<p>Bahá’u’lláh
provides for the possibility that the line of A<u>gh</u>ṣán would
terminate prior to the establishment of the Universal House of
Justice. He designated that in such a situation <i>“endowments
shall revert to the people of Bahá.”</i> The term <i>“people of
Bahá”</i> is used with a number of different meanings in the
Bahá’í Writings. In this instance, they are described as those
<i>“who speak not except by His leave and judge not save in
accordance with what God hath decreed in this Tablet.”</i>
Following the passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957, the Hands of the
Cause of God directed the affairs of the Cause until the election of
the Universal House of Justice in 1963 (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-183">183</a>).</p>

<a href="#ka_en-1-44">¶44</a></p>
<p>In some religious
traditions it is considered desirable to shave one’s head. The
shaving of the head is forbidden by Bahá’u’lláh, and He makes
it clear that the provision contained in His Súriy-i-Ḥajj
requiring pilgrims to the Holy House in <u>Sh</u>íráz to shave
their heads has been superseded through this verse of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-10">10</a>).</p>

forbidding the growing of the hair beyond the lobe of the ear
pertains only to men. The application of this law will require

<b>70. Exile and imprisonment

states that the determination of the degree of penalty, in accordance
with the seriousness of the offense, rests with the House of Justice
(Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-49">49</a>). The punishments for theft are
intended for a future condition of society, when they will be

<p>The mark to be
placed on the thief’s forehead serves the purpose of warning people
of his proclivities. All details concerning the nature of the mark,
how the mark is to be applied, how long it must be worn, on what
conditions it may be removed, as well as the seriousness of various
degrees of theft have been left by Bahá’u’lláh for the
Universal House of Justice to determine when the law is applied.</p>

<p>In the Bayán the

Islamic condemnation of their use which stems not from an explicit
injunction of the Qur’án but from Muslim traditions. Bahá’u’lláh
here confirms the Báb’s ruling.</p>

<b>73. Take heed lest, when

In many parts of the world it has been customary to eat with the
hands from a communal bowl.</p>

<b>74. Adopt ye such usages as

<a href="#ka_en-1-46">¶46</a></p>
<p>This is the first
of several passages referring to the importance of refinement and
cleanliness. The original Arabic word “laáfah” rendered here as
<i>“refinement,”</i> has a wide range of meanings with both
spiritual and physical implications, such as elegance, gracefulness,
cleanliness, civility, politeness, gentleness, delicacy and
graciousness, as well as being subtle, refined, sanctified and pure.
In accordance with the context of the various passages where it
occurs in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, it has been translated either as
“refinement” or “cleanliness.”</p>

<b>75. He Who is the

<p>In the Tablet of
I<u>sh</u>ráqát, Bahá’u’lláh affirms that the Most Great
Infallibility is confined to the Manifestations of God.</p>
<p>
Chapter 45 in <i>Some Answered Questions</i> is devoted to an
explanation by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá of this verse of the Aqdas. In
this chapter He stresses, among other things, the inseparability of
essential <i>“infallibility”</i> from the Manifestations of God,
and asserts that <i>“whatever emanates from Them is identical with
the truth, and conformable to reality,”</i> that <i>“They are not
under the shadow of the former laws,”</i> and <i>“Whatever They
say is the word of God, and whatever They perform is an upright
action.”</i></p>

<b>76. Unto every father hath
been enjoined the instruction of his son and daughter in the art of

<a href="#ka_en-1-48">¶48</a></p>
<p>‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
in His Tablets, not only calls attention to the responsibility of
parents to educate all their children, but He also clearly specifies
that the <i>“training and culture of daughters is more necessary
than that of sons,”</i> for girls will one day be mothers, and
mothers are the first educators of the new generation. If it is not
possible, therefore, for a family to educate all the children,
preference is to be accorded to daughters since, through educated
mothers, the benefits of knowledge can be most effectively and
rapidly diffused throughout society.</p>

<b>77. God hath imposed a fine
on every adulterer and adulteress, to be paid to the House of Justice
<a href="#ka_en-1-49">¶49</a></p>
<p>Although the term
translated here as adultery refers, in its broadest sense, to
unlawful sexual intercourse between either married or unmarried
individuals (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-36">36</a> for a definition
of the term), ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has specified that the
punishment here prescribed is for sexual intercourse between persons
who are unmarried. He indicates that it remains for the Universal
House of Justice to determine the penalty for adultery committed by a
married individual. (See also Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-49">49</a>.)</p>
<p>
In one of His Tablets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to some of the
spiritual and social implications of the violation of the laws of
morality and, concerning the penalty here described, He indicates
that the aim of this law is to make clear to all that such an action
is shameful in the eyes of God and that, in the event that the
offense can be established and the fine imposed, the principal
purpose is the exposure of the offenders — that they are shamed and
disgraced in the eyes of society. He affirms that such exposure is in
itself the greatest punishment.</p>
<p>
The House of Justice referred to in this verse is presumably the
Local House of Justice, currently known as the Local Spiritual
Assembly.</p>

<b>78. nine mi<u><b>th</u><b>qáls
of gold, to be doubled if they should repeat the offense
<a href="#ka_en-1-49">¶49</a></p>
<p>A mi<u>th</u>qál
is a unit of weight. The weight of the traditional mi<u>th</u>qál
used in the Middle East is equivalent to 24 na<u>kh</u>uds. However,
the mi<u>th</u>qál used by the Bahá’ís consists of 19 na<u>kh</u>uds,
<i>“in accordance with the specification of the Bayán”</i> (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-23">23</a>). The weight of nine of these mi<u>th</u>qál
equals 32.775 grams or 1.05374 troy ounces.</p>
<p>
In relation to the application of the fine, Bahá’u’lláh clearly
specifies that each succeeding fine is double the preceding one (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-23">23</a>); thus the fine imposed increases in
geometrical progression. The imposition of this fine is intended for
a future condition of society, at which time the law will be
supplemented and applied by the Universal House of Justice.</p>

<b>79. We have made it lawful

<p>‘Abdu’l-Bahá
has written that <i>“Among certain nations of the East, music was
considered reprehensible.”</i> Though the Qur’án contains no
specific guidance on the subject, some Muslims consider listening to
music as unlawful, while others tolerate music within certain bounds
and subject to particular conditions.</p>
<p>
There are a number of passages in the Bahá’í Writings in praise
of music. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, for example, asserts that <i>“music,
sung or played, is spiritual food for soul and heart.”</i></p>

specified that the extent of the penalty depends upon <i>“the
severity of the injury,”</i> there is no record of His having set
out the details of the size of the indemnity with regard to each
degree of offense. The responsibility to determine these devolves
upon the Universal House of Justice.</p>

<b>82. Verily, it is enjoined

<a href="#ka_en-1-57">¶57</a></p>
<p>This injunction
has become the basis for the holding of monthly Bahá’í
festivities and as such constitutes the ordination of the Nineteen
Day Feast. In the Arabic Bayán the Báb called upon His followers to
gather together once every nineteen days to show hospitality and
fellowship. Bahá’u’lláh here confirms this and notes the
unifying role of such occasions.</p>
<p>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi after Him have gradually
unfolded the institutional significance of this injunction.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá emphasized the importance of the spiritual
and devotional character of these gatherings. Shoghi Effendi, besides
further elaborating the devotional and social aspects of the Feast,
has developed the administrative element of such gatherings and, in
systematically instituting the Feast, has provided for a period of
consultation on the affairs of the Bahá’í community, including
the sharing of news and messages.</p>
<p>
In answer to a question as to whether this injunction is obligatory,
Bahá’u’lláh stated it was not (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-48">48</a>).
Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf further comments:</p>

<p>
Attendance at Nineteen Day Feasts is not obligatory but very
important, and every believer should consider it a duty and privilege
to be present on such occasions.</p>

<p>By this law,
Bahá’u’lláh greatly simplifies practices and religious
regulations of the past relating to hunting. He has also stated that
hunting with such weapons as bows and arrows, guns, and the like, is
included in this ruling, but that the consumption of game if it is
found dead in a trap or a net is prohibited (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-24">24</a>).</p>

consider what constitutes an excess in hunting.</p>

<b>85. He hath granted them no

Muslim practice, in which lineal descendants of Muḥammad are

anyone deliberately take another’s life, him also shall ye put to

<p>The law of
Bahá’u’lláh prescribes the death penalty for murder and arson,
with the alternative of life imprisonment (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-87">87</a>).</p>
<p>
In His Tablets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains the difference
between revenge and punishment. He affirms that individuals do not
have the right to take revenge, that revenge is despised in the eyes
of God, and that the motive for punishment is not vengeance, but the
imposition of a penalty for the committed offense. In <i>Some
Answered Questions</i>, He confirms that it is the right of society
to impose punishments on criminals for the purpose of protecting its
members and defending its existence. </p>
<p>
With regard to this provision, Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on
his behalf gives the following explanation:</p>

<p>
In the Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh has given death as the penalty for
murder. However, He has permitted life imprisonment as an
alternative. Both practices would be in accordance with His Laws.
Some of us may not be able to grasp the wisdom of this when it
disagrees with our own limited vision; but we must accept it, knowing
His Wisdom, His Mercy and His Justice are perfect and for the
salvation of the entire world. If a man were falsely condemned to
die, can we not believe Almighty God would compensate him a
thousandfold, in the next world, for this human injustice? You cannot
give up a salutary law just because on rare occasions the innocent
may be punished.</p>

<p>
The details of the Bahá’í law of punishment for murder and arson,
a law designed for a future state of society, were not specified by
Bahá’u’lláh. The various details of the law, such as degrees of
offense, whether extenuating circumstances are to be taken into
account, and which of the two prescribed punishments is to be the
norm are left to the Universal House of Justice to decide in light of
prevailing conditions when the law is to be in operation. The manner
in which the punishment is to be carried out is also left to the
Universal House of Justice to decide.</p>
<p>
In relation to arson, this depends on what <i>“house”</i> is
burned. There is obviously a tremendous difference in the degree of
offense between the person who burns down an empty warehouse and one
who sets fire to a school full of children.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-87"></a>
<b>87. Should ye condemn the
arsonist and the murderer to life imprisonment, it would be
permissible according to the provisions of the Book.
<a href="#ka_en-1-62">¶62</a></p>
<p>Shoghi Effendi, in
response to a question about this verse of the Aqdas, affirmed that
while capital punishment is permitted, an alternative, “life
imprisonment,” has been provided “whereby the rigors of such a
condemnation can be seriously mitigated.” He states that
“Bahá’u’lláh has given us a choice and has, therefore, left
us free to use our own discretion within certain limitations imposed
by His law.” In the absence of specific guidance concerning the
application of this aspect of Bahá’í law, it remains for the
Universal House of Justice to legislate on the matter in the future.</p>

<b>89. Beware that ye take not
unto yourselves more wives than two. Whoso contenteth himself with a
single partner from among the maidservants of God, both he and she
shall live in tranquillity.
<a href="#ka_en-1-63">¶63</a></p>
<p>While the text of
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas appears to permit bigamy, Bahá’u’lláh
counsels that tranquillity and contentment derive from monogamy. In
another Tablet, He underlines the importance of the individual’s
acting in such a way as to <i>“bring comfort to himself and to his
partner.”</i> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the authorized Interpreter
of the Bahá’í Writings, states that in the text of the Aqdas
monogamy is in effect enjoined. He elaborates this theme in a number
of Tablets, including the following:</p>

<p>
<i>Know thou that polygamy is not permitted under the law of God, for
contentment with one wife hath been clearly stipulated. Taking a
second wife is made dependent upon equity and justice being upheld
between the two wives, under all conditions. However, observance of
justice and equity towards two wives is utterly impossible. The fact
that bigamy has been made dependent upon an impossible condition is
clear proof of its absolute prohibition. Therefore it is not
permissible for a man to have more than one wife.</i></p>

<p>
Polygamy is a very ancient practice among the majority of humanity.
The introduction of monogamy has been only gradually accomplished by
the Manifestations of God. Jesus, for example, did not prohibit
polygamy, but abolished divorce except in the case of fornication;
Muḥammad limited the number of wives to four, but making plurality
of wives contingent on justice, and reintroducing permission for
divorce; Bahá’u’lláh, Who was revealing His Teachings in the
milieu of a Muslim society, introduced the question of monogamy
gradually in accordance with the principles of wisdom and the
progressive unfoldment of His purpose. The fact that He left His
followers with an infallible Interpreter of His Writings enabled Him
to outwardly permit two wives in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas but uphold a
condition that enabled ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to elucidate later
that the intention of the law was to enforce monogamy.</p>

<b>90. he who would take into
his service a maid may do so with propriety
<a href="#ka_en-1-63">¶63</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
states that a man may employ a maiden for domestic service. This was
not permissible under <u>Sh</u>í‘ih Muslim practice unless the
employer entered into a marriage contract with her. Bahá’u’lláh
emphasizes that the <i>“service”</i> referred to in this verse is
solely <i>“such as is performed by any other class of servants, be
they young or old, in exchange for wages”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-30">30</a>).
An employer has no sexual rights over his maid. She is <i>“free to
choose a husband at whatever time she pleaseth,”</i> for the
purchase of women is forbidden (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-30">30</a>).</p>

<b>91. This is My bidding unto
you; hold fast to it as an assistance to yourselves.
<a href="#ka_en-1-63">¶63</a></p>
<p>While marriage is
enjoined in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh clarifies that it
is not obligatory (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-46">46</a>). Shoghi
Effendi, in a letter written on his behalf, also declared that
“marriage is by no means an obligation,” and he affirmed that “in
the last resort, it is for the individual to decide whether he wishes
to lead a family life or live in a state of celibacy.” If a person
has to wait a considerable period of time before finding a spouse, or
ultimately must remain single, it does not mean that the individual
is thereby unable to fulfill his or her life’s purpose, which is
fundamentally spiritual.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-92"></a>
<b>92. We have conditioned it
… upon the permission of their parents
<a href="#ka_en-1-65">¶65</a></p>
<p>In a letter
written on his behalf, Shoghi Effendi has commented on this provision
of the law:</p>

<p>
Bahá’u’lláh has clearly stated the consent of all living
parents is required for a Bahá’í marriage. This applies whether
the parents are Bahá’ís or non-Bahá’ís, divorced for years or
not. This great law He has laid down to strengthen the social fabric,
to knit closer the ties of the home, to place a certain gratitude and
respect in the hearts of the children for those who have given them
life and sent their souls out on the eternal journey towards their
Creator.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-93"></a>
<b>93. No marriage may be
contracted without payment of a dowry
<a href="#ka_en-1-66">¶66</a></p>
<p>The Synopsis and
Codification, section IV.C.1.j.i.–v., summarizes the main
provisions concerning the dowry. These provisions have their
antecedents in the Bayán.</p>
<p>
The dowry is to be paid by the bridegroom to the bride. It is fixed
at 19 mi<u>th</u>qáls of pure gold for city dwellers, and 19
mi<u>th</u>qáls of silver for village dwellers (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-94">94</a>).
Bahá’u’lláh indicates that, if, at the time of the wedding, the
bridegroom is unable to pay the dowry in full, it is permissible for
him to issue a promissory note to the bride (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-39">39</a>).</p>
<p>
With the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh many familiar concepts,
customs and institutions are redefined and take on new meaning. One
of these is the dowry. The institution of dowry is a very ancient
practice in many cultures and takes many forms. In some countries it
is a payment made by the parents of the bride to the bridegroom; in
others it is a payment made by the bridegroom to the parents of the
bride, called a “bride-price.” In both such cases the amount is
often quite considerable. The law of Bahá’u’lláh abolishes all
such variants and converts the dowry into a symbolic act whereby the
bridegroom presents a gift of a certain limited value to the bride.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-94"></a>
<b>94. for city dwellers at
nineteen mi<u><b>th</u><b>qáls
of pure gold, and for village dwellers at the same amount in silver
<a href="#ka_en-1-66">¶66</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
specifies that the criterion for determining the dowry payment is the
location of the permanent residence of the bridegroom, not of the
bride (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-87">87</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-88">88</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-95"></a>
<b>95. Whoso wisheth to
increase this sum, it is forbidden him to exceed the limit of
ninety-five mi<u><b>th</u><b>qáls
… If he content himself, however, with a payment of the lowest
level, it shall be better for him according to the Book.
<a href="#ka_en-1-66">¶66</a></p>
<p>In answer to a
question about the dowry, Bahá’u’lláh stated:</p>

<p>
<i>Whatever is revealed in the Bayán, in respect to those residing
in cities and villages, is approved and should be carried out.
However, in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas mention is made of the lowest level.
The intention is nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of silver,
specified in the Bayán for village dwellers. This is more pleasing
unto God, provided the two parties agree. The purpose is to promote
the comfort of all, and to bring about concord and union among the
people. Therefore, the greater the consideration shown in these
matters the better it will be … The people of Bahá must associate
and deal with each other with the utmost love and sincerity. They
should be mindful of the interests of all, especially the friends of
God.</i></p>

<p>‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
in one of His Tablets, summarized some of the provisions for
determining the level of the dowry. The unit of payment mentioned in
the extract, cited below, is the “váḥid.” One váḥid is
equivalent to nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls. He stated:</p>

<p>
<i>City dwellers must pay in gold and village dwellers in silver. It
dependeth on the financial means at the disposal of the groom. If he
is poor, he payeth one váḥid; if of modest means, he payeth two
váḥids; if well-to-do, three váḥids; if wealthy, four váḥids;
and if very rich, he giveth five váḥids. It is, in truth, a matter
for agreement between the bridegroom, the bride, and their parents.
Whatever agreement is reached should be carried out.</i></p>

<p>In this same
Tablet, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá encouraged the believers to refer
questions concerning the application of this law to the Universal
House of Justice which has <i>“the authority to legislate.”</i>
He stressed that <i>“it is this body which will enact laws and
legislate upon secondary matters which are not explicit in the Holy
Text.”</i></p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-96"></a>
<b>96. should any one of His
servants intend to travel, he must fix for his wife a time when he
will return home
<a href="#ka_en-1-67">¶67</a></p>
<p>If the husband
leaves without informing his wife of the date of his return, and no
news of him reaches her and all trace of him is lost, Bahá’u’lláh
has stated that, should the husband have been aware of the law
prescribed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the wife may remarry after waiting
a full year. If, however, the husband was unaware of the law, the
wife must wait until news of her husband reaches her (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-4">4</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-97"></a>
<b>97. it behooveth her to
wait for a period of nine months, after which there is no impediment
to her taking another husband
<a href="#ka_en-1-67">¶67</a></p>
<p>In the event of
the husband’s failure, either to return at the end of the specified
period of time or to notify his wife of a delay, the wife must wait
nine months, after which she is free to remarry, though it is
preferable for her to wait longer (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-147">147</a>
for the Bahá’í calendar).</p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh states that, in such circumstances, should news
reach the wife of <i>“her husband’s death or murder,”</i> she
must also wait nine months, prior to remarrying (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-27">27</a>).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in a Tablet, has further clarified that the
nine months’ waiting period following news of the husband’s death
applies only if the husband had been away at the time of his death,
and not if he dies while at home.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-98"></a>
<b>98. she should choose the
course that is praiseworthy
<a href="#ka_en-1-67">¶67</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
defines <i>“the course that is praiseworthy”</i> as <i>“the
exercise of patience”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-4">4</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-99"></a>
<b>99. two just witnesses
<a href="#ka_en-1-67">¶67</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
sets out <i>“the criterion of justness”</i> in relation to
witnesses as <i>“a good reputation among the people.”</i> He
states that it is not necessary that the witnesses should be Bahá’ís
since <i>“The testimony of all God’s servants, of whatever faith
or creed, is acceptable before His Throne”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-79">79</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-100"></a>
<b>100. Should resentment or
antipathy arise between husband and wife, he is not to divorce her
but to bide in patience throughout the course of one whole year
<a href="#ka_en-1-68">¶68</a></p>
<p>Divorce is
strongly condemned in the Bahá’í Teachings. If, however,
antipathy or resentment develop between the marriage partners,
divorce is permissible after the lapse of one full year. During this
year of patience, the husband is obliged to provide for the financial
support of his wife and children, and the couple is urged to strive
to reconcile their differences. Shoghi Effendi affirms that both the
husband and wife “have equal right to ask for divorce” whenever
either partner “feels it absolutely essential to do so.”</p>
<p>
In Questions and Answers, Bahá’u’lláh elaborates a number of
issues concerning the year of patience, its observance (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-12">12</a>),
establishing the date of its beginning (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-19">19</a>
and <a href="#ka_en-3-40">40</a>), the conditions for reconciliation
(Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-38">38</a>), and the role of witnesses and
the Local House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-73">73</a> and
<a href="#ka_en-3-98">98</a>). In relation to the witnesses, the
Universal House of Justice has clarified that in these days the
duties of the witnesses in cases of divorce are performed by the
Spiritual Assemblies.</p>
<p>
The detailed provisions of the Bahá’í laws on divorce are
summarized in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.2.a.–i.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-101"></a>
<b>101. The Lord hath
prohibited … the practice to which ye formerly had recourse when
thrice ye had divorced a woman.
<a href="#ka_en-1-68">¶68</a></p>
<p>This relates to a
law of Islám set out in the Qur’án which decreed that under
certain conditions a man could not remarry his divorced wife unless
she had married and been divorced by another man. Bahá’u’lláh
affirms that this is the practice which has been prohibited in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-31">31</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-102"></a>
<b>102. He who hath divorced
his wife may choose, upon the passing of each month, to remarry her
when there is mutual affection and consent, so long as she hath not
taken another husband … unless, clearly, her circumstances change.
<a href="#ka_en-1-68">¶68</a></p>
<p>Shoghi Effendi
states, in a letter written on his behalf, that the intention of “the
passing of each month” is not to impose a limitation, and that it
is possible for a divorced couple to remarry at any time after their
divorce, so long as neither party is currently married to another
person.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-103"></a>
<b>103. semen is not unclean
<a href="#ka_en-1-74">¶74</a></p>
<p>In a number of
religious traditions and in <u>Sh</u>í‘ih Muslim practice semen
has been declared ritually unclean. Bahá’u’lláh has here
dispelled this concept. See also note <a href="#ka_en-5-106">106</a>
below.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-104"></a>
<b>104. Cleave ye unto the
cord of refinement
<a href="#ka_en-1-74">¶74</a></p>
<p>‘Abdu’l-Bahá
refers to the effect of <i>“purity and holiness, cleanliness and
refinement”</i> on the exaltation of <i>“the human condition”</i>
and <i>“the development of man’s inner reality.”</i> He states:
<i>“The fact of having a pure and spotless body exercises an
influence upon the spirit of man.”</i> (See also note <a href="#ka_en-5-74">74</a>.)</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-105"></a>
<b>105. Wash ye every soiled
thing with water that hath undergone no alteration in any one of the
three respects <a href="#ka_en-1-74">¶74</a></p>
<p>The <i>“three
respects”</i> referred to in this verse are changes in the color,
taste or smell of the water. Bahá’u’lláh provides additional
guidance concerning pure water and the point at which it is
considered unsuitable for use (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-91">91</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-106"></a>
<b>106. God hath … abolished
the concept of “uncleanness,” whereby divers things and peoples
have been held to be impure.
<a href="#ka_en-1-75">¶75</a></p>
<p>The concept of
ritual “uncleanness,” as understood and practiced in some tribal
societies and in the religious communities of certain earlier
Dispensations, has been abolished by Bahá’u’lláh. He states
that through His Revelation <i>“all created things were immersed in
the sea of purification.”</i> (See also notes <a href="#ka_en-5-12">12</a>,
<a href="#ka_en-5-20">20</a>, and <a href="#ka_en-5-103">103</a>.)</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-107"></a>
<b>107. first day of Riḍván
<a href="#ka_en-1-75">¶75</a></p>
<p>This is a
reference to the arrival of Bahá’u’lláh and His companions in
the Najíbíyyih Garden outside the city of Ba<u>gh</u>dád,
subsequently referred to by the Bahá’ís as the Garden of Riḍván.
This event, which took place thirty-one days after Naw-Rúz, in April
1863, signalized the commencement of the period during which
Bahá’u’lláh declared His Mission to His companions. In a
Tablet, He refers to His Declaration as <i>“the Day of supreme
felicity”</i> and He describes the Garden of Riḍván as <i>“the
Spot from which He shed upon the whole of creation the splendors of
His Name, the All-Merciful.”</i> Bahá’u’lláh spent twelve
days in this Garden prior to departing for Istanbul, the place to
which He had been banished.</p>
<p>
The Declaration of Bahá’u’lláh is celebrated annually by the
twelve-day Riḍván Festival, described by Shoghi Effendi as “the
holiest and most significant of all Bahá’í festivals” (see
notes <a href="#ka_en-5-138">138</a> and <a href="#ka_en-5-140">140</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-108"></a>
<b>108. the Bayán
<a href="#ka_en-1-77">¶77</a></p>
<p>The Bayán, the
Mother Book of the Bábí Dispensation, was revealed by the Báb in
two parts, one Persian and one Arabic. It is the repository of the
laws and precepts of the Báb’s Dispensation and enshrines most of
His references and tributes to “Him Whom God will make manifest”
(Bahá’u’lláh), Whose advent He heralded. In God Passes By
Shoghi Effendi indicates that the Bayán should be regarded
“primarily as a eulogy of the Promised One rather than as a code of
laws and ordinances designed to be a permanent guide to future
generations.”</p>
<p>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written: <i>“The Bayán hath been
superseded by the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, except in respect of such laws as
have been confirmed and mentioned in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.”</i></p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-109"></a>
<b>109. the destruction of
books <a href="#ka_en-1-77">¶77</a></p>
<p>In the Tablet of
I<u>sh</u>ráqát Bahá’u’lláh, referring to the fact that the
Báb had made the laws of the Bayán subject to His sanction, states
that He put some of the Báb’s laws into effect <i>“by embodying
them in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in different words,”</i> while others He
set aside.</p>
<p>
With regard to the destruction of books, the Bayán commanded the
Báb’s followers to destroy all books except those that were
written in vindication of the Cause and Religion of God. Bahá’u’lláh
abrogates this specific law of the Bayán.</p>
<p>
As to the nature and severity of the laws of the Bayán, Shoghi
Effendi in a letter written on his behalf provides the following
comment:</p>

<p>
The severe laws and injunctions revealed by the Báb can be properly
appreciated and understood only when interpreted in the light of His
own statements regarding the nature, purpose and character of His own
Dispensation. As these statements clearly reveal, the Bábí
Dispensation was essentially in the nature of a religious and indeed
social revolution, and its duration had therefore to be short, but
full of tragic events, of sweeping and drastic reforms. Those drastic
measures enforced by the Báb and His followers were taken with the
view of undermining the very foundations of <u>Sh</u>í‘ih
orthodoxy, and thus paving the way for the coming of Bahá’u’lláh.
To assert the independence of the new Dispensation, and to prepare
also the ground for the approaching Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh,
the Báb had therefore to reveal very severe laws, even though most
of them were never enforced. But the mere fact that He revealed them
was in itself a proof of the independent character of His
Dispensation and was sufficient to create such widespread agitation,
and excite such opposition on the part of the clergy that led them to
cause His eventual martyrdom.</p>

<b>110. We have permitted you

<p>The Bahá’í
Writings enjoin the acquisition of knowledge and the study of the
arts and sciences. Bahá’ís are admonished to respect people of
learning and accomplishment, and are warned against the pursuit of
studies that are productive only of futile wrangling.</p>
<p>
In His Tablets Bahá’u’lláh counsels the believers to study such
sciences and arts as are <i>“useful”</i> and would further <i>“the
progress and advancement”</i> of society, and He cautions against
sciences which <i>“begin with words and end with words,”</i> the
pursuit of which leads to <i>“idle disputation.”</i> Shoghi
Effendi, in a letter written on his behalf, likened sciences that
“begin with words and end with words” to “fruitless excursions
into metaphysical hair-splittings,” and, in another letter, he
explained that what Bahá’u’lláh primarily intended by such
“sciences” are “those theological treatises and commentaries
that encumber the human mind rather than help it to attain the
truth.”</p>

<p>The word here
translated as <i>“Constantinople”</i> is, in the original,
“Ar-Rúm” or “Rome.” This term has generally been used in the
Middle East to designate Constantinople and the Eastern Roman Empire,
then the city of Byzantium and its empire, and later the Ottoman
Empire.</p>

<p>This is a

Bosporus, a strait about 31 kilometers long which links the Black Sea
and the Sea of Marmara, it is the largest city and seaport of Turkey.</p>
<p>
Constantinople was the capital of the Ottoman Empire from 1453 until
1922. During Bahá’u’lláh’s sojourn in this city, the
tyrannical Sultan ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz occupied the throne. The
Ottoman Sultans were also the Caliphs, the leaders of Sunní Islám.
Bahá’u’lláh anticipated the fall of the Caliphate, which was
abolished in 1924.</p>

‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained that Bahá’u’lláh’s
reference to having seen the banks of the Rhine <i>“covered with
gore”</i> related to the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), and
that there was more suffering to come.</p>
<p>
In <i>God Passes By</i> Shoghi Effendi states that the “oppressively
severe treaty” that was imposed on Germany following its defeat in
the first World War “provoked <i>‘the lamentations</i> [of

<a href="#ka_en-1-91">¶91</a></p>
<p>“Ṭá” is the
initial letter of Ṭihrán, the capital of Iran. Bahá’u’lláh
has often chosen to represent certain place names by reference to
their initial letter. According to the abjad system of reckoning, the
numerical value of Ṭá is nine, which equals the numerical value of
the name Bahá.</p>

<a href="#ka_en-1-97">¶97</a></p>
<p>This verse
establishes Ḥuqúqu’lláh, the Right of God, the offering of a
fixed portion of the value of the believer’s possessions. This
offering was made to Bahá’u’lláh as the Manifestation of God
and then, following His Ascension, to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the
Center of the Covenant. In His Will and Testament, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
provided that the Ḥuqúqu’lláh was to be offered <i>“through
the Guardian of the Cause of God.”</i> There now being no Guardian,
it is offered through the Universal House of Justice as the Head of
the Faith. This fund is used for the promotion of the Faith of God
and its interests as well as for various philanthropic purposes. The
offering of the Ḥuqúqu’lláh is a spiritual obligation, the
fulfillment of which has been left to the conscience of each Bahá’í.
While the community is reminded of the requirements of the law of
Ḥuqúq, no believer may be approached individually to pay it.</p>
<p>
A number of items in Questions and Answers further elaborate this
law. The payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh is based on the calculation of
the value of the individual’s possessions. If a person has
possessions equal in value to at least nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of
gold (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-8">8</a>), it is a spiritual
obligation to pay nineteen percent of the total amount, once only, as
Ḥuqúqu’lláh (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-89">89</a>). Thereafter,
whenever one’s income, after all expenses have been paid, increases
the value of one’s possessions by the amount of at least nineteen
mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold, one is to pay nineteen percent of this
increase, and so on for each further increase (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-8">8</a>,
<a href="#ka_en-3-90">90</a>).</p>
<p>
Certain categories of possessions, such as one’s residence, are
exempt from the payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-8">8</a>,
<a href="#ka_en-3-42">42</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-95">95</a>), and
specific provisions are outlined to cover cases of financial loss
(Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-44">44</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-45">45</a>),
the failure of investments to yield a profit (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-102">102</a>)
and for the payment of Ḥuqúq in the event of the person’s death
(Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-9">9</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-69">69</a>,
<a href="#ka_en-3-80">80</a>). (In this latter case, see note <a href="#ka_en-5-47">47</a>.)</p>
<p>
Extensive extracts from Tablets, Questions and Answers, and other
Writings concerning the spiritual significance of Ḥuqúqu’lláh
and the details of its application have been published in a

<a href="#ka_en-1-98">¶98</a></p>
<p>“<i>For a number
of years,”</i> Bahá’u’lláh states in one of His Tablets,
<i>“petitions reached the Most Holy Presence from various lands
begging for the laws of God, but We held back the Pen ere the
appointed time had come.”</i> Not until twenty years from the birth
of His Prophetic Mission in the Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál of Ṭihrán had
elapsed did Bahá’u’lláh reveal the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the
Repository of the laws of His Dispensation. Even after its revelation
the Aqdas was withheld by Him for some time before it was sent to the
friends in Persia. This divinely purposed delay in the revelation of
the basic laws of God for this age, and the subsequent gradual
implementation of their provisions, illustrate the principle of
progressive revelation which applies even within the ministry of each
Prophet.</p>

Tree beyond which there is no passing.”</i> This is used as a
symbol in Islám, for example in the accounts of Muḥammad’s Night
Journey, to mark the point in the heavens beyond which neither men
nor angels can pass in their approach to God, and thus to delimit the
bounds of divine knowledge as revealed to mankind. Hence it is often
used in the Bahá’í Writings to designate the Manifestation of God
Himself. (See also note <a href="#ka_en-5-164">164</a>.)</p>

<b>129. the Mother Book

<p>The term “Mother
Book” is generally used to designate the central Book of a
religious Dispensation. In the Qur’án and Islamic Ḥadí<u>th</u>,
the term is used to describe the Qur’án itself. In the Bábí
Dispensation, the Bayán is the Mother Book, and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
is the Mother Book of the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh. Further,
the Guardian in a letter written on his behalf has stated that this
concept can also be used as a “collective term indicating the body
of the Teachings revealed by Bahá’u’lláh.” This term is also
used in a broader sense to signify the Divine Repository of
Revelation.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-130"></a>
<b>130. Whoso interpreteth
what hath been sent down from the heaven of Revelation, and altereth
its evident meaning
<a href="#ka_en-1-105">¶105</a></p>
<p>In several of His
Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh affirms the distinction between
allegorical verses, which are susceptible to interpretation, and
those verses that relate to such subjects as the laws and ordinances,
worship and religious observances, whose meanings are evident and
which demand compliance on the part of the believers.</p>
<p>
As explained in notes <a href="#ka_en-5-145">145</a> and <a href="#ka_en-5-184">184</a>,
Bahá’u’lláh designated ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, His eldest Son,
as His Successor and the Interpreter of His Teachings. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
in His turn appointed His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, to succeed
Him as interpreter of the holy Writ and Guardian of the Cause. The
interpretations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi are
considered divinely guided and are binding on the Bahá’ís.</p>
<p>
The existence of authoritative interpretations does not preclude the
individual from engaging in the study of the Teachings and thereby
arriving at a personal interpretation or understanding. A clear
distinction is, however, drawn in the Bahá’í Writings between
authoritative interpretation and the understanding that each
individual arrives at from a study of its Teachings. Individual
interpretations based on a person’s understanding of the Teachings
constitute the fruit of man’s rational power and may well
contribute to a greater comprehension of the Faith. Such views,
nevertheless, lack authority. In presenting their personal ideas,
individuals are cautioned not to discard the authority of the
revealed words, not to deny or contend with the authoritative
interpretation, and not to engage in controversy; rather they should
offer their thoughts as a contribution to knowledge, making it clear
that their views are merely their own.</p>

<b>131. approach not the
public pools of Persian baths
<a href="#ka_en-1-106">¶106</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
prohibits the use of the pools found in the traditional public
bathhouses of Persia. In these baths it was the custom for many
people to wash themselves in the same pool and for the water to be
changed at infrequent intervals. Consequently, the water was
discolored, befouled and unhygienic, and had a highly offensive
stench.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-132"></a>
<b>132. Avoid ye likewise the
malodorous pools in the courtyards of Persian homes
<a href="#ka_en-1-106">¶106</a></p>
<p>Most houses in
Persia used to have a pool in their courtyard which served as a
reservoir for water used for cleaning, washing and other domestic
purposes. Since the water in the pool was stagnant and was not
usually changed for weeks at a time, it tended to develop a very
unpleasant odor.</p>

<b>133. It is forbidden you to
wed your fathers’ wives.
<a href="#ka_en-1-107">¶107</a></p>
<p>Marriage with
one’s stepmother is here explicitly prohibited. This prohibition
also applies to marrying one’s stepfather. Where Bahá’u’lláh
has expressed a law between a man and a woman it applies <i>mutatis
mutandis</i> as between a woman and a man unless the context should
make this impossible.</p>
<p>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi confirmed that, while
stepmothers are the only category of relatives mentioned in the text,
this does not mean that all other unions within a family are
permissible. Bahá’u’lláh states that it devolves upon the House
of Justice to legislate “concerning the legitimacy or otherwise of
marrying one’s relatives” (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-50">50</a>).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written that the more distant the blood
relationship between the couple the better, since such marriages
provide the basis for the physical well-being of humanity and are
conducive to fellowship among mankind.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-134"></a>
<b>134. the subject of boys
<a href="#ka_en-1-107">¶107</a></p>
<p>The word
translated here as <i>“boys”</i> has, in this context, in the
Arabic original, the implication of pederasty. Shoghi Effendi has
interpreted this reference as a prohibition on all homosexual
relations.</p>
<p>
The Bahá’í teachings on sexual morality center on marriage and
the family as the bedrock of the whole structure of human society and
are designed to protect and strengthen that divine institution.
Bahá’í law thus restricts permissible sexual intercourse to that
between a man and the woman to whom he is married.</p>
<p>
In a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi it is stated:</p>

<p>
No matter how devoted and fine the love may be between people of the
same sex, to let it find expression in sexual acts is wrong. To say
that it is ideal is no excuse. Immorality of every sort is really
forbidden by Bahá’u’lláh, and homosexual relationships He looks
upon as such, besides being against nature. To be afflicted this way
is a great burden to a conscientious soul. But through the advice and
help of doctors, through a strong and determined effort, and through
prayer, a soul can overcome this handicap.</p>

<p>
Bahá’u’lláh makes provision for the Universal House of Justice
to determine, according to the degree of the offense, penalties for
adultery and sodomy (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-49">49</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-135"></a>
<b>135. To none is it

<p>This is an
allusion to the practice of certain clerics and religious leaders of
earlier Dispensations who, out of hypocrisy and affectation, and in
order to win the praise of their followers, would ostentatiously
mutter prayers in public places as a demonstration of their piety.
Bahá’u’lláh forbids such behavior and stresses the importance
of humility and genuine devotion to God.</p>

<b>136. Unto everyone hath

will and testament, and is free to dispose of his estate in whatever
manner he chooses (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-38">38</a>).</p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh affirms that in drawing up his will <i>“a person
hath full jurisdiction over his property,”</i> since God has
permitted the individual <i>“to deal with that which He hath
bestowed upon him in whatever manner he may desire”</i> (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-69">69</a>). Provisions are set out in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas for the distribution of inheritance in the case of
intestacy. (See notes <a href="#ka_en-5-38">38</a>–<a href="#ka_en-5-48">48</a>.)</p>

<p>As explained in
note <a href="#ka_en-5-33">33</a>, the Greatest Name of God can take
various forms, all based on the word “Bahá.” The Bahá’ís in
the East have implemented this injunction of the Aqdas by heading
their wills with such phrases as “O Thou Glory of the
All-Glorious,” “In the name of God, the All-Glorious” or “He
is the All-Glorious” and the like.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-138"></a>
<b>138. All Feasts have
attained their consummation in the two Most Great Festivals, and in
the two other Festivals that fall on the twin days
<a href="#ka_en-1-110">¶110</a></p>
<p>This passage
establishes four great festivals of the Bahá’í year. The two
designated by Bahá’u’lláh as <i>“the two Most Great
Festivals”</i> are, first, the Festival of Riḍván, which
commemorates Bahá’u’lláh’s Declaration of His Prophetic
Mission in the Garden of Riḍván in Ba<u>gh</u>dád during twelve
days in April/May 1863 and is referred to by Him as <i>“the King of
Festivals”</i> and, second, the Báb’s Declaration, which
occurred in May 1844 in <u>Sh</u>íráz. The first, ninth and twelfth
days of the Festival of Riḍván are Holy Days (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-1">1</a>),
as is the day of the Declaration of the Báb.</p>
<p>
The <i>“two other Festivals”</i> are the anniversaries of the
births of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb. In the Muslim lunar
calendar these fall on consecutive days, the birth of Bahá’u’lláh
on the second day of the month of Muḥarram 1233 A.H. (12 November
1817), and the birth of the Báb on the first day of the same month
1235 A.H. (20 October 1819), respectively. They are thus referred to
as the “Twin Birthdays” and Bahá’u’lláh states that these
two days are accounted as one in the sight of God (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-2">2</a>).
He states that, should they fall within the month of fasting, the
command to fast shall not apply on those days (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-36">36</a>).
Given that the Bahá’í calendar (see notes <a href="#ka_en-5-26">26</a>
and <a href="#ka_en-5-147">147</a>) is a solar calendar, it remains
for the Universal House of Justice to determine whether the Twin Holy
Birthdays are to be celebrated on a solar or lunar basis.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-139"></a>
<b>139. the first day of the
month of Bahá <a href="#ka_en-1-111">¶111</a></p>
<p>In the Bahá’í
calendar the first month of the year and the first day of each month
are given the name “Bahá.” The day of Bahá of the month of Bahá
is thus the Bahá’í New Year, Naw-Rúz, which was ordained by the
Báb as a festival and is here confirmed by Bahá’u’lláh (see
notes <a href="#ka_en-5-26">26</a> and <a href="#ka_en-5-147">147</a>).</p>
<p>
In addition to the seven Holy Days ordained in these passages of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the anniversary of the Martyrdom of the Báb was also
commemorated as a Holy Day in the lifetime of Bahá’u’lláh and,
as a corollary to this, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá added the observance
of the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, making nine Holy Days in all.
Two other anniversaries which are observed, but on which work is not
suspended, are the Day of the Covenant and the anniversary of the
Passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. See the section on the Bahá’í
calendar in <i>The Bahá’í World,</i> volume XVIII.</p>

Bahá’í House of Worship, Bahá’u’lláh has explained that,
although the actual time specified in the Book of God is <i>“the

earliest dawn of day, between dawn and sunrise, or even up to two
hours after sunrise”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-15">15</a>).</p>

repeatedly affirms the absolute integrity of His Writings as the Word

<p>There are many
references in the Bahá’í Writings which prohibit the use of wine
and other intoxicating drinks and which describe the deleterious
effect of such intoxicants on the individual. In one of His Tablets,
Bahá’u’lláh states:</p>

<p>
<i>Beware lest ye exchange the Wine of God for your own wine, for it
will stupefy your minds, and turn your faces away from the

God, the Exalted, the Almighty.</i></p>

<p>‘Abdu’l-Bahá
explains that the Aqdas prohibits <i>“both light and strong
drinks,”</i> and He states that the reason for prohibiting the use
of alcoholic drinks is because <i>“alcohol leadeth the mind astray
and causeth the weakening of the body.”</i></p>
<p>
Shoghi Effendi, in letters written on his behalf, states that this
prohibition includes not only the consumption of wine but of
“everything that deranges the mind,” and he clarifies that the
use of alcohol is permitted only when it constitutes part of a
medical treatment which is implemented “under the advice of a
competent and conscientious physician, who may have to prescribe it
for the cure of some special ailment.”</p>

upon the believers to turn towards Him. In the Book of the Covenant,
His Will and Testament, Bahá’u’lláh discloses the intention of
this verse. He states: <i>“The object of this sacred verse is none
other except the Most Mighty Branch.”</i> The <i>“Most Mighty

‘Abdu’l-Bahá. (See also notes <a href="#ka_en-5-66">66</a>

Bahá’u’lláh removes this prohibition of the Báb. He invites

the year (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-139">139</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-149"></a>
<b>149. The Lord hath decreed
that the dead should be interred in coffins
<a href="#ka_en-1-128">¶128</a></p>
<p>In the Bayán, the
Báb prescribed that the deceased should be interred in a coffin made
of crystal or polished stone. Shoghi Effendi, in a letter written on
his behalf, explained that the significance of this provision was to
show respect for the human body which “was once exalted by the
immortal soul of man.” </p>
<p>
In brief, the Bahá’í law for the burial of the dead states that
it is forbidden to carry the body for more than one hour’s journey
from the place of death; that the body should be wrapped in a shroud
of silk or cotton, and on its finger should be placed a ring bearing
the inscription <i>“I came forth from God, and return unto Him,
detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful,
the Compassionate”</i>; and that the coffin should be of crystal,
stone or hard fine wood. A specific Prayer for the Dead (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-10">10</a>)
is ordained, to be said before interment. As affirmed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and the Guardian, this law precludes cremation of the dead. The
formal prayer and the ring are meant to be used for those who have
attained the age of maturity, i.e. 15 years of age (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-70">70</a>).</p>
<p>
With regard to the material from which the coffin is to be made, the
spirit of the law is that coffins should be of as durable a material
as possible. Hence, the Universal House of Justice has explained
that, in addition to the materials specified in the Aqdas, there is
no objection to using the hardest wood available or concrete for the
casket. For the present, the Bahá’ís are left free to make their
own choices in this matter.</p>

<b>150. the Point of the Bayán
<a href="#ka_en-1-129">¶129</a></p>
<p>The <i>“Point of
the Bayán”</i> is one of the titles by which the Báb referred to
Himself.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-151"></a>
<b>151. the deceased should be
enfolded in five sheets of silk or cotton
<a href="#ka_en-1-130">¶130</a></p>
<p>In the Bayán, the
Báb specified that the body of the deceased should be wrapped in
five sheets of silk or cotton. Bahá’u’lláh confirmed this
provision and added the stipulation that for <i>“those whose means
are limited a single sheet of either fabric will suffice.”</i></p>
<p>
When asked whether the <i>“five sheets”</i> mentioned in the law
referred to “five full-length shrouds” or “five cloths which
were hitherto customarily used,” Bahá’u’lláh responded that
the intention is the <i>“use of five cloths”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-56">56</a>).</p>
<p>
Concerning the way in which the body should be wrapped, there is
nothing in the Bahá’í Writings to define how the wrapping of the
body is to be done, either when <i>“five cloths”</i> are used or
only <i>“a single sheet.”</i> At present, the Bahá’ís are
free to use their judgment in the matter.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-152"></a>
<b>152. It is forbidden you to
transport the body of the deceased a greater distance than one hour’s
journey from the city
<a href="#ka_en-1-130">¶130</a></p>
<p>The intention of
this command is to limit the duration of the journey to one hour’s
time, irrespective of the means of transport that are chosen to carry
the body to the burial site. Bahá’u’lláh affirms that the
sooner the burial takes place, <i>“the more fitting and acceptable
will it be”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-16">16</a>).</p>
<p>
The place of death may be taken to encompass the city or town in
which the person passes away, and therefore the one hour’s journey
may be calculated from the city limits to the place of burial. The
spirit of Bahá’u’lláh’s law is for the deceased to be buried
near where he or she dies.</p>

<b>153. God hath removed the

<a href="#ka_en-1-131">¶131</a></p>
<p>The Báb decreed
certain restrictions on travel which were to remain in force until
the advent of the Promised One of the Bayán, at which time the
believers were instructed to set out, even if on foot, to meet Him,
since the attainment of His presence was the fruit and purpose of
their very existence.</p>

<p>Bahá’u’lláh
identifies the <i>“two Houses”</i> as His House in Ba<u>gh</u>dád,
designated by Him as the <i>“Most Great House,”</i> and the House
of the Báb in <u>Sh</u>íráz, both of which have been ordained by
Him as sites of pilgrimage. (See Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-29">29</a>,
<a href="#ka_en-3-32">32</a> and note <a href="#ka_en-5-54">54</a>.)</p>
<p>
Shoghi Effendi explained that <i>“the other sites wherein the
throne of your Lord … hath been established”</i> refers to those
places where the Person of the Manifestation of God has resided.
Bahá’u’lláh states that <i>“the people of the areas where
these are situated may choose to preserve either each house”</i>
wherein He resided, <i>“or one of them”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-32">32</a>).
Bahá’í institutions have identified, documented, and where
possible, acquired and restored a number of the historical sites
associated with the Twin Manifestations.</p>

<p>The <i>“Book”</i>
is the record of the revealed Word of the Manifestations of God. The
<i>“Living Book”</i> is a reference to the Person of the

<p>
These words contain an allusion to a statement of the Báb in the
Persian Bayán about the <i>“Living Book,”</i> which He
identifies as Him Whom God will make manifest. In one of His Tablets
Bahá’u’lláh Himself states: <i>“The Book of God hath been
sent down in the form of this Youth.”</i></p>
<p>
In this verse of the Aqdas, and again in paragraph <a href="#ka_en-1-168">168</a>
of the Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh refers to Himself as the <i>“Living
Book.”</i> He cautions the <i>“followers of every other Faith”</i>
against seeking <i>“reasons in their Holy Books”</i> for refuting
the utterances of the <i>“Living Book.”</i> He admonishes the
people not to allow what has been recorded in the <i>“Book”</i>
to prevent them from recognizing His Station and from holding fast to
what is in this new Revelation.</p>

<b>158. It is unlawful to

one party to a marriage embrace this Cause, his or her possessions

<a href="#ka_en-1-139">¶139</a></p>
<p>The passage of the
Bayán which Bahá’u’lláh here quotes draws the attention of the
believers to the imminence of the coming of “Him Whom God will make
manifest.” Its prohibition of marriage with a non-Bábí and its
provision that the property of a husband or wife who embraced the
Faith could not lawfully pass to the non-Bábí spouse were
explicitly held in abeyance by the Báb, and were subsequently
annulled by Bahá’u’lláh before they could come into effect.
Bahá’u’lláh, in quoting this law, points to the fact that, in
revealing it, the Báb had clearly anticipated the possibility that
the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh would rise to prominence before that
of the Báb Himself.</p>
<p>
In <i>God Passes By</i> Shoghi Effendi points out that the Bayán
“should be regarded primarily as a eulogy of the Promised One
rather than a code of laws and ordinances designed to be a permanent
guide to future generations.” “Designedly severe in the rules and
regulations it imposed,” he continues, “revolutionizing in the
principles it instilled, calculated to awaken from their age-long
torpor the clergy and the people, and to administer a sudden and
fatal blow to obsolete and corrupt institutions, it proclaimed,
through its drastic provisions, the advent of the anticipated Day,
the Day when ‘the Summoner shall summon to a stern business,’
when He will ‘demolish whatever hath been before Him, even as the
Apostle of God demolished the ways of those that preceded Him’”

<b>160. Verily, there is none
other God besides Me
<a href="#ka_en-1-143">¶143</a></p>
<p>The Bahá’í
Writings contain many passages that elucidate the nature of the
Manifestation and His relationship to God. Bahá’u’lláh
underlines the unique and transcendent nature of the Godhead. He
explains that <i>“since there can be no tie of direct intercourse
to bind the one True God with His creation”</i> God ordains that
<i>“in every age and dispensation a pure and stainless Soul be made
manifest in the kingdoms of earth and heaven.”</i> This <i>“mysterious
and ethereal Being,”</i> the Manifestation of God, has a human
nature which pertains to <i>“the world of matter”</i> and a
spiritual nature <i>“born of the substance of God Himself.”</i>
He is also endowed with a <i>“double station”</i>:</p>

<p>
<i>The first station, which is related to His innermost reality,
representeth Him as One Whose voice is the voice of God Himself …
The second station is the human station, exemplified by the following
verses: “I am but a man like you.” “Say, praise be to my Lord!
Am I more than a man, an apostle?”</i></p>

<p>Bahá’u’lláh
also affirms that, in the spiritual realm, there is an <i>“essential
unity”</i> between all the Manifestations of God. They all reveal
the <i>“Beauty of God,”</i> manifest His names and attributes,
and give utterance to His Revelation. In this regard, He states:</p>

<p>
<i>Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to declare: “I
am God,” He, verily, speaketh the truth, and no doubt attacheth
thereto. For it hath been repeatedly demonstrated that through their
Revelation, their attributes and names, the Revelation of God, His
names and His attributes, are made manifest in the world…</i></p>

<p>While the
Manifestations reveal the names and attributes of God and are the
means by which humanity has access to the knowledge of God and His
Revelation, Shoghi Effendi states that the Manifestations should
“never … be identified with that invisible Reality, the Essence
of Divinity itself.” In relation to Bahá’u’lláh, the Guardian
wrote that the “human temple that has been the vehicle of so
overpowering a Revelation” is not to be identified with the
“Reality” of God.</p>
<p>
Concerning the uniqueness of Bahá’u’lláh’s station and the
greatness of His Revelation, Shoghi Effendi affirms that the
prophetic statements concerning the “Day of God,” found in the
Sacred Scriptures of past Dispensations, are fulfilled by the advent
of Bahá’u’lláh:</p>

<p>
To Israel He was neither more nor less than the incarnation of the
“Everlasting Father,” the “Lord of Hosts” come down “with
ten thousands of saints”; to Christendom Christ returned “in the
glory of the Father”; to <u>Sh</u>í‘ah Islám the return of the
Imám Ḥusayn; to Sunní Islám the descent of the “Spirit of God”
(Jesus Christ); to the Zoroastrians the promised <u>Sh</u>áh-Bahrám;
to the Hindus the reincarnation of Krishna; to the Buddhists the
fifth Buddha.</p>

<p>Bahá’u’lláh
describes the station of “Divinity” which He shares with all the
Manifestations of God as</p>

<p>
…<i>the station in which one dieth to himself and liveth in God.
Divinity, whenever I mention it, indicateth My complete and absolute
self-effacement. This is the station in which I have no control over
mine own weal or woe nor over my life nor over my resurrection.</i></p>

<p>And, regarding His
own relationship to God, He testifies:</p>

<p>
<i>When I contemplate, O my God, the relationship that bindeth me to
Thee, I am moved to proclaim to all created things “verily I am
God”; and when I consider my own self, lo, I find it coarser than
clay!</i></p>

<b>161. payment of Zakát
<a href="#ka_en-1-146">¶146</a></p>
<p>Zakát is referred
to in the Qur’án as a regular charity binding upon Muslims. In due
course the concept evolved into a form of alms tax which imposed the
obligation to give a fixed portion of certain categories of income,
beyond specified limits, for the relief of the poor, for various
charitable purposes, and to aid the Faith of God. The limit of
exemption varied for different commodities, as did the percentage
payable on the portion assessable.</p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh states that the Bahá’í law of Zakát follows
<i>“what hath been revealed in the Qur’án”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-107">107</a>).
Since such issues as the limits for exemption, the categories of
income concerned, the frequency of payments, and the scale of rates
for the various categories of Zakát are not mentioned in the Qur’án,
these matters will have to be set forth in the future by the
Universal House of Justice. Shoghi Effendi has indicated that pending
such legislation the believers should, according to their means and
possibilities, make regular contributions to the Bahá’í Fund.</p>

<p>In a Tablet
‘Abdu’l-Bahá expounds the meaning of this verse. He states
that <i>“mendicancy is forbidden and that giving charity to people
who take up begging as their profession is also prohibited.”</i> He
further points out in that same Tablet: <i>“The object is to uproot
mendicancy altogether. However, if a person is incapable of earning a
living, is stricken by dire poverty or becometh helpless, then it is
incumbent on the wealthy or the Deputies to provide him with a
monthly allowance for his subsistence … By ‘Deputies’ is meant
the representatives of the people, that is to say the members of the
House of Justice.”</i></p>
<p>
The prohibition against giving charity to people who beg does not
preclude individuals and Spiritual Assemblies from extending
financial assistance to the poor and needy or from providing them
with opportunities to acquire such skills as would enable them to
earn a livelihood (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-56">56</a>).</p>

<p>
With regard to the definition of <i>“verses of God,”</i>
Bahá’u’lláh states that it refers to <i>“all that hath been
sent down from the Heaven of Divine Utterance.”</i> Shoghi Effendi,
in a letter written to one of the believers in the East, has
clarified that the term <i>“verses of God”</i> does not include
the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; he has likewise indicated
that this term does not apply to his own writings.</p>

confirms the injunction in the Arabic Bayán regarding the renewal,
every nineteen years, of the furnishings of one’s home, provided
one is able to do so. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá relates this ordinance
to the promotion of refinement and cleanliness. He explains that the
purpose of the law is that one should change those furnishings that
become old, lose their luster and provoke repugnance. It does not
apply to such things as rare or treasured articles, antiques or
jewelry.</p>

clothes and generally to be the essence of cleanliness and
refinement. The Synopsis and Codification, section IV.D.3.y.i.–vii.,
summarizes the relevant provisions. In relation to the washing of the
feet, Bahá’u’lláh states that it is preferable to use warm

of pulpits for the delivery of sermons and the reading of the Text.
He specified, instead, that to enable all to hear the Word of God
clearly, a chair for the speaker should be placed upon a platform.</p>
<p>
In comments on this law, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi
have made it clear that in the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár
(where sermons are prohibited and only the words of Holy Scripture
may be read) the reader may stand or sit, and if necessary to be
better heard, may use a low movable platform, but that no pulpit is
permitted. In the case of meetings in places other than the
Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, it is also permissible for the
reader or speaker to sit or stand, and to use a platform. In one of
His Tablets, when reiterating the prohibition of the use of pulpits
in any location, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stressed that when
Bahá’ís deliver their speeches in gatherings, they are to do so
in an attitude of utmost humility and self-abnegation.</p>

<b>170. the use of opium …
any substance that induceth sluggishness and torpor
<a href="#ka_en-1-155">¶155</a></p>
<p>This prohibition
of the use of opium is reiterated by Bahá’u’lláh in the final
paragraph of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. In this connection, Shoghi Effendi
stated that one of the requirements for “a chaste and holy life”
is “total abstinence … from opium, and from similar habit-forming
drugs.” Heroin, hashish and other derivatives of cannabis such as
marijuana, as well as hallucinogenic agents such as LSD, peyote and
similar substances, are regarded as falling under this prohibition.</p>
<p>‘Abdu’l-Bahá
has written:</p>

<p>
<i>As to opium, it is foul and accursed. God protect us from the
punishment He inflicteth on the user. According to the explicit Text
of the Most Holy Book, it is forbidden, and its use is utterly
condemned. Reason showeth that smoking opium is a kind of insanity,
and experience attesteth that the user is completely cut off from the
human kingdom. May God protect all against the perpetration of an act
so hideous as this, an act which layeth in ruins the very foundation
of what it is to be human, and which causeth the user to be
dispossessed for ever and ever. For opium fasteneth on the soul so
that the user’s conscience dieth, his mind is blotted away, his
perceptions are eroded. It turneth the living into the dead. It
quencheth the natural heat. No greater harm can be conceived than
that which opium inflicteth. Fortunate are they who never even speak
the name of it; then think how wretched is the user.</i></p>
<p>
<i>O ye lovers of God! In this, the cycle of Almighty God, violence
and force, constraint and oppression, are one and all condemned. It
is, however, mandatory that the use of opium be prevented by any
means whatsoever, that perchance the human race may be delivered from
this most powerful of plagues. And otherwise, woe and misery to whoso
falleth short of his duty to his Lord.</i></p>

<p>In one of His
Tablets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stated concerning opium: <i>“the
user, the buyer and the seller are all deprived of the bounty and
grace of God.”</i></p>
<p>In yet another
Tablet, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written:</p>

<p>
<i>Regarding hashish you have pointed out that some Persians have
become habituated to its use. Gracious God! This is the worst of all
intoxicants, and its prohibition is explicitly revealed. Its use
causeth the disintegration of thought and the complete torpor of the
soul. How could anyone seek the fruit of the infernal tree, and by
partaking of it, be led to exemplify the qualities of a monster? How
could one use this forbidden drug, and thus deprive himself of the
blessings of the All-Merciful?</i></p>
<p>
<i>Alcohol consumeth the mind and causeth man to commit acts of
absurdity, but this opium, this foul fruit of the infernal tree, and
this wicked hashish extinguish the mind, freeze the spirit, petrify
the soul, waste the body and leave man frustrated and lost.</i></p>

<p>It should be noted
that the above prohibition against taking certain classes of drugs
does not forbid their use when prescribed by qualified physicians as
part of a medical treatment.</p>

<i>“mystery of the Great Reversal in the Sign of the Sovereign.”</i>
He states: <i>“Through this reversal He hath caused the exalted to
be abased and the abased to be exalted,”</i> and He recalls that
<i>“in the days of Jesus, it was those who were distinguished for
their learning, the men of letters and religion, who denied Him,
whilst humble fisherman made haste to gain admittance into the

the Arabic letter “Váv.” In <i>The Dawn-Breakers,</i> Nabíl
states that this letter “symbolized for the Báb the advent of a

Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in such passages as <i>‘the
mystery of the Great Reversal’</i> and <i>‘the Sign of the

<p>
The name for the letter “Váv” consists of three letters: Váv,
Alif, Váv. According to the abjad reckoning, the numerical value of
each of these letters is 6, 1 and 6 respectively. Shoghi Effendi in a
letter written on his behalf to one of the believers in the East
provides an interpretation of this verse of the Aqdas. He states that
the <i>“Upright Alif”</i> refers to the advent of the Báb. The
first letter with its value of six, which comes before the Alif, is a
symbol of earlier Dispensations and Manifestations which predate the
Báb, while the third letter, which also has a numerical value of
six, stands for Bahá’u’lláh’s supreme Revelation which was
made manifest after the Alif.</p>

<a href="#ka_en-1-159">¶159</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
confirms an injunction contained in the Bayán which makes it
unlawful to carry arms, unless it is necessary to do so. With regard
to circumstances under which the bearing of arms might be <i>“essential”</i>
for an individual, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives permission to a
believer for self-protection in a dangerous environment. Shoghi
Effendi in a letter written on his behalf has also indicated that, in
an emergency, when there is no legal force at hand to appeal to, a
Bahá’í is justified in defending his life. There are a number of
other situations in which weapons are needed and can be legitimately
used; for instance, in countries where people hunt for their food and
clothing, and in such sports as archery, marksmanship, and fencing.</p>
<p>
On the societal level, the principle of collective security
enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh (see <i>Gleanings from the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh,</i> CXVII) and elaborated by Shoghi Effendi
(see the Guardian’s letters in <i>The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh</i>)
does not presuppose the abolition of the use of force, but prescribes
“a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice,” and
which provides for the existence of an international peacekeeping
force that “will safeguard the organic unity of the whole
commonwealth.” In the Tablet of Bi<u>sh</u>árát, Bahá’u’lláh
expresses the hope that <i>“weapons of war throughout the world may
be converted into instruments of reconstruction and that strife and
conflict may be removed from the midst of men.”</i></p>
<p>
In another Tablet Bahá’u’lláh stresses the importance of
fellowship with the followers of all religions; He also states that
<i>“the law of holy war hath been blotted out from the Book.”</i></p>

<b>174. and permitted you to
attire yourselves in silk
<a href="#ka_en-1-159">¶159</a></p>
<p>According to
Islamic practice, the wearing of silk by men was generally forbidden,
except in times of holy war. This prohibition, which was not based on
the verses of the Qur’án, was abrogated by the Báb. </p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-175"></a>
<b>175. The Lord hath relieved
you … of the restrictions that formerly applied to clothing and to
the trim of the beard.
<a href="#ka_en-1-159">¶159</a></p>
<p>Many rules about
dress had their origins in the laws and traditional practices of the
world’s religions. For example, the <u>Sh</u>í‘ih clergy adopted
for themselves a distinctive headdress and robes and, at one time,
forbade the people to adopt European attire. Muslim practice, in its
desire to emulate the custom of the Prophet, also introduced a number
of restrictions with regard to the trim of the moustache and the
length of the beard.</p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh removed such limitations on one’s apparel and
beard. He leaves such matters to the <i>“discretion”</i> of the
individual, and at the same time calls upon the believers not to
transgress the bounds of propriety and to exercise moderation in all
that pertains to dress.</p>

<b>177. We perceive that which

<p>This passage is a
reference to the intrigues of a group of Azalís, followers of Mírzá
Yaḥyá (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-190">190</a>), associated with
the city of Kirmán. They include Mullá Ja‘far, his son <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>
Aḥmad-i-Rúḥí and Mírzá Áqá <u>Kh</u>án-i-Kirmání (both
sons-in-law of Mírzá Yaḥyá), as well as Mírzá Aḥmad-i-Kirmání.
They not only sought to undermine the Faith, but involved themselves
in political intrigues which culminated in the assassination of
Náṣiri’d-Dín <u>Sh</u>áh.</p>

Muḥammad-Ḥasan, one of the leading exponents of <u>Sh</u>í‘ih
Islám, rejected the Báb. The author of voluminous writings on

1850.</p>
<p>
Nabíl, in <i>The Dawn-Breakers,</i> describes the encounter that
took place in Najaf between Mullá ‘Alíy-i-Basámí, one of the
Letters of the Living, and <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muḥammad-Ḥasan.
During the meeting, Mullá ‘Alí announced the manifestation of the
Báb and extolled the potency of His Revelation. At the instigation
of the <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>, Mullá ‘Alí was forthwith pronounced
a heretic and expelled from the assembly. He was put on trial,
transported to Istanbul, and condemned to hard labor.</p>

<p>This is an

person in Iṣfahán to accept the Faith of the Báb. He is mentioned
in the Persian Bayán and praised as one who <i>“donned the robe of
discipleship.”</i> In <i>The Dawn-Breakers,</i> Nabíl describes
the unreserved acceptance of the Message by the “sifter of wheat”
and his zealous advocacy of the new Revelation. He joined the company
of the defenders of the Fort of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Ṭabarsí and
perished during that siege.</p>

<b>180. Take heed lest the
word “Prophet” withhold you from this Most Great Announcement
<a href="#ka_en-1-167">¶167</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
cautions people <i>“of insight”</i> not to allow their
interpretations of the Holy Scriptures to prevent them from
recognizing the Manifestation of God. Followers of each religion have
tended to allow their devotion to its Founder to cause them to
perceive His Revelation as the final Word of God and to deny the
possibility of the appearance of any subsequent Prophet. This has
been the case of Judaism, Christianity and Islám. Bahá’u’lláh
denies the validity of this concept of finality both in relation to
past Dispensations and to His own. With regard to Muslims, He wrote
in the Kitáb-i-Íqán that the <i>“people of the Qur’án …
have allowed the words ‘Seal of the Prophets’ to veil their
eyes,”</i> <i>“to obscure their understanding, and deprive them
of the grace of all His manifold bounties.”</i> He affirms that
<i>“this theme hath … been a sore test unto all mankind,”</i>
and laments the fate of <i>“those who, clinging unto these words,
have disbelieved in Him Who is their true Revealer.”</i> The Báb
refers to this same theme when He warns: <i>“Let not names shut you
out as by a veil from Him Who is their Lord, even the name Prophet,
for such a name is but a creation of His utterance.”</i></p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-181"></a>
<b>181. any reference to

<a href="#ka_en-1-167">¶167</a></p>
<p>The word here
translated <i>“Vicegerency”</i> is, in the original Arabic,
“viláyat,” which has a range of meanings including
“vicegerency,” “guardianship,” “protectorship” and
“successorship.” It is used in relation to God Himself, to His
Manifestation, or to those who are the appointed Successors of a
Manifestation.</p>
<p>
In this verse of the Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh warns against allowing
such concepts to blind one to the <i>“sovereignty”</i> of the new
Divine Manifestation, the true <i>“Vicegerent of God.”</i></p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-182"></a>
<b>182. Call ye to mind Karím
<a href="#ka_en-1-170">¶170</a></p>
<p>Ḥájí Mírzá
Muḥammad Karím <u>Kh</u>án-i-Kirmání (1810–circa 1873) was
the self-appointed leader of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í community
after the death of Siyyid Káẓim, who was the appointed successor
to <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í (see notes <a href="#ka_en-5-171">171</a>
and <a href="#ka_en-5-172">172</a>). He dedicated himself to the
promotion of the teachings of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad. The
opinions he expressed became the subject of controversy among his
supporters and opponents alike.</p>
<p>
Regarded as one of the leading savants and prolific authors of his
age, he composed numerous books and epistles in the various fields of
learning that were cultivated in those times. He actively opposed
both the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, and used his treatises to attack
the Báb and His Teachings. In the Kitáb-i-Íqán, Bahá’u’lláh
condemns the tone and content of his writings and singles out for
criticism one of his works which contains negative allusions to the
Báb. Shoghi Effendi describes him as “inordinately ambitious and
hypocritical” and describes how he “at the special request of the
<u>Sh</u>áh had in a treatise viciously attacked the new Faith and
its doctrines.”</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-183"></a>
<b>183. O ye the learned ones
in Bahá <a href="#ka_en-1-173">¶173</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
eulogizes the learned among His followers. In the Book of His
Covenant, He wrote: <i>“Blessed are the rulers and learned among
the people of Bahá.”</i> Referring to this statement, Shoghi
Effendi has written:</p>

<p>
In this holy cycle the <i>“learned”</i> are, on the one hand, the
Hands of the Cause of God, and, on the other, the teachers and
diffusers of His Teachings who do not rank as Hands, but who have
attained an eminent position in the teaching work. As to the <i>“rulers”</i>
they refer to the members of the Local, National and International
Houses of Justice. The duties of each of these souls will be
determined in the future.</p>

<p>
The Hands of the Cause of God were individuals appointed by
Bahá’u’lláh and charged with various duties, especially those
of protecting and propagating His Faith. In <i>Memorials of the
Faithful</i> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá referred to other outstanding
believers as Hands of the Cause, and in His Will and Testament He
included a provision calling upon the Guardian of the Faith to
appoint Hands of the Cause at his discretion. Shoghi Effendi first
raised posthumously a number of the believers to the rank of Hands of
the Cause, and during the latter years of his life appointed a total
of 32 believers from all continents to this position. In the period
between the passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957 and the election of the
Universal House of Justice in 1963, the Hands of the Cause directed
the affairs of the Faith in their capacity as Chief Stewards of
Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic World Commonwealth (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-67">67</a>).
In November 1964, the Universal House of Justice determined that it
could not legislate to make it possible to appoint Hands of the
Cause. Instead, by a decision of the House of Justice in 1968, the
functions of the Hands of the Cause in relation to protecting and
propagating the Faith were extended into the future by the creation
of the Continental Boards of Counselors, and in 1973 through the
establishment of the International Teaching Center, which has its
seat in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>
The Universal House of Justice appoints the Counselor members of the
International Teaching Center and the Continental Counselors. Members
of Auxiliary Boards are appointed by the Continental Counselors. All
these individuals fall within the definition of the <i>“learned”</i>
given by Shoghi Effendi in the statement quoted above.</p>

<b>185. the School of
Transcendent Oneness
<a href="#ka_en-1-175">¶175</a></p>
<p>In this verse and
the ones which immediately follow it, Bahá’u’lláh confronts one
of the reasons some of the Bábís rejected His claim to be the
Promised One of the Bayán. Their rejection was based on a Tablet
addressed by the Báb to “Him Who will be made manifest” on the
reverse side of which the Báb had written: <i>“May the glances of
Him Whom God shall make manifest illumine this letter at the primary
school.”</i> This Tablet is published in <i>Selections from the
Writings of the Báb.</i></p>
<p>
These Bábís maintained that, since Bahá’u’lláh was two years
older than the Báb, it was not possible for Him to receive this
Tablet <i>“at the primary school.”</i></p>
<p>
Bahá’u’lláh here explains that the reference is to events
transpiring in the spiritual worlds beyond this plane of existence.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-186"></a>
<b>186. We accepted the verses

<a href="#ka_en-1-175">¶175</a></p>

characterizes the Bayán as an offering from Him to Bahá’u’lláh.

<p>Shoghi Effendi, in
letters written on his behalf, has explained the significance of the
<i>“letters B and E.”</i> They constitute the word “Be,”
which, he states, “means the creative Power of God Who through His
command causes all things to come into being” and “the power of
the Manifestation of God, His great spiritual creative force.”</p>
<p>
The imperative “Be” in the original Arabic is the word “kun,”
consisting of the two letters “káf” and “nún.” They have
been translated by Shoghi Effendi in the above manner. This word has
been used in the Qur’án as God’s bidding calling creation into
being.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-189"></a>
<b>189. this new World Order
<a href="#ka_en-1-181">¶181</a></p>
<p>In the Persian
Bayán, the Báb stated: <i>“Well is it with him who fixeth his
gaze upon the Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and rendereth thanks unto
his Lord. For He will assuredly be made manifest. God hath indeed
irrevocably ordained it in the Bayán.”</i> Shoghi Effendi
identifies this <i>“Order”</i> with the System Bahá’u’lláh
envisages in the Aqdas, in which He testifies to its revolutionizing
effect on the life of humanity and reveals the laws and principles
which govern its operation.</p>
<p>
The features of the <i>“new World Order”</i> are delineated in
the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and in
the letters of Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice. The
institutions of the present-day Bahá’í Administrative Order,
which constitute the “structural basis” of Bahá’u’lláh’s
World Order, will mature and evolve into the Bahá’í World
Commonwealth. In this regard, Shoghi Effendi affirms that the
Administrative Order “will, as its component parts, its organic
institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigor, assert its
claim and demonstrate its capacity to be regarded not only as the
nucleus but the very pattern of the New World Order destined to
embrace in the fullness of time the whole of mankind.”</p>
<p>
For additional information on the evolution of this new World Order,
see, for example, the letters of Shoghi Effendi published in <i>The
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh.</i></p>

<b>190. O source of

<p>This is a
reference to Mírzá Yaḥyá, known as Ṣubḥ-i-Azal (Morning of
Eternity), a younger half-brother of Bahá’u’lláh, who arose
against Him and opposed His Cause. Mírzá Yaḥyá was nominated by
the Báb to serve as a figurehead for the Bábí community pending
the imminent manifestation of the Promised One. At the instigation of
Siyyid Muḥammad-i-Iṣfahání (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-192">192</a>),
Mírzá Yaḥyá betrayed the trust of the Báb, claimed to be His
successor, and intrigued against Bahá’u’lláh, even attempting
to have Him murdered. When Bahá’u’lláh formally declared His
Mission to him in Adrianople, Mírzá Yaḥyá responded by going to
the length of putting forward his own claim to be the recipient of an
independent Revelation. His pretensions were eventually rejected by
all but a few, who became known as Azalís (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-177">177</a>).
He is described by Shoghi Effendi as the “Arch-Breaker of the
Covenant of the Báb” (see <i>God Passes By,</i> chapter X).</p>

watched over his early youth and manhood.</p>

<b>192. God hath laid hold on

<a href="#ka_en-1-184">¶184</a></p>
<p>A reference to
Siyyid Muḥammad-i-Iṣfahání, who is described by Shoghi Effendi
as the “Antichrist of the Bahá’í Revelation.” He was a man of
corrupt character and great personal ambition who induced Mírzá
Yaḥyá to oppose Bahá’u’lláh and to claim prophethood for
himself (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-190">190</a>). Although he was an
adherent of Mírzá Yaḥyá, Siyyid Muḥammad was exiled with
Bahá’u’lláh to ‘Akká. He continued to agitate and plot
against Bahá’u’lláh. In describing the circumstances of his
death, Shoghi Effendi has written in <i>God Passes By</i>:</p>

<p>
A fresh danger now clearly threatened the life of Bahá’u’lláh.
Though He Himself had stringently forbidden His followers, on several
occasions, both verbally and in writing, any retaliatory acts against
their tormentors, and had even sent back to Beirut an irresponsible
Arab convert, who had meditated avenging the wrongs suffered by his
beloved Leader, seven of the companions clandestinely sought out and
slew three of their persecutors, among whom were Siyyid Muḥammad
and Áqá Ján.</p>
<p>
The consternation that seized an already oppressed community was
indescribable. Bahá’u’lláh’s indignation knew no bounds.
<i>“Were We,”</i> He thus voices His emotions, in a Tablet
revealed shortly after this act had been committed, <i>“to make
mention of what befell Us, the heavens would be rent asunder and the
mountains would crumble.”</i> <i>“My captivity,”</i> He wrote
on another occasion, <i>“cannot harm Me. That which can harm Me is
the conduct of those who love Me, who claim to be related to Me, and
yet perpetrate what causeth My heart and My pen to groan.”</i></p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-193"></a>
<b>193. Select ye a single
language … adopt ye … a common script.
<a href="#ka_en-1-189">¶189</a></p>
<p>Bahá’u’lláh
enjoins the adoption of a universal language and script. His Writings
envisage two stages in this process. The first stage is to consist of
the selection of an existing language or an invented one which would
then be taught in all the schools of the world as an auxiliary to the
mother tongues. The governments of the world through their
parliaments are called upon to effect this momentous enactment. The
second stage, in the distant future, would be the eventual adoption
of one single language and common script for all on earth.</p>

<p align="left"><a name="ka_en-5-194"></a>
<b>194. We have appointed two
signs for the coming of age of the human race
<a href="#ka_en-1-189">¶189</a></p>
<p>The first sign of
the coming of age of humanity referred to in the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh is the emergence of a science which is described as
that <i>“divine philosophy”</i> which will include the discovery
of a radical approach to the transmutation of elements. This is an
indication of the splendors of the future stupendous expansion of
knowledge.</p>
<p>
Concerning the <i>“second”</i> sign which Bahá’u’lláh
indicates to have been revealed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Shoghi Effendi
states that Bahá’u’lláh, “…in His Most Holy Book, has
enjoined the selection of a single language and the adoption of a
common script for all on earth to use, an injunction which, when
carried out, would, as He Himself affirms in that Book, be one of the
signs of the <i>‘coming of age of the human race.’</i>” </p>
<p>
Further insight into this process of mankind’s coming of age and
proceeding to maturity is provided by the following statement of
Bahá’u’lláh:</p>

<p>
<i>One of the signs of the maturity of the world is that no one will
accept to bear the weight of kingship. Kingship will remain with none
willing to bear alone its weight. That day will be the day whereon
wisdom will be manifested among mankind.</i></p>

<p>
The coming of age of the human race has been associated by Shoghi
Effendi with the unification of the whole of mankind, the
establishment of a world commonwealth, and an unprecedented stimulus
to “the intellectual, the moral and spiritual life of the entire
human race.” </p>
