  </div>

<p>First published in
1923, <i>Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era</i> offers readers a
thorough introduction to the Bahá’í Faith written by one of its
early adherents. Through studious investigation of the young
religion, aided by a close relationship with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá — the
son and successor of Bahá’u’lláh, its Prophet and Founder — Dr.
John E. Esslemont gained rare insight into the history and teachings
of a religion still in its infant stages.</p>


<p>
Since its first publication, Dr. Esslemont’s book, now translated
into sixty-seven different languages, remains one of the most
enduring and widely used introductory books on the Bahá’í Faith.
It is our hope that in making this edition widely available to the
general public, the book will continue to provide readers with a
comprehensive and inspiring overview of the newest of the world’s
independent religions.

  </div>


<p>
With the publication of “Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era” more
than ten years ago, the Bahá’í Faith was given its first
well-conceived, thorough exposition by a student of the teachings.
Recognizing its value as the most satisfactory introduction to the
Cause, Bahá’ís in both East and West have found Dr. Esslemont’s
book so helpful that it has been translated into some thirty
different languages.</p>


<p>
As Dr. Esslemont himself recognized, the Faith entered a new phase of
its history after the ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The result is
that the author’s views, some of them written prior to 1921, no
longer, on certain aspects of the subject, correspond to the
evolutionary character of the Faith. His treatment of events and
social conditions then existing, moreover, no longer appears fully
relevant. Unavoidably, a few errors of fact had entered his text,
while his explanation of the stations of the Báb and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
have been replaced in the minds of Bahá’ís by the authoritative
interpretations since made by the first Guardian of the Faith, Shoghi
Effendi.</p>


<p>
The present edition therefore represents a revision made by the
American National Spiritual Assembly, acting under the advice and
approval of Shoghi Effendi.</p>


<p>
These revisions in no respect alter the original plan of Dr.
Esslemont’s book, nor affect the major portion of his text. Their
purpose has been to amplify the author’s discussion in a few
passages by the addition of material representing the fuller
knowledge available since his lamented death, and newer translations
of his quotations from Bahá’í Sacred Writings.

  </div>


<p>
With this edition the American Bahá’í Publishing Committee takes
over copyright and other interests in “Bahá’u’lláh and the
New Era” from Messrs. George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., of London,
England, through whom the late Dr. J. E. Esslemont published his
famous book more than twenty years ago. Under arrangement with the
British publishers, the Committee has since 1928 brought out eleven
printings, in addition to the first American edition imported by
Brentano’s of New York.</p>


<p>
This edition does not displace the text as it has appeared since
major revision was made in the book under the direction of the
Guardian of the Faith in 1937, as the time has not come for anything
like a thorough recasting of the book to make its references to world
conditions completely contemporaneous. Dr. Esslemont’s work endures
as a trustworthy introduction to the history and teachings of the
Bahá’í Faith. Its translation into some thirty different
languages attests its appeal to students in the East as well as the
West.</p>


<p>
It should be added that any further revision of the text in the
future is subject to approval by Shoghi Effendi. The Committee has no
authority to pass upon revisions which may be desired by Bahá’ís
of other countries for their particular need.

  </div>


<p>
Since 1937 no revision has been made to the text of Dr. Esslemont’s
book, although in 1950 some minor corrections were introduced. On the
other hand, the diffusion and development of the Bahá’í Faith
since that time have been tremendous, and there has been added to
Bahá’í bibliography a rich legacy of incomparable expositions,
translations and historical accounts from the pen of Shoghi Effendi,
Guardian of the Faith and the appointed interpreter of its Sacred
Writings.</p>


<p>
It has therefore been deemed necessary to bring the book up to date
in order to maintain its usefulness for modern readers. This has been
done with a minimum of alteration to the text, and chiefly by the use
of footnotes and of an epilogue giving the current statistics and new
developments in the organic unfoldment of the Bahá’í Faith.</p>


<p>
Dr. Esslemont’s book continues to be one of the most widely used
introductory books on the Bahá’í Faith, as evidenced by the fact
that since 1937 the number of its translations has increased from
thirty to fifty-eight.

<p>
In preparing this edition of <i>Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era</i>,
some minor changes have been made in order to provide readers with
the most up-to-date information and resources available. Newer
authorized translations of extracts from the Bahá’í writings have
been substituted where available, minor corrections have been made to
the text and footnotes for clarity and consistency, and a
bibliography has been added. All revisions have been made with the
approval of the Universal House of Justice — the international
governing body of the Bahá’í Faith — and great care has been
taken to ensure that none of the revisions made in any way alter the
original intent of the author.

 <p>The text of this Ocean reader edition was taken from the recently released
 reference library (reference.bahai.org). Although the quality of that text was
 significantly improved from previous electronic versions, it still contained a
 number of typos and other minor errors such as merged paragraphs and missing references.</p>

 <p>In addition to fixing these errors, we updated several hundred quotes to utilize
 newer authorized translations such as "Summons of the Lord of Hosts",
 "Some Answered Questions" and "Tabernacle of Unity".</p>

 <p>Moreover, where possible, additional references were added to identify sources
 of quotes which may been hard for previous editors to identify prior to computerized
 full-text searche.</p>

 <p>Where available, modern paragraph based references have been used instead of

    <div class='title'>Introduction</div>
  </div>

<p>
In December 1914, through a conversation with friends who had met
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and the loan of a few pamphlets, I first became
acquainted with the Bahá’í teachings. I was at once struck by
their comprehensiveness, power and beauty. They impressed me as
meeting the great needs of the modern world more fully and
satisfactorily than any other presentation of religion which I had
come across — an impression which subsequent study has only served to
deepen and confirm.</p>


<p>
In seeking for fuller knowledge about the movement I found
considerable difficulty in obtaining the literature I wanted, and
soon conceived the idea of putting together the gist of what I
learned in the form of a book, so that it might be more easily
available for others. When communication with Palestine was reopened
after the war, I wrote to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and enclosed a copy of
the first nine chapters of the book, which was then almost complete
in rough draft. I received a very kind and encouraging reply, and a
cordial invitation to visit Him in Haifa and bring the whole of my
manuscript with me. The invitation was gladly accepted, and I had the
great privilege of spending two and a half months as the guest of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá during the winter of 1919–1920. During this visit
‘Abdu’l-Bahá discussed the book with me on various occasions. He
gave several valuable suggestions for its improvement and proposed
that, when I had revised the manuscript, He would have the whole of
it translated into Persian so that He could read it through and amend
or correct it where necessary. The revisal and translation were
carried out as suggested, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá found time, amid His
busy life, to correct some three and a half chapters (Chapters 1, 2,
5 and part of 3) before He passed away. It is a matter of profound
regret to me that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was not able to complete the
correction of the manuscript, as the value of the book would thereby
have been greatly enhanced. The whole of the manuscript has been
carefully revised, however, by a committee of the National Bahá’í
Assembly of England, and its publication approved by that Assembly.</p>


<p>
I am greatly indebted to Miss E. J. Rosenberg, Mrs. Claudia S. Coles,
Mírzá Luṭfu’lláh S. Ḥakím, Messrs. Roy Wilhelm and
Mountfort Mills and many other kind friends for valuable help in the
preparation of the work.</p>


<p>
As regards the transliteration of Arabic and Persian names and words,
the system adopted in this book is that recently recommended by
Shoghi Effendi for use throughout the Bahá’í World.

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_2'>The Greatest Event in History</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='1.2' data-ref='bne_en-p2'>
If we study the story of the “ascent of man” as recorded in the
pages of history, it becomes evident that the leading factor in human
progress is the advent, from time to time, of men who pass beyond the
accepted ideas of their day and become the discoverers and revealers
of truths hitherto unknown among mankind. The inventor, the pioneer,
the genius, the Prophet — these are the men on whom the
transformation of the world primarily depends. As Carlyle says: — </p>

  <p id='1.3' data-ref='bne_en-p3' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>The plain truth, very plain, we think is, that … <i>one</i> man
    that has a higher Wisdom, a hitherto unknown spiritual Truth in him,
    is stronger, not than ten men that have it not, or than ten thousand,
    but than <i>all</i> men that have it not; and stands among them with
    a quite ethereal, angelic power, as with a sword out of Heaven’s
    own armory, sky-tempered, which no buckler, and no tower of brass,
    will finally withstand.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Signs of the Times</i>. </span></p>


<p id='1.4' data-ref='bne_en-p4'>
In the history of science, of art, of music, we see abundant
illustrations of this truth, but in no domain is the supreme
importance of the great man and his message more clearly evident than
in that of religion. All down the ages, whenever the spiritual life
of men has become degenerate and their morals corrupt, that most
wonderful and mysterious of men, the Prophet, makes His appearance.
Alone against the world, without a single human being capable of
teaching, of guiding, of fully understanding Him, or of sharing His
responsibility, He arises, like a seer among blind men, to proclaim
His gospel of righteousness and truth.</p>


<p id='1.5' data-ref='bne_en-p5'>
Amongst the Prophets some stand out with special preeminence. Every
few centuries a great Divine Revealer — a Krishna, a Zoroaster, a
Moses, a Jesus, a Muḥammad — appears in the East, like a spiritual
Sun, to illumine the darkened minds of men and awaken their dormant
souls. Whatever our views as to the relative greatness of these
religion-founders we must admit that They have been the most potent
factors in the education of mankind. With one accord these Prophets
declare that the words They utter are not from Themselves, but are a
Revelation through Them, a Divine message of which They are the
bearers. Their recorded utterances abound, too, in hints and promises
of a great world teacher Who will appear “in the fullness of time”
to carry on Their work and bring it to fruition, One Who will
establish a reign of peace and justice upon earth, and bring into one
family all races, religions, nations, and tribes, that “there may
be one fold and one shepherd” and that all may know and love God
“from the least even unto the greatest.”</p>


<p id='1.6' data-ref='bne_en-p6'>
Surely the advent of this “Educator of Mankind,” in the latter
days, when He appears, must be the greatest event in human history.
<i>And the Bahá’í Movement is proclaiming to the world the glad
tidings that this Educator has in fact appeared, that His Revelation
has been delivered and recorded and may be studied by every earnest
seeker, that the “Day of the Lord” has already dawned and the
“Sun of Righteousness” arisen.</i> As yet only a few on the
mountaintops have caught sight of the Glorious Orb, but already its
rays are illumining heaven and earth, and erelong it will rise above
the mountains and shine with full strength on the plains and valleys
too, giving life and guidance to all.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_7'>The Changing World</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='1.7' data-ref='bne_en-p7'>
That the world, during the nineteenth and the early part of the
twentieth centuries,<a data-fnid='1'></a> has been passing
through the death pangs of an old era and the birth pangs of a new,
is evident to all. The old principles of materialism and
self-interest, the old sectarian and patriotic prejudices and
animosities, are perishing, discredited, amidst the ruins they have
wrought, and in all lands we see signs of a new spirit of faith, of
brotherhood, of internationalism, that is bursting the old bonds and
overrunning the old boundaries. Revolutionary changes of
unprecedented magnitude have been occurring in every department of
human life. The old era is not yet dead. It is engaged in a life and
death struggle with the new. Evils there are in plenty, gigantic and
formidable, but they are being exposed, investigated, challenged and
attacked with new vigor and hope. Clouds there are in plenty, vast
and threatening, but the light is breaking through, and is illumining
the path of progress and revealing the obstacles and pitfalls that
obstruct the onward way.</p>


<p id='1.8' data-ref='bne_en-p8'>
In the eighteenth century it was different. Then the spiritual and
moral gloom that enshrouded the world was relieved by hardly a ray of
light. It was like the darkest hour before the dawn, when the few
lamps and candles that remain alight do little more than make the
darkness visible. Carlyle in his <i>Frederick the Great</i> writes of
the eighteenth century thus: — </p>

  <p id='1.9' data-ref='bne_en-p9' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>A century which has no history and can have little or none. A century
    so opulent in accumulated falsities … as never century before was!
    Which had no longer the consciousness of being false, so false had it
    grown; and was so steeped in falsity, and impregnated with it to the
    very bone, that — in fact the measure of the things was full, and a
    French Revolution had to end it.… A very fit termination, as I
    thankfully feel, for such a century.… For there was need once more
    of a Divine Revelation to the torpid, frivolous children of men, if
    they were not to sink altogether into the ape condition.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Frederick the Great</i>, Book I, Chap. 1. </span></p>


<p id='1.10' data-ref='bne_en-p10'>
Compared with the eighteenth century the present time is as the dawn
after darkness, or as the spring after winter. The world is stirring
with new life, thrilling with new ideals and hopes. Things that but a
few years ago seemed impossible dreams are now accomplished facts.
Others that seemed centuries ahead of us have already become matters
of “practical politics.” We fly in the air and make voyages under
the sea. We send messages around the world with the speed of
lightning. Within a few decades we have seen miracles too numerous to
mention.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_11'>The Sun of Righteousness</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='1.11' data-ref='bne_en-p11'>
What is the cause of this sudden awakening throughout the world?
Bahá’ís believe that it is due to a great outpouring of the Holy
Spirit through the Prophet Bahá’u’lláh, Who was born in Persia
in 1817 and passed away in the Holy Land in 1892.</p>


<p id='1.12' data-ref='bne_en-p12'>
Bahá’u’lláh taught that the Prophet, or “Manifestation of
God,” is the Light-bringer of the spiritual world, as the sun is
the light-bringer of the natural world. Just as the material sun
shines over the earth and causes the growth and development of
material organisms, so also, through the Divine Manifestation, the
Sun of Truth shines upon the world of heart and soul, and educates
the thoughts, morals and characters of men. And just as the rays of
the natural sun have an influence which penetrates into the darkest
and shadiest corners of the world, giving warmth and life even to
creatures that have never seen the sun itself, so also, the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit through the Manifestation of God
influences the lives of all, and inspires receptive minds even in
places and among peoples where the name of the Prophet is quite
unknown. The advent of the Manifestation is like the coming of the
Spring. It is a day of Resurrection in which the spiritually dead are
raised to new life, in which the Reality of the Divine Religions is
renewed and reestablished, in which appear “new heavens and a new
earth.”</p>


<p id='1.13' data-ref='bne_en-p13'>
But, in the world of nature, the Spring brings about not only the
growth and awakening of new life but also the destruction and removal
of the old and effete; for the same sun, that makes the flowers to
spring and the trees to bud, causes also the decay and disintegration
of what is dead and useless; it loosens the ice and melts the snow of
winter, and sets free the flood and the storm that cleanse and purify
the earth. So it is also in the spiritual world. The spiritual
sunshine causes similar commotion and change. Thus the Day of
Resurrection is also the Day of Judgment, in which corruptions and
imitations of the truth and outworn ideas and customs are discarded
and destroyed, in which the ice and snow of prejudice and
superstition, which accumulated during the season of winter, are
melted and transformed, and energies long frozen and pent up are
released to flood and renovate the world.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_14'>The Mission of Bahá’u’lláh</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='1.14' data-ref='bne_en-p14'>
Bahá’u’lláh declared, plainly and repeatedly, that He was the
long-expected educator and teacher of all peoples, the channel of a
wondrous Grace that would transcend all previous outpourings, in
which all previous forms of religion would become merged, as rivers
merge in the ocean. He laid a foundation which affords a firm basis
for Unity throughout the whole world and the inauguration of that
glorious age of peace on earth, goodwill among men, of which prophets
have told and poets sung.</p>


<p id='1.15' data-ref='bne_en-p15'>
Search after truth, the oneness of mankind, unity of religions, of
races, of nations, of East and West, the reconciliation of religion
and science, the eradication of prejudices and superstitions, the
equality of men and women, the establishment of justice and
righteousness, the setting up of a supreme international tribunal,
the unification of languages, the compulsory diffusion of
knowledge — these, and many other teachings like these, were revealed
by the pen of Bahá’u’lláh during the latter half of the
nineteenth century, in innumerable books and epistles several of
which were addressed to the Kings and Rulers of the world.</p>


<p id='1.16' data-ref='bne_en-p16'>
His message, unique in its comprehensiveness and scope, is
wonderfully in accord with the signs and needs of the times. Never
were the new problems confronting men so gigantic and complex as now.
Never were the proposed solutions so numerous and conflicting. Never
was the need of a great world teacher so urgent or so widely felt.
Never, perhaps, was the expectancy of such a teacher so confident or
so general.</p>

<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='1.17' data-ref='bne_en-p17' class='nodropcap noid'>‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes: — </p>

  <p id='1.18' data-ref='bne_en-p18' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>When Christ appeared, twenty centuries ago, although the Jews were
    eagerly awaiting His Coming, and prayed every day, with tears,
    saying: “O God, hasten the Revelation of the Messiah,” yet when
    the Sun of Truth dawned, they denied Him and rose against Him with
    the greatest enmity, and eventually crucified that divine Spirit, the
    Word of God, and named Him Beelzebub, the evil one, as is recorded in
    the Gospel. The reason for this was that they said: “The Revelation
    of Christ, according to the clear text of the Torah, will be attested
    by certain signs, and so long as these signs have not appeared, whoso
    layeth claim to be a Messiah is an impostor. Among these signs is
    this, that the Messiah should come from an unknown place, yet we all
    know this man’s house in Nazareth, and can any good thing come out
    of Nazareth? The second sign is that He shall rule with a rod of
    iron, that is, He must act with the sword, but this Messiah has not
    even a wooden staff. Another of the conditions and signs is this: He
    must sit upon the throne of David and establish David’s
    sovereignty. Now, far from being enthroned, this man has not even a
    mat to sit on. Another of the conditions is this: the promulgation of
    all the laws of the Torah; yet this man has abrogated these laws, and
    has even broken the sabbath day, although it is the clear text of the
    Torah that whosoever layeth claim to prophethood and revealeth
    miracles and breaketh the sabbath day, he must be put to death.
    Another of the signs is this, that in His reign justice will be so
    advanced that righteousness and well-doing will extend from the human
    even to the animal world — the snake and the mouse will share one
    hole, the eagle and the partridge one nest, the lion and the gazelle
    shall dwell in one pasture, and the wolf and the kid shall drink from
    one fountain. Yet now, injustice and tyranny have waxed so great in
    his time that they have crucified him! Another of the conditions is
    this, that in the days of the Messiah the Jews will prosper and
    triumph over all the peoples of the world, but now they are living in
    the utmost abasement and servitude in the Empire of the Romans. Then
    how can this be the Messiah promised in the Torah?”</q> </p>


  <p id='1.19' data-ref='bne_en-p19' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>In this wise did they object to that Sun of Truth, although that
    Spirit of God was indeed the One promised in the Torah. But as they
    did not understand the meaning of these signs, they crucified the
    Word of God. Now the Bahá’ís hold that the recorded signs did
    come to pass in the Manifestation of Christ, although not in the
    sense which the Jews understood, the description in the Torah being
    allegorical. For instance, among the signs is that of sovereignty.
    For Bahá’ís say that the sovereignty of Christ was a heavenly,
    divine, everlasting sovereignty, not a Napoleonic sovereignty that
    vanisheth in a short time. For well-nigh two thousand years this
    sovereignty of Christ hath been established, and until now it
    endureth, and to all eternity that Holy Being will be exalted upon an
    everlasting throne.</q> </p>


  <p id='1.20' data-ref='bne_en-p20' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>In like manner all the other signs have been made manifest, but the
    Jews did not understand. Although nearly twenty centuries have
    elapsed since Christ appeared with divine splendor, yet the Jews are
    still awaiting the coming of the Messiah and regard themselves as
    true and Christ as false.</q>
     <span class='block reference'>(Written by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for this chapter.)</span></p>


<p id='1.21' data-ref='bne_en-p21'>
Had the Jews applied to Christ He would have explained to them the
true meaning of the prophecies concerning Himself. Let us profit by
their example, and before deciding that the prophecies concerning the
Manifestation of the Latter-day Teacher have not been fulfilled, let
us turn to what Bahá’u’lláh Himself has written regarding their
interpretation, for many of the prophecies are admittedly “sealed”
sayings, and the True Educator Himself is the only One Who can break
the seals and show the real meaning contained in the casket of words.</p>


<p id='1.22' data-ref='bne_en-p22'>
Bahá’u’lláh has written much in explanation of the prophecies
of old, but it is not on these that He depends for proof of His
Prophethood. The sun is its own proof, to all that have the power of
perception. When it rises we need no ancient predictions to assure us
of its shining. So with the Manifestation of God when He appears.
Were all the former prophecies swept into oblivion, He would still be
His own abundant and sufficient proof to all whose spiritual senses
are open.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_23'>Proofs of Prophethood</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='1.23' data-ref='bne_en-p23'>
Bahá’u’lláh asked no one to accept His statements and His
tokens blindly. On the contrary, He put in the very forefront of His
teachings emphatic warnings against blind acceptance of authority,
and urged all to open their eyes and ears, and use their own
judgment, independently and fearlessly, in order to ascertain the
truth. He enjoined the fullest investigation and never concealed
Himself, offering, as the supreme proofs of His Prophethood, His
words and works and their effects in transforming the lives and
characters of men. The tests He proposed are the same as those laid
down by His great Predecessors. Moses said: — </p>

  <p id='1.24' data-ref='bne_en-p24' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bible'>When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow
    not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not
    spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not
    be afraid of him.</q> <span class='block reference'>— Deut. xviii, 22.</span></p>


<p id='1.25' data-ref='bne_en-p25'>
Christ put His test just as plainly, and appealed to it in proof of
His own claim. He said: — </p>

  <p id='1.26' data-ref='bne_en-p26' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bible'>Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing,
    but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their
    fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so
    every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree
    bringeth forth evil fruit.… Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
    them.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> — Matt. vii, 15–17, 20.</span></p>


<p id='1.27' data-ref='bne_en-p27'>
In the chapters that follow, we shall endeavor to show whether
Bahá’u’lláh’s claim to Prophethood stands or falls by
application of these tests: whether the things that He had spoken
have followed and come to pass, and whether His fruits have been good
or evil; in other words, whether His prophecies are being fulfilled
and His ordinances established, and whether His lifework has
contributed to the education and upliftment of humanity and the
betterment of morals, or the contrary.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_28'>Difficulties of Investigation</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='1.28' data-ref='bne_en-p28'>
There are, of course, difficulties in the way of the student who
seeks to get at the truth about this Cause. Like all great moral and
spiritual reformations, the Bahá’í Faith has been grossly
misrepresented. About the terrible persecutions and sufferings of
Bahá’u’lláh and His followers, both friends and enemies are in
entire agreement. About the value of the Movement, however, and the
character of its Founders, the statements of the believers and the
accounts of the deniers are utterly at variance. It is just as in the
time of Christ. Concerning the crucifixion of Jesus and the
persecution and martyrdom of His followers both Christian and Jewish
historians are in agreement, but whereas the believers say that
Christ fulfilled and developed the teachings of Moses and the
prophets, the deniers declare that He broke the laws and ordinances
and was worthy of death.</p>


<p id='1.29' data-ref='bne_en-p29'>
In religion, as in science, truth reveals her mysteries only to the
humble and reverent seeker, who is ready to lay aside every prejudice
and superstition — to sell all that he has, in order that he may buy
the “one pearl of great price.” To understand the Bahá’í
Faith in its full significance, we must undertake its study in the
spirit of sincere and selfless devotion to truth, persevering in the
path of search and relying on divine guidance. In the Writings of its
Founders we shall find the master key to the mysteries of this great
spiritual awakening, and the ultimate criterion of its value.
Unfortunately, here again there are difficulties in the way of the
student who is unacquainted with the Persian and Arabic languages in
which the teachings are written. Only a small proportion of the
Writings has been translated into English, and many of the
translations which have appeared leave much to be desired, both in
accuracy and style. But despite the imperfection and inadequacy of
historical narratives and translations, the greatest essential truths
which form the massive and firm foundations of this Cause stand out
like mountains from the mists of uncertainty.<a data-fnid='2'></a></p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_30'>Aim of Book</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='1.30' data-ref='bne_en-p30'>
The endeavor in the following chapters will be to set forth, as far
as possible, fairly and without prejudice, the salient features of
the history and more especially of the teachings of the Bahá’í
Cause, so that readers may be enabled to form an intelligent judgment
as to their importance, and perhaps be induced to search into the
subject more deeply for themselves.</p>


<p id='1.31' data-ref='bne_en-p31'>
Search after truth, however, important though it be, is not the whole
aim and end of life. The truth is no dead thing, to be placed in a
museum when found — to be labeled, classified, cataloged, exhibited
and left there, dry and sterile. It is something vital which must
take root in men’s hearts and bear fruit in their lives ere they
reap the full reward of their search.</p>


<p id='1.32' data-ref='bne_en-p32'>
The real object, therefore, in spreading the knowledge of a prophetic
revelation is that those who become convinced of its truth may
proceed to practice its principles, to “lead the life” and
diffuse the glad tidings, thus hastening the advent of that blessed
day when God’s Will shall be done on earth as it is in Heaven.</p>

<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_34'>Birthplace of the New Revelation</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.2' data-ref='bne_en-p34'>
Persia, the birthplace of the Bahá’í Revelation, has occupied a
unique place in the history of the world. In the days of her early
greatness she was a veritable queen among nations, unrivaled in
civilization, in power and in splendor. She gave to the world great
kings and statesmen, prophets and poets, philosophers and artists.
Zoroaster, Cyrus and Darius, Ḥáfiz and Firdawsí, Sa‘dí and
‘Umar <u>Kh</u>ayyám are but a few of her many famous sons. Her
craftsmen were unsurpassed in skill; her carpets were matchless, her
steel blades unequaled, her pottery world famous. In all parts of the
Near and Middle East she has left traces of her former greatness.</p>


<p id='2.3' data-ref='bne_en-p35'>
Yet, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries she had sunk to a
condition of deplorable degradation. Her ancient glory seemed
irretrievably lost. Her government was corrupt and in desperate
financial straits; some of her rulers were feeble, and others
monsters of cruelty. Her priests were bigoted and intolerant, her
people ignorant and superstitious. Most of them belonged to the
<u>Sh</u>í‘ih sect,<a data-fnid='2'></a> of Muḥammadans,
but there were also considerable numbers of Zoroastrians, Jews and
Christians, of diverse and antagonistic sects. All professed to
follow sublime teachers who exhorted them to worship the one God and
to live in love and unity, yet they shunned, detested and despised
each other, each sect regarding the others as unclean, as dogs or
heathens. Cursing and execration were indulged in to a fearful
extent. It was dangerous for a Jew or a Zoroastrian to walk in the
street on a rainy day, for if his wet garment should touch a
Muḥammadan, the Muslim was defiled, and the other might have to
atone for the offense with his life. If a Muḥammadan took money
from a Jew, Zoroastrian or Christian he had to wash it before he
could put it in his pocket. If a Jew found his child giving a glass
of water to a poor Muḥammadan beggar he would dash the glass from
the child’s hand, for curses rather than kindness should be the
portion of infidels! The Muslims themselves were divided into
numerous sects, among whom strife was often bitter and fierce. The
Zoroastrians did not join much in these mutual recriminations, but
lived in communities apart, refusing to associate with their fellow
countrymen of other faiths.</p>


<p id='2.4' data-ref='bne_en-p36'>
Social as well as religious affairs were in a state of hopeless
decadence. Education was neglected. Western science and art were
looked upon as unclean and contrary to religion. Justice was
travestied. Pillage and robbery were of common occurrence. Roads were
bad and unsafe for travel. Sanitary arrangements were shockingly
defective.</p>


<p id='2.5' data-ref='bne_en-p37'>
Yet, notwithstanding all this, the light of spiritual life was not
extinct in Persia. Here and there, amid the prevailing worldliness
and superstition, could still be found some saintly souls, and in
many a heart the longing for God was cherished, as in the hearts of
Anna and Simeon before the appearance of Jesus. Many were eagerly
awaiting the coming of a promised Messenger of God, and confident
that the time of His advent was at hand. Such was the state of
affairs in Persia when the Báb, the Herald of a new era, set all the
country in commotion with His message.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_38'>Early Life</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.6' data-ref='bne_en-p38'>
Mírzá ‘Alí-Muḥammad, Who afterwards assumed the title of Báb
(i.e., Gate), was born at <u>Sh</u>íráz, in the south of Persia, on
the 20th of October, 1819 A.D.<a data-fnid='3'></a> He was a
Siyyid, that is, a descendant of the Prophet Muḥammad. His father,
a well-known merchant, died soon after His birth, and He was then
placed under the care of a maternal uncle, a merchant of <u>Sh</u>íráz,
who brought Him up. In childhood He learned to read, and received the
elementary education customary for children.<a data-fnid='4'></a>
At the age of fifteen He went into business, at first with His
guardian, and afterwards with another uncle who lived at Bú<u>sh</u>ihr,
on the shore of the Gulf of Persia.</p>


<p id='2.7' data-ref='bne_en-p39'>
As a youth He was noted for great personal beauty and charm of
manner, and also for exceptional piety, and nobility of character. He
was unfailing in His observance of the prayers, fasts and other
ordinances of the Muḥammadan religion, and not only obeyed the
letter, but lived in the spirit of the Prophet’s teachings. He
married when about twenty-two years of age. Of this marriage one son
was born, who died while still an infant, in the first year of the
Báb’s public ministry.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_40'>Declaration</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.8' data-ref='bne_en-p40'>
On reaching His twenty-fifth year, in response to divine command, He
declared that “God the Exalted had elected Him to the station of
Bábhood.” In “A Traveler’s Narrative”<a data-fnid='5'></a>
we read that: —


  <p id='2.9' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>“What he intended by the term <i>Báb</i> was this,
    that he was the channel of grace from some great Person still behind
    the veil of glory, who was the possessor of countless and boundless
    perfections, by whose will he moved, and to the bond of whose love he
    clung.”</q>
    <span class='block reference'> — <i>A Traveler’s Narrative</i> (Episode of the Báb).</span></p>


<p id='2.10' data-ref='bne_en-p41'>
In those days belief in the imminent appearance of a Divine Messenger
was especially prevalent among a sect known as the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ís,
and it was to a distinguished divine belonging to this sect, called
Mullá Ḥusayn Bu<u>sh</u>rú’i, that the Báb first announced His
mission. The exact date of this announcement is given in the Bayán,
one of the Báb’s Writings, as two hours and eleven minutes after
sunset on the eve preceding the fifth day of the month of
Jamádíyu’l-Avval 1260 A.H.<a data-fnid='6'></a>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was born in the course of the same night, but the
exact hour of His birth has not been ascertained. After some days of
anxious investigation and study, Mullá Ḥusayn became firmly
convinced that the Messenger long expected by the <u>Sh</u>í‘ihs
had indeed appeared. His eager enthusiasm over this discovery was
soon shared by several of his friends. Before long the majority of
the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ís accepted the Báb, becoming known as
Bábís; and soon the fame of the young Prophet began to spread like
wildfire throughout the land.</p>







<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_42'>Spread of the Bábí Movement</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.11' data-ref='bne_en-p42'>
The first eighteen disciples of the Báb (with Himself as nineteenth)
became known as “Letters of the Living.” These disciples He sent
to different parts of Persia and Turkistán to spread the news of His
advent. Meantime He Himself set out on a pilgrimage to Mecca, where
He arrived in December 1844, and there openly declared His mission.
On His return to Bú<u>sh</u>ihr great excitement was caused by the
announcement of His Bábhood. The fire of His eloquence, the wonder
of His rapid and inspired writings, His extraordinary wisdom and
knowledge, His courage and zeal as a reformer, aroused the greatest
enthusiasm among His followers, but excited a corresponding degree of
alarm and enmity among the orthodox Muslims. The <u>Sh</u>í‘ih
doctors vehemently denounced Him, and persuaded the Governor of Fárs,
namely Ḥusayn Khán, a fanatical and tyrannical ruler, to undertake
the suppression of the new heresy. Then commenced for the Báb a long
series of imprisonments, deportations, examinations before tribunals,
scourgings and indignities, which ended only with His martyrdom in
1850.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_43'>Claims of the Báb</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.12' data-ref='bne_en-p43'>
The hostility aroused by the claim of Bábhood was redoubled when the
young reformer proceeded to declare that He was Himself the Mihdí
(Mahdi) Whose coming Muḥammad had foretold. The <u>Sh</u>í‘ihs
identified this Mihdí with the 12th Imám<a data-fnid='7'></a>
who, according to their beliefs, had mysteriously disappeared from
the sight of men about a thousand years previously. They believed
that he was still alive and would reappear in the same body as
before, and they interpreted in a material sense the prophecies
regarding his dominion, his glory, his conquests and the “signs”
of his advent, just as the Jews in the time of Christ interpreted
similar prophecies regarding the Messiah. They expected that he would
appear with earthly sovereignty and an innumerable army and declare
his revelation, that he would raise dead bodies and restore them to
life, and so on. As these signs did not appear, the <u>Sh</u>í‘ihs
rejected the Báb with the same fierce scorn which the Jews displayed
towards Jesus. The Bábís, on the other hand, interpreted many of
the prophecies figuratively. They regarded the sovereignty of the
Promised One, like that of the Galilean “Man of Sorrows,” as a
mystical sovereignty; His glory as spiritual, not earthly glory; His
conquests as conquests over the cities of men’s hearts; and they
found abundant proof of the Báb’s claim in His wonderful life and
teachings, His unshakable faith, His invincible steadfastness, and
His power of raising to newness of spiritual life those who were in
the graves of error and ignorance.</p>


<p id='2.13' data-ref='bne_en-p44'>
But the Báb did not stop even with the claim of Mihdíhood.
He adopted the sacred title of “Nuqṭiyiúlá” or “Primal
Point.” This was a title applied to Muḥammad Himself by His
followers. Even the Imáms were secondary in importance to the
“Point,” from Whom they derived their inspiration and authority.
In assuming this title, the Báb claimed to rank, like Muḥammad, in
the series of great Founders of Religion, and for this reason, in the
eyes of the <u>Sh</u>í‘ihs, He was regarded as an impostor, just
as Moses and Jesus before Him had been regarded as impostors. He even
inaugurated a new calendar, restoring the solar year, and dating the
commencement of the New Era from the year of His own Declaration.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_45'>Persecution Increases</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.14' data-ref='bne_en-p45'>
In consequence of these declarations of the Báb and the alarming
rapidity with which people of all classes, rich and poor, learned and
ignorant, were eagerly responding to His teaching, attempts at
suppression became more and more ruthless and determined. Houses were
pillaged and destroyed. Women were seized and carried off. In Ṭihrán,
Fárs, Mázindarán, and other places great numbers of the believers
were put to death. Many were beheaded, hanged, blown from the mouths
of cannon, burnt or chopped to pieces. Despite all attempts at
repression, however, the movement progressed. Nay, through this very
oppression the assurance of the believers increased, for thereby many
of the prophecies concerning the coming of the Mihdí were literally
fulfilled. Thus in a tradition recorded by Jábir, which the <u>Sh</u>í‘ihs
regard as authentic, we read: — </p>

  <p id='2.15' data-ref='bne_en-p46' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='tradition'>In him shall be the perfection of Moses, the preciousness of Jesus,
    and the patience of Job; his saints shall be abased in his time, and
    their heads shall be exchanged as presents, even as the heads of the
    Turk and the Deylamite are exchanged as presents; they shall be slain
    and burned, and shall be afraid, fearful and dismayed; the earth
    shall be dyed with their blood, and lamentation shall prevail amongst
    their women; these are my saints indeed.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> — <i>New History of the Báb</i>, translated by Prof. E. G. Browne. </span> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_47'>Martyrdom of the Báb</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.16' data-ref='bne_en-p47'>
On the 9th of July, 1850,<a data-fnid='8'></a> the Báb
Himself, Who was then in His thirty-first year, fell a victim to the
fanatical fury of His persecutors. With a devoted young follower
named Áqá Muḥammad-‘Alí, who had passionately begged to be
allowed to share His martyrdom, He was led to the scaffold in the old
barrack square of Tabríz. About two hours before noon the two were
suspended by ropes under their armpits in such a way that the head of
Muḥammad-‘Alí rested against the breast of his beloved Master. A
regiment of Armenian soldiers was drawn up and received the order to
fire. Promptly the volleys rang out, but when the smoke cleared, it
was found that the Báb and His companion were still alive. The
bullets had but severed the ropes by which they were suspended, so
that they dropped to the ground unhurt. The Báb proceeded to a room
nearby, where He was found talking to one of His friends. About noon
they were again suspended. The Armenians, who considered the result
of their volleys a miracle, were unwilling to fire again, so another
regiment of soldiers had been brought on the scene, who fired when
ordered. This time the volleys took effect. The bodies of both
victims were riddled by bullets and horribly mutilated, although
their faces were almost untouched.</p>


<p id='2.17' data-ref='bne_en-p48'>
By this foul deed the Barrack Square of Tabríz became a second
Calvary. The enemies of the Báb enjoyed a guilty thrill of triumph,
thinking that this hated tree of the Bábí faith was now severed at
the root, and its complete eradication would be easy! But their
triumph was short-lived! They did not realize that the Tree of Truth
cannot be felled by any material ax. Had they but known, this very
crime of theirs was the means of giving greater vigor to the Cause.
The martyrdom of the Báb fulfilled His own cherished wish and
inspired His followers with increased zeal. Such was the fire of
their spiritual enthusiasm that the bitter winds of persecution but
fanned it to a fiercer blaze: The greater the efforts at extinction,
the higher mounted the flames.</p>







<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_49'>Tomb on Mount Carmel</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.18' data-ref='bne_en-p49'>
After the Báb’s martyrdom, His remains, with those of His devoted
companion, were thrown on the edge of the moat outside the city wall.
On the second night they were rescued at midnight by some of the
Bábís, and after being concealed for years in secret depositories
in Persia, were ultimately brought, with great danger and difficulty,
to the Holy Land. There they are now interred in a tomb beautifully
situated on the slope of Mount Carmel, not far from the Cave of
Elijah, and only a few miles from the spot where Bahá’u’lláh
spent His last years and where His remains now lie. Among the
thousands of pilgrims from all parts of the world who come to pay
homage at the Holy Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh, none omits to offer a
prayer also at the shrine of His devoted lover and forerunner, the
Báb.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_50'>Writings of Báb</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.19' data-ref='bne_en-p50'>
The Writings of the Báb were voluminous, and the rapidity with
which, without study or premeditation, He composed elaborate
commentaries, profound expositions or eloquent prayers was regarded
as one of the proofs of His divine inspiration.</p>


<p id='2.20' data-ref='bne_en-p51'>The purport of His various Writings has been summarized as follows: — </p>

  <p id='2.21' data-ref='bne_en-p52' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Some of these [the Báb’s Writings] were commentaries on, and
    interpretations of the verses of the Qur’án; some were prayers,
    homilies, and hints of [the true significance of certain] passages;
    others were exhortations, admonitions, dissertations on the different
    branches of the doctrine of the Divine Unity … encouragements to
    amendment of character, severance from worldly states, and dependence
    on the inspirations of God. But the essence and purport of his
    compositions were the praises and descriptions of that Reality soon
    to appear which was his only object and aim, his darling, and his
    desire. For he regarded his own appearance as that of a harbinger of
    good tidings, and considered his own real nature merely as a means
    for the manifestation of the greater perfections of that One. And
    indeed he ceased not from celebrating Him by night or day for a
    single instant, but used to signify to all his followers that they
    should expect His arising: in such wise that he declares in his
    writings, “I am a letter out of that most mighty book and a
    dew-drop from that limitless ocean, and, when He shall appear, my
    true nature, my mysteries, riddles, and intimations will become
    evident, and the embryo of this religion shall develop through the
    grades of its being and ascent, attain to the station of ‘<i>the
    most comely of forms</i>,’ and become adorned with the robe of
    ‘<i>blessed be God, the Best of Creators</i>.’” … and so
    inflamed was he with His flame that commemoration of Him was the
    bright candle of his dark nights in the fortress of Máh-Kú, and
    remembrance of Him was the best of companions in the straits of the
    prison of <u>Ch</u>ihríq. Thereby he obtained spiritual
    enlargements; with His wine was he inebriated; and at remembrance of
    Him did he rejoice.</q>

<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_53'>He Whom God Shall Make Manifest</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.22' data-ref='bne_en-p53'>
The Báb has been compared to John the Baptist, but the station of
the Báb is not merely that of the herald or forerunner. In Himself
the Báb was a Manifestation of God, the Founder of an independent
religion, even though that religion was limited in time to a brief
period of years. The Bahá’ís believe that the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh were Co-Founders of Their Faith, the following
words of Bahá’u’lláh testifying to this truth: <q class='baha'>“That so brief
a span should have separated this most mighty and wondrous Revelation
from Mine own previous Manifestation, is a secret that no man can
unravel and a mystery such as no mind can fathom. Its duration had
been foreordained, and no man shall ever discover its reason unless
and until he be informed of the contents of My Hidden Book.”</q> In His
references to Bahá’u’lláh, however, the Báb revealed an utter
selflessness, declaring that, in the day of <q class='bab'>“Him Whom God shall
manifest”</q>: —


  <p id='2.23' data-ref='bne_en-p58' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bab'>“If one should hear a single verse from Him and
    recite it, it is better than that he should recite the Bayán [i.e.,
    the Revelation of the Báb] a thousand times.”</q>
     <span class='block reference'>— <i>A Traveler’s Narrative</i> (Episode of the Báb).</span></p>


<p id='2.24' data-ref='bne_en-p54'>
He counted Himself happy in enduring any affliction, if by so doing
He could smooth the path, by ever so little, for <q class='bab'>“Him Whom God
shall make manifest,”</q> Who was, He declared, the sole source of His
inspiration as well as the sole object of His love.</p>







<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_55'>Resurrection, Paradise, and Hell</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.25' data-ref='bne_en-p55'>
An important part of the Báb’s teaching is His explanation of the
terms Resurrection, Day of Judgment, Paradise and Hell. By the
Resurrection is meant, He said, the appearance of a new Manifestation
of the Sun of Truth. The raising of the dead means the spiritual
awakening of those who are asleep in the graves of ignorance,
heedlessness and lust. The Day of Judgment is the Day of the new
Manifestation, by acceptance or rejection of Whose Revelation the
sheep are separated from the goats, for the sheep know the voice of
the Good Shepherd and follow Him. Paradise is the joy of knowing and
loving God, as revealed through His Manifestation, thereby attaining
to the utmost perfection of which one is capable, and, after death,
obtaining entrance to the Kingdom of God and the life everlasting.
Hell is simply deprivation of that knowledge of God with consequent
failure to attain divine perfection, and loss of the Eternal Favor.
He definitely declared that these terms have no real meaning apart
from this; and that the prevalent ideas regarding the resurrection of
the material body, a material heaven and hell, and the like, are mere
figments of the imagination. He taught that man has a life after
death, and that in the afterlife progress towards perfection is
limitless.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_56'>Social and Ethical Teachings</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.26' data-ref='bne_en-p56'>
In His Writings the Báb tells His followers that they must be
distinguished by brotherly love and courtesy. Useful arts and crafts
must be cultivated. Elementary education should be general. In the
new and wondrous Dispensation now commencing, women are to have
fuller freedom. The poor are to be provided for out of the common
treasury, but begging is strictly forbidden, as is the use of
intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes.</p>


<p id='2.27' data-ref='bne_en-p57'>
The guiding motive of the true Bábí must be pure love, without hope
of reward or fear of punishment. Thus He says in the Bayán: — </p>

  <p id='2.28' data-ref='bne_en-p58' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bab'>So worship God that if the recompense of thy worship of Him were to
    be the Fire, no alteration in thy worship of Him would be produced.
    If you worship from fear, that is unworthy of the threshold of the
    holiness of God.… So also, if your gaze is on Paradise, and if you
    worship in hope of that; for then you have made God’s creation a
    Partner with Him.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> — <i>Bábís of Persia</i>, II, by Prof. E. G. Browne, J.R.A.S., vol. xxi.</span></p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_59'>Passion and Triumph</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='2.29' data-ref='bne_en-p59'>
This last quotation reveals the spirit which animated the Báb’s
whole life. To know and love God, to mirror forth His attributes and
to prepare the way for His coming Manifestation — these were the sole
aim and object of His being. For Him life had no terrors and death no
sting, for love had cast out fear, and martyrdom itself was but the
rapture of casting His all at the feet of His Beloved.</p>


<p id='2.30' data-ref='bne_en-p60'>
Strange! that this pure and beautiful Soul, this inspired Teacher of
Divine Truth, this devoted Lover of God and of His fellowmen should
be so hated, and done to death by the professedly religious of His
day! Surely nothing but unthinking or willful prejudice could blind
men to the fact that here was indeed a Prophet, a Holy Messenger of
God. Worldly greatness and glory He had none, but how can spiritual
Power and Dominion be proved except by the ability to dispense with
all earthly assistance, and to triumph over all earthly opposition,
even the most potent and virulent? How can Divine Love be
demonstrated to an unbelieving world save by its capacity to endue to
the uttermost the blows of calamity and the darts of affliction, the
hatred of enemies and the treachery of seeming friends, to rise
serene above all these and, undismayed and unembittered, still to
forgive and bless?</p>


<p id='2.31' data-ref='bne_en-p61'>
The Báb has endured and the Báb has triumphed. Thousands have
testified to the sincerity of their love for Him by sacrificing their
lives and their all in His service. Kings might well envy His power
over men’s hearts and lives. Moreover, “He Whom the Lord shall
make manifest” has appeared, has confirmed the claims and accepted
the devotion of His forerunner, and made Him partaker of His Glory.</p>

<p id='3.2' data-ref='bne_en-p63'>
Mírzá Ḥusayn ‘Alí, Who afterwards assumed the title of
Bahá’u’lláh (i.e., Glory of God), was the eldest son of Mírzá
‘Abbás of Núr, a Vazír or Minister of State. His family was
wealthy and distinguished, many of its members having occupied
important positions in the Government and in the Civil and Military
Services of Persia. He was born in Ṭihrán (Teheran), the capital
city of Persia, between dawn and sunrise on the 12th of November,
1817.<a data-fnid='2'></a> He never attended school or college,
and what little teaching He received was given at home. Nevertheless,
even as a child He showed wonderful wisdom and knowledge. While He
was still a youth His father died, leaving Him responsible for the
care of His younger brothers and sisters, and for the management of
the extensive family estates.</p>


<p id='3.3' data-ref='bne_en-p64'>
On one occasion ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the eldest son of Bahá’u’lláh,
related to the writer the following particulars about His Father’s
early days: — </p>

  <p id='3.4' data-ref='bne_en-p65' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>From childhood He was extremely kind and generous. He was a great
    lover of outdoor life, most of His time being spent in the garden or
    the fields. He had an extraordinary power of attraction, which was
    felt by all. People always crowded around Him. Ministers and people
    of the Court would surround Him, and the children also were devoted
    to Him. When He was only thirteen or fourteen years old He became
    renowned for His learning. He would converse on any subject and solve
    any problem presented to Him. In large gatherings He would discuss
    matters with the ‘Ulamá (leading mullás) and would explain
    intricate religious questions. All of them used to listen to Him with
    the greatest interest.</q> </p>


  <p id='3.5' data-ref='bne_en-p66' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>When Bahá’u’lláh was twenty-two years old, His father died, and
    the Government wished Him to succeed to His father’s position in
    the Ministry, as was customary in Persia, but Bahá’u’lláh did
    not accept the offer. Then the Prime Minister said: “Leave him to
    himself. Such a position is unworthy of him. He has some higher aim
    in view. I cannot understand him, but I am convinced that he is
    destined for some lofty career. His thoughts are not like ours. Let
    him alone.”</q> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_67'>Imprisoned as Bábí</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.6' data-ref='bne_en-p67'>
When the Báb declared His mission in 1844, Bahá’u’lláh, Who
was then in His twenty-seventh year, boldly espoused the Cause of the
new Faith, of which He soon became recognized as one of the most
powerful and fearless exponents.</p>


<p id='3.7' data-ref='bne_en-p68'>
He had already twice suffered imprisonment for the Cause, and on one
occasion had undergone the torture of the bastinado, when in August
1852, an event occurred fraught with terrible consequences for the
Bábís. One of the Báb’s followers, a youth named Ṣádiq, had
been so affected by the martyrdom of his beloved Master, of which he
was an eyewitness, that his mind became deranged, and, in revenge, he
waylaid the <u>Sh</u>áh and fired a pistol at him. Instead of using
a bullet, however, he charged his weapon with small shot, and
although a few pellets struck the <u>Sh</u>áh, no serious harm was
done. The youth dragged the <u>Sh</u>áh from his horse, but was
promptly seized by the attendants of his Majesty and put to death on
the spot. The whole body of Bábís was unjustly held responsible for
the deed, and frightful massacres ensued. Eighty of them were
forthwith put to death in Ṭihrán with the most revolting tortures.
Many others were seized and put into prisons, among them being
Bahá’u’lláh. He afterwards wrote: — </p>

  <p id='3.8' data-ref='bne_en-p69' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>By the righteousness of God! We were in no wise connected with that
    evil deed, and Our innocence was indisputably established by the
    tribunals. Nevertheless, they apprehended Us, and from Níyávarán,
    which was then the residence of His Majesty, conducted Us, on foot
    and in chains, with bared head and bare feet, to the dungeon of
    Ṭihrán. A brutal man, accompanying Us on horseback, snatched off
    Our hat, whilst We were being hurried along by a troop of
    executioners and officials. We were consigned for four months to a
    place foul beyond comparison. As to the dungeon in which this Wronged
    One and others similarly wronged were confined, a dark and narrow pit
    were preferable. Upon Our arrival We were first conducted along a
    pitch-black corridor, from whence We descended three steep flights of
    stairs to the place of confinement assigned to Us. The dungeon was
    wrapped in thick darkness, and Our fellow-prisoners numbered nearly a
    hundred and fifty souls: thieves, assassins and highwaymen. Though
    crowded, it had no other outlet than the passage by which We entered.
    No pen can depict that place, nor any tongue describe its loathsome
    smell. Most of these men had neither clothes nor bedding to lie on.
    God alone knoweth what befell Us in that most foul-smelling and
    gloomy place!</q> </p>


  <p id='3.9' data-ref='bne_en-p70' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Day and night, while confined in that dungeon, We meditated upon the
    deeds, the condition, and the conduct of the Bábís, wondering what
    could have led a people so high-minded, so noble, and of such
    intelligence, to perpetrate such an audacious and outrageous act
    against the person of His Majesty. This Wronged One, thereupon,
    decided to arise, after His release from prison, and undertake, with
    the utmost vigor, the task of regenerating this people.</q> </p>


  <p id='3.10' data-ref='bne_en-p71' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>One night, in a dream, these exalted words were heard on every side:
    “Verily, We shall render Thee victorious by Thyself and by Thy Pen.
    Grieve Thou not for that which hath befallen Thee, neither be Thou
    afraid, for Thou art in safety. Erelong will God raise up the
    treasures of the earth — men who will aid Thee through Thyself and
    through Thy Name, wherewith God hath revived the hearts of such as
    have recognized Him.”</q>

<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_72'>Exile to Ba<u>gh</u>dád</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.11' data-ref='bne_en-p72'>
This terrible imprisonment lasted four months, but Bahá’u’lláh
and His companions remained zealous and enthusiastic, in the greatest
of happiness. Almost every day one or more of them was tortured or
put to death and the others reminded that their turn might come next.
When the executioners came to fetch one of the friends, the one whose
name was called would literally dance with joy, kiss the hands of
Bahá’u’lláh, embrace the rest of his fellow believers and then
hasten with glad eagerness to the place of martyrdom.</p>


<p id='3.12' data-ref='bne_en-p73'>
It was conclusively proved that Bahá’u’lláh had no share in the
plot against the <u>Sh</u>áh, and the Russian Minister testified to
the purity of His character. He was, moreover, so ill that it was
thought He would die. Instead, therefore, of sentencing Him to death,
the <u>Sh</u>áh ordered that He should be exiled to ‘Iráq-i-‘Arab,
in Mesopotamia; and thither, a fortnight later, Bahá’u’lláh set
out, accompanied by His family and a number of other believers. They
suffered terribly from cold and other hardships on the long winter
journey, and arrived in Ba<u>gh</u>dád in a state of almost utter
destitution.</p>


<p id='3.13' data-ref='bne_en-p74'>
As soon as His health permitted, Bahá’u’lláh began to teach
inquirers and to encourage and exhort the believers, and soon peace
and happiness reigned among the Bábís.<a data-fnid='3'></a>
This, however, was short-lived. Bahá’u’lláh’s half brother,
Mírzá Yaḥyá, also known as Ṣubḥ-i-Azal, arrived in Ba<u>gh</u>dád,
and soon afterwards differences, secretly instigated by him, began to
grow, just as similar divisions had arisen among the disciples of
Christ. These differences (which later, in Adrianople, became open
and violent) were very painful to Bahá’u’lláh, Whose whole aim
in life was the promotion of unity among the people of the world.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_75'>Two Years in the Wilderness</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.14' data-ref='bne_en-p75'>
About a year after coming to Ba<u>gh</u>dád, He departed alone into
the wilderness of Sulaymáníyyih, taking with Him nothing but a
change of clothes. Regarding this period He writes in the <i>Book of
Íqán</i><a data-fnid='4'></a> as follows: — </p>

  <p id='3.15' data-ref='bne_en-p76' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>In the early days of Our arrival in this land, when We discerned the
    signs of impending events, We decided, ere they happened, to retire.
    We betook Ourselves to the wilderness, and there, separated and
    alone, led for two years a life of complete solitude. From Our eyes
    there rained tears of anguish, and in Our bleeding heart there surged
    an ocean of agonizing pain. Many a night We had no food for
    sustenance, and many a day Our body found no rest. By Him Who hath My
    being between His hands! notwithstanding these showers of afflictions
    and unceasing calamities, Our soul was wrapt in blissful joy, and Our
    whole being evinced an ineffable gladness. For in Our solitude We
    were unaware of the harm or benefit, the health or ailment, of any
    soul. Alone, We communed with Our spirit, oblivious of the world and
    all that is therein. We knew not, however, that the mesh of divine
    destiny exceedeth the vastest of mortal conceptions, and the dart of
    His decree transcendeth the boldest of human designs. None can escape
    the snares He setteth, and no soul can find release except through
    submission to His will. By the righteousness of God! Our withdrawal
    contemplated no return, and Our separation hoped for no reunion. The
    one object of Our retirement was to avoid becoming a subject of
    discord among the faithful, a source of disturbance unto Our
    companions, the means of injury to any soul, or the cause of sorrow
    to any heart. Beyond these, We cherished no other intention, and
    apart from them, We had no end in view. And yet, each person schemed
    after his own desire, and pursued his own idle fancy, until the hour
    when, from the Mystic Source, there came the summons bidding Us
    return whence We came. Surrendering Our will to His, We submitted to
    His injunction.</q> </p>


  <p id='3.16' data-ref='bne_en-p77' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>What pen can recount the things We beheld upon Our return! Two years
    have elapsed during which Our enemies have ceaselessly and

<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_78'>Opposition of Mullás</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.17' data-ref='bne_en-p78'>
After His return from this retirement, His fame became greater than
ever and people flocked to Ba<u>gh</u>dád from far and near to see
Him and hear His teachings. Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians, as
well as Muḥammadans, became interested in the new message. The
Mullás (Muḥammadan doctors), however, took up a hostile attitude
and persistently plotted to effect His overthrow. On a certain
occasion they sent one of their number to interview Him and submit to
Him certain questions. The envoy found the answers of Bahá’u’lláh
so convincing and His wisdom so amazing, although evidently not
acquired by study, that he was obliged to confess that in knowledge
and understanding Bahá’u’lláh was peerless. In order, however,
that the Mullás who had sent him should be satisfied as to the
reality of Bahá’u’lláh’s Prophethood, he asked that some
miracle should be produced as a proof. Bahá’u’lláh expressed
His willingness to accept the suggestion on certain conditions,
declaring that if the Mullás would agree regarding some miracle to
be performed, and would sign and seal a document to the effect that
on performance of this miracle they would confess the validity of His
mission and cease to oppose Him, He would furnish the desired proof
or else stand convicted of imposture. Had the aim of the Mullás been
to get at the truth, surely here was their opportunity; but their
intention was far otherwise. Rightly or wrongly, they meant to secure
a decision in their own favor. They feared the truth and fled from
the daring challenge. This discomfiture, however, only spurred them
on to devise fresh plots for the eradication of the oppressed sect.
The Consul General of Persia in Ba<u>gh</u>dád came to their
assistance and sent repeated messages to the <u>Sh</u>áh to the
effect that Bahá’u’lláh was injuring the Muḥammadan religion
more than ever, still exerting a malign influence in Persia, and that
He ought therefore to be banished to some more distant place.</p>


<p id='3.18' data-ref='bne_en-p79'>
It was characteristic of Bahá’u’lláh that, at this crisis, when
at the instigation of the Muḥammadan Mullás the Persian and
Turkish Governments were combining their efforts to eradicate the
Movement, He remained calm and serene, encouraging and inspiring His
followers and writing imperishable words of consolation and guidance.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá related how the <i>Hidden Words</i> were written at
this time. Bahá’u’lláh would often go for a walk along the bank
of the Tigris. He would come back looking very happy and write down
those lyric gems of wise counsel which have brought help and healing
to thousands of aching and troubled hearts. For years, only a few
manuscript copies of the <i>Hidden Words</i> were in existence, and
these had to be carefully concealed lest they should fall into the
hands of the enemies that abounded, but now this little volume is
probably the best known of all Bahá’u’lláh’s works, and is
read in every quarter of the globe. <i>The Book of Íqán</i> is
another well-known work of Bahá’u’lláh’s written about the
same period, towards the end of His sojourn at Ba<u>gh</u>dád
(1862–1863 A.D.)</p>







<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_80'>Declaration at Riḍván near Ba<u>gh</u>dád</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.19' data-ref='bne_en-p80'>
After much negotiation, at the request of the Persian Government, an
order was issued by the Turkish Government summoning Bahá’u’lláh
to Constantinople. On receipt of this news His followers were in
consternation. They besieged the house of their beloved Leader to
such an extent that the family encamped in the Garden of Najíb Pá<u>sh</u>á
outside the town for twelve days, while the caravan was being
prepared for the long journey. It was on the first of these twelve
days (April 22 to May 3, 1863, i.e., nineteen years after the Báb’s
Declaration) that Bahá’u’lláh announced to several of His
followers the glad tidings that He was the One Whose coming had been
foretold by the Báb — the Chosen of God, the Promised One of all the
Prophets. The Garden where this memorable Declaration took place has
become known to Bahá’ís as the “Garden of Riḍván,” and the
days Bahá’u’lláh spent there are commemorated in the “Feast
of Riḍván,” which is held annually on the anniversary of those
twelve days. During those days Bahá’u’lláh, instead of being
sad or depressed, showed the greatest joy, dignity and power. His
followers became happy and enthusiastic, and great crowds came to pay
their respects to Him. All the notables of Ba<u>gh</u>dád, even the
Governor himself, came to honor the departing prisoner.</p>







<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_81'>Constantinople and Adrianople</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.20' data-ref='bne_en-p81'>
The journey to Constantinople lasted between three and four months,
the party consisting of Bahá’u’lláh with members of His family
and twenty-six disciples. Arrived in Constantinople they found
themselves prisoners in a small house in which they were very much
overcrowded. Later they got somewhat better quarters, but after four
months they were again moved on, this time to Adrianople. The journey
to Adrianople, although it lasted but a few days, was the most
terrible they had yet undertaken. Snow fell heavily most of the time,
and as they were destitute of proper clothing and food, their
sufferings were extreme. For the first winter in Adrianople,
Bahá’u’lláh and His family, numbering twelve persons, were
accommodated in a small house of three rooms, comfortless and vermin
infested. In the spring they were given a more comfortable abode.
They remained in Adrianople for four and a half years. Here
Bahá’u’lláh resumed His teaching and gathered about Him a large
following. He publicly announced His mission and was enthusiastically
<i>accepted by the majority of the Bábís, who were known thereafter
as Bahá’ís</i>. A minority, however, under the leadership of
Bahá’u’lláh’s half brother, Mírzá Yaḥyá, became
violently opposed to Him and joined with their former enemies, the
<u>Sh</u>í‘ihs, in plotting for His overthrow. Great troubles
ensued, and at last the Turkish Government banished both Bábís and
Bahá’ís from Adrianople, exiling Bahá’u’lláh and His
followers to ‘Akká, in Palestine, where they arrived (according to
Nabíl)<a data-fnid='6'></a> on August 31, 1868, while Mírzá
Yaḥyá and his party were sent to Cyprus.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_82'>Letters to Kings</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.21' data-ref='bne_en-p82'>
About this time Bahá’u’lláh wrote His famous letter to the
Sulṭán of Turkey, many of the crowned heads of Europe, the Pope,
and the <u>Sh</u>áh of Persia. Later, in His <i>Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i><a data-fnid='7'></a>
He addressed other sovereigns, the rulers and Presidents of America,
the leaders of religion in general and the generality of mankind. To
all, He announced His mission and called upon them to bend their
energies to the establishment of true religion, just government and
international peace. In His letter to the <u>Sh</u>áh He powerfully
pleaded the cause of the oppressed Bábís and asked to be brought
face to face with those who had instigated their persecution.
Needless to say, this request was not complied with; Badí‘, the
young and devoted Bahá’í who delivered the letter of Bahá’u’lláh,
was seized and martyred with fearful tortures, hot bricks being
pressed on his flesh!</p>


<p id='3.22' data-ref='bne_en-p83'>
In the same letter Bahá’u’lláh gives a most moving account of
His own sufferings and longings: — </p>

  <p id='3.23' data-ref='bne_en-p84' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O King, I have seen in the way of God what no eye hath seen and no
    ear hath heard. Friends have disclaimed me; ways are straitened unto
    me; the pool of safety is dried up; the plain of ease is [scorched]
    yellow. How many calamities have descended, and how many will
    descend! I walk advancing toward the Mighty, the Bounteous, while
    behind me glides the serpent. My eyes rain down tears until my bed is
    drenched; but my sorrow is not for myself. By God, my head longeth
    for the spears for the love of its Lord, and I never pass by a tree
    but my heart addresseth it [saying], “O would that thou wert cut
    down in my name and my body were crucified upon thee in the way of my
    Lord;” yea, because I see mankind going astray in their
    intoxication, and they know it not: they have exalted their lusts,
    and put aside their God, as though they took the command of God for a
    mockery, a sport, and a plaything; and they think that they do well,
    and that they are harbored in the citadel of security. The matter is
    not as they suppose: tomorrow they shall see what they [now] deny.</q> </p>


  <p id='3.24' data-ref='bne_en-p85' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>We are about to shift from this most remote place of banishment
    [Adrianople] unto the prison of Acre. And, according to what they
    say, it is assuredly the most desolate of the cities of the world,
    the most unsightly of them in appearance, the most detestable in
    climate, and the foulest in water; it is as though it were the
    metropolis of the owl; there is not heard from its regions aught save
    the sound of its hooting. And in it they intend to imprison the
    servant, and to shut in our faces the doors of leniency and take away
    from us the good things of the life of the world during what
    remaineth of our days. By God, though weariness should weaken me, and
    hunger should destroy me, though my couch should be made of the hard
    rock and my associates of the beasts of the desert, I will not
    blench, but will be patient, as the resolute and determined are
    patient, in the strength of God, the King of Preexistence, the
    Creator of the nations; and under all circumstances I give thanks
    unto God. And we hope of His graciousness (exalted is He) … that He
    will render [all men’s] faces sincere toward Him, the Mighty, the
    Bounteous. Verily He answereth him who prayeth unto Him, and is near
    unto him who calleth on Him. And we ask Him to make this dark
    calamity a buckler for the body of His saints, and to protect them
    thereby from sharp swords and piercing blades. Through affliction
    hath His light shone and His praise been bright unceasingly: this
    hath been His method through past ages and bygone times.</q>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_86'>Imprisonment in ‘Akká</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.25' data-ref='bne_en-p86'>
At that time ‘Akká (Acre) was a prison city to which the worst
criminals were sent from all parts of the Turkish Empire. On arriving
there, after a miserable sea journey, Bahá’u’lláh and His
followers, about eighty to eighty-four in number, including men,
women and children, were imprisoned in the army barracks. The place
was dirty and cheerless in the extreme. There were no beds or
comforts of any sort. The food supplied was wretched and inadequate,
so much so that after a time the prisoners begged to be allowed to
buy their food for themselves. During the first few days the children
were crying continually, and sleep was almost impossible. Malaria,
dysentery and other diseases soon broke out, and everyone in the
company fell sick, with the exception of two. Three succumbed to
their sickness, and the sufferings of the survivors were
indescribable.<a data-fnid='8'></a></p>


<p id='3.26' data-ref='bne_en-p87'>
This rigorous imprisonment lasted for over two years, during which
time none of the Bahá’ís were allowed outside the prison door,
except four men, carefully guarded, who went out daily to buy food.</p>

During the imprisonment in the barracks, visitors were rigidly
excluded. Several of the Bahá’ís of Persia came all the way on
foot for the purpose of seeing their beloved Leader, but were refused
admittance within the city walls. They used to go to a place on the
plain outside the third moat, from which they could see the windows
of Bahá’u’lláh’s quarters. He would show Himself to them at
one of the windows and after gazing on Him from afar, they would weep
and return to their homes, fired with new zeal for sacrifice and
service.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_89'>Restrictions Relaxed</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.28' data-ref='bne_en-p89'>
At last the imprisonment was mitigated. A mobilization of Turkish
troops occurred and the barracks were required for soldiers.
Bahá’u’lláh and His family were transferred to a house by
themselves and the rest of the party were accommodated in a
caravanserai in the town. Bahá’u’lláh was confined for seven
more years in this house. In a small room near that in which He was
imprisoned, thirteen of His household, including both sexes, had to
accommodate themselves as best they could! In the earlier part of
their stay in this house they suffered greatly from insufficiency of
accommodation, inadequate food supply and a lack of the ordinary
conveniences of life. After a time, however, a few additional rooms
were placed at their disposal and they were able to live in
comparative comfort. From the time Bahá’u’lláh and His
companions left the barracks, visitors were allowed to see them, and
gradually the severe restrictions imposed by the Imperial firmans
were more and more left in abeyance, although now and then reimposed
for a time.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_90'>Prison Gates Opened</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.29' data-ref='bne_en-p90'>
Even when the imprisonment was at its worst, the Bahá’ís were not
dismayed, and their serene confidence was never shaken. While in the
barracks at ‘Akká, Bahá’u’lláh wrote to some friends: — </p>

  <p id='3.30' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>“Fear
    not. These doors shall be opened. My tent shall be pitched on Mount
    Carmel, and the utmost joy shall be realized.”</q></p>

<p id='3.31'>
This declaration was
a great source of consolation to His followers, and in due course it
was literally fulfilled. The story of how the prison doors were
opened had best be told in the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as
translated by His grandson, Shoghi Effendi: — </p>

  <p id='3.32' data-ref='bne_en-p91' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Bahá’u’lláh loved the beauty and verdure of the country. One
    day He passed the remark: “I have not gazed on verdure for nine
    years. The country is the world of the soul, the city is the world of
    bodies.” When I heard indirectly of this saying I realized that He
    was longing for the country, and I was sure that whatever I could do
    towards the carrying out of His wish would be successful. There was
    in ‘Akká at that time a man called Muḥammad Pá<u>sh</u>á
    Ṣafwat, who was very much opposed to us. He had a palace called
    Mazra’ih, about four miles north of the city, a lovely place,
    surrounded by gardens and with a stream of running water. I went and
    called on this Pá<u>sh</u>á at his home. I said: “Pá<u>sh</u>á,
    you have left the palace empty, and are living in ‘Akká.” He
    replied “I am an invalid and cannot leave the city. If I go there
    it is lonely and I am cut off from my friends.” I said: “While
    you are not living there and the place is empty, let it to us.” He
    was amazed at the proposal, but soon consented. I got the house at a
    very low rent, about five pounds per annum, paid him for five years
    and made a contract. I sent laborers to repair the place and put the
    garden in order and had a bath built. I also had a carriage prepared
    for the use of the Blessed Beauty.<a data-fnid='9'></a> One day
    I determined to go and see the place for myself. Notwithstanding the
    repeated injunctions given in successive firmans that we were on no
    account to pass the limits of the city walls, I walked out through
    the City Gate. Gendarmes were on guard, but they made no objection,
    so I proceeded straight to the palace. The next day I again went out,
    with some friends and officials, unmolested and unopposed, although
    the guards and sentinels stood on both sides of the city gates.
    Another day I arranged a banquet, spread a table under the pine trees
    of Bahjí, and gathered round it the notables and officials of the
    town. In the evening we all returned to the town together.</q> </p>


  <p id='3.33' data-ref='bne_en-p92' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>One day I went to the Holy Presence of the Blessed Beauty and said:
    “the palace at Mazra’ih is ready for You, and a carriage to drive
    You there.” (At that time there were no carriages in ‘Akká or
    Haifa.) He refused to go, saying: “I am a prisoner.” Later I
    requested Him again, but got the same answer. I went so far as to ask
    Him a third time, but He still said “No!” and I did not dare to
    insist further. There was, however, in ‘Akká a certain Muḥammadan
    <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>, a well-known man with considerable influence,
    who loved Bahá’u’lláh and was greatly favored by Him. I called
    this <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> and explained the position to him. I said,
    “You are daring. Go tonight to His Holy Presence, fall on your
    knees before Him, take hold of His hands and do not let go until He
    promises to leave the city!” He was an ‘Arab.… He went directly
    to Bahá’u’lláh and sat down close to His knees. He took hold of
    the hands of the Blessed Beauty and kissed them and asked: “Why do
    you not leave the city?” He said: “I am a prisoner.” The <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>
    replied: “God forbid! Who has the power to make you a prisoner? You
    have kept yourself in prison. It was your own will to be imprisoned,
    and now I beg you to come out and go to the palace. It is beautiful
    and verdant. The trees are lovely, and the oranges like balls of
    fire!” As often as the Blessed Beauty said: “I am a prisoner, it
    cannot be,” the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> took His hands and kissed
    them. For a whole hour he kept on pleading. At last Bahá’u’lláh
    said, “<u>Kh</u>aylí <u>kh</u>ub (very good)” and the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>’s
    patience and persistence were rewarded. He came to me with great joy
    to give the glad news of His holiness’s consent. In spite of the
    strict firman of ‘Abdu’l-’Azíz which prohibited my meeting or
    having any intercourse with the Blessed Perfection, I took the
    carriage the next day and drove with Him to the palace. No one made
    any objection. I left Him there and returned myself to the city.</q> </p>


  <p id='3.34' data-ref='bne_en-p93' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>For two years He remained in that charming and lovely spot. Then it
    was decided to remove to another place, at Bahjí. It so happened
    that an epidemic disease had broken out at Bahjí, and the proprietor
    of the house fled away in distress, with all his family, ready to
    offer the house free of charge to any applicant. We took the house at
    a very low rent, and there the doors of majesty and true sovereignty
    were flung wide open. Bahá’u’lláh was nominally a prisoner (for
    the drastic firmans of Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz were never
    repealed), yet in reality He showed forth such nobility and dignity
    in His life and bearing that He was reverenced by all, and the Rulers
    of Palestine envied His influence and power. Governors and
    Mutaṣarrifs, generals and local officials, would humbly request the
    honor of attaining His presence — a request to which He seldom
    acceded.</q> </p>


  <p id='3.35' data-ref='bne_en-p94' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>On one occasion a Governor of the city implored this favor on the
    ground of his being ordered by higher authorities to visit, with a
    certain general, the Blessed Perfection. The request being granted,
    the general, who was a very corpulent individual, a European, was so
    impressed by the majestic presence of Bahá’u’lláh that he
    remained kneeling on the ground near the door. Such was the
    diffidence of both visitors that it was only after repeated
    invitations from Bahá’u’lláh that they were induced to smoke
    the nargileh (hubble-bubble pipe) offered to them. Even then they
    only touched it with their lips, and then, putting it aside, folded
    their arms and sat in an attitude of such humility and respect as to
    astonish all those who were present.</q> </p>


  <p id='3.36' data-ref='bne_en-p95' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The loving reverence of friends, the consideration and respect that
    were shown by all officials and notables, the inflow of pilgrims and
    seekers after truth, the spirit of devotion and service that was
    manifest all around, the majestic and kingly countenance of the
    Blessed Perfection, the effectiveness of His command, the number of
    His zealous devotees — all bore witness to the fact that Bahá’u’lláh
    was in reality no prisoner, but a King of Kings. Two despotic
    sovereigns were against Him, two powerful autocratic rulers, yet,
    even when confined in their own prisons, He addressed them in very
    austere terms, like a king addressing his subjects. Afterwards, in
    spite of severe firmans, He lived at Bahjí like a prince. Often He
    would say: “Verily, verily, the most wretched prison has been
    converted into a Paradise of Eden.”</q> </p>


  <p id='3.37' data-ref='bne_en-p96' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Surely, such a thing has not been witnessed since the creation of the world.</q> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_97'>Life at Bahjí</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.38' data-ref='bne_en-p97'>
Having in His earlier years of hardship shown how to glorify God in a
state of poverty and ignominy, Bahá’u’lláh in His later years
at Bahjí showed how to glorify God in a state of honor and
affluence. The offering of hundreds of thousands of devoted followers
placed at His disposal large funds which He was called upon to
administer. Although His life at Bahjí has been described as truly
regal, in the highest sense of the word, yet it must not be imagined
that it was characterized by material splendor or extravagance. The
Blessed Perfection and His family lived in very simple and modest
fashion, and expenditure on selfish luxury was a think unknown in
that household. Near His home the believers prepared a beautiful
garden called Riḍván, in which He often spent many consecutive
days or even weeks, sleeping at night in a little cottage in the
garden. Occasionally He went further afield. He made several visits
to ‘Akká and Haifa, and on more than one occasion pitched His tent
on Mount Carmel, as He had predicted when imprisoned in the barracks
at ‘Akká. The time of Bahá’u’lláh was spent for the most
part in prayer and meditation, in writing the Sacred Books, revealing
Tablets, and in spiritual education of the friends. In order to give
Him entire freedom for this great work, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá undertook
the arrangement of all other affairs, even meeting the Mullás,
poets, and members of the Government. All of these were delighted and
happy through meeting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and entirely satisfied with
His explanation and talks, and although they had not met Bahá’u’lláh
Himself, they became full of friendly feeling towards Him, through
their acquaintanceship with His son, for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
attitude caused them to understand the station of His father.</p>


<p id='3.39' data-ref='bne_en-p98'>
The distinguished orientalist, the late Professor Edward G. Browne,
of the University of Cambridge, visited Bahá’u’lláh at Bahjí
in the year 1890, and recorded his impressions as follows: — </p>

  <p id='3.40' data-ref='bne_en-p99' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='browne'> … my conductor paused for a moment while I removed my shoes. Then,
    with a quick movement of the hand, he withdrew, and, as I passed,
    replaced the curtain; and I found myself in a large apartment, along
    the upper end of which ran a low divan, while on the side opposite to
    the door were placed two or three chairs. Though I dimly suspected
    whither I was going and whom I was to behold (for no distinct
    intimation had been given to me), a second or two elapsed ere, with a
    throb of wonder and awe, I became definitely conscious that the room
    was not untenanted. In the corner where the divan met the wall sat a
    wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt head-dress of the
    kind called <i>taj</i> by dervishes (but of unusual height and make),
    round the base of which was wound a small white turban. The face of
    him on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it.
    Those piercing eyes seemed to read one’s very soul; power and
    authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines on the
    forehead and face implied an age which the jet-black hair and beard
    flowing down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist
    seemed to belie. No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed
    myself before one who is the object of a devotion and love which
    kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain!</q> </p>


  <p id='3.41' data-ref='bne_en-p100' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='browne'> A mild dignified voice bade me be seated, and then continued: “Praise
    be to God that thou has attained! … Thou has come to see a prisoner
    and an exile.… We desire but the good of the world and happiness of
    the nations; yet they deem us a stirrer up of strife and sedition
    worthy of bondage and banishment.… That all nations should become
    one in faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and
    unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity
    of religion should cease, and differences of race be annulled — what
    harm is there in this? … Yet so it shall be; these fruitless
    strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the ‘Most Great
    Peace’ shall come.… Do not you in Europe need this also? Is not
    this that which Christ foretold? … Yet do we see your kings and
    rulers lavishing their treasures more freely on means for the
    destruction of the human race than on that which would conduce to the
    happiness of mankind.… These strifes and this bloodshed and discord
    must cease, and all men be as one kindred and one family.… Let not
    a man glory in this, that he loves his country; let him rather glory
    in this, that he loves his kind.…”</q> </p>


  <p id='3.42' data-ref='bne_en-p101' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='browne'> Such, so far as I can recall them, were the words which, besides many
    others, I heard from Behá. Let those who read them consider well
    with themselves whether such doctrines merit death and bonds, and
    whether the world is more likely gain or lose by their
    diffusion.</q>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_102'>Ascension</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.43' data-ref='bne_en-p102'>
Thus simply and serenely did Bahá’u’lláh pass the evening of
His life on earth until, after an attack of fever, He passed away on
the 29th of May, 1892, at the age of seventy-five. Among the last
Tablets He revealed was His Will and Testament, which He wrote with
His own hand and duly signed and sealed. Nine days after His death
the seals were broken by His eldest son, in the presence of members
of the family and a few friends, and the contents of the short but
remarkable document were made known. By this will ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was constituted His father’s representative and the expounder of
His teachings, and the family and relatives of Bahá’u’lláh and
all believers were instructed to turn to Him and obey Him. By this
arrangement sectarianism and division were provided against and the
unity of the Cause assured.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_103'>Prophethood of Bahá’u’lláh</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.44' data-ref='bne_en-p103'>
It is important to have clear ideas of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Prophethood. His utterances, like those of other divine
“Manifestations,” may be divided into two classes, in one of
which He writes or speaks simply as a man who has been charged by God
with a message to His fellows, while in the other class the words
purport to be the direct utterance of God Himself.</p>


<p id='3.45' data-ref='bne_en-p104' class='noid'>He writes in the <i>Book of Íqán</i>: — </p>

  <p id='3.46' data-ref='bne_en-p105' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>We have already in the foregoing pages assigned two stations unto
  each of the Luminaries arising from the Daysprings of eternal
  holiness. One of these stations, the station of essential unity, We
  have already explained. “No distinction do We make between any of
  them.” [Qur’án 2:136] The other is the station of distinction,
  and pertaineth to the world of creation and to be the limitations
  thereof. In this respect, each Manifestation of God hath a distinct
  individuality, a definitely prescribed mission, a predestined
  Revelation, and specially designated limitations. Each one of them is
  known by a different name, is characterized by a special attribute,
  fulfils a definite Mission, and is entrusted with a particular
  Revelation. Even as He saith: “Some of the Apostles We have caused
  to excel the others. To some God hath spoken, some He hath raise and
  exalted. And to Jesus, Son of Mary, We gave manifest signs, and We
  strengthen Him with the Holy Spirit.” [Qur’án 2:253] … </q> </p>



  <p id='3.47' data-ref='bne_en-p106' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Thus, viewed from the standpoint of their oneness and sublime
  detachment, the attributes of Godhead, Divinity, Supreme Singleness,
  and Inmost Essence, have been and are applicable to those Essences of
  being, inasmuch as they all abide on the throne of divine Revelation,
  and are established upon the seat of divine Concealment. Through
  their appearance the Revelation of God is made manifest, and by their
  countenance the Beauty of God is revealed. Thus it is that the
  accents of God Himself have been heard uttered by these
  Manifestations of the divine Being.</q> </p>


  <p id='3.48' data-ref='bne_en-p107' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Viewed in the light of their second station — the station of
  distinction, differentiation, temporal limitations, characteristics
  and standards, — they manifest absolute servitude, utter destitution
  and complete self-effacement. Even as He saith: “I am the servant
  of God. I am but a man like you.” … </q> </p>



  <p id='3.49' data-ref='bne_en-p108' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to declare: “I
  am God!” He verily speaketh the truth, and no doubt attacheth
  thereto. For it hath been repeatedly demonstrated that through their
  Revelation, their attributes and names, the Revelation of God, His
  name and His attributes, are made manifest in the world. Thus, He
  hath revealed: “Those shafts were God’s, not Thine!” [Qur’án
  8:17] And also He saith: “In truth, they who plighted fealty unto
  thee, really plighted that fealty unto God.” [Qur’án 48:10] And
  were any of them to voice the utterance: “I am the Messenger of
  God,” He also speaketh the truth, the indubitable truth. Even as He
  saith: “Muḥammad is not the father of any man among you, but He
  is the Messenger of God.” Viewed in this light, they are all but
  Messengers of that ideal King, that unchangeable Essence. And were
  they all to proclaim: “I am the Seal of Prophets,” they verily
  utter but the truth, beyond the faintest shadow of doubt. For they
  are all but one person, one soul, one spirit, one being, one
  revelation. They are all the manifestation of the “Beginning” and
  the “End,” the “First” and the “Last,” the “Seen” and
  “Hidden” — all of which pertain to Him Who is the innermost
  Spirit of Spirits and eternal Essence of Essences. And were they to
  say: “We are the servants of God,” [Qur’án 33:40] this also is
  a manifest and indisputable fact. For they have been made manifest in
  the uttermost state of servitude, a servitude the like of which no
  man can possibly attain. Thus in moments in which these Essences of
  being were deeply immersed beneath the oceans of ancient and
  everlasting holiness, or when they soared to the loftiest summits of
  divine mysteries, they claimed their utterance to be the Voice of
  divinity, the Call of God Himself. Were the eye of discernment to be
  opened, it would recognize that in this very state, they have
  considered themselves utterly effaced and nonexistent in the face of
  Him Whom is the All-Pervading, the incorruptible. Methinks, they have
  regarded themselves as utter nothingness, and deemed their mention in
  that Court an act of blasphemy. For the slightest whisperings of
  self, within such a Court, is an evidence of self-assertion and
  independent existence. In the eyes of them that have attained unto
  that Court, such a suggestion is itself a grievous transgression. How
  much more grievous would it be, were aught else to be mentioned in
  that Presence, were man’s heart, his tongue, his mind, or his soul,
  to be busied with anyone but the Well-Beloved, were his eyes to
  behold any countenance other than His beauty, were his ear to be
  inclined to any melody but His voice, and were his feet to tread any
  way but His way.</q> </p>


  <p id='3.50' data-ref='bne_en-p109' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>In this day the breeze of God is wafted, and His Spirit hath pervaded
  all things. Such is the outpouring of His grace that the pen is
  stilled and the tongue is speechless.</q> </p>


  <p id='3.51' data-ref='bne_en-p110' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>By virtue of this station, they have claimed for themselves the Voice
  of Divinity and the like, whilst by virtue of their station of
  Messengership, they have declared themselves the Messengers of God.
  In every instance they have voiced an utterance that would conform to
  the requirements of the occasion, and have ascribed all these
  declarations to Themselves, declarations ranging from the divine
  Revelation to the realm of creation, and from the domain of Divinity
  even unto the domain of earthly existence. Thus it is that whatsoever
  be their utterance, whether it pertain to the realm of Divinity,
  Lordship, Prophethood, Messengership, Guardianship, Apostleship or
  Servitude, all is true, beyond the shadow of a doubt. Therefore,
  these sayings which We have quoted in support of Our argument must be
  attentively considered, that the divergent utterances of the
  Manifestations of the Unseen and Daysprings of Holiness may cease to
  agitate the soul and perplex the mind.</q>

<p id='3.52' data-ref='bne_en-p111'>
When Bahá’u’lláh speaks as a man, the station He claims for
Himself is that of utter humility, of “annihilation in God.” What
distinguishes the Manifestation, in His human personality, from other
men is the completeness of His self-abnegation as well as the
perfection of His powers. Under all circumstances He is able to say,
as did Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, <q class='jesus'>“nevertheless not my
will, but thine, be done.”</q> Thus in His epistle to the <u>Sh</u>áh,
Bahá’u’lláh says: — </p>

  <p id='3.53' data-ref='bne_en-p112' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O king! I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo,
  the breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me
  the knowledge of all that hath been. This thing is not from Me, but
  from One Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. And He bade Me lift up My
  voice between earth and heaven, and for this there befell Me what
  hath caused the tears of every man of understanding to flow. The
  learning current amongst men I studied not; their schools I entered
  not.… This is but a leaf which the winds of the will of thy Lord,
  the Almighty, the All-Praised have stirred. Can it be still when the
  tempestuous winds are blowing? Nay, by Him Who is the Lord of all
  Names and Attributes! They move it as they list. The evanescent is as
  nothing before Him Who is the Ever-Abiding. His all-compelling
  summons hath reached Me, and caused Me to speak His praise amidst all
  people. I was indeed as one dead when His behest was uttered. The
  hand of the will of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Merciful,
  transformed Me. Can any one speak forth of his own accord that for
  which all men, both high and low, will protest against him? Nay, by
  Him Who taught the Pen the eternal mysteries, save him whom the grace
  of the Almighty, the All-Powerful, hath strengthened.</q>

<p id='3.54' data-ref='bne_en-p113'>
As Jesus washed His disciples’ feet, so Bahá’u’lláh used
sometimes to cook food and perform other lowly offices for His
followers. He was a servant of the servants, and gloried only in
servitude, content to sleep on a bare floor if need be, to live on
bread and water, or even, at times, on what He called “the divine
nourishment, that is to say, hunger!” His perfect humility was seen
in His profound reverence for nature, for human nature, and
especially for the saints, prophets and martyrs. To Him, all things
spoke of God, from the meanest to the greatest.</p>


<p id='3.55' data-ref='bne_en-p114'>
His human personality had been chosen by God to become the Divine
Mouthpiece and Pen. It was not of His own will that He had assumed
this position of unparalleled difficulty and hardship. As Jesus said:
<q class='jesus'>“Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me,”</q> so
Bahá’u’lláh said: <q class='baha'>“had there been any expounder or speaker
discernible, We would not have made Ourself the object of the
censure, ridicule and slander of the people.”</q> (Tablet of I<u>sh</u>ráqát).
But the divine call was clear and imperative and He obeyed. God’s
will became His will, and God’s pleasure, His pleasure; and with
“radiant acquiescence” He declared: —

  <p id='3.56' data-ref='bne_en-p117' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“Verily I say: Whatever
    befalleth in the path of God is the beloved of the soul and the
    desire of the heart. Deadly poison in His path is pure honey, and
    every tribulation a draught of crystal water.”</q>
    <span class='block reference'> — <i>Epistle to the Son of the Wolf</i>.</span></p>


<p id='3.57' data-ref='bne_en-p115'>
At other times, as we have mentioned, Bahá’u’lláh speaks “from
the station of Deity.” In these utterances His human personality is
so completely subservient that it is left out of account altogether.
Through Him God addresses His creatures proclaiming His love for
them, teaching them His attributes, making known His will, announcing
His laws for their guidance and pleading for their love, their
allegiance and service.</p>


<p id='3.58' data-ref='bne_en-p116'>
In the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, the utterance frequently
changes from one of these forms to another. Sometimes it is evidently
the man who is discoursing, then without a break the writing
continues as if God were speaking in the first person. Even when
speaking as a man, however, Bahá’u’lláh speaks as God’s
messenger, as a living example of entire devotion to God’s will.
His whole life is actuated by the Holy Spirit. Hence no hard and fast
line can be drawn between the human and divine elements in His life
or teachings. God tells Him: — </p>

<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_118'>His Mission</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.60' data-ref='bne_en-p118'>
Bahá’u’lláh’s mission in the world is to bring about
Unity — Unity of all mankind in and through God. He says: —

  <p id='3.61' data-ref='bne_en-p117' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“Of the
    Tree of Knowledge the All-glorious fruit is this exalted word: Of one
    Tree are all ye the fruits and of one Bough the leaves. Let not man
    glory in this that he loves his country, but let him rather glory in
    this that he loves his kind.”</q></p>


<p id='3.62' data-ref='bne_en-p119'>
Previous Prophets have heralded an age of peace on earth, goodwill
among men, and have given Their lives to hasten its advent, but each
and all of Them have plainly declared that this blessed consummation
would be reached only after the <q class='bible'>“Coming of the Lord”</q> in the
latter days, when the wicked would be judged and righteous rewarded.</p>
</q>

<p id='3.63' data-ref='bne_en-p120'>
Zoroaster foretold three thousand years of conflict before the advent
of <u>Sh</u>áh Bahrám, the world-savior, Who would overcome Ahríman
the spirit of evil, and establish a reign of righteousness and peace.</p>


<p id='3.64' data-ref='bne_en-p121'>
Moses foretold a long period of exile, persecution and oppression for
the children of Israel, before the Lord of Hosts would appear to
gather them from all the nations, to destroy the oppressors and
establish His Kingdom upon earth.</p>


<p id='3.65' data-ref='bne_en-p122'>
Christ said: <q class='jesus'>“Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I
came not to send peace, but a sword”</q> <span class='ref'>(Matt. x, 34)</span>, and He
predicted a period of wars and rumors of wars, of tribulations and
afflictions that would continue till the coming of the Son of Man <q class='jesus'>“in
the glory of the Father.”</q></p>


<p id='3.66' data-ref='bne_en-p123'>
Muḥammad declared that, because of their wrongdoings, Alláh had
put enmity and hatred among both Jews and Christians that would last
until the Day of Resurrection, when He would appear to judge them
all.<a data-fnid='10'></a></p>


<p id='3.67' data-ref='bne_en-p124'>
Bahá’u’lláh, on the other hand, announces that He is the
Promised One of all these Prophets — the Divine Manifestation in
Whose era the reign of peace will actually be established. This
statement is unprecedented and unique, yet it fits in wonderfully
with the signs of the times, and with the prophecies of all the great
Prophets. Bahá’u’lláh revealed with incomparable clearness and
comprehensiveness the means for bringing about peace and unity
amongst mankind.</p>


<p id='3.68' data-ref='bne_en-p125'>
It is true that, since the advent of Bahá’u’lláh, there have
been, until now, war and destruction on an unprecedented scale, but
this is just what all the prophets have said would happen at the dawn
of the <q class='bible'>“great and terrible Day of the Lord,”</q> and is, therefore,
but a confirmation of the view that the <q class='bible'>“Coming of the Lord”</q> is
not only at hand, but is already an accomplished fact. According to
the parable of Christ, the Lord of the Vineyard must miserably
destroy the wicked husbandmen before He gives the Vineyard to others
who will render Him the fruits in their seasons. Does not this mean
that at the coming of the Lord dire destruction awaits those despotic
governments, avaricious and intolerant priests, mullás, or
tyrannical leaders who through the centuries have, like wicked
husbandmen, misruled the earth and misappropriated its fruits?</p>


<p id='3.69' data-ref='bne_en-p126'>
There may be terrible events, and unparalleled calamities yet awhile
on the earth, but Bahá’u’lláh assures us that erelong, <q class='baha'>“these
fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the ‘Most
Great Peace’ shall come.”</q> War and strife have become so
intolerable in their destructiveness that mankind <i>must</i> find
deliverance from them or perish.</p>


<p id='3.70' data-ref='bne_en-p127'>
<q class='bible'>“The fullness of time”</q> has come and with it the Promised
Deliverer!</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_128'>His Writings</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.71' data-ref='bne_en-p128'>
The Writings of Bahá’u’lláh are most comprehensive in their
range, dealing with every phase of human life, individual and social,
with things material and things spiritual, with the interpretation of
ancient and modern scriptures, and with prophetic anticipations of
both the near and distant future.</p>


<p id='3.72' data-ref='bne_en-p129'>
The range and accuracy of His knowledge was amazing. He could quote
and expound the Scriptures of the various religions with which His
correspondents or questions were familiar, in convincing the
authoritative manner, although apparently He had never had the
ordinary means of access to many of the books referred to. He
declares, in <i>Epistle to the Son of the Wolf</i>, that He had never
read the Bayán, although in His own Writings He shows the most
perfect knowledge and understanding of the Báb’s Revelation. (The
Báb, as we have seen, declared that His Revelation, the Bayán, was
inspired by and emanated from <q class='bab'>“Him Whom God shall make Manifest”</q>!)
With the single exception of a visit from Professor Edward Granville
Browne, to whom in the year 1890 He accorded four interviews, each
lasting twenty to thirty minutes, He had no opportunities of
intercourse with enlightened Western thinkers, yet His Writings show
a complete grasp of the social, political and religious problems of
the Western World, and even His enemies had to admit that His wisdom
and knowledge were incomparable. The well-known circumstances of His
long imprisonment render it impossible to doubt that the wealth of
knowledge shown in His Writings must have been acquired from some
spiritual source, quite independent of the usual means of study or
instruction and the help of books or teachers.<a data-fnid='11'></a></p>


<p id='3.73' data-ref='bne_en-p130'>
Sometimes He wrote in modern Persian, the ordinary language of His
fellow countrymen, which is largely admixed with Arabic. At other
times, as when addressing learned Zoroastrians, He wrote in the
purest classical Persian. He also wrote with equal fluency in Arabic,
sometimes in very simple language, sometimes in classical style
somewhat similar to that of the Qur’án. His perfect mastery of
these different languages and styles was remarkable because of His
entire lack of literary education.</p>


<p id='3.74' data-ref='bne_en-p131'>
In some of His Writings the way of holiness is pointed out in such
simple terms that <q class='bible'>“the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err
therein”</q> <span class='ref'>(Isaiah xxxv, 8)</span>. In others there is a wealth of poetic
imagery, profound philosophy and allusions to Muḥammadan,
Zoroastrian and other scriptures, or to Persian and Arabic literature
and legends, such as only the poet, the philosopher or the scholar
can adequately appreciate. Still others deal with advanced stages of
the spiritual life and are to be understood only by those who have
already passed through the earlier stages. His works are like a
bountiful table provided with foods and delicacies suited to the
needs and tastes of all who are genuine truth seekers.</p>


<p id='3.75' data-ref='bne_en-p132'>
It is because of this that His Cause had effect among the learned and
cultured, spiritual poets and well-known writers. Even some of the
leaders of the Ṣúfís and of other sets, and some of the political
ministers who were writers, were attracted by His words, for they
exceeded those of all other writers in sweetness and depth of
spiritual meaning.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_133'>The Bahá’í Spirit</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='3.76' data-ref='bne_en-p133'>
From His place of confinement in distant ‘Akká, Bahá’u’lláh
stirred His native land of Persia to its depths; and not only Persia;
He stirred and is stirring the world. The spirit that animated Him
and His followers was unfailingly gentle, courteous and patient, yet
it was a force of astonishing vitality and transcendent power. It
achieved the seemingly impossible. It changed human nature. Men who
yielded to its influence became new creatures. They were filled with
a love, a faith, and enthusiasm, compared with which earthly joys and
sorrows were but as dust in the balance. They were ready to face
lifelong suffering or violent death with perfect equanimity, nay,
with radiant joy, in the strength of fearless dependence on God.</p>


<p id='3.77' data-ref='bne_en-p134'>
Most wonderful of all, their hearts were so brimming over with the
joy of a new life as to leave no room for thoughts of bitterness or
vindictiveness against their oppressors. They entirely abandoned the
use of violence in self-defense, and instead of bemoaning their fate,
they considered themselves the most fortunate of men in being
privileged to receive this new and glorious Revelation and to spend
their lives or shed their blood testifying to its truth. Well might
their hearts sing with joy, for they believed that God, the Supreme,
the Eternal, the Beloved, had spoken to them through human lips, had
called them to be His servants and friends, had come to establish His
Kingdom upon earth and to bring the priceless boon of Peace to a
warworn, strife-stricken world.</p>


<p id='3.78' data-ref='bne_en-p135'>
Such was the faith inspired by Bahá’u’lláh. He announced His
own mission, as the Báb had foretold that He would, and, thanks to
the devoted labors of His great Forerunner, there were thousands
ready to acclaim His Advent — thousands who had shaken off
superstitions and prejudices, and were waiting with pure hearts and
open minds for the Manifestation of God’s Promised Glory. Poverty
and chains, sordid circumstances and outward ignominy could not hide
from them the Spiritual Glory of their Lord — nay, these dark earthly
surroundings only served to enhance the brilliance of His real
Splendor.</p>

<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_137'>Birth and Childhood</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.2' data-ref='bne_en-p137'>
‘Abbás Effendi, Who afterwards assumed the title of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
(i.e. Servant of Bahá), was the eldest son of Bahá’u’lláh. He
was born in Ṭihrán before midnight on the eve of the 23rd of May,
1844,<a data-fnid='1'></a> the very same night in which the Báb
declared His mission.</p>


<p id='4.3' data-ref='bne_en-p138'>
He was nine years of age when His father, to Whom even then He was
devotedly attached, was thrown into the dungeon in Ṭihrán. A mob
sacked their house, and the family were stripped of their possessions
and left in destitution. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá tells how one day He was
allowed to enter the prison yard to see His beloved father when He
came out for His daily exercise. Bahá’u’lláh was terribly
altered, so ill He could hardly walk, His hair and beard unkempt, His
neck galled and swollen from the pressure of a heavy steel collar,
His body bent by the weight of His chains, and the sight made a
never-to-be-forgotten impression on the mind of the sensitive boy.</p>


<p id='4.4' data-ref='bne_en-p139'>
During the first year of their residence in Ba<u>gh</u>dád, ten
years before the open Declaration by Bahá’u’lláh of His
Mission, the keen insight of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who was then but nine
years of age, already led Him to the momentous discovery that His
father was indeed the Promised One Whose Manifestation all the Bábís
were awaiting. Some sixty years afterwards He thus described the
moment in which this conviction suddenly overwhelmed His whole
nature: — </p>

  <p id='4.5' data-ref='bne_en-p140' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>I am the servant of the Blessed Perfection. In Ba<u>gh</u>dád I was
    a child. Then and there He announced to me the Word, and I believed
    in Him. As soon as He proclaimed to me the Word, I threw myself at
    His Holy Feet and implored and supplicated Him to accept my blood as
    a sacrifice in His Pathway. Sacrifice! How sweet I find that word!
    There is no greater Bounty for me than this! What greater glory can I
    conceive than to see this neck chained for His sake, these feet
    fettered for His love, this body mutilated or thrown into the depths
    of the sea for His Cause! If in reality we are His sincere lovers — if
    in reality I am His sincere servant, then I must sacrifice my life,
    my all at His Blessed Threshold.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Diary of Mírzá Aḥmad Sohrab</i>, January 1914. </span></p>


<p id='4.6' data-ref='bne_en-p141'>
About this time He began to be called by His friends, <q class='baha'>“The Mystery
of God,”</q> a title given to Him by Bahá’u’lláh, by which He was
commonly known during the period of residence in Ba<u>gh</u>dád.</p>


<p id='4.7' data-ref='bne_en-p142'>
When His father went away for two years in the wilderness, ‘Abbás
was heartbroken. His chief consolation consisted in copying and
committing to memory the Tablets of the Báb, and much of His time
was spent in solitary meditation. When at last His father returned,
the boy was overwhelmed with joy.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_143'>Youth</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.8' data-ref='bne_en-p143'>
From that time onwards, He became His father’s closest companion
and, as it were, protector. Although a mere youth, He already showed
astonishing sagacity and discrimination, and undertook the task of
interviewing all the numerous visitors who came to see His father. If
He found they were genuine truth seekers, He admitted them to His
father’s presence, but otherwise He did not permit them to trouble
Bahá’u’lláh. On many occasions He helped His father in
answering the questions and solving the difficulties of these
visitors. For example, when one of the Ṣúfí leaders, named ‘Alí
<u>Sh</u>awkat Pá<u>sh</u>á, asked for an explanation of the
phrase: <q class='tradition'>“I was a Hidden Mystery,”</q> which occurs in a well-known
Muḥammadan tradition,<a data-fnid='2'></a> Bahá’u’lláh
turned to the <q class='baha'>“Mystery of God,”</q> ‘Abbás, and asked Him to write
the explanation. The boy, who was then about fifteen or sixteen years
of age, at once wrote an important epistle giving an exposition so
illuminating as to astonish the Pá<u>sh</u>á. This epistle is now
widely spread among the Bahá’ís, and is well known to many
outside the Bahá’í faith.</p>


<p id='4.9' data-ref='bne_en-p144'>
About this time ‘Abbás was a frequent visitor to the mosques,
where He would discuss theological matters with the doctors and
learned men. He never attended any school or college, His only
teacher being His father. His favorite recreation was horseback
riding, which He keenly enjoyed.</p>


<p id='4.10' data-ref='bne_en-p145'>
After Bahá’u’lláh’s Declaration in the Garden outside
Ba<u>gh</u>dád, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s devotion to His father became
greater than ever. On the long journey to Constantinople He guarded
Bahá’u’lláh night and day, riding by His wagon and watching
near His tent. As far as possible He relieved His father of all
domestic cares and responsibilities, becoming the mainstay and
comfort of the entire family.</p>


<p id='4.11' data-ref='bne_en-p146'>
During the years spent in Adrianople, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá endeared
Himself to everyone. He taught much, and became generally known as
the “Master.” At ‘Akká, when nearly all the party were ill
with typhoid, malaria, and dysentery, He washed the patients, nursed
them, fed them, watched with them, taking no rest, until utterly
exhausted, He Himself took dysentery, and for about a month remained
in a dangerous condition. In ‘Akká, as in Adrianople, all classes,
from the Governor to the most wretched beggar, learned to love and
respect Him.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_147'>Marriage</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.12' data-ref='bne_en-p147'>
The following particulars regarding the marriage of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
were kindly supplied to the writer by a Persian historian of the
Bahá’í Faith: — </p>

  <p id='4.13' data-ref='bne_en-p148' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>During the youth of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá the question of a suitable
    marriage for Him was naturally one of great interest to the
    believers, and many people came forward, wishing to have this crown
    of honor for their own family. For a long time, however, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
    showed no inclination for marriage, and no one understood the wisdom
    of this. Afterwards it became known that there was a girl who was
    destined to become the wife of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, one whose birth
    came about through the Blessing which the Báb gave to her parents in
    Iṣfahán. Her father was Mírzá Muḥammad ‘Alí, who was the
    uncle of the “King of Martyrs” and the “Beloved of Martyrs,”
    and she belonged to one of the great and noble families of Iṣfahán.
    When the Báb was in Iṣfahán, Mírzá Muḥammad ‘Alí had no
    children, but his wife was longing for a child. On hearing of this,
    the Báb gave him a portion of His food and told him to share it with
    his wife. After they had eaten of that food, it soon became apparent
    that their long-cherished hopes of parenthood were about to be
    fulfilled, and in due course a daughter was born to them, who was
    given the name of Munírih <u>Kh</u>ánum.<a data-fnid='3'></a>
    Later on a son was born, to whom they gave the name of Siyyid Yaḥyá,
    and afterwards they had some other children. After a time, Munírih’s
    father died, her cousins were martyred by Ẓillu’s-Sulṭán and
    the mullás, and the family fell into great troubles and bitter
    persecutions because of their being Bahá’ís. Bahá’u’lláh
    then permitted Munírih and her brother Siyyid Yaḥyá to come to
    ‘Akká for protection. Bahá’u’lláh and His wife, Navváb, the
    mother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, showed such kindness and favor to
    Munírih that others understood that they wished her to become the
    wife of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The wish of His father and mother became
    the wish of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, too. He had a warm feeling of love and
    affection for Munírih which was fully reciprocated, and erelong they
    became united in marriage.</q> </p>


  <p id='4.14' data-ref='bne_en-p149' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>The marriage proved exceedingly happy and harmonious. Of the children
    born to them four daughters have survived the rigors of their long
    imprisonment, and, through their beautiful lives of service, have
    endeared themselves to all who have been privileged to know them.</q> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_150'>Center of the Covenant</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.15' data-ref='bne_en-p150'>
Bahá’u’lláh indicated in many ways the ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was to
direct the Cause after His own ascension. Many years before His death
He declared this in a veiled manner in His <i>Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i>. He
referred to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on many occasions as <q class='baha'>“The Center of
My Covenant,”</q> <q class='baha'>“The Most Great Branch,”</q> <q class='baha'>“The Branch from the
Ancient Root.”</q> He habitually spoke of Him as <q class='baha'>“The Master”</q> and
required all His family to treat Him with marked deference; and in
His Will and Testament He left explicit instructions that all should
turn to Him and obey Him.</p>


<p id='4.16' data-ref='bne_en-p151'>
After the death of the “Blessed Beauty” (as Bahá’u’lláh was
generally called by His family and believers) ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
assumed the position which His father had clearly indicated for Him
as head of the Cause and authoritative Interpreter of the teachings,
but this was resented by certain of His relatives and others, who
became as bitterly opposed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as Ṣubḥ-i-Azal
had been to Bahá’u’lláh. They tried to stir up dissensions
among the believers, and, failing in that, proceeded to make various
false charges against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the Turkish Government.</p>


<p id='4.17' data-ref='bne_en-p152'>
In accordance with instructions received from His father,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was erecting a building on the side of Mount
Carmel, above Haifa, which was intended to be the permanent
resting-place of the remains of the Báb, and also to contain a
number of rooms for meetings and services. They represented to the
authorities that this building was intended as a fort, and that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His followers meant to entrench themselves
there, defy the Government, and endeavor to gain possession of the
neighboring region of Syria.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_153'>Strict Imprisonment Renewed</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.18' data-ref='bne_en-p153'>
In consequence of this and other equally unfounded charges, in 1901,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His family, who for more than twenty years had
been allowed the freedom of the country for some miles around ‘Akká,
were again, for over seven years, strictly confined within the walls
of the prison city. This did not prevent Him, however, from
effectively spreading the Bahá’í message through Asia, Europe and
America. Mr. Horace Holley writes of this period as follows: — </p>

  <p id='4.19' data-ref='bne_en-p154' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>To ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as a teacher and friend, came men and women
    from every race, religion and nation, to sit at his table like
    favored guests, questioning him about the social, spiritual or moral
    program each had most at heart; and after a stay lasting from a few
    hours to many months, returning home, inspired, renewed and
    enlightened. The world surely never possessed such a guest-house as
    this.</q> </p>


  <p id='4.20' data-ref='bne_en-p155' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>Within its doors the rigid castes of India melted away, the racial
    prejudice of Jew, Christian and Muḥammadan became less than a
    memory; and every convention save the essential law of warm hearts
    and aspiring minds broke down, banned and forbidden by the unifying
    sympathy of the master of the house. It was like a King Arthur and
    the Round Table … but an Arthur who knighted women as well as men,
    and sent them away not with the sword but with the Word.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>The Modern Social Religion</i>, Horace Holley. </span></p>


<p id='4.21' data-ref='bne_en-p156'>
During these years ‘Abdu’l-Bahá carried on an enormous
correspondence with believers and inquirers in all parts of the
world. In this work He was greatly assisted by His daughters and also
by several interpreters and secretaries.</p>


<p id='4.22' data-ref='bne_en-p157'>
Much of His time was spent in visiting the sick and the afflicted in
their own homes; and in the poorest quarters of ‘Akká no visitor
was more welcome than the “Master.” A pilgrim who visited ‘Akká
at this time writes: — </p>

  <p id='4.23' data-ref='bne_en-p158' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>It is the custom of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá each week, on Friday morning,
    to distribute alms to the poor. From his own scanty store he gives a
    little to each one of the needy who come to ask assistance. This
    morning about one hundred were ranged in line, seated and crouching
    upon the ground in the open street of the courts where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
    house stands. And such a nondescript collection of humanity they
    were. All kinds of men, women and children — poor, wretched, hopeless
    in aspect, half-clothed, many of them crippled and blind, beggars
    indeed, poor beyond expression — waiting expectant — until from the
    doorway came ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.… Quickly moving from one to
    another, stopping sometimes to leave a word of sympathy and
    encouragement, dropping small coins into each eager outstretched
    palm, touching the face of a child, taking the hand of an old woman
    who held fast to the hem of his garment as he passed along, speaking
    words of light to old men with sightless eyes, inquiring after those
    too feeble and wretched to come for their pittance of help, and
    sending them their portion with a message of love and
    uplift.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Glimpses of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá</i>, M. J. M. </span></p>


<p id='4.24' data-ref='bne_en-p159'>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s personal wants were few. He worked late and
early. Two simple meals a day sufficed Him. His wardrobe consisted of
a very few garments of inexpensive material. He could not bear to
live in luxury while others were in want.</p>


<p id='4.25' data-ref='bne_en-p160'>
He had a great love for children, for flowers, and for the beauties
of nature. Every morning about six or seven, the family party used to
gather to partake of the morning tea together, and while the Master
sipped His tea, the little children of the household chanted prayers.
Mr. Thornton Chase writes of these children

  <p id='4.26' class='blockquote'>
     “Such children I
    have never seen, so courteous, unselfish, thoughtful for others,
    unobtrusive, intelligent, and swiftly self-denying in the little
    things that children love.…”
     <span class='block reference'> — <i>In Galilee</i>.</span></p>


<p id='4.27' data-ref='bne_en-p161'>
The “ministry of flowers” was a feature of the life at ‘Akká,
of which every pilgrim brought away fragrant memories. Mrs. Lucas

Mr. Thornton Chase sums up his impression of the prison life at ‘Akká
as follows: — </p>

  <p id='4.31' data-ref='bne_en-p164' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>Five days we remained within those walls, prisoners with Him who
    dwells in that <q class='baha'>“Greatest Prison.”<q> It is a prison of peace, of
    love and service. No wish, no desire is there save the good of
    mankind, the peace of the world, the acknowledgement of the
    Fatherhood of God and the mutual rights of men as His creatures, His
    children. Indeed, the real prison, the suffocating atmosphere, the
    separation from all true heart desires, the bond of world conditions,
    is outside of those stone walls, while within them is the freedom and
    pure aura of the Spirit of God. All troubles, tumults, worries or
    anxieties for worldly things are barred out there.</q>

<p id='4.32' data-ref='bne_en-p165'>
To most people the hardships of prison life would appear as grievous
calamities, but for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá they had no terrors. When in
prison He wrote: — </p>

  <p id='4.33' data-ref='bne_en-p166' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Grieve not because of my imprisonment and calamity; for this prison
    is my beautiful garden, my mansioned paradise and my throne of

    which I glory among the righteous.</q> </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_168'>Turkish Commissions of Investigation</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.35' data-ref='bne_en-p168'>
In 1904 and 1907 commissions were appointed by the Turkish Government
to inquire into the charges against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and lying
witnesses gave evidence against Him. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, while
refuting the charges, expressed His entire readiness to submit to any
sentence the tribunal chose to impose. He declared that if they
should throw Him into jail, drag Him through the streets, curse Him,
spit upon Him, stone Him, heap upon Him all sort of ignominy, hang
Him or shoot Him, He would still be happy.</p>


<p id='4.36' data-ref='bne_en-p169'>
Between the sittings of the Commissions of Investigation He pursued
His ordinary life with the utmost serenity, planting fruit trees in a
garden and presiding at a marriage feast with the dignity and
radiance of spiritual freedom. The Spanish Consul offered to provide
Him a safe passage to any foreign port He cared to select, but this
offer He gratefully but firmly refused, saying that whatever the
consequences, He must follow in the footsteps of the Báb and the
Blessed Perfection, Who never tried to save Themselves or run away
from Their enemies. He encouraged most of the Bahá’ís, however,
to leave the neighborhood of ‘Akká, which had become very
dangerous for them, and remained alone, with a few of the faithful,
to await His destiny.</p>


<p id='4.37' data-ref='bne_en-p170'>
The four corrupt officials who constituted the last investigating
commission arrived in ‘Akká in the early part of the winter of
1907, stayed one month, and departed for Constantinople, after
finishing their so called “investigation,” prepared to report
that the charges against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had been substantiated and
to recommend His exile or execution. No sooner had they got back to
Turkey, however, than the Revolution broke out there and the four
commissioners, who belonged to the old regime, had to flee for their
lives. The Young Turks established their supremacy, and all political
and religious prisoners in the Ottoman Empire were set free. In
September 1908 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was released from prison, and in the
following year ‘Abdu’l-Ẓamíd, the Sulṭán, became himself a
prisoner.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_171'>Western Tours</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.38' data-ref='bne_en-p171'>
After His release, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá continued the same holy life of
ceaseless activity in teaching, correspondence, ministering to the
poor and the sick, with merely the change from ‘Akká to Haifa and
from Haifa to Alexandria, until August 1911, when He started on His
first visit to the Western world. During His tours in the West,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá met men of every shade of opinion and amply
fulfilled the command of Bahá’u’lláh to <q class='baha'>“Consort with all the
people with joy and fragrance.”</q> He reached London early in
September 1911, and spent a month there, during which, besides daily
talks with inquirers and many other activities, He addressed the
congregations of the Rev. R. J. Campbell at the City Temple, and of
Archdeacon Wilberforce at St. John’s, Westminster, and breakfasted
with the Lord Mayor. He then proceeded to Paris, where His time was
occupied in giving daily addresses and talks to eager listeners of
many nationalities and types. In December He returned to Egypt, and
next spring, in response to the earnest entreaty of the American
friends, He proceeded to the United States, arriving in New York in
April 1912. During the next nine months He traveled through America,
from coast to coast, addressing all sorts and conditions of
men — university students, Socialists, Mormons, Jews, Christians,
Agnostics, Esperantists, Peace Societies, New Thought Clubs, Women’s
Suffrage Societies, and speaking in churches of almost every
denomination, in each case giving addresses suited to the audience
and the occasion. On December 5 He sailed for Great Britain, where He
passed six weeks, visiting Liverpool, London, Bristol and Edinburgh.
In Edinburgh He gave a notable address to the Esperanto Society, in
which He announced that He had encouraged the Bahá’ís of the East
to study Esperanto in order to further better understanding between
the East and the West. After two months in Paris, spent as before in
daily interviews and conference, He proceeded to Stuttgart, where He
held a series of very successful meetings with the German Bahá’ís;
thence to Budapest and Vienna, founding new groups in these places,
returning, in May 1913, to Egypt, and on December 5, 1913, to Haifa.</p>

<p id='4.39' data-ref='bne_en-p172'>
He was then in His seventieth year, and His long and arduous labors,
culminating in these strenuous Western tours, had worn out His
physical frame. After His return He wrote the following pathetic
Tablet to the believers in East and West: — </p>

  <p id='4.40' data-ref='bne_en-p173' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Friends, the time is coming when I shall be no longer with you. I
    have done all that could be done. I have served the Cause of

    <q class='abd'>Oh, how I yearn to see the friends united, even as a shining strand

<p id='4.48' data-ref='bne_en-p181'>
The enemies of the Bahá’í Cause, whose hopes had risen high when
the Báb fell a victim to their fury, when Bahá’u’lláh was
driven from His native land and made a prisoner for life, and again
at the passing of Bahá’u’lláh — these enemies once more took
heart when they saw the physical weakness and weariness of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá after His return from His Western travels. But
again their hopes were doomed to disappointment. In a short time
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was able to write: — </p>

  <p id='4.49' data-ref='bne_en-p182' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Unquestionably this physical body and human energy would have been
    unable to stand the constant wear and tear … but the aid and help
    of the Desired One were the Guardian and Protector of the weak and
    humble ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.… Some have asserted that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
    is on the eve of bidding his last farewell to the world, that his
    physical energies are depleted and drained and that ere long these
    complications will put an end to his life. This is far from the
    truth. Although in the outward estimation of the Covenant-breakers
    and defective-minded the body is weak on account of ordeals in the
    Blessed Path, yet, Praise be to God! through the providence of the
    Blessed Perfection the spiritual forces are in the utmost
    rejuvenation and strength. Thanks be to God that now, through the
    blessing and benediction of Bahá’u’lláh, even the physical
    energies are fully restored, divine joy is obtained, the supreme
    glad-tidings are resplendent and ideal happiness overflowing.</q> </p>


<p id='4.50' data-ref='bne_en-p183'>
Both during the European War and after its close ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
amidst countless other activities, was able to pour forth a series of
great and inspiring letters which, when communications were reopened,
roused believers throughout the world to new enthusiasm and zeal for
service. Under the inspiration of these letters the Cause progressed
by leaps and bounds and everywhere the Faith showed signs of new
vitality and vigor.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_184'>War Time at Haifa</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.51' data-ref='bne_en-p184'>
A remarkable instance of the foresight of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
supplied during the months immediately preceding the war. During
peacetimes there was usually a large number of pilgrims at Haifa,
from Persia and other regions of the globe. About six months before
the outbreak of war one of the old Bahá’ís living at Haifa
presented a request from several believers of Persia for permission
to visit the Master. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá did not grant the permission,
and from that time onwards gradually dismissed the pilgrims who were
at Haifa, so that by the end of July 1914 none remained. When, in the
first days of August the sudden outbreak of the Great War startled
the world, the wisdom of His precaution became apparent.</p>


<p id='4.52' data-ref='bne_en-p185'>
When the war broke out, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who had already spent
fifty-five years of His life in exile and prison, became again
virtually a prisoner of the Turkish Government. Communication with
friends and believers outside Syria was almost completely cut off,
and He and His little band of followers were again subjected to
straitened circumstances, scarcity of food and great personal danger
and inconvenience.</p>


<p id='4.53' data-ref='bne_en-p186'>
During the war ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had a busy time in ministering to
the material and spiritual wants of the people about Him. He
personally organized extensive agricultural operations near Tiberias,
thus securing a great supply of wheat, by means of which famine was
averted, not only for the Bahá’ís but for hundreds of the poor of
all religions in Haifa and ‘Akká, whose wants He liberally
supplied. He took care of all, and mitigated their sufferings as far
as possible. To hundreds of poor people He would give a small sum of
money daily. In addition to money He gave bread. If there was no
bread He would give dates or something else. He made frequent visits
to ‘Akká to comfort and help the believers and poor people there.
During the time of war He had daily meetings of the believers, and
through His help the friends remained happy and tranquil throughout
those troublous years.</p>

<p id='4.54' data-ref='bne_en-p187'>
Great was the rejoicing in Haifa when, on the 23rd day of September,
1918, at 3 P.M., after some twenty-four hours’ fighting, the city
was taken by British and Indian cavalry, and the horrors of war
conditions under the Turkish rule came to an end.</p>


<p id='4.55' data-ref='bne_en-p188'>
From the beginning of the British occupation, large numbers of
soldiers and Government officials of all ranks, even the highest,
sought interviews with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, delighting in His
illuminating talks, His breadth of view and depth of insight, His
dignified courtesy and genial hospitality. So profoundly impressed
were the Government representatives by His noble character and His
great work in the interests of peace conciliation, and the true
prosperity of the people, that a knighthood of the British Empire was
conferred on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the ceremony taking place in the
garden of the Military Governor of Haifa on the 27th day of April,
1920.</p>







<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_189'>Last Years</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.56' data-ref='bne_en-p189'>
During the winter of 1919–1920 the writer had the great privilege
of spending two and half months as the guest of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at
Haifa and intimately observing His daily life. At that time, although
nearly seventy-six years of age, He was still remarkably vigorous,
and accomplished daily an almost incredible amount of work. Although
often very weary He showed wonderful powers of recuperation, and His
services were always at the disposal of those who needed them most.
His unfailing patience, gentleness, kindliness and tact made His
presence like a benediction. It was His custom to spend a large part
of each night in prayer and meditation. From early morning until
evening, except for a short siesta after lunch, He was busily engaged
in reading and answering letters from many lands and in attending to
the multitudinous affairs of the household and of the Cause. In the
afternoon He usually had a little relaxation in the form of a walk or
a drive, but even then He was usually accompanied by one or two, or a
party, of pilgrims with whom He would converse on spiritual matters,
or He would find opportunity by the way of seeing and ministering to
some of the poor. After His return He would call the friends to the
usual evening meeting in His salon. Both at lunch and supper He used
to entertain a number of pilgrims and friends, and charm His guests
with happy and humorous stories as well as precious talks on a great
variety of subjects. <q class='abd'>“My home is the home of laughter and mirth,”</q>
He declared, and indeed it was so. He delighted in gathering together
people of various races, colors, nations and religions in unity and
cordial friendship around His hospitable board. He was indeed a
loving father not only to the little community at Haifa, but to the
Bahá’í community throughout the world.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_190'>The Passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.57' data-ref='bne_en-p190'>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s manifold activities continued with little
abatement despite increasing bodily weakness and weariness up till
the last day or two of His life. On Friday, November 25, 1921, He
attended the noonday prayer at the Mosque in Haifa, and afterwards
distributed alms to the poor with His own hands, as was His wont.
After lunch He dictated some letters. When He had rested He walked in
the garden and had a talk with the gardener. In the evening He gave
His blessing and counsel to a loved and faithful servant of the
household who had been married that day, and afterwards He attended
the usual meeting of the friends in His own salon. Less than three
days later, about 1:30 A.M. on Monday, November 28, He passed away so
peacefully that, to the two daughters watching by His bedside, it
seemed as if He had gone quietly to sleep.</p>


<p id='4.58' data-ref='bne_en-p191'>
The sad news soon spread throughout the town and was flashed over the
wires to all parts of the world. The next morning (Tuesday, November
29) the funeral took place:</p>


<p id='4.59' data-ref='bne_en-p192'>
… a funeral the like of which Haifa, nay Palestine itself, had
surely never seen … so deep was the feeling that brought so many
thousands of mourners together, representative of so many religions,
races and tongues.</p>


<p id='4.60' data-ref='bne_en-p193'>
The High Commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel, the Governor of Jerusalem,
the Governor of Phoenicia, the Chief Officials of the Government, the
Consuls of the various countries, resident in Haifa, the heads of the
various religious communities, the notables of Palestine, Jews,
Christians, Moslems, Druses, Egyptians, Greeks, Turks, Kurds, and a
host of his American, European and native friends, men, women and
children, both of high and low degree … all, about ten thousand in
number, mourning the loss of their Beloved One.… </p>



<p id='4.61' data-ref='bne_en-p194'>
“O God, my God!” the people wailed with one accord, “Our father
has left us, our father has left us!”</p>


<p id='4.62' data-ref='bne_en-p195'>
… they slowly wended their way up Mount Carmel, the Vineyard of
God.… After two hours’ walking, they reached the garden of the
Tomb of the Báb.… As the vast concourse pressed round …
representatives of the various denominations, Moslems, Christians and
Jews, all hearts being ablaze with fervent love of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
some on the impulse of the moment, others prepared, raised their
voices in eulogy and regret, paying their last homage of farewell to
their loved one. So united were they in their acclamation of him, as
the wise educator and reconciler of the human race in this perplexed
and sorrowful age, that there seemed to be nothing left for the
Bahá’ís to say. — <span class='ref'><i>The Passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá</i>, by
Lady Blomfield and Shoghi Effendi.</span></p>


<p id='4.63' data-ref='bne_en-p196'>
Nine speakers, all of them prominent representatives of the Muslim,
Christian and Jewish communities, bore eloquent and moving witness to
their love and admiration of the pure and noble life which had just
drawn to its close. Then the casket was slowly passed to its simple
and hallowed resting-place.</p>


<p id='4.64' data-ref='bne_en-p197'>
Surely here was a fitting tribute to the memory of One Who had
labored all His life for unity of religions, of races, of tongues — a
tribute, and also a proof, that His lifework had not been in vain,
that the ideals of Bahá’u’lláh, which were His inspiration,
nay, His very life, were already beginning to permeate the world and
to break down the barriers of sect and caste that for centuries had
alienated Muslim, Christian, Jew, and the other diverse factions into
which the human family has been riven.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_198'>Writings and Addresses</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.65' data-ref='bne_en-p198'>
The Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are very numerous and are mostly in
the form of letters to believers and inquirers. A great many of His
talks and addresses have also been recorded and many have been
published. Of the thousands of pilgrims who have visited Him at ‘Akká
and Haifa a large number have written descriptions of their
impressions, and many of these records are now available in printed
form.</p>


<p id='4.66' data-ref='bne_en-p199'>
His teachings are thus very completely preserved, and they cover a
very wide range of subjects. With many of the problems of both East
and West He dealt more fully than His Father had done, giving more
detailed applications of the general principles laid down by
Bahá’u’lláh. A number of His Writings have not yet been
translated into any Western language but enough is already available
to give deep and full knowledge of the more important principles of
His teaching.</p>


<p id='4.67' data-ref='bne_en-p200'>
He spoke Persian, Arabic and Turkish. In His Western tours His talks
and addresses were always interpreted, obviously losing much of their
beauty, eloquence and force in the process, yet such was the power of
the Spirit which accompanied His words that all who heard Him were
impressed.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_201'>Station of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='4.68' data-ref='bne_en-p201'>
The unique station assigned to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá by the Blessed
Perfection is indicated in the following passage written by the
latter: — </p>

  <p id='4.69' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of
    My Revelation is ended, turn your faces towards Him Whom God hath
    purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root.”</q> </p>

<p id='4.70' class='noid'>And again: — </p>

  <p id='4.71' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“… refer ye whatsoever ye understand not in the Book to Him Who hath
    branched from this mighty Stock.”</q>

<p id='4.72' class='noid'>‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself wrote the following: — </p>

  <p id='4.73' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>“In accordance with the explicit text of the
    Kitáb-i-Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh hath made the Center of the Covenant
    the Interpreter of His Word — a Covenant so firm and mighty that from
    the beginning of time until the present day no religious Dispensation
    hath produced its like.”</q></p>


<p id='4.74' data-ref='bne_en-p202'>
The very completeness of the servitude with which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
promulgated the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in East and West resulted
at times in a confusion of belief concerning His station on the part
of believers. Realizing the purity of the spirit animating His word
and deed, surrounded by religious influences marking the breakdown of
their traditional doctrines, a number of Bahá’ís felt that they
honored ‘Abdu’l-Bahá by likening Him to a Manifestation, or
hailing Him as the “return of Christ.” Nothing caused Him such
intense grief as this failure to perceive that His capacity to serve
Bahá’u’lláh proceeded from the purity of the mirror turned to
the Sun of Truth, and not from the Sun itself.</p>


<p id='4.75' data-ref='bne_en-p203'>
Moreover, unlike previous Dispensations, the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
had within it the potency of a universal human society. During
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s mission covering the period 1892 to 1921, the
Faith evolved through successive stages of development in the
direction of a true world order. Its development required continuous
direction and specific instruction from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who alone
knew the fullness of that new potent inspiration brought to earth in
this age. Until His own Will and Testament was revealed after
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s departure from the flesh, and its significance
was expounded by Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Faith, the
Bahá’ís almost inevitably attributed their beloved Master’s
guidance a degree of spiritual authority equaling that of the
Manifestation.</p>


<p id='4.76' data-ref='bne_en-p204'>
The effects of such naive enthusiasm are no longer felt within the
Bahá’í community, but with a sounder realization of the mystery
of that incomparable devotion and servitude, the Bahá’ís can
today all the more consciously appreciate the unique character of the
mission which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá fulfilled. The Faith which in 1892
seemed so weak and helpless in the physical exile and imprisonment of
its Exemplar and Interpreter, has since, with irresistible power,
raised up communities in many countries,<a data-fnid='4'></a>
and challenges the weakness of a decaying civilization with a body of
teachings that alone reveal the future of a despairing humanity.</p>


<p id='4.77' data-ref='bne_en-p205'>
The Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá itself set forth with
complete clarity the mystery of the stations of the Báb and of
Bahá’u’lláh, and His own mission: — </p>

  <p id='4.78' data-ref='bne_en-p206' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>This is the foundation of the belief of the people of Bahá (may my
    life be offered up for them): “His Holiness, the Exalted One (the
    Báb), is the Manifestation of the Unity and Oneness of God and the
    Forerunner of the Ancient Beauty. His Holiness the Abhá Beauty (may
    my life be a sacrifice for His steadfast friends) is the Supreme
    Manifestation of God and the Dayspring of His Most Divine Essence.
    All others are servants unto Him and do His bidding.”</q> </p>


<p id='4.79' data-ref='bne_en-p207'>
By this statement, and by numerous others in which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
emphasized the importance of basing one’s knowledge of the Faith
upon His <i>general</i> Tablets, a foundation for unity of belief was
established, with the result that the differences of understanding
caused by reference to His Tablets to individuals, in which the
Master answered personal questions, rapidly disappeared. Above all,
the establishment of a definite administrative order, with the
Guardian at its head, transferred to institutions all authority
previously wielded in the form of prestige and influence by
individual Bahá’ís in the various local groups.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_208'>Exemplar of Bahá’í Life</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->






<p id='4.80' data-ref='bne_en-p208'>
Bahá’u’lláh was preeminently the Revealer of the Word. His
forty years’ imprisonment gave Him but limited opportunities of
intercourse with His fellowmen. To ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, therefore, fell
the important task of becoming the exponent of the Revelation, the
Doer of the Word, the Great Exemplar of the Bahá’í life in actual
contact with the world of today, in the most diverse phases of its
myriad activities. He showed that it is still possible, amid the
whirl and rush of modern life, amid the self-love and struggle for
material prosperity that everywhere prevail, to live the life of
entire devotion to God and to the service of one’s fellows, which
Christ and Bahá’u’lláh and all the Prophets have demanded of
men. Through trial and vicissitudes, calumnies, and treachery on the
one hand, and through love and praise, devotion and veneration on the
other, He stood like a lighthouse founded on a rock, around which
wintry tempests rage and the summer ocean plays, His poise and
serenity remaining ever steadfast and unshaken. He lived the life of
faith, and calls on His followers to live it here and now. He raised
amid a warring world the Banner of Unity and Peace, the Standard of a
New Era, and He assures those who rally to its support that they
shall be inspired by the Spirit of the New Day. It is the same Holy
Spirit which inspired the Prophets and Saints of old, but it is a new
outpouring of that Spirit, suited to the needs of the new time.</p>

  <p id='5.1' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Man must show forth fruits. A fruitless man, in the words of His
    Holiness the Spirit [Jesus], is like a fruitless tree, and a
    fruitless tree is fit for fire.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> — Bahá’u’lláh, <i>Words of Paradise</i>. </span> </p>

<p id='5.2' data-ref='bne_en-p210'>
Herbert Spencer once remarked that by no political alchemy is it
possible to get golden conduct out of leaden instincts, and it is
equally true that by no political alchemy is it possible to make a
golden society out of leaden individuals. Bahá’u’lláh, like all
previous Prophets, proclaimed this truth and taught that in order to
establish the Kingdom of God in the world, it must first be
established in the hearts of men. In examining the Bahá’í
teachings, therefore, we shall commence with the instructions of
Bahá’u’lláh for individual conduct, and try to form a clear
picture of what it means to be a Bahá’í.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_211'>Living the Life</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='5.3' data-ref='bne_en-p211'>
When asked on one occasion: “What is a Bahá’í?” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
replied: <q class='abd'>“To be a Bahá’í simply means to love all the world; to
love humanity and try to serve it; to work for universal peace and
universal brotherhood.”</q> On another occasion He defined a Bahá’í
as <q class='abd'>“one endowed with all the perfections of man in activity.”</q> In
one of His London talks He said that a man may be a Bahá’í even
if He has never heard the name of Bahá’u’lláh. He added: — </p>

  <p id='5.4' data-ref='bne_en-p212' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The man who lives the life according to the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
    is already a Bahá’í. On the other hand, a man may call himself a
    Bahá’í for fifty years, and if he does not live the life he is
    not a Bahá’í. An ugly man may call himself handsome, but he
    deceives no one, and a black man may call himself white, yet he
    deceives no one, not even himself.</q> </p>


<p id='5.5' data-ref='bne_en-p212a'>
One who does not know God’s Messengers, however, is like a plant
growing in the shade. Although it knows not the sun, it is,
nevertheless, absolutely dependent on it. The great Prophets are
spiritual suns, and Bahá’u’lláh is the sun of this “day” in
which we live. The suns of former days have warmed and vivified the
world, and had those suns not shone, the earth would not be cold and
dead, but it is the sunshine of today that alone can ripen the fruits
which the suns of former days have kissed into life.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_213'>Devotion to God</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='5.6' data-ref='bne_en-p213'>
In order to attain to the Bahá’í life <i>in all its fullness</i>,
conscious and direct relations with Bahá’u’lláh are as
necessary as is sunshine for the unfolding of the lily or the rose.
The Bahá’í worships not the human personality of Bahá’u’lláh,
but the Glory of God manifest through that personality. He reverences
Christ and Muḥammad and all God’s former Messengers to mankind,
but he recognizes Bahá’u’lláh as the bearer of God’s Message
for the new age in which we live, as the Great World teacher Who has
come to carry on and consummate the work of His predecessors.</p>


<p id='5.7' data-ref='bne_en-p214'>
Intellectual assent to a creed does not make a man a Bahá’í, nor
does outward rectitude of conduct. Bahá’u’lláh requires of His
followers wholehearted and complete devotion. God alone has the right
to make such a demand, but Bahá’u’lláh speaks as the
Manifestation of God, and the Revealer of His Will. Previous
Manifestations have been equally clear on this point. Christ said:
<q class='jesus'>“If any man come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
cross daily, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall
lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall
save it.”</q> In different words, all the Divine Manifestations have
made this same demand from Their followers, and the history of
religion shows clearly that as long as the demand has been frankly
recognized and accepted, religion has flourished, despite all earthly
opposition, despite affliction, persecution and martyrdom of the
believers. On the other hand, whenever compromise has crept in, and
“respectability” has taken the place of complete consecration,
then religion has decayed. It has become fashionable, but it has lost
its power to save and transform, its power to work miracles. True
religion has never yet been fashionable. God grant that one day it
may become so; but it is still true, as in the days of Christ, that
<q class='jesus'>“strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto
life, and few there be that find it.”</q> The gateway of spiritual
birth, like the gateway of natural birth, admits men only one by one,
and without encumbrances. If, in the future, more people succeed in
entering that way than in the past, it will not be because of any
widening of the gate, but because of a greater disposition on the
part of men to make the “great surrender” which God demands;
because long and bitter experience has at last brought them to see
the folly of choosing their own way instead of God’s way.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_215'>Search After Truth</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='5.8' data-ref='bne_en-p215'>
Bahá’u’lláh enjoins justice on all His followers and defines it
as: —

  <p id='5.9' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“The freedom of man from superstition and imitation, so that
    he may discern the Manifestations of God with the eyes of Oneness,
    and consider all affairs with keen sight.”</q>
     <span class='block reference'> — <i>Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh</i>, Words of Wisdom.</span></p>


<p id='5.10' data-ref='bne_en-p216'>
It is necessary that each individual should see and realize for
himself the Glory of God manifest in the human temple of Bahá’u’lláh,
otherwise the Bahá’í Faith would be for him but a name without
meaning. The call of the Prophets to mankind has always been that men
should open their eyes, not shut them, use their reason, not suppress
it. It is clear seeing and free thinking, not servile credulity, that
will enable them to penetrate the clouds of prejudice, to shake off
the fetters of blind imitation, and attain to the realization of the
truth of a new Revelation.</p>


<p id='5.11' data-ref='bne_en-p217'>
He who would be a Bahá’í needs to be a fearless seeker after
truth, but he should not confine his search to the material plane.
His spiritual perceptive powers should be awake as well as his
physical. He should use all the faculties God has given him for the
acquisition of truth, believing nothing without valid and sufficient
reason. If his heart is pure, and his mind free from prejudice, the
earnest seeker will not fail to recognize the Divine Glory in
whatsoever temple it may become manifest. Bahá’u’lláh further
declares: — </p>

  <p id='5.12' data-ref='bne_en-p218' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Man should know his own self, and know those things that lead to
    loftiness or to baseness, to shame or to honor, to wealth or to
    poverty.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh</i>, Tablet of Ṭarázát. </span></p>


<p id='5.13' data-ref='bne_en-p219'>
The source of all learning is the knowledge of God, exalted be His
Glory! and this cannot be attained save through the knowledge of His
divine Manifestation. — <span class='ref'><i>Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh</i>, Words of
Wisdom.</span></p>


<p id='5.14' data-ref='bne_en-p220'>
The Manifestation is the Perfect Man, the great Exemplar for Mankind,
the First Fruit of the tree of humanity. Until we know Him we do not
know the latent possibilities within ourselves. Christ tells us to
consider the lilies how they grow, and declares that Solomon in all
his glory was not arrayed like one of these. The lily grows from a
very unattractive-looking bulb. If we had never seen a lily in bloom,
never gazed on its matchless grace of foliage and flower, how could
we know the reality contained in that bulb? We might dissect it most
carefully and examine it most minutely, but we should never discover
the dormant beauty which the gardener knows how to awaken. So until
we have seen the Glory of God revealed in the Manifestation, we can
have no idea of the spiritual beauty latent in our own nature and in
that of our fellows. By knowing and loving the Manifestation of God
and following His teachings we are enabled, little by little, to
realize the potential perfections within ourselves; then, and not
till then, does the meaning and purpose of life and of the universe
become apparent to us.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_221'>Love of God</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='5.15' data-ref='bne_en-p221'>
To know the Manifestation of God means also to love Him. One is
impossible without the other. According to Bahá’u’lláh, the
purpose of man’s creation is that he may know God and adore Him. He
says in one of His Tablets: — </p>

  <p id='5.16' data-ref='bne_en-p222' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>The cause of the creation of all contingent beings has been love, as
    it is said in the well-known tradition, “I was a hidden treasure
    and I loved to be known. Therefore I created the creation in order to
    be known.”</q> </p>


<p id='5.17' data-ref='bne_en-p223' class='noid'>And in the <i>Hidden Words</i> He says: — </p>

  <p id='5.18' data-ref='bne_en-p224' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O Son of Being!<br/>
    Love Me, that I may love thee. If thou lovest Me
    not, My love can in no wise reach thee. Know this, O servant.</q> </p>


  <p id='5.19' data-ref='bne_en-p225' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O Son of the Wondrous Vision!<br/>
    I have breathed within thee a
    breath of My own Spirit, that thou mayest be My lover. Why hast thou
    forsaken Me and sought a beloved other than Me?</q> </p>


<p id='5.20' data-ref='bne_en-p226'>
To be God’s lover! That is the sole object of life for the Bahá’í.
To have God as his closest companion and most intimate friend, his
Peerless Beloved, in Whose Presence is fullness of joy! And to love
God means to love everything and everybody, for all are of God. The
real Bahá’í will be the perfect lover. He will love everyone with
a pure heart, fervently. He will hate no one. He will despise no one,
for he will have learned to see the Face of the Beloved in every
face, and to find His traces everywhere. His love will know no limit
of sect, nation, class or race. Bahá’u’lláh says: —

 <p id='5.21' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“Of old
    it hath been revealed: ‘Love of one’s country is an element of
    the Faith of God.’ The Tongue of Grandeur hath … in the day of
    His manifestation proclaimed: ‘It is not his to boast who loveth
    his country, but it is his who loveth the world.’”</q>
     <span class='block reference'>— Tablet of the World.</span></p>

<p id='5.22' class='noid'>And again: —  </p>

 <p id='5.23' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“Blessed is he who prefers his brother
    before himself; such an one is of the people of Bahá.” </q>
     <span class='block reference'>— <i>Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh</i>, Words of Paradise.</span></p>


<p id='5.24' data-ref='bne_en-p227'>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá tells us we must be <q class='abd'>“as one soul in many bodies,
for the more we love each other, the nearer we shall be to God.”</q> To
an American audience He said: — </p>

  <p id='5.25' data-ref='bne_en-p228' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Likewise the divine religions of the holy Manifestations of God are
    in reality one though in name and nomenclature they differ. Man must
    be a lover of the light no matter from what dayspring it may appear.
    He must be a lover of the rose no matter what soil it may be growing.
    He must be a seeker of the truth no matter from what source it come.
    Attachment to the lantern is not loving the light. Attachment to the
    earth is not befitting but enjoyment of the rose which develops from
    the soil is worthy. Devotion to the tree is profitless but partaking
    of the fruit is beneficial. Luscious fruits no matter upon what tree
    they grow or where they may be found must be enjoyed. The word of
    truth no matter which tongue utters it must be sanctioned. Absolute
    verities no matter in what book they be recorded must be accepted. If
    we harbor prejudice it will be the cause of deprivation and
    ignorance. The strife between religions, nations and races arises
    from misunderstanding. If we investigate the religions to discover
    the principles underlying their foundations we will find they agree,
    for the fundamental reality of them is one and not multiple. By this
    means the religionists of the world will reach their point of unity
    and reconciliation.</q> </p>

<p class='par' id='5.26' data-ref='bne_en-p229'> Again He says: —  </div>

  <p class='par' id='5.27'  class='blockquote'>
    Every soul of the beloved ones must love the others and withhold not
    his possessions and life from them, and by all means he must endeavor
    to make the other joyous and happy. But these others must also be
    disinterested and self-sacrificing. Thus may this Sunrise flood the
    horizons, this Melody gladden and make happy all the people, this
    divine Remedy become the panacea for every disease, this Spirit of
    Truth become the cause of life for every soul.</p>









<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_231'>Severance</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='5.28' data-ref='bne_en-p231'>
Devotion to God implies also severance from everything that is not of
God, severance, that is, from all selfish and worldly, and even
other-worldly desires. The path of God may lie through riches or
poverty, health or sickness, through palace or dungeon, rose garden
or torture chamber. Whichever it be, the Bahá’í will learn to
accept his lot with <q class='baha'>“radiant acquiescence.”</q> Severance does not
mean stolid indifference to one’s surroundings or passive
resignation to evil conditions; nor does it mean despising the good
things which God has created. The true Bahá’í will not be
callous, nor apathetic nor ascetic. He will find abundant interest,
abundant work and abundant joy in the Path of God, but he will not
deviate one hair’s breadth from that path in pursuit of pleasure
nor hanker after anything that God has denied him. When a man becomes
a Bahá’í, God’s Will becomes his will, for to be at variance
with God is the one thing he cannot endure. In the path of God no
errors can appall, no troubles dismay him. The light of love
irradiates his darkest days, transmutes suffering into joy, and
martyrdom itself into an ecstasy of bliss. Life is lifted to the
heroic plane and death becomes a glad adventure. Bahá’u’lláh
says: — </p>

  <p id='5.29' data-ref='bne_en-p232' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Whoso cherisheth in his heart the love of anyone beside Me, be it to
    the extent of a grain of mustard seed, shall be unable to gain
    admittance into My Kingdom.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>The Summons of the Lord of Hosts</i>, Súriy-i-Haykal </span></p>


    <p id='5.30' data-ref='bne_en-p233' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O Son of Man!<br/>
    If thou lovest Me, turn away from thyself; and if
    thou seekest My pleasure, regard not thine own; that thou mayest die
    in Me and I may eternally live in thee.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>The Hidden Words</i>. </span></p>


    <p id='5.31' data-ref='bne_en-p234' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O My Servant!<br/>
    Free thyself from the fetters of this world, and
    loose thy soul from the prison of self. Seize thy chance, for it will
    come to thee no more.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>The Hidden Words</i>. </span></p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_235'>Obedience</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='5.32' data-ref='bne_en-p235'>
Devotion to God involves implicit obedience to His revealed Commands
even when the reason for these Commands is not understood. The sailor
implicitly obeys his captain’s orders, even when he does not know
the reason for them, but his acceptance of authority is not blind. He
knows full well that the captain has served a thorough probation, and
given ample proofs of competence as a navigator. Were it not so, he
would be foolish indeed to serve under him. So the Bahá’í must
implicitly obey the Captain of his Salvation, but he will be foolish
indeed if he has not first ascertained that this Captain has given
ample proofs of trustworthiness. Having received such proofs,
however, to refuse obedience would be even greater folly, for only by
intelligent and open-eyed obedience to the wise master can we reap
the benefits of his wisdom, and acquire this wisdom for ourselves. Be
the captain never so wise, if none of the crew obey him how shall the
ship reach its port or the sailors learn the art of navigation?
Christ clearly pointed out that obedience is the path of knowledge.
He said: — </p>

  <p id='5.33' data-ref='bne_en-p234' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='jesus'>“My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any
    man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of
    God, or whether I speak of myself.”</q>
    <span class='block reference'>— St. John vii, 16–17.</span></p>


<p id='5.34'>
So Bahá’u’lláh says: </p>


  <p id='5.35' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“True belief in God and recognition of Him
    cannot be complete save by acceptance of that which He hath revealed
    and by observance of whatsoever hath been decreed by Him and set down
    in the Book by the Pen of Glory.”</q>
    <span class='block reference'>— <i>Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh</i>, Tablet of Tajallíyát.</span></p>


<p id='5.36' data-ref='bne_en-p236'>
Implicit obedience is not a popular virtue in these democratic days,
and indeed entire submission to the will of any mere man would be
disastrous. But the Unity of Humanity can be attained only by
complete harmony of each and all with the Divine will. Unless that
Will be clearly revealed, and men abandon all other leaders and obey
the Divine Messenger, then conflict and strife will go on, and men
will continue to oppose each other, to devote a large part of their
energy to frustrating the efforts of their brother men, instead of
working harmoniously together for the Glory of God and the common
good.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_237'>Service</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='5.37' data-ref='bne_en-p237'>
Devotion to God implies a life of service to our fellow-creatures. We
can be of service to God in no other way. If we turn our backs on our
fellowmen, we are turning our backs upon God. Christ said, <q class='jesus'>“Inasmuch
as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me.”</q>
So Bahá’u’lláh says: —

  <p id='5.38' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“O son of man! If thine eyes be turned
    towards mercy, forsake the things that profit thee, and cleave unto
    that which will profit mankind. And if thine eyes be turned towards
    justice, choose thou for thy neighbor that which thou choosest for
    thyself.”</q>
     <span class='block reference'>— <i>Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh</i>, Words of Paradise.</span></p>


<p id='5.39' data-ref='bne_en-p238' class='noid'>‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='5.40' data-ref='bne_en-p239' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>In the Bahá’í Cause arts, sciences and all crafts are counted as
    worship. The man who makes a piece of notepaper to the best of his
    ability, conscientiously, concentrating all his forces on perfecting
    it, is giving praise to God. Briefly, all effort and exertion put
    forth by man from the fullness of his heart is worship, if it is
    prompted by the highest motives and the will to do service to
    humanity. This is worship: to serve mankind and to minister to the
    needs of the people. Service is prayer. A physician ministering to
    the sick, gently, tenderly, free from prejudice and believing in the
    solidarity of the human race, is giving praise.</q> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_240'>Teaching</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='5.41' data-ref='bne_en-p240'>
The real Bahá’í will not only believe in the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh, but find in them the guide and inspiration of his
whole life and joyfully impart to others the knowledge that is the
wellspring of his own being. Only thus will he receive in full
measure <q class=''>“the power and confirmation of the Spirit.”</q> All cannot be
eloquent speakers or ready writers, but all can teach by <q class=''>“living
the life.”</q> Bahá’u’lláh says: — </p>

  <p id='5.42' data-ref='bne_en-p241' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>It behoveth the people of Bahá to render the Lord victorious through
    the power of their utterance and to admonish the people by their
    goodly deeds and character, inasmuch as deeds exert greater influence
    than words.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh</i>, Words of Paradise. </span></p>


<p id='5.43' data-ref='bne_en-p242'>
The Bahá’í will, however, on no account force his ideas on those
who do not wish to hear them. He will attract people to the Kingdom
of God, not try to drive them into it. He will be like the good
shepherd who leads his flock, and charms the sheep by his music,
rather than like the one who, from behind, urges them on with dog and
stick.</p>


<p id='5.44' data-ref='bne_en-p243' class='noid'>Bahá’u’lláh says in the <i>Hidden Words</i>: — </p>

  <p id='5.45' data-ref='bne_en-p244' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O Son of Dust!<br/>
    The wise are they that speak not unless they

    depths of his heart until he gazeth upon the beauty of his beloved.
    Wherefore sow the seeds of wisdom and knowledge in the pure soil of
    the heart, and keep them hidden, till the hyacinths of divine wisdom
    spring from the heart and not from mire and clay.</q> </p>


<p id='5.46' data-ref='bne_en-p245' class='noid'>Again He says, in the Tablet of Bi<u>sh</u>árát: — </p>

  <p id='5.47' data-ref='bne_en-p246' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O people of Bahá! Ye are the dawning-places of the love of God and
    the daysprings of His loving-kindness. Defile not your tongues with
    the cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against

    favorably received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain.
    Leave that soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the
    Self-Subsisting. Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and
    strife. The hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in
    the shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance

He teaches that as the flower is hidden in the bud, so a spirit from
God dwells in the heart of every man, no matter how hard and unlovely
his exterior. The true Bahá’í will treat every man, therefore, as
the gardener tends a rare and beautiful plant. He knows that no
impatient interference on his part can open the bud into a blossom;
only God’s sunshine can do that, therefore his aim is to bring that
life-giving sunshine into all darkened hearts and homes.</p>

    <q class='abd'>Among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is one requiring man, under
    all conditions and circumstances, to be forgiving, to love his enemy
    and to consider an ill-wisher as a well-wisher. Not that one should
    consider another as an enemy and then put up with him … and be
    forbearing toward him. This is hypocrisy and not real love. Nay,
    rather, you must see your enemies as friends, your ill-wishers as
    well-wishers and treat them accordingly. Your love and kindness must
    be real … not merely forbearance, for forbearance, if not of the
    heart, is hypocrisy.</q> </p>


<p id='5.57' data-ref='bne_en-p255'>
Such counsel appears unintelligible and self-contradictory until we
realize that while the outer carnal man may be a hater and
ill-wisher, there is in everyone an inner, spiritual nature which is
the real man, from whom only love and goodwill can proceed. It is to
this real, inner man in each of our neighbors that we must direct our
thought and love. When he awakens into activity, the outer man will
be transformed and renewed.</p>

Bahá’u’lláh constantly urges men to realize and give full

self as distinguished from the limited outer self, which at best is
but the temple, and too often is the prison of the real man. In the
<i>Hidden Words</i> He says: — </p>

Realization of the spiritual self in ourselves means realization of
the sublime truth that we are from God and to Him shall we return.
This return to God is the glorious goal of the Bahá’í; but to
attain this goal the only path is that of obedience to His chosen
Messengers, and especially to His Messenger for the time in which we

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_287'>Conversation with God</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='6.2' data-ref='bne_en-p287'>
<q class='abd'>“Prayer,”</q> says ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, <q class='abd'>“is conversation with God.”</q>
In order that God may make known His Mind and Will to men, He must
speak to them in a language which they can understand, and this He
does by the mouths of His Holy Prophets. While these Prophets are
alive in the body They speak with men face to face and convey to them
the Message of God, and after Their death Their message continues to
reach men’s minds through Their recorded sayings and writings. But
this is not the only way in which God can commune with and inspire
those whose hearts are seeking after truth, wherever they are, and
whatever their native race or tongue. By this language the
Manifestation continues to hold converse with the faithful after His
departure from the material world. Christ continued to converse with
and inspire His disciples after His crucifixion. In fact He
influenced them more powerfully than before; and with other Prophets
it has been the same. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá speaks much of this spiritual
language. He says, for instance: — </p>

  <p id='6.3' data-ref='bne_en-p288' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>We should speak in the language of heaven — in the language of the
    spirit — for there is a language of the spirit and heart. It is as
    different from our language as our own language is different from
    that of the animals, who express themselves only by cries and sounds.</q> </p>


  <p id='6.4' data-ref='bne_en-p289' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>It is the language of the spirit which speaks to God. When, in
    prayer, we are freed from all outward things and turn to God, then it
    is as if in our hearts we hear the voice of God. Without words we
    speak, we communicate, we converse with God and hear the answer.…
    All of us, when we attain to a truly spiritual condition, can hear
    the Voice of God.</q>
     <span class='block reference'>(From a talk reported by Miss Ethel J. Rosenberg).</span></p>


<p id='6.5' data-ref='bne_en-p290'>
Bahá’u’lláh declares that the higher spiritual truths can be
communicated only by means of this spiritual language. The spoken or
written word is quite inadequate. In a little book called <i>The
Seven Valleys</i>, in which He describes the journey of travelers
from the earthly dwelling to the Divine Home, He says, in speaking of
the more advanced stages of the journey: — </p>

  <p id='6.6' data-ref='bne_en-p291' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>The tongue is unable to give an account of these, and utterance falls
    exceedingly short. The pen is useless in this court, and the ink
    gives no result but blackness.… Heart alone can communicate to
    heart the state of the knower; this is not the work of a messenger,
    nor can it be contained in letters.</q> </p>

conversation with God becomes possible, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='6.8' data-ref='bne_en-p293' class='dropcap blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>We must strive to attain to that condition by being separated from
    all things and from the people of the world and by turning to God
    alone. It will take some effort on the part of man to attain to that
    condition, but he must work for it, strive for it. We can attain to
    it by thinking and caring less for material things and more for the
    spiritual. The further we go from the one, the nearer we are to the
    other. The choice is ours.</q> </p>


  <p id='6.9' data-ref='bne_en-p294' class='blockquote'>

    bodily part of his nature, then is he fallen from his high place and
    he becomes inferior to the inhabitants of the lower animal kingdom.</q> </p>

  <p id='6.19' data-ref='bne_en-p303' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>If we wish to pray, we must have some object on which to concentrate.
    If we turn to God, we must direct our hearts to a certain center. If
    man worships God otherwise than through His Manifestation, he must
    first form a conception of God, and that conception is created by his
    own mind. As the finite cannot comprehend the infinite, so God is not
    to be comprehended in this fashion. That which man conceives with his
    own mind he comprehends. That which he can comprehend is not God.
    That conception of God which a man forms for himself is but a
    phantasm, an image, an imagination, an illusion. There is no

  <p id='6.23' data-ref='bne_en-p307' class='blockquote'>

    covered with grass and vegetation without the rain of the cloud;
    therefore the cloud is the intermediary between the divine bounties
    and the soil.… The light hath a center and if one desire to seek it
    otherwise than from the center, one can never attain to it.… Turn

Another correspondent asked: “Why pray? What is the wisdom thereof,
for God has established everything and executes all affairs after the
best order — therefore, what is the wisdom in beseeching and
supplicating and in stating one’s wants and seeking help?”</p>


<p id='6.30' data-ref='bne_en-p313' class='noid'>‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied: — </p>

  <p id='6.31' data-ref='bne_en-p314' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Know thou, verily, it is becoming in a weak one to supplicate to the
    Strong One, and it behooveth a seeker of bounty to beseech the
    Glorious Bountiful One. When one supplicates to his Lord, turns to
    Him and seeks bounty from His Ocean, this supplication brings light
    to his heart, illumination to his sight, life to his soul and
    exaltation to his being.</q> </p>


  <p id='6.32' data-ref='bne_en-p315' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>During thy supplications to God and thy reciting, “Thy Name is my

    Kingdom of God! By these attractions one’s ability and capacity
    increase. When the vessel is enlarged the water increases, and when
    the thirst grows the bounty of the cloud becomes agreeable to the
    taste of man. This is the mystery of supplication and the wisdom of
    stating one’s wants.</q>

<p id='6.33' data-ref='bne_en-p316'>
Bahá’u’lláh has revealed three daily obligatory prayers. The
believer is free to choose any one of these three prayers, but is
under the obligation of reciting one of them, and in the manner
Bahá’u’lláh has prescribed.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_317'>Congregational Prayer</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='6.34' data-ref='bne_en-p317'>
The prayers which Bahá’u’lláh has ordained as a daily
obligation for Bahá’ís are to be said privately. Only in the case
of the Prayer for the Dead has Bahá’u’lláh commanded
congregational prayer, and the only requirement is that the believer
who reads it aloud, and all others present, should stand. This
differs from the Islamic practice of congregational prayer in which
the believers stand in rows behind an imám, who leads the prayer,
which is prohibited in the Bahá’í Faith.</p>


<p id='6.35' data-ref='bne_en-p318'>
These ordinances, which are in accordance with Bahá’u’lláh’s
abolition of professional clergy, do not mean that He attached no
value to meetings for worship. Regarding the value of gathering for
prayer, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke as follows: — </p>

  <p id='6.36' data-ref='bne_en-p319' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Man may say: “I can pray to God whenever I wish, when the feelings
    of my heart are drawn to God; when I am in the wilderness, when I am
    in the city, or wherever I may be. Why should I go where others are
    gathered upon a special day, at a certain hour, to unite my prayers
    with theirs, when I may not be in a frame of mind for praying?”</q> </p>


  <p id='6.37' data-ref='bne_en-p320' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>To think in this way is useless imagination, for where many are
    gathered together their force is greater. Separate soldiers fighting
    alone and individually have not the force of a united army. If all
    the soldiers in this spiritual war gather together, then their united
    spiritual feelings help each other, and their prayers become
    acceptable.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> (From notes taken by Miss Ethel J. Rosenberg.)</span></p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_321'>Prayer the Language of Love</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='6.38' data-ref='bne_en-p321'>
To someone who asked whether prayer was necessary, since presumably
God knows the wishes of all hearts, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied: — </p>

  <p id='6.39' data-ref='bne_en-p322' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>If one friend loves another, is it not natural that he should wish to
    say so? Though he knows that the friend is aware of his love, does he
    still not wish to tell him of it? .… It is true that God knows the
    wishes of all hearts; but the impulse to pray is a natural one,
    springing from man’s love to God.</q> </p>


  <p id='6.40' data-ref='bne_en-p323' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>… Prayer need not be in words, but rather in thought and action.
    But if this love and this desire are lacking, it is useless to try to
    force them. Words without love mean nothing. If a person talks to you
    as an unpleasant duty, finding neither love nor enjoyment in the
    meeting, do you wish to converse with him?</q>
     <span class='block reference'> (Article in <i>Fortnightly
      Review</i>, Jan.–June 1911, by Miss E. S. Stevens.) </span></p>



<p id='6.41' data-ref='bne_en-p324' class='noid'>In another talk He said: — </p>

  <p id='6.42' data-ref='bne_en-p325' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>In the highest prayer, men pray only for the love of God, not because
    they fear Him or hell, or hope for bounty or heaven.… When a man
    falls in love with a human being, it is impossible for him to keep
    from mentioning the name of his beloved. How much more difficult is
    it to keep from mentioning the Name of God when one has come to love
    Him.… The spiritual man finds no delight in anything save in
    commemoration of God.</q>

      pilgrims, November and December 1900.)</span></p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_326'>Deliverance from Calamities</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='6.43' data-ref='bne_en-p326'>
According to the teaching of the Prophets, disease and all other
forms of calamity are due to disobedience to the Divine Commands.
Even disasters due to floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes are
attributed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indirectly to this cause.</p>


<p id='6.44' data-ref='bne_en-p327'>
The suffering that follows error is not vindictive, however, but
educative and remedial. It is God’s Voice proclaiming to man that
he has strayed from the right path. If the suffering is terrible, it
is only because the danger of wrongdoing is more terrible, for <q class='bible'>“the
wages of sin is death.”</q></p>


<p id='6.45' data-ref='bne_en-p328'>
Just as calamity is due to disobedience, so deliverance from calamity
can be obtained only by obedience. There is no chance or uncertainty
about the matter. Turning <i>from</i> God inevitably brings disaster,
and turning <i>to</i> God as inevitably brings blessing.</p>


<p id='6.46' data-ref='bne_en-p329'>
As the whole of humanity is one organism, however, the welfare of
each individual depends not only on his own behavior, but on that of
his neighbors. If one does wrong, all suffer in greater or less
degree; while if one does well, all benefit. Each has to bear his
neighbor’s burdens, to some extent, and the best of mankind are
those who bear the biggest burdens. The saints have always suffered
abundantly; the Prophets have suffered superlatively. Bahá’u’lláh
says in the <i>Book of Íqán</i>: — </p>

  <p id='6.47' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“You must undoubtedly have
    been informed of the tribulations, the poverty, the ills, and the
    degradation that have befallen every Prophet of God and His
    companions. You must have heard how the heads of their followers were
    sent as presents unto different cities.…”</q>
     <span class='block reference'> — <i>Kitáb-i-Íqán</i>.</span></p>

<p id='6.48'>
This is not because the saints and Prophets have merited punishment
above other men. Nay, they often suffer for the sins of others, and
<i>choose</i> to suffer, for the sake of others. Their concern is for
the world’s welfare, not for their own. The prayer of the true
lover of humanity is not that he, as an individual, may escape
poverty, ill-health or disaster, but that mankind may be saved from
ignorance and error and the ills that inevitably flow from them. If
he wishes health or wealth for himself, it is in order that he may
serve the Kingdom, and if physical health and wealth are denied him,
he accepts his lot with <q class='baha'>“radiant acquiescence,”</q> well knowing that
there is a right wisdom in whatever befalls him in the Path of God.</p>


<p id='6.49' data-ref='bne_en-p330' class='noid'>‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='6.50' data-ref='bne_en-p331' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Grief and sorrow do not come to us by chance; they are sent by the
    Divine Mercy for our perfecting. When grief and sorrow come, then
    will a man remember his Father Who is in Heaven, Who is able to
    deliver him from his humiliations. The more a man is chastened, the
    greater is the harvest of spiritual virtues shown forth by him.</q> </p>


<p id='6.51' data-ref='bne_en-p332'>
At first sight it may seem very unjust that the innocent should
suffer for the guilty, but ‘Abdu’l-Bahá assures us that the
injustice is only apparent and that, in the long run, perfect justice
prevails. He writes: — </p>

  <p id='6.52' data-ref='bne_en-p333' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>As to the subject of babes and children and weak ones who are
    afflicted by the hands of the oppressors … for those souls there is
    a recompense in another world … that suffering is the greatest
    mercy of God. Verily that mercy of the Lord is far better than all
    the comfort of this world and the growth and development appertaining
    to this place of mortality.</q> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_334'>Prayer and Natural Law</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='6.53' data-ref='bne_en-p334'>
Many find a difficulty in believing in the efficacy of prayer because
they think that answers to prayer would involve arbitrary
interference with the laws of nature. An analogy may help to remove
this difficulty. If a magnet be held over some iron filings the
latter will fly upwards and cling to it, but this involves no
interference with the law of gravitation. The force of gravity
continues to act on the filings just as before. What has happened is
that a superior force has been brought into play — another force
whose action is just as regular and calculable as that of gravity.
The Bahá’í view is that prayer brings into action higher forces,
as yet comparatively little known; but there seems no reason to
believe that these forces are more arbitrary in their action than the
physical forces. The difference is that they have not yet been fully
studied and experimentally investigated, and their action appears
mysterious and incalculable because of our ignorance.</p>


<p id='6.54' data-ref='bne_en-p335'>
Another difficulty which some find perplexing is that prayer seems
too feeble a force to produce the great results often claimed to it.
Analogy may serve to clear up this difficulty also. A small force,
when applied to the sluice gate of a reservoir, may release and
regulate an enormous flow of water-power, or, when applied to the
steering gear of an ocean liner, may control the course of the huge
vessel. In the Bahá’í view, the power that brings about answers
to prayer is the inexhaustible Power of God. The part of the
suppliant is only to exert the feeble force necessary to release the
flow or determine the course of the Divine Bounty, which is ever
ready to serve those who have learned how to draw upon it.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_336'>Bahá’í Prayers</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='6.55' data-ref='bne_en-p336'>
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have revealed innumerable
prayers for the use of Their followers at various times and for
various purposes. The greatness of conception and depth of
spirituality revealed in these utterances must impress every
thoughtful student, but only by making their use a regular and
important part of one’s daily life can their significance be fully
appreciated and their power for good realized. Unfortunately,
considerations of space prevent our giving more than a very few short
specimens of these prayers. For further examples the reader must be
referred to other works. </p>

<p id='7.2' data-ref='bne_en-p357'>
According to the Bahá’í teaching the human body serves a
temporary purpose in the development of the soul, and, when that
purpose has been served, is laid aside; just as the eggshell serves a
temporary purpose in the development of the chick, and, when that
purpose has been served, is broken and discarded. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
says that the physical body is incapable of immortality, for it is a
composite thing, built up of atoms and molecules, and, like all
things that are composed, must, in time, become decomposed.</p>


<p id='7.3' data-ref='bne_en-p358'>
The body should be the servant of the soul, never its master, but it
should be a willing, obedient and efficient servant, and should be
treated with the consideration which a good servant deserves. If it
is not properly treated, disease and disaster result, with injurious
consequences to master as well as servant.</p>

<p id='7.4' data-ref='bne_en-p359'>
The essential oneness of all the myriad forms and grades of life is
one of the fundamental teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. Our physical
health is so linked up with our mental, moral and spiritual health,
and also with the individual and social health of our fellowmen, nay,
even with the life of the animals and plants, that each of these is
affected by the others to a far greater extent than is usually
realized.</p>


<p id='7.5' data-ref='bne_en-p360'>
There is no command of the Prophet, therefore, to whatever department
of life it may primarily refer, which does not concern bodily health.

physical health than others, and these we may now proceed to examine.</p>

Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl, in his book, <i>Bahá’í Proofs</i>,<a data-fnid='1'></a>
points out the extreme importance of these commands, more especially
in some parts of the East, where water of the foulest description is
often used for household purposes, for bathing and even for drinking,
and horribly insanitary conditions abound, causing a vast amount of
preventable disease and misery. These conditions, often supposed to
be sanctioned by the prevailing religion, can be changed, among
Orientals, only by the commandment of one who is believed to have
Divine authority. In many parts of the Western Hemisphere, too, a
wonderful transformation would result were cleanliness accepted not
only as next to godliness, but as an essential part of godliness.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_373'>Effect of Obedience to Prophetic Commands</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='7.19' data-ref='bne_en-p373'>
The bearing on health of these commands relating to the simple life,
hygiene, abstinence from alcohol and opium, etcetera, is too obvious
to call for much comment, although their vital importance is apt to
be greatly underestimated. Were they to be generally observed, most
of the infectious diseases and a good many others would soon vanish
from among men. The amount of illness caused by neglect of simple
hygienic precautions and by indulgence in alcohol and opium is
prodigious. Moreover, obedience to these commands would not only
affect health, but would have an enormous effect for good on
character and conduct. Alcohol and opium affect a man’s conscience
long before they affect his gait or cause obvious bodily disease, so
that the moral spiritual gain from abstinence would be even greater
than the physical. With regard to cleanliness, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
says: —</p>

  <p id='7.20' class='blockquote'>
     <q class='abd'>“External cleanliness, although it is but a physical thing,
    has great influence upon spirituality.… The fact of having a pure
    and spotless body exercises an influence upon the spirit of man.”</q></p>


<p id='7.21' data-ref='bne_en-p374'>
Were the commands of the Prophets concerning chastity in sexual
relations generally observed, another fertile cause of disease would
be eliminated. The loathsome venereal diseases, which wreck the
health of so many thousands today, innocent as well as guilty, babes
as well as parents, would very soon be entirely a thing of the past. </p>



<p id='7.22' data-ref='bne_en-p375'>
Were the commands of the Prophets concerning justice, mutual aid,
loving one’s neighbor as oneself, carried out, how could
overcrowding, sweated labor and sordid poverty on the one hand,
together with self-indulgence, idleness and sordid luxury on the
other, continue to work mental, moral and physical ruin?</p>


<p id='7.23' data-ref='bne_en-p376'>
Simple obedience to the hygienic and moral commands of Moses, Buddha,
Christ, Muḥammad or Bahá’u’lláh would do more in the way of
preventing disease than all the doctors and all the public health
regulations in the world have been able to accomplish. In fact, it
seems certain that were such obedience general, good health would
also become general. Instead of lives being blighted by disease or
cut off in infancy, youth or prime, as so frequently happens now, men
would live to a ripe old age, like sound fruits that mature and
mellow ere they drop from the bough.</p>







<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_377'>The Prophet as Physician</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='7.24' data-ref='bne_en-p377'>
We live in a world, however, where from time immemorial obedience to
the commands of the Prophets has been the exception rather than the
rule; where love of self has been a more prevalent motive than love
of God; where limited and party interests have taken precedence of
the interests of humanity as a whole; where material possessions and
sensual pleasures have been preferred to the social and spiritual
welfare of mankind. Hence have arisen fierce competition and
conflict, oppression and tyranny, extremes of wealth and poverty — all
those conditions which breed disease, mental and physical. As a
consequence, the whole tree of humanity is sick, and every leaf on
the tree shares in the general sickness. Even the purest and holiest
have to suffer for the sins of others. Healing is needed — healing of
humanity as a whole, of nations and of individuals. So Bahá’u’lláh,
like His inspired predecessors, not only shows how health is to be
maintained, but also how it may be recovered when lost. He comes as
the Great Physician, the Healer of the world’s sicknesses, both of
body and of mind.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_378'>Healing by Material Means</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='7.25' data-ref='bne_en-p378'>
In the Western world of today there is evident a remarkable revival
of belief in the efficacy of healing by mental and spiritual means.
Indeed many, in their revolt against the materialistic ideals about
disease and its treatment which prevailed in the nineteenth century,
have gone to the opposite extreme of denying that material remedies
or hygienic methods have any value whatsoever. Bahá’u’lláh
recognizes the value of both material and spiritual remedies. He
teaches that the science and art of healing must be developed,
encouraged and perfected, so that all means of healing may be used to
the best advantage, each in its appropriate sphere. When members of
Bahá’u’lláh’s own family were sick, a professional physician
was called in, and this practice is recommended to His followers. He
says: <q class='baha'>“Resort ye, in times of sickness, to competent
physicians.”</q><span class='ref'> — <i>Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i>.</span></p>


<p id='7.26' data-ref='bne_en-p379'>
This is quite in accordance with the Bahá’í attitude towards
science and art generally. All sciences and arts which are for the
benefit of mankind, even in a material way, are to be esteemed and
promoted. Through science man becomes the master of material things;
through ignorance he remains their slave.</p>


<p id='7.27' data-ref='bne_en-p380' class='noid'>Bahá’u’lláh writes: — </p>

  <p id='7.28' data-ref='bne_en-p381' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Do not neglect medical treatment when it is necessary, but leave it
    off when health has been restored. Treat disease through diet, by
    preference, refraining from the use of drugs; and if you find what is
    required in a single herb, do not resort to a compound medicament.…
    Abstain from drugs when the health is good, but administer them when
    necessary.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  Tablet to a Physician </span></p>


<p id='7.29' data-ref='bne_en-p382' class='noid'>In one of His Tablets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='7.30' data-ref='bne_en-p383' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>O seeker after truth! There are two ways of healing sickness,
    material means and spiritual means. The first way is through the use
    of material remedies. The second consists in praying to God and in
    turning to Him. Both means should be used and practiced.… Moreover,
    they are not incompatible, and you should accept the physical
    remedies as coming from the mercy and favor of God Who has revealed
    and made manifest medical knowledge, so that His servants may profit
    by this kind of treatment also.</q> </p>


<p id='7.31' data-ref='bne_en-p384'>
He teaches that, were our natural tastes and instincts not vitiated
by foolish and unnatural modes of living, they would become reliable
guides in the choice both of appropriate diet and of medicinal
fruits, herbs and other remedies, as is the case with wild animals.
In an interesting talk on healing, recorded in <i>Some Answered
Questions</i>, He says in conclusion: — </p>

  <p id='7.32' data-ref='bne_en-p385' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>It is therefore evident that it is possible to cure by foods,
    aliments, and fruits; but as today the science of medicine is
    imperfect, this fact is not yet fully grasped. When the science of
    medicine reaches perfection, treatment will be given by foods,
    aliments, fragrant fruits, and vegetables, and by various waters, hot
    and cold in temperature.</q> </p>


<p id='7.33' data-ref='bne_en-p386'>
Even when the means of healing are material, the power that heals is
really Divine, for the attributes of the herb of mineral are from the
Divine Bestowals. <q class='abd'>“All depends upon God. Medicine is merely an
outward form or means by which we obtain heavenly healing.”</q></p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_387'>Healing by Nonmaterial Means</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='7.34' data-ref='bne_en-p387'>
He teaches that there are also many methods of healing without
material means. There is a <q class='abd'>“contagion of health,”</q> as well as a
contagion of disease, although the former is very slow and has a
small effect, while the latter is often violent and rapid in its
action.</p>


<p id='7.35' data-ref='bne_en-p388'>
Much more powerful effects result from the patient’s own mental
states, and <q class=''>“suggestion”</q> may play an important part in
determining these states. Fear, anger, worry, et cetera, are very
prejudicial to health, while hope, love, joy, et cetera, are
correspondingly beneficial.</p>


<p id='7.36' data-ref='bne_en-p389' class='noid'>Thus Bahá’u’lláh says: — </p>

  <p id='7.37' data-ref='bne_en-p390' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Verily the most necessary thing is contentment under all
    circumstances; by this one is preserved from morbid conditions and

    avoid these two as you would a lion.</q>

<p id='7.38' data-ref='bne_en-p391'>
And ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: —</p>

  <p id='7.39' class='blockquote'>
     <q class='abd'>“Joy gives us wings. In times of joy
    our strength is more vital, our intellect keener.… But when sadness
    visits us our strength leaves us.”</q></p>


<p id='7.40' data-ref='bne_en-p392'>
Of another form of mental healing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes that it
results: — </p>

  <p id='7.41' data-ref='bne_en-p393' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>from the entire concentration of the mind of a strong person upon a
    sick person, when the latter expects with all his concentrated faith
    that a cure will be effected from the spiritual power of the strong
    person, to such an extent that there will be a cordial connection
    between the strong person and the invalid. The strong person makes
    every effort to cure the sick patient, and the sick patient is then
    sure of receiving a cure. From the effect of these mental impressions
    an excitement of the nerves is produced, and this impression and this
    excitement of the nerves will become the cause of the recovery of the
    sick person.</q>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_395'>The Power of the Holy Spirit</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='7.43' data-ref='bne_en-p395'>
The most potent means of healing is the Power of the Holy Spirit. </p>

  <p id='7.44' data-ref='bne_en-p396' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>… This does not depend on contact, nor on sight, nor upon

     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Some Answered Questions</i>. </span></p>


<p id='7.45' data-ref='bne_en-p397'>
In a talk with Miss Ethel Rosenberg, in October 1904, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said: — </p>

  <p id='7.46' data-ref='bne_en-p398' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The healing that is by the power of the Holy Spirit needs no special
  concentration or contact. It is through the wish or desire and the
  prayer of the holy person. The one who is sick may be in the East and
  the healer in the West, and they may not have been acquainted with
  each other, but as soon as that holy person turns his heart to God
  and begins to pray, the sick one is healed. This is a gift belonging
  to the Holy Manifestations and those who are in the highest station.</q> </p>


<p id='7.47' data-ref='bne_en-p399'>
Of this nature, apparently, were the works of healing performed by
Christ and His apostles, and similar works of healing have been
attributed to holy men in all ages. Both Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá were gifted with this power, and similar powers are
promised to Their faithful followers.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_400'>Attitude of the Patient</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='7.48' data-ref='bne_en-p400'>
In order that the power of spiritual healing may be brought fully
into operation certain requirements are necessary on the part of the
patient, of the healer, of the patient’s friends and of the
community at large.</p>


<p id='7.49' data-ref='bne_en-p401'>
On the part of the patient the prime requisite is, turning with all
the heart to God, with implicit trust both in His Power and in His
Will to do whatever is best. To an American lady, in August 1912,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: — </p>

  <p id='7.50' data-ref='bne_en-p402' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>All of these ailments will pass away and you will receive perfect
    physical and spiritual health.… Let your heart be confident and
    assured that through the Bounty of Bahá’u’lláh, through the
    Favor of Bahá’u’lláh, everything will become pleasant for you.…
    But you must turn your face wholly towards the Abhá (All-Glorious)
    Kingdom, giving perfect attention — the same attention that Mary
    Magdalene gave to His Holiness Christ — and I assure you that you
    will get physical and spiritual health. You are worthy. I give you
    the glad tidings that you are worthy because your heart is pure.…
    Be confident! Be happy! Be rejoiced! Be hopeful!</q> </p>


<p id='7.51' data-ref='bne_en-p403'>
Although in this particular case ‘Abdu’l-Bahá guaranteed the
attainment of sound physical health, He does not do so in every case,
even where there is strong faith on the part of the individual. He
wrote: — </p>

  <p id='7.52' data-ref='bne_en-p404' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The prayers which were revealed to ask for healing apply both to
    physical and spiritual healing. Recite them, then, to heal both the
    soul and the body. If healing is right for the patient, it will
    certainly be granted; but for some ailing persons, healing would only
    be the cause of other ills, and therefore wisdom doth not permit an
    affirmative answer to the prayer.</q> </p>


  <p id='7.53' data-ref='bne_en-p405' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>O handmaid of God! The power of the Holy Spirit healeth both physical

<p id='7.54' data-ref='bne_en-p406' class='noid'>Again He writes to one who is ill: — </p>

  <p id='7.55' data-ref='bne_en-p407' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Verily the Will of God acts sometimes in a way for which mankind is
    unable to find out the reason. The causes and reasons shall appear.

    and will cause His Mercy to descend upon Thee.</q> </p>


<p id='7.56' data-ref='bne_en-p408'>
He teaches that spiritual health is <i>conducive</i> to physical
health, but physical health depends upon many factors, some of which
are outside the control of the individual. Even the most exemplary
spiritual attitude on the part of the individual, therefore, may not
<i>ensure</i> physical health in every case. The holiest men and
women sometimes suffer illness.</p>


<p id='7.57' data-ref='bne_en-p409'>
Nevertheless, the beneficent influence on bodily health which results
from a right spiritual attitude is far more potent than is generally
imagined, and is sufficient to banish ill-health in a large
proportion of cases. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote to an English lady: — </p>

  <p id='7.58' data-ref='bne_en-p409.a' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>“You
    have written about the weakness of your body. I ask from the Bounties
    of Bahá’u’lláh that your spirit may become strong, that through
    the strength of your spirit your body also may be healed.”</q> </p>


<p id='7.59' data-ref='bne_en-p410' class='noid'>Again He says: — </p>

  <p id='7.60' data-ref='bne_en-p411' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>God hath bestowed upon man such wonderful powers, that he might ever
    look upward, and receive, among other gifts, healing from His divine
    Bounty. But alas! man is not grateful for this supreme good, but
    sleeps the sleep of negligence, being careless of the great mercy
    which God has shown towards him, turning his face away from the Light
    and going on his way in darkness.</q> </p>

<p id='7.61' data-ref='bne_en-p412'>
The power of spiritual healing is doubtless common to all mankind in
greater or less degree, but, just as some men are endowed with
exceptional talent for mathematics or music, so others appear to be
endowed with exceptional aptitude for healing. These are the people
who ought to make the healing art their lifework. Unfortunately, so
materialistic has the world become in recent centuries that the very
possibility of spiritual healing has to a large extent been lost
sight of. Like all other talents the gift of healing has to be
recognized, trained and educated in order that it may attain its
highest development and power, and there are probably thousands in
the world today, richly dowered with natural aptitude for healing, in
whom this precious gift is lying dormant and inactive. When the
potentialities of mental and spiritual treatment are more fully
realized, the healing art will be transformed and ennobled and its
efficacy immeasurably increased. And when this new knowledge and
power in the healer are combined with lively faith and hope on the
part of the patient, wonderful results may be looked for.</p>

<p id='7.70' data-ref='bne_en-p421'>
The work of healing the sick, however, is a matter that concerns not
the patient and the practitioner only, but everyone. All must help,
by sympathy and service, by right living and right thinking, and
especially by prayer, for of all remedies prayer is the most potent.
<q class='abd'>“Supplication and prayer on behalf of others,”</q> says ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
<q class='abd'>“will surely be effective.”</q> The friends of the patient have a
special responsibility, for their influence, either for good or ill,
is most direct and powerful. In how many cases of sickness the issue
depends mainly on the ministrations of parents, friends or neighbors
of the helpless sufferer!</p>


<p id='7.71' data-ref='bne_en-p422'>
Even the members of the community at large have an influence in every
case of sickness. In individual cases that influence may not appear
great, yet in the mass the effect is potent. Everyone is affected by
the social “atmosphere” in which he lives, by the general
prevalence of faith or materialism, of virtue or vice, of
cheerfulness of depression; and each individual has his share in
determining the state of that social “atmosphere.” It may not be
possible for everyone, in the present state of the world, to attain
to perfect health, but it is possible for everyone to become a
“willing channel” for the health-giving power of the Holy Spirit
and thus to exert a healing, helpful influence both on his own body
and on all with whom he comes in contact.</p>


<p id='7.72' data-ref='bne_en-p423'>
Few duties are impressed on Bahá’ís more repeatedly and
emphatically than that of healing the sick, and many beautiful
prayers for healing have been revealed by both Bahá’u’lláh and

Bahá’u’lláh gives the assurance that, through harmonious
cooperation of patients, healers and the community in general, and by
appropriate use of the various means to health, material, mental and
spiritual, the Golden Age may be realized, when, by the Power of God,
<q class='baha'>“all sorrow will be turned into joy, and all disease into health.”</q>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that <q class='baha'>“when the Divine Message is understood,
all troubles will vanish.”</q> Again He says: — </p>

  <p id='7.74' data-ref='bne_en-p425' class='blockquote'>

<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='7.75' data-ref='bne_en-p426'>
In concluding this chapter it will be well to recall ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
teaching as to the right use of physical health. In one of His
Tablets to the Bahá’ís of Washington He says: — </p>

  <p id='7.76' data-ref='bne_en-p427' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>If the health and well-being of the body be expended in the path of
    the Kingdom, this is very acceptable and praiseworthy; and if it be
    expended to the benefit of the human world in general — even though
    it be to their material (or bodily) benefit — and be a means of doing
    good, that is also acceptable. But if the health and welfare of man
    be spent in sensual desires, in a life on the animal plane, and in
    devilish pursuits — then disease were better than such health; nay,
    death itself were preferable to such a life. If thou art desirous of
    health, wish thou health for serving the Kingdom. I hope that thou
    mayest attain perfect insight, inflexible resolution, complete
    health, and spiritual and physical strength in order that thou mayest
    drink from the fountain of eternal life and be assisted by the spirit
    of divine confirmation.</q> </p>

    enduring unity. Well is it with them that keep My statutes.</q>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_429'>Sectarianism in the Nineteenth Century</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.2' data-ref='bne_en-p429'>
Never, perhaps, did the world seem farther away from religious unity
than in the nineteenth century. For many centuries had the great
religious communities — the Zoroastrian, Mosaic, Buddhist, Christian,
Muḥammadan and others — been existing side by side, but instead of
blending together into a harmonious whole they had been at constant
enmity and strife, each against the others. Not only so, but each had
become split up, by division after division, into an increasing
number of sects which were often bitterly opposed to each other. Yet
Christ had said: <q class='jesus'>“By this shall all men know that ye are my
disciples, if ye have love one to another,”</q> and Muḥammad had
said: <q class='muh'>“This your religion is the one religion.… To you hath God
prescribed the faith which He commanded unto Noah, and which We have
revealed unto thee, and which We commanded unto Abraham and Moses and
Jesus saying: ‘Observe this faith, and be not divided into sects
therein!’”</q> The Founder of every one of the great religions had
called His followers to love and unity, but in every case the aim of
the Founder was to a large extent lost sight of in a welter of
intolerance and bigotry, formalism and hypocrisy, corruption and
misrepresentation, schism and contention. The aggregate number of
more or less hostile sects in the world was probably greater at the
commencement of the Bahá’í era than at any previous period in
human history. It seemed as if humanity at that time were
experimenting with every possible kind of religious belief, with
every possible sort of ritual and ceremonial observance, with every
possible variety of moral code.</p>


<p id='8.3' data-ref='bne_en-p430'>
At the same time an increasing number of men were devoting their
energies to fearless investigation and critical examination of the
laws of nature and the foundations of belief. New scientific
knowledge was being rapidly acquired and new solutions were being
found for many of the problems of life. The development of inventions
such as steamship and railway, postal system and press, greatly aided
the diffusion of ideas and the fertilizing contact of widely
different types of thought and life.</p>


<p id='8.4' data-ref='bne_en-p431'>
The so called “conflict between religion and science” became a
fierce battle. In the Christian world Biblical criticism combined
with physical science to dispute, and to some extent to refute, the
authority of the Bible, an authority that for centuries had been the
generally accepted basis of belief. A rapidly increasing proportion
of the population became skeptical about the teachings of the
churches. A large number even of religious priests secretly or openly
entertained doubts or reservations regarding the creeds adhered to by
their respective denominations.</p>


<p id='8.5' data-ref='bne_en-p432'>
This ferment and flux of opinion, with increasing recognition of the
inadequacy of the old orthodoxies and dogmas, and groping and
striving after fuller knowledge and understanding, were not confined
to Christian countries, but were manifest, more or less, and in
different forms, among the people of all countries and religions.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_433'>The Message of Bahá’u’lláh</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.6' data-ref='bne_en-p433'>
It was when this state of conflict and confusion was at its height,
that Bahá’u’lláh sounded His great trumpet call to humanity: — </p>

  <p id='8.7' data-ref='bne_en-p434' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>That all nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers;
    that the bonds of affection and unity between the sons of men should
    be strengthened; that diversity of religion should cease, and
    differences of race be annulled.… These strifes and this bloodshed
    and discord must cease, and all men be as one kindred and one
    family.…</q>
     <span class='block reference'> (words spoken to Professor Browne). </span></p>


<p id='8.8' data-ref='bne_en-p435'>
It is a glorious message, but how are its proposals to be carried
into effect? Prophets have preached, poets have sung and saints have
prayed about these things for thousands of years, but diversities of
religion have not ceased nor have strife and bloodshed and discord
been annulled. What is there to show that now the miracle is to be
accomplished? Are there any new factors in the situation? Is not
human nature the same as it ever was, and will it not continue to be
the same while the world lasts? If two people want the same thing, or
two nations, will they not fight for it in the future as they have
done in the past? If Moses, Buddha, Christ and Muḥammad failed to
achieve world unity will Bahá’u’lláh succeed? If all previous
faiths become corrupted and rent asunder into sects will not the
Bahá’í Faith share the same fate? Let us see what answer the
Bahá’í teachings give to these and similar questions.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_436'>Can Human Nature Change?</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.9' data-ref='bne_en-p436'>
Education and religion are alike based on the assumption that it <i>is</i>
possible to change human nature. In fact, it requires but little
investigation to show that the one thing we can say with certainty
about any living thing is that it cannot keep from changing. Without
change there can be no life. Even the mineral cannot resist change,
and the higher we go in the scale of being, the more varied, complex,
and wonderful do the changes become. Moreover, in progress and
development among creatures of all grades we find two kinds of
change — one slow, gradual, often almost imperceptible; and the other
rapid, sudden and dramatic. The latter occur at what are called
“critical stages” of development. In the case of minerals we find
such critical stages at the melting and boiling points, for example,
when the solid suddenly becomes a liquid or the liquid becomes a gas.
In the case of plants we see such critical stages when the seed
begins to germinate, or the bud bursts into leaf. In the animal world
we see the same on every hand, as when the grub suddenly changes into
a butterfly, the chick emerges from its shell, or the babe is born
from its mother’s womb. In the higher life of the soul we often see
a similar transformation, when a man is “born again” and his
whole being becomes radically changed in its aims, its character and
activities. Such critical stages often affect a whole species or
multitude of species simultaneously, as when vegetation of all kinds
suddenly bursts into new life in springtime.</p>


<p id='8.10' data-ref='bne_en-p437'>
Bahá’u’lláh declares that just as lesser living things have
times of sudden emergence into new and fuller life, so for mankind
also a “critical stage,” a time of “rebirth,” is at hand.
Then modes of life which have persisted from the dawn of history up
till now will be quickly, irrevocably, altered, and humanity enter on
a new phase of life as different from the old as the butterfly is
different from the caterpillar, or the bird from the egg. Mankind as
a whole, in the light of new Revelation, will attain to a new vision
of truth; as a whole country is illumined when the sun rises, so that
all men see clearly, where but an hour before everything was dark and
dim. <q class='abd'>“This is a new cycle of human power,”</q> says ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
<q class='abd'>“All the horizons of the world are luminous, and the world will
become indeed as a rose garden and a paradise.”</q> The analogies of
nature are all in favor of such a view; the Prophets of old have with
one accord foretold the advent of such a glorious day; the signs of
the times show clearly that profound and revolutionary changes in
human ideas and institutions are even now in progress. What could be
more futile and baseless therefore, than the pessimistic argument
that, although all things else change, human nature cannot change?</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_438'>First Steps Toward Unity</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.11' data-ref='bne_en-p438'>
As a means of promoting religious unity Bahá’u’lláh advocates
the utmost charity and tolerance, and calls on His followers to
<q class='baha'>“consort with the people of all religions with joy and gladness.”</q>
In His last Will and Testament He says: — </p>

  <p id='8.12' data-ref='bne_en-p439' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Conflict and contention are categorically forbidden in His Book. This
    is a decree of God in this Most Great Revelation. It is divinely
    preserved from annulment and is invested by Him with the splendor of
    His confirmation.</q> </p>


  <p id='8.13' data-ref='bne_en-p440' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>O ye that dwell on earth! The religion of God is for love and unity;
    make it not the cause of enmity or dissension.… We fain would hope
    that the people of Bahá may be guided by the blessed words: “Say:
    all things are of God.” This exalted utterance is like unto water
    for quenching the fire of hate and enmity which smoldereth within the
    hearts and breasts of men. By this single utterance contending
    peoples and kindreds will attain the light of true unity. Verily He
    speaketh the truth and leadeth the way. He is the All-Powerful, the
    Exalted, the Gracious.</q> </p>


<p id='8.14' data-ref='bne_en-p441' class='noid'>‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='8.15' data-ref='bne_en-p442' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>All must abandon prejudices and must even go to each other’s
    churches and mosques, for, in all of these worshipping places, the
    Name of God is mentioned. Since all gather to worship God, what
    difference is there? None of them worship Satan. The Muḥammadans
    must go to the churches of the Christians and the Synagogues of the
    Jews, and vice versa, the others must go to the Muḥammadan Mosques.
    They hold aloof from one another merely because of unfounded
    prejudices and dogmas. In America I went to the Jewish Synagogues,
    which are similar to the Christian Churches, and I saw them
    worshipping God everywhere.</q> </p>


  <p id='8.16' data-ref='bne_en-p443' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>In many of these places I spoke about the original foundations of the
    divine religions, and I explained to them the proofs of the validity
    of the divine prophets and of the Holy Manifestations. I encouraged
    them to do away with blind imitations. All of the leaders must,
    likewise, go to each other’s Churches and speak of the foundation
    and of the fundamental principles of the divine religions. In the
    utmost unity and harmony they must worship God, in the worshipping
    places of one another, and must abandon fanaticism.</q> </p>


  <p id='8.17' data-ref='bne_en-p444' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Were even these first steps accomplished and a state of friendly
    mutual tolerance established between the various religious sects,
    what a wonderful change would be brought about in the world! In order
    that real unity may be achieved, however, something more than this is
    required. For the disease of sectarianism, tolerance is a valuable
    palliative, but it is not a radical cure. It does not remove the
    cause of the trouble.</q> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_445'>The Problem of Authority</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.18' data-ref='bne_en-p445'>
The different religious communities have failed to unite in the past,
because the adherents of each have regarded the Founder of their own
community as the one supreme authority, and His law as the divine
law. Any Prophet Who proclaimed a different message was, therefore,
regarded as an enemy of the truth. The different sects of each
community have separated for similar reasons. The adherents of each
have accepted some subordinate authority and regarded some particular
version or interpretation of the Founder’s Message as the One True
Faith, and all others as wrong. It is obvious that while this state
of matters exists no true unity is possible. Bahá’u’lláh, on
the other hand, teaches that all the Prophets were bearers of
authentic messages from God; that each in His day gave the highest
teachings that the people could then receive, and educated men so
that they were able to receive further teachings from His successors.
He calls on the adherents of each religion, not to deny the Divine
Inspiration of their own Prophets, but to acknowledge the Divine
Inspiration of all other Prophets, to see that the teachings of all
are essentially in harmony, and are parts of a great plan for the
education and the unification of humanity. He calls on the people of
all denominations to show their reverence for their Prophets by
devoting their lives to the accomplishment of that unity for which
all the Prophets labored and suffered. In His letter to Queen
Victoria He likens the world to a sick man whose malady is aggravated
because he has fallen into the hands of unskilled physicians; and He
tells how the remedy may be effected: — </p>

  <p id='8.19' data-ref='bne_en-p446' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and
    mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of
    all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith. This can in
    no wise be achieved except through the power of a skilled, an all
    powerful and inspired Physician. This, verily, is the truth, and all
    else naught but error.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh</i>. </span></p>






<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_447'>Progressive Revelation</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.20' data-ref='bne_en-p447'>
A great stumbling block to many, in the way of religious unity, is
the difference between the Revelations given by the different
Prophets. What is commanded by one is forbidden by another; how then
can both be right, how can both be proclaiming the Will of God?
Surely the truth is One, and cannot change. Yes, the Absolute Truth
is One and cannot change, but the Absolute Truth is infinitely beyond
the present range of human understanding, and our conceptions of it
must constantly change. Our earlier, imperfect ideas will be by the
Grace of God replaced, as time goes on, by more and more adequate
conceptions. Bahá’u’lláh says, in a Tablet to some Bahá’ís
of Persia: — </p>

  <p id='8.21' data-ref='bne_en-p448' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O people! Words are revealed according to capacity so that the
    beginners may make progress. The milk must be given according to
    measure so that the babe of the world may enter into the Realm of
    Grandeur and be established in the Court of Unity.</q> </p>


<p id='8.22' data-ref='bne_en-p449'>
It is milk that strengthens the babe so that it can digest more solid
food later on. To say that because one Prophet is right in giving a
certain teaching at a certain time, therefore another Prophet must be
wrong Who gives a different teaching at a different time, is like
saying that because milk is the best food for the newborn babe,
therefore, milk and nothing but milk should be the food of the grown
man also, and to give any other diet would be wrong! ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
says: — </p>

  <p id='8.23' data-ref='bne_en-p450' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Each divine revelation is divided into two parts. The first part is
    essential and belongs to the eternal world. It is the exposition of
    Divine truths and essential principles. It is the expression of the
    Love of God. This is one in all the religions, unchangeable and
    immutable. The second part is not eternal; it deals with practical
    life, transactions and business, and changes according to the
    evolution of man and the requirements of the time of each Prophet.
    For example.… During the Mosaic period the hand of a person was cut
    off in punishment of a small theft; there was a law of an eye for an
    eye and a tooth for a tooth, but as these laws were not expedient in
    the time of Christ, they were abrogated. Likewise divorce had become
    so universal that there remained no fixed laws of marriage, therefore
    His Holiness Christ forbade divorce.</q> </p>


  <p id='8.24' data-ref='bne_en-p451' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>According to the exigencies of the time, His Holiness Moses revealed
    ten laws for capital punishment. It was impossible at that time to
    protect the community and to preserve social security without these
    severe measures, for the children of Israel lived in the wilderness
    of Tah, where there were no established courts of justice and no
    penitentiaries. But this code of conduct was not needed in the time
    of Christ. The history of the second part of religion is unimportant,
    because it relates to the customs of this life only; but the
    foundation of the religion of God is one, and His Holiness
    Bahá’u’lláh has renewed that foundation.</q> </p>


<p id='8.25' data-ref='bne_en-p452'>
The religion of God is the One Religion, and all the Prophets have
taught it, but it is a living and a growing thing, not lifeless and
unchanging. In the teaching of Moses we see the Bud; in that of
Christ the Flower; in that of Bahá’u’lláh the Fruit. The flower
does not destroy the bud, nor does the fruit destroy the flower. It
destroys not, but fulfills. The bud scales must fall in order that
the flower may bloom, and the petals must fall that the fruit may
grow and ripen. Were the bud scales and the petals wrong or useless,
then, that they had to be discarded? Nay, both in their time were
right and necessary; without them there could have been no fruit. So
it is with the various prophetic teachings; their externals change
from age to age, but each revelation is the fulfillment of its
predecessors; they are not separate or incongruous, but different
stages in the life history of the One Religion, which has in turn
been revealed as seed, as bud and as flower, and now enters on the
stage of fruition.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_453'>Infallibility of the Prophets</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.26' data-ref='bne_en-p453'>
Bahá’u’lláh teaches that everyone endowed with the Station of
Prophethood is given sufficient proofs of His Mission, is entitled to
claim obedience from all men and has authority to abrogate, alter or
add to the teachings of His predecessors. In the <i>Book of Íqán</i>
we read: — </p>

  <p id='8.27' data-ref='bne_en-p454' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>How far from the grace of the All Bountiful and from His loving
    providence and tender mercies it is to single out a soul from amongst
    all men for the guidance of His creatures, and, on one hand, to
    withhold from Him the full measure of His divine testimony, and, on
    the other, inflict severe retribution on His people for having turned
    away from His chosen One! Nay, the manifold bounties of the Lord of
    all beings have, at all times, through the Manifestations of His
    divine Essence, encompassed the earth and all that dwell therein.…</q> </p>


  <p id='8.28' data-ref='bne_en-p455' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>And yet, is not the object of every Revelation to effect a
    transformation in the whole character of mankind, a transformation
    that shall manifest itself both outwardly and inwardly, that shall
    affect both its inner life and external conditions? For if the
    character of mankind be not changed, the futility of God’s
    universal Manifestations would be apparent.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Kitáb-i-Íqán</i>. </span></p>


<p id='8.29' data-ref='bne_en-p456'>
God is the One infallible Authority, and the Prophets are infallible
because Their Message is the Message of God given to the world
through Them. That Message remains valid until it is superseded by a
later Message given by the same or another Prophet.</p>


<p id='8.30' data-ref='bne_en-p457'>
God is the great Physician Who alone can rightly diagnose the world’s
sickness and prescribe the appropriate remedy. The remedy prescribed
in one age is no longer suitable in a later age, when the condition
of the patient is different. To cling to the old remedy when the
physician has ordered new treatment is not to show faith in the
physician, but infidelity. It may be a shock to the Jew to be told
that some of the remedies for the world’s sickness which Moses
ordered over three thousand years ago are now out of date and
unsuitable; the Christian may be equally shocked when told that
Muḥammad had anything necessary or valuable to add to what Jesus
prescribed; and so also the Muslim, when asked to admit that the Báb
or Bahá’u’lláh had authority to alter the commands of Muḥammad;
but according to the Bahá’í view, true devotion to God implies
reverence to all His Prophets, and implicit obedience to His latest
Commands, as given by the Prophet for our own age. Only by such
devotion can true Unity be attained.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_458'>The Supreme Manifestation</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.31' data-ref='bne_en-p458' class='nodropcap'>
Like all the other Prophets, Bahá’u’lláh states His own Mission
in the most unmistakable terms.</p>


<p id='8.32' data-ref='bne_en-p459'>
In the Lawḥ-i-Aqdas, a Tablet addressed especially to Christians,
He says: — </p>

  <p id='8.33' data-ref='bne_en-p460' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>… Lo! The Father is come, and that which ye were promised in the
    Kingdom is fulfilled! This is the Word which the Son concealed, when
    to those around Him He said: “Ye cannot bear it now.” And when
    the appointed time was fulfilled and the Hour had struck, the Word
    shone forth above the horizon of the Will of God. Beware, O followers
    of the Son, that ye cast it not behind your backs. Take ye fast hold
    of it. Better is this for you than all that ye possess.… </q> </p>



  <p id='8.34' data-ref='bne_en-p461' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Verily, He Who is the Spirit of Truth is come to guide you unto all

    the earth, that which ye have and take fast hold of that which ye are
    bidden by the All-Powerful, He Who is the Bearer of the Trust of God.</q> </p>


<p id='8.35' data-ref='bne_en-p462'>
And in a letter to the Pope, written from Adrianople in 1867, He
says: — </p>

    <q class='baha'>Beware lest celebration hinder you from the Celebrated and worship

    the Dawning-place of Revelation! Tarry not, even for an hour! Are ye
    learned of the Gospel, and yet are unable to see the Lord of Glory?</q> </p>


  <p id='8.37' data-ref='bne_en-p464' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>This beseemeth you not, O learned concourse! Say then, if ye deny

Just as in these letters to Christians He announces the fulfillment
of the Gospel promises, so He proclaims also to Muḥammadan, Jews,
Zoroastrians and the people of other faiths the fulfillment of the
promises of their Holy Books. He addresses all men as the sheep of
God, who have hitherto been divided into different flocks and
sheltered in different folds. His message, He says, is the Voice of
God, the Good Shepherd, Who has come in the fullness of time to
gather His scattered sheep into one flock, removing the barriers
between them, that <q class='bible'>“there may be one fold and one shepherd.”</q></p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_466'>A New Situation</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.39' data-ref='bne_en-p466'>
The position of Bahá’u’lláh among the Prophets is unprecedented
and unique, because the condition of the world at the time of His
advent was unprecedented and unique. By a long and checkered process
of development in religion, science, art and civilization the world
had become ripe for a teaching of Unity. The barriers which in
previous centuries had made a world unity impossible were ready to
crumble when Bahá’u’lláh appeared, and since His birth, in
1817, and more especially since the promulgation of His teachings
began, these barriers have been breaking down in most astonishing
fashion. Be the explanation what it may, about the fact there can be
no doubt.</p>


<p id='8.40' data-ref='bne_en-p467'>
In the days of previous Prophets geographical barriers alone were
amply sufficient to prevent world unity. Now that obstacle has been
overcome. For the first time in human history men on opposite sides
of the globe are able to communicate with each other quickly and
easily. Things done in Europe yesterday are known in every continent
of the world today, and a speech made in America today may be read in
Europe, Asia and Africa tomorrow.</p>


<p id='8.41' data-ref='bne_en-p468'>
Another great obstacle was the language difficulty. Thanks to the
study and teaching of foreign languages, that difficulty has already
been to a large extent overcome; and there is every reason to suppose
that ere many years an international auxiliary language will be
adopted and taught in all the schools of the world. Then this
difficulty also will be completely removed.</p>


<p id='8.42' data-ref='bne_en-p469'>
The third great obstacle was religious prejudice and intolerance.
That, too, is disappearing. Men’s minds are becoming more open. The
education of the people is passing more and more out of the hands of
sectarian priests; and new and more liberal ideas can no longer be
prevented from penetrating into even the most exclusive and
conservative circles.</p>


<p id='8.43' data-ref='bne_en-p470'>
Bahá’u’lláh is thus the first of the great Prophets Whose
message has become known within a period of comparatively few years
in every quarter of the globe. Within a short time the essential
teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, translated from His own authentic
Writings, will be directly accessible to every man, woman and child
in the world who is able to read.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_471'>Fullness of the Bahá’í Revelation</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.44' data-ref='bne_en-p471'>
The Bahá’í Revelation is unprecedented and unique among the
faiths of the world by reason of the fullness and completeness of its
authentic records. The recorded words that can with certainty be
attributed to Christ, to Moses, to Zoroaster, to Buddha, to Krishna,
are very few, and leave many modern questions of great practical
importance unanswered. Many of the teachings commonly attributed to
these religious Founders are of doubtful authenticity, and some are
evidently accretions of later date. The Muḥammadans possess in the
Qur’án, and in a large store of traditions, a much fuller record
of the life and teachings of their Prophet, but Muḥammad Himself,
though inspired, was illiterate, as were most of His early followers.
The methods employed for recording and spreading His teachings were
in many respects unsatisfactory, and the authenticity of many of the
traditions is very doubtful. As a result, differences of
interpretation and conflicting opinions have caused divisions and
dissensions in Islam, as in all previous religious communities.</p>


<p id='8.45' data-ref='bne_en-p472'>
On the other hand, both the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh wrote
copiously and with great eloquence and power. As both were debarred
from public speaking and spent most of Their lives (after the
declaration of Their mission) in prison, They devoted a large
proportion of Their time to writing, with the result that in richness
of authentic scriptures the Bahá’í Revelation is unapproached by
any of its predecessors. Clear and full expositions are given of many
truths which were but dimly foreshadowed in previous revelations, and
the eternal principles of truth, which all the Prophets have taught,
have been applied to the problems which are facing the world
today — problems of the utmost complexity and difficulty, many of
which had not arisen in the days of former Prophets. It is evident
that this full record of authentic revelation must have a powerful
effect in preventing misunderstandings in the future and in clearing
up those misunderstandings of the past which have kept the various
sects asunder.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_473'>The Bahá’í Covenant</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.46' data-ref='bne_en-p473'>
The Bahá’í Revelation is unprecedented and unique in still
another way. Before the death of Bahá’u’lláh He repeatedly put
in writing a Covenant appointing his eldest son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Whom He often refers to as <q class='baha'>“The Branch,”</q> or <q class='baha'>“The Most Great
Branch,”</q> as the authorized interpreter of the teachings, and
declaring that any explanations or interpretations given by Him are
to be accepted as of equal validity with the words of Bahá’u’lláh
Himself. In His Will and Testament He says: — </p>

  <p id='8.47' data-ref='bne_en-p474' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Consider that which We revealed in Our Most Holy Book: “When the
    ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is
    ended, turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath
    branched from this Ancient Root.” The object of this sacred verse
    is none other except the Most Mighty Branch (‘Abdu’l-Bahá).</q> </p>


<p id='8.48' data-ref='bne_en-p475'>
And in the <i>Tablet of the Branch</i>, in which He explains the station of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, He says: — </p>

  <p id='8.49' data-ref='bne_en-p476' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Render thanks unto God, O people, for His appearance; for verily He
    is the most great Favor unto you, the most perfect bounty upon you;
    and through Him every moldering bone is quickened. Whoso turneth
    towards Him hath turned towards God, and whoso turneth away from Him
    hath turned away from My Beauty, hath repudiated My Proof, and
    transgressed against Me.</q> </p>


<p id='8.50' data-ref='bne_en-p477'>
After the death of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had abundant
opportunities, both in His own home and on His extensive travels, of
meeting people from all parts of the world and of all shades of
opinion. He heard all their questions, their difficulties and
objections, and gave full explanations which were carefully recorded
in writing. During a long series of years ‘Abdu’l-Bahá continued
this work of elucidating the teachings and showing their applications
to the most varied problems of modern life. Differences of opinion
which have arisen among believers have been referred to Him and
authoritatively settled, and thus the risks of future
misunderstandings have been further reduced.</p>


<p id='8.51' data-ref='bne_en-p478'>
Bahá’u’lláh further arranged that an International House of
Justice, representative of all Bahá’ís throughout the world,
should be elected to take charge of the affairs of the Cause, control
and coordinate all its activities, prevent divisions and schisms,
elucidate obscure matters, and preserve the teachings from corruption
and misrepresentation. The fact that this supreme administrative body
can not only initiate legislation on all matters not defined in the
Teachings, but also annul its own enactments when new conditions
require different measures, enables the Faith to expand and adapt
itself, like a living organism, to the needs and requirements of a
changing society.</p>


<p id='8.52' data-ref='bne_en-p479'>
Moreover, Bahá’u’lláh expressly forbade interpretation of the
teachings by anyone but the authorized interpreter. In His Will and
Testament ‘Abdu’l-Bahá appointed Shoghi Effendi to be the
Guardian of the Faith after Him and to be empowered to interpret the
Writings.</p>


<p id='8.53' data-ref='bne_en-p480'>
In a thousand or more years another Manifestation will appear, under
the shadow of Bahá’u’lláh, with clear proofs of His mission,
but until then the words of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
the Guardian and the decisions of the International House of Justice
constitute the authorities to which all believers must turn for
guidance. No Bahá’í may found a school or sect based on any
particular interpretation of the teachings or any supposed divine
revelation. Anyone contravening these injunctions is considered a
“Covenant-breaker.”<a data-fnid='1'></a></p>


<p id='8.54' data-ref='bne_en-p481' class='noid'>‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='8.55' data-ref='bne_en-p482' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>One of the enemies of the Cause is he who endeavors to interpret the
    words of Bahá’u’lláh and thereby colors the meaning according
    to his capacity, and collects around him a following, forming a
    different sect, promoting his own station, and making a division in
    the Cause.</q> </p>


<p id='8.56' data-ref='bne_en-p483' class='noid'>In another Tablet He writes: — </p>

  <p id='8.57' data-ref='bne_en-p484' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>These people (promoters of schism) are like the froth that gathers on
    the surface of the sea; a wave will surge from the ocean of the
    Covenant and through the power of the Abhá Kingdom will cast this
    foam ashore.… These corrupt thoughts that emanate from personal and
    evil intentions will all vanish, whereas the Covenant of God shall
    remain stable and secure.</q> </p>


<p id='8.58' data-ref='bne_en-p485'>
There is nothing to keep men from forsaking religion if they wish to
do so. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: <q class='abd'>“God Himself does not compel the
soul to become spiritual. The exercise of the free human will is
necessary.”</q> The spiritual Covenant, however, clearly makes
sectarianism <i>within</i> the Bahá’í community quite impossible.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_486'>No Professional Priesthood</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='8.59' data-ref='bne_en-p486'>
One other feature of the Bahá’í organization must be specially
mentioned, and that is the absence of a professional priesthood.
Voluntary contributions toward the expenses of teachers are permitted
and many devote their whole time to work for the Cause, but all
Bahá’ís are expected to share in the work of teaching, et cetera,
according to their opportunity and ability, and there is no special
class distinguished from their fellow believers by the exclusive
exercise of priestly functions and prerogatives.</p>


<p id='8.60' data-ref='bne_en-p487'>
In former ages priesthoods were necessary, because people were
illiterate and uneducated and were dependent on priests for their
religious instruction, for the conduct of religious rites and
ceremonies, for the administration of justice, et cetera. Now,
however, times have changed. Education is fast becoming universal,
and if the commands of Bahá’u’lláh are carried out, every boy
and girl in the world will receive a sound education. Each individual
will then be able to study the Scriptures for himself, to draw the
Water of Life for himself, direct from the Fountainhead. Elaborate
rites and ceremonies, requiring the services of a special profession
or caste, have no place in the Bahá’í system; and the
administration of justice is entrusted to the authorities instituted
for that purpose.</p>


<p id='8.61' data-ref='bne_en-p488'>
For a child a teacher is necessary, but the aim of the true teacher
is to fit his pupil to do without a teacher; to see things with his
own eyes, hear with his own ears, and understand with his own mind.
Just so, in the childhood of the race, the priest is necessary, but
his real work is to enable men to do without him: to see things
divine with their own eyes, hear them with their own ears and
understand them with their own minds. Now the priest’s work is all
but accomplished, and the aim of the Bahá’í teaching is to
complete that work, to make men independent of all save God, so that
they can turn directly to Him, that is, to His Manifestation. When
all turn to one Center, then there can be no cross-purposes or
confusion and the nearer all draw to the Center, the nearer they will
draw to each other.</p>

<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_490'>Religion the Basis of Civilization</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.2' data-ref='bne_en-p490'>
According to the Bahá’í view, the problems of human life,
individual and social, are so inconceivably complex that the ordinary
human intellect is incapable of itself of solving them aright. Only
the Omniscient fully knows the purpose of creation and how that
purpose may be achieved. Through the Prophets He shows to mankind the
true goal of human life and the right path of progress; and the
building up of a true civilization depends upon faithful adherence to
the guidance of prophetic Revelation. Bahá’u’lláh says: — </p>

  <p id='9.3' data-ref='bne_en-p491' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Religion is verily the chief instrument for the establishment of
    order in the world and of tranquillity amongst its peoples. The
    weakening of the pillars of religion hath strengthened the foolish
    and emboldened them and made them more arrogant. Verily I say: The
    greater the decline of religion, the more grievous the waywardness of
    the ungodly. This cannot but lead in the end to chaos and confusion.…</q> </p>


  <p id='9.4' data-ref='bne_en-p492' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Consider the civilization of the West, how it hath agitated and
    alarmed the peoples of the world. An infernal engine hath been
    devised, and hath proved so cruel a weapon of destruction that its
    like none hath ever witnessed or heard. The purging of such
    deeply-rooted and overwhelming corruptions cannot be effected unless
    the peoples of the world unite in pursuit of one common aim and
    embrace one universal faith.…</q> </p>


  <p id='9.5' data-ref='bne_en-p493' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O people of Bahá! Each one of the ordinances We have revealed is a
    mighty stronghold for the preservation of the world of being.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh</i>, Words of Paradise. </span></p>


<p id='9.6' data-ref='bne_en-p494'>
The present state of Europe and of the world in general eloquently
confirms the truth of these words written so many years ago. Neglect
of the prophetic commands and the prevalence of irreligion have been
accompanied by disorder and destruction on the most terrible scale,
and, without the change of heart and aim which is the essential
characteristic of true religion, the reform of society seems an utter
impossibility.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_495'>Justice</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.7' data-ref='bne_en-p495'>
In the little book of <i>Hidden Words</i>, in which Bahá’u’lláh
gives in brief the essence of the prophetic teachings, His first
counsel refers to the individual life: <q class='baha'>“Possess a pure, kindly and
radiant heart.”</q> The next indicates the fundamental principle of
true social life: — </p>

  <p id='9.8' data-ref='bne_en-p496' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O Son of Spirit!<br/>
    The best beloved of all things in My sight is
    Justice; turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it
    not that I may confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine
    own eyes and not through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine
    own knowledge and not through the knowledge of thy neighbor. Ponder
    this in thy heart; how it behooveth thee to be. Verily justice is My
    gift to thee and the sign of My loving-kindness. Set it then before
    thine eyes.</q> </p>


<p id='9.9' data-ref='bne_en-p497'>
The first essential of social life is that individuals should become
capable of discerning the true from the false and right from wrong,
and of seeing things in their true proportions. The greatest cause of
spiritual and social blindness, and the greatest foe of social
progress, is selfishness. Bahá’u’lláh says: — </p>

  <p id='9.10' data-ref='bne_en-p498' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O ye sons of intelligence! The thin eyelid prevents the eye from
    seeing the world and what is contained therein. Then think of the
    result when the curtain of greed covers the sight of the heart!</q> </p>


  <p id='9.11' data-ref='bne_en-p499' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O people! The darkness of greed and envy obscures the light of the
    soul as the cloud prevents the penetration of the sun’s rays.</q>
     <span class='block reference'>(Tablet to a Zoroastrian.) <span></p>


<p id='9.12' data-ref='bne_en-p500'>
Long experience is at last convincing men of the truth of the
prophetic teaching that selfish views and selfish actions inevitably
bring social disaster, and that if humanity is not to perish
ingloriously, each must look on the things of his neighbor as of
equal importance with his own, and subordinate his own interests to
those of humanity as a whole. In this way the interests of each and
all will ultimately be best served. Bahá’u’lláh says: —

  <p id='9.13' data-ref='bne_en-p499' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“O son of man! If thine eyes be turned towards mercy, forsake the things
    that profit thee, and cleave unto that which will profit mankind. And
    if thine eyes be turned towards justice, choose thou for thy neighbor
    that which thou choosest for thyself.”</q>

<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_501'>Government</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.14' data-ref='bne_en-p501'>
The teachings of Bahá’u’lláh contain two different types of
reference to the question of true social order. One type is
exemplified in the tablets revealed to the Kings, which deal with the
problem of government as existing in the world during Bahá’u’lláh’s
life on earth; the other references are to the new order to be
developed within the Bahá’í community itself.</p>


<p id='9.15' data-ref='bne_en-p502'>
Hence arises the sharp contrast between such passages as: <q class='baha'>“The one
true God, exalted be His glory, hath ever regarded, and will continue
to regard, the hearts of men as His own, His exclusive possession.
All else, whether pertaining to land or sea, whether riches or glory,
He hath bequeathed unto the Kings and rulers of the earth”</q> and <q class='baha'>“It
beseemeth all men, in this Day, to take firm hold on the Most Great
Name, and to establish the unity of all mankind. There is no place to
flee to, no refuge that any one can seek, except Him.”</q>
<span class='ref'> — <i>Gleanings
from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh</i>.</span></p>


<p id='9.16' data-ref='bne_en-p503'>
The apparent incompatibility of these two views is removed when we
observe the distinction which Bahá’u’lláh makes between the
<q class='baha'>“Lesser Peace”</q> and the <q class='baha'>“Most Great Peace.”</q> In His tablets to
the Kings Bahá’u’lláh called upon them to assemble and take
measures for the maintenance of political peace, the reduction of
armaments and the removal of the burdens and insecurity of the poor.
But His words make it perfectly clear that their failure to respond
to the needs of the time would result in wars and revolutions leading
to the overthrow of the old order. Therefore, on the one hand He
said: <q class='baha'>“What mankind needeth in this day is obedience unto them that
are in authority,”</q> and on the other, <q class='baha'>“Those men who, having
amassed the vanities and ornaments of the earth, have turned away
disdainfully from God — these have lost both this world and the world
to come. Erelong, will God, with the Hand of Power, strip them of
their possessions, and divest them of the robe of His bounty.”</q> <q class='baha'>“We
have a fixed time for you, O peoples. If ye fail, at the appointed
hour, to turn towards God, He, verily, will lay violent hold on you,
and will cause grievous afflictions to assail you from every
direction.”</q> <q class='baha'>“The signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now
be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order appeareth to be
lamentably defective.”</q> <q class='baha'>“We have pledged Ourselves to secure Thy
triumph upon earth and to exalt Our Cause above all men, though no
king be found who would turn his face towards Thee.”</q><span class='ref'> — <i>Gleanings
from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh</i>.</span></p>


    <p id='9.17' data-ref='bne_en-p504' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>The Great Being, wishing to reveal the prerequisites of the peace and
    tranquillity of the world and the advancement of its peoples, hath
    written: The time must come when the imperative necessity for the
    holding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will be
    universally realized. The rulers and kings of the earth must needs
    attend it, and participating in its deliberations, must consider such
    ways and means as will lay the foundations of the world’s Great
    Peace amongst men. Such a peace demandeth that the Great Powers
    should resolve, for the sake of the tranquillity of the peoples of
    the earth, to be fully reconciled among themselves. Should any kind
    take up arms against another, all should unitedly arise and prevent
    him.</q>
    <span class='block reference'> — <i>Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh</i>.</span></p>


<p id='9.18' data-ref='bne_en-p505'>
By such counsel, Bahá’u’lláh revealed the conditions under
which public responsibility must be discharged in this Day of God.
Appealing for international solidarity on the one hand, He no less
clearly warned the rulers that continuance of strife would destroy
their power. Now modern history confirms this warning, in the rise of
those coercive movements which in all civilized nations have attained
such destructive energy, and in the development of warfare to the
degree that victory is no longer attainable by any party. <q class='baha'>“Now that
ye have refused the Most Great Peace, hold ye fast unto this, the
Lesser Peace, that haply ye may in some degree better your own
condition and that of your dependents.”</q> <q class='baha'>“That which the Lord hath
ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument for the
healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one
universal Cause, one common Faith. This can in no wise be achieved
except through the power of a skilled, an all-powerful and inspired
Physician.”</q> — <span class='ref'><i>Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh</i>.</span></p>


<p id='9.19' data-ref='bne_en-p506'>
By the Lesser Peace is meant a political unity of states, while the
Most Great Peace is a unity embracing spiritual as well as political
and economic factors. <q class='baha'>“Soon will the present-day order be rolled
up, and a new one spread out in its stead.”</q><span class='ref'> — <i>Gleanings from the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh</i>.</span></p>


<p id='9.20' data-ref='bne_en-p507'>
In former ages, a government could concern itself with external
matters and material affairs, but today the function of government
demands a quality of leadership, of consecration and of spiritual
knowledge impossible save to those who have turned to God.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_508'>Political Freedom</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.21' data-ref='bne_en-p508'>
Although advocating as the ideal condition a representative form of
government, local, national and international, Bahá’u’lláh
teaches that this is possible only when men have attained a
sufficiently high degree of individual and social development.
Suddenly to grant full self-government to people without education,
who are dominated by selfish desires and are inexperienced in the
conduct of public affairs, would be disastrous. There is nothing more
dangerous than freedom for those who are not fit to use it wisely.
Bahá’u’lláh writes in the <i>Book of Aqdas</i>: — </p>

  <p id='9.22' data-ref='bne_en-p509' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Consider the pettiness of men’s minds. They ask for that which
    injureth them, and cast away the thing that profiteth them. They are,
    indeed, of those that are far astray. We find some men desiring
    liberty, and priding themselves therein. Such men are in the depths
    of ignorance.</q> </p>


  <p id='9.23' data-ref='bne_en-p510' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition, whose flames none can
    quench. Thus warneth you He Who is the Reckoner, the All-Knowing.
    Know ye that the embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the animal.
    That which beseemeth man is submission unto such restraints as will
    protect him from his own ignorance, and guard him against the harm of
    the mischief-maker. Liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of
    propriety, and to infringe on the dignity of his station. It debaseth
    him to the level of extreme depravity and wickedness.</q> </p>


  <p id='9.24' data-ref='bne_en-p511' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Regard men as a flock of sheep that need a shepherd for their
    protection. This, verily, is the truth, the certain truth. We approve

    others. We, verily, are the All-Knowing.</q> </p>

    hath apprehended the Purpose of God in whatever He hath revealed from
    the Heaven of His Will, that pervadeth all created things. Say: The
    liberty that profiteth you is to be found nowhere except in complete

force of good example, not on violence, for bringing about a better

<p id='9.34' data-ref='bne_en-p520'>
In making appointments, the only criterion must be fitness for the
position. Before this paramount consideration, all others, such as

    <q class='baha'>Governments should fully acquaint themselves with the conditions of

    position of the faithful, nor the despoiler rule in the place of the

<p id='9.36' data-ref='bne_en-p522'>
It needs but little consideration to show that when this principle

    where to lay their head.… This condition of affairs is wrong, and
    must be remedied. Now the remedy must be carefully undertaken. It
    cannot be done by bringing to pass absolute equality between men.
    Equality is a chimera! It is entirely impracticable. Even if equality
    could be achieved it could not continue; and if its existence were
    possible, the whole order of the world would be destroyed. The Law of
    Order must always obtain in the world of humanity. Heaven has so
    decreed in the creation of man.… Humanity, like a great army,
    requires a general, captains, underofficers in their degree, and
    soldiers, each with their appointed duties. Degrees are absolutely
    necessary to ensure an orderly organization. An army could not be
    composed of generals alone, or of captains only, or of nothing but
    soldiers without anyone in authority.</q> </p>


  <p id='9.39' data-ref='bne_en-p525' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Certainly, some being enormously rich and other lamentably poor, an
    organization is necessary to control and improve this state of
    affairs. It is important to limit riches, as it is also of importance
    to limit poverty. Either extreme is not good.… When we see poverty
    allowed to reach a condition of starvation, it is a sure sign that
    somewhere we shall find tyranny. Men must bestir themselves in this
    matter, and no longer delay in altering conditions which bring the
    misery of grinding poverty to a very large number of people.</q> </p>


  <p id='9.40' data-ref='bne_en-p526' class='blockquote'>

    <q class='abd'>There must be special laws made, dealing with these extremes of rich

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_528'>Public Finance</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.42' data-ref='bne_en-p528'>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá suggests that each town and village or district
should be entrusted as far as possible with the administration of
fiscal matters within its own area and should contribute its due
proportion for the expenses of the general government. One of the
principal sources of revenue should be a graduated income tax. If a
man’s income does not exceed his necessary expenditure he should
not be required to pay any tax, but in all cases where income exceeds
the necessary expenditure a tax should be levied, the percentage of
tax increasing as the surplus of income over necessary expenditure
increases.</p>


<p id='9.43' data-ref='bne_en-p529'>
On the other hand, if a person, through illness, poor crops, or other
cause for which he is not responsible, is unable to earn an income
sufficient to meet his necessary expenses for the year, then what he
lacks for the maintenance of himself and his family should be
supplied out of public funds.</p>


<p id='9.44' data-ref='bne_en-p530'>
There will also be other sources of public revenue, e.g. from
intestate estates, mines, treasure trove and voluntary contributions;
while among the expenditures will be grants for the support of the
infirm, of orphans, of schools, of the deaf and blind, and for the
maintenance of public health. Thus the welfare and comfort of all
will be provided for.<a data-fnid='1'></a></p>

<p id='9.45' data-ref='bne_en-p531'>
In a letter to the <i>Central Organization for a Durable Peace</i>,
written in 1919, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='9.46' data-ref='bne_en-p532' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is voluntary sharing of
    one’s property with others among mankind. This voluntary sharing is
    greater than (legally imposed) equality, and consists in this, that
    one should not prefer oneself to others, but rather should sacrifice
    one’s life and property for others. But this should not be
    introduced by coercion so that it becomes a law which man is
    compelled to follow. Nay, rather, man should voluntarily and of his
    own choice sacrifice his property and life for others, and spend
    willingly for the poor, just as is done in Persia among the Bahá’ís.</q> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_533'>Work for All</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.47' data-ref='bne_en-p533'>
One of the most important instructions of Bahá’u’lláh in regard
to the economic question is that all must engage in useful work.
There must be no drones in the social hive, no able-bodied parasites
on society. He says: — </p>

  <p id='9.48' data-ref='bne_en-p534' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>It is enjoined upon every one of you to engage in some form of
    occupation, such as crafts, trades and the like. We have graciously
    exalted your engagement in such work to the rank of worship unto God,
    the True One. Ponder ye in your hearts the grace and the blessings of
    God and render thanks unto Him at eventide and at dawn. Waste not
    your time in idleness and sloth. Occupy yourselves with that which
    profiteth yourselves and others. Thus hath it been decreed in this
    Tablet from whose horizon the daystar of wisdom and utterance shineth
    resplendent.</q> </p>


  <p id='9.49' data-ref='bne_en-p535' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>The most despised of men in the sight of God are those who sit idly
    and beg. Hold ye fast unto the cord of material means, placing your
    whole trust in God, the Provider of all means.</q>

<p id='9.50' data-ref='bne_en-p536'>
How much of the energy employed in the business world of today is
expended simply in canceling and neutralizing the efforts of other
people — in useless strife and competition! And how much in ways that
are still more injurious! Were all to work, and were all work,
whether of brain or hand, of a nature profitable to mankind, as
Bahá’u’lláh commands, then the supplies of everything necessary
for a healthy, comfortable and noble life would amply suffice for
all. There need be no slums, no starvation, no destitution, no
industrial slavery, no health-destroying drudgery.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_537'>The Ethics of Wealth</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.51' data-ref='bne_en-p537'>
According to the Bahá’í teachings, riches rightly acquired and
rightly used are honorable and praiseworthy. Services rendered should
be adequately rewarded. Bahá’u’lláh says in the Tablet of
Ṭarázát: — </p>

  <p id='9.52' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“The people of Bahá should not deny to any soul the
    reward due to him, … One must speak with fairness and appreciate
    such bounty.”</q></p>


<p id='9.53' data-ref='bne_en-p538'>
With regard to interest on money, Bahá’u’lláh writes in the
Tablet of I<u>sh</u>ráqát as follows: — </p>

  <p id='9.54' data-ref='bne_en-p539' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>… Many people stand in need of this. Because if there were no
    prospect for gaining interest, the affairs of men would suffer
    collapse or dislocation. One can seldom find a person who would
    manifest such consideration towards his fellowman, his countryman or
    towards his own brother and would show such tender solicitude for him
    as to be well-disposed to grant him a loan on benevolent terms.
    Therefore as a token of favor towards men We have prescribed that
    interest on money should be treated like other business transactions
    that are current amongst men.…</q> </p>


  <p id='9.55' data-ref='bne_en-p540' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>However, this is a matter that should be practised with moderation
    and fairness. Our Pen of Glory hath, as a token of wisdom and for the
    convenience of the people, desisted from laying down its limit.
    Nevertheless We exhort the loved ones of God to observe justice and
    fairness, and to do that which would prompt the friends of God to
    evince tender mercy and compassion towards each other.</q> </p>


  <p id='9.56' data-ref='bne_en-p541' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>[T]he conduct of these affairs hath been entrusted to the men of the
    House of Justice that they may enforce them according to the
    exigencies of the time and the dictates of wisdom.</q> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_542'>No Industrial Slavery</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.57' data-ref='bne_en-p542'>
In the <i>Book of Aqdas </i>Bahá’u’lláh forbids slavery, and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has explained that not only chattel slavery, but
also industrial slavery, is contrary to the law of God. When in the
United States in 1912, He said to the American people: — </p>

  <p id='9.58' data-ref='bne_en-p543' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Between 1860 and 1865 you did a wonderful thing; you abolished
    chattel slavery; but today you must do a much more wonderful thing:
    you must abolish industrial slavery.… </q> </p>



  <p id='9.59' data-ref='bne_en-p544' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The solution of economic questions will not be brought about by array
    of capital against labor, and labor against capital, in strife and
    conflict, but by the voluntary attitude of goodwill on both sides.
    Then a real and lasting justness of conditions will be secured.… </q> </p>



  <p id='9.60' data-ref='bne_en-p545' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Among the Bahá’ís there are no extortionate, mercenary and unjust
    practices, no rebellious demands, no revolutionary uprisings against
    existing governments.… </q> </p>



  <p id='9.61' data-ref='bne_en-p546' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>It will not be possible in the future for men to amass great fortunes
    by the labors of others. The rich will willingly divide. They will
    come to this gradually, naturally, by their own volition. It will
    never be accomplished by war and bloodshed.</q> </p>


<p id='9.62' data-ref='bne_en-p547'>
It is by friendly consultation and cooperation, by just copartnership
and profit-sharing, that the interests of both capital and labor will
be best served. The harsh weapons of the strike and lockout are
injurious, not only to the trades immediately affected, but to the
community as a whole. It is, therefore, the business of the
governments to devise means for preventing recourse to such barbarous
methods of settling disputes. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said at Dublin, New
Hampshire, in 1912: — </p>

  <p id='9.63' data-ref='bne_en-p548' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Now I want to tell you about the law of God. According to the divine
    law, employees should not be paid merely by wages. Nay, rather they
    should be partners in every work. The question of socialization is
    very difficult. It will not be solved by strikes for wages. All the
    governments of the world must be united, and organize an assembly,
    the members of which shall be elected from the parliaments and the
    noble ones of the nations. These must plan with wisdom and power, so
    that neither the capitalists suffer enormous losses, nor the laborers
    become needy. In the utmost moderation they should make the law, then
    announce to the public that the rights of the working people are to
    be effectively preserved; also the rights of the capitalists are to
    be protected. When such a general law is adopted, by the will of both
    sides, should a strike occur, all the governments of the world should
    collectively resist it. Otherwise the work will lead to much
    destruction, especially in Europe. Terrible things will take place.</q> </p>


  <p id='9.64' data-ref='bne_en-p549' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>One of the several causes of a universal European war will be this
    question. The owners of properties, mines and factories, should share
    their incomes with their employees, and give a fairly certain
    percentage of their profits to their workingmen, in order that the
    employees should receive, besides their wages, some of the general
    income of the factory, so that the employee may strive with his soul
    in the work.</q> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_550'>Bequest and Inheritance</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.65' data-ref='bne_en-p550'>
Bahá’u’lláh states that a person should be free to dispose of
his possessions during his lifetime in any way he chooses, and it is
incumbent on everyone to write a will stating how his property is to
be disposed of after his death. When a person dies without leaving a
will, the value of the property should be estimated and divided in
certain state proportions among seven classes of inheritors, namely,
children, wife or husband, father, mother, brothers, sisters and
teachers, the share of each diminishing from the first to the last.
In the absence of one or more of these classes, the share which would
belong to them goes to the public treasury, to be expended on the
poor, the fatherless and the widows, or on useful public works. If
the deceased has no heirs, then all his property goes to the public
treasury.</p>


<p id='9.66' data-ref='bne_en-p551'>
There is nothing in the law of Bahá’u’lláh to prevent a man
from leaving all his property to one individual if he pleases, but
Bahá’ís will naturally be influenced, in making their wills, by
the model Bahá’u’lláh has laid down for the case of intestate
estates, which ensures distribution of property among a considerable
number of heirs.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_552'>Equality of Men and Women</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.67' data-ref='bne_en-p552'>
One of the social principles to which Bahá’u’lláh attaches
great importance is that women should be regarded as the equals of
men and should enjoy equal rights and privileges, equal education and
equal opportunities.</p>


<p id='9.68' data-ref='bne_en-p553'>
The great means on which He relies for bringing about the
emancipation of women is universal education. Girls are to receive as
good an education as boys. In fact, the education of girls is even
more important than that of boys, for in time these girls will become
mothers, and, as mothers, they will be the first teachers of the next
generation. Children are like green and tender branches; if the early
training is right they grow straight, and if it is wrong they grow
crooked; and to the end of their lives they are affected by the
training of their earliest years. How important, then, that girls
should be well and wisely educated!</p>


<p id='9.69' data-ref='bne_en-p554'>
During His Western tours, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had frequent occasion to
explain the Bahá’í teachings on this subject. At a meeting of the
Women’s Freedom League in London in January 1913, He said: — </p>

  <p id='9.70' data-ref='bne_en-p555' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Humanity is like a bird with its two wings — the one is male, the
    other female. Unless both wings are strong and impelled by some
    common force, the bird cannot fly heavenwards. According to the
    spirit of this age, women must advance and fulfill their mission in
    all departments of life, becoming equal to men. They must be on the
    same level as men and enjoy equal rights. This is my earnest prayer
    and it is one of the fundamental principles of Bahá’u’lláh.</q> </p>


  <p id='9.71' data-ref='bne_en-p556' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Some scientists have declared that the brains of men weigh more than
    those of women, and claim this as a proof of man’s superiority. Yet
    when we look around us we see people with small heads, whose brains
    must weigh little, who show the greatest intelligence and great
    powers of understanding; and others with big heads, whose brains must
    be heavy, and yet they are witless. Therefore the avoirdupois of the
    brain is no true measure of intelligence or superiority.</q> </p>


  <p id='9.72' data-ref='bne_en-p557' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>When men bring forward as a second proof of their superiority the
    assertion that women have not achieved as much as men, they use poor
    arguments which leave history out of consideration. If they kept
    themselves more fully informed historically, they would know that
    great women have lived and achieved great things in the past, and
    that there are many living and achieving great things today.</q> </p>


<p id='9.73' data-ref='bne_en-p558'>
Here ‘Abdu’l-Bahá described the achievements of Zenobia and
other great women of the past, concluding with an eloquent tribute to
the fearless Mary Magdalene, whose faith remained firm while that of
the apostles was shaken. He continued: — </p>

  <p id='9.74' data-ref='bne_en-p559' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Amongst the women of our own time is Qurratu’l-’Ayn, the daughter
    of a Muḥammadan priest. At the time of the appearance of the Báb
    she showed such tremendous courage and power that all who heard her
    were astonished. She threw aside her veil despite the immemorial
    custom of the women of Persia, and although it was considered
    impolite to speak with men, this heroic woman carried on
    controversies with the most learned men, and in every meeting she
    vanquished them. The Persian Government took her prisoner; she was
    stoned in the streets, anathematized, exiled from town to town,
    threatened with death, but she never failed in her determination to
    work for the freedom of her sisters. She bore persecution and
    suffering with the greatest heroism; even in prison she gained
    converts. To a Minister in Persia, in whose house she was imprisoned,
    she said: “You can kill me as soon as you like but you cannot stop
    the emancipation of women.” At last the end of her tragic life
    came; she was carried into a garden and strangled. She put on,
    however, her choicest robes as if she were going to join a bridal
    party. With such magnanimity and courage she gave her life, startling
    and thrilling all who saw her. She was truly a great heroine. Today
    in Persia, among the Bahá’ís, there are women who also show
    unflinching courage, and who are endowed with great poetic insight.
    They are most eloquent, and speak before large gatherings of people.</q> </p>


  <p id='9.75' data-ref='bne_en-p560' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Women must go on advancing; they must extend their knowledge of
    science, literature, history, for the perfection of humanity. Erelong
    they will receive their rights. Men will see women in earnest,
    bearing themselves with dignity, improving the civil and political
    life, opposed to warfare, demanding suffrage and equal opportunities.

When woman’s point of view receives due consideration and woman’s
will is allowed adequate expression in the arrangement of social
affairs, we may expect great advancement in matters which have often
been grievously neglected under the old regime of male dominance — such
matters as health, temperance, peace, and regard for the value of the
individual life. Improvements in these respects will have very
far-reaching and beneficent effects. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='9.77' data-ref='bne_en-p562' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The world in the past has been ruled by force, and man has dominated
    over woman by reason of his more forceful and aggressive qualities
    both of body and mind. But the balance is already shifting; force is
    losing its dominance, and mental alertness, intuition, and the
    spiritual qualities of love and service, in which woman is strong,
    are gaining ascendancy. Hence the new age will be an age less
    masculine and more permeated with the feminine ideals, or, to speak
    more exactly, will be an age in which the masculine and feminine
    elements of civilization will be more evenly balanced.</q>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_563'>Methods of Violence Discarded</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.78' data-ref='bne_en-p563'>
In bringing about the emancipation of women as in other matters,
Bahá’u’lláh counsels His followers to avoid methods of
violence. An excellent illustration of the Bahá’í method of
social reform has been given by the Bahá’í women in Persia, Egypt
and Syria. In these countries it is customary for Muḥammadan women
outside their homes to wear a veil covering the face. The Báb
indicated that in the New Dispensation women would be relieved from
this irksome restraint, but Bahá’u’lláh counsels His followers,
where no important question of morality is involved, to defer to
established customs until people become enlightened, rather than
scandalize those amongst whom they live, and arouse needless
antagonism. The Bahá’í women, therefore, although well aware that
the antiquated custom of wearing the veil is, for enlightened people,
unnecessary and inconvenient, yet quietly put up with the
inconvenience, rather than rouse a storm of fanatical hatred and
rancorous opposition by uncovering their faces in public. This
conformity to custom is in no way due to fear, but to an assured
confidence in the power of education and in the transforming and
life-giving effect of true religion. Bahá’ís in these regions are
devoting their energies to the education of their children,
especially their girls, and to the diffusion and promotion of the
Bahá’í ideals, well knowing that as the new spiritual life grows
and spreads among the people, antiquated customs and prejudices will
by and by be shed, as naturally and inevitably as bud scales are shed
in spring when the leaves and flowers expand in the sunshine.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_564'>Education</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.79' data-ref='bne_en-p564'>
Education — the instruction and guidance of men and the development
and training of their innate faculties — has been the supreme aim of
all the Holy Prophets since the world began, and in the Bahá’í
teachings the fundamental importance and limitless possibilities of
education are proclaimed in the clearest terms. The teacher is the
most potent factor in civilization and his work is the highest to
which men can aspire. Education begins in the mother’s womb and is
as unending as the life of the individual. It is a perennial
necessity of right living and the foundation of both individual and
social welfare. When education on right lines becomes general,
humanity will be transformed and the world will become a paradise. </p>



<p id='9.80' data-ref='bne_en-p565'>
At present a really well educated man is the rarest of phenomena, for
nearly everyone has false prejudices, wrong ideals, erroneous
conceptions and bad habits drilled into him from babyhood. How few
are taught from their earliest childhood to love God with all their
hearts and dedicate their lives to Him; to regard service to humanity
as the highest aim in life; to develop their powers to the best
advantage for the general good of all! Yet surely these are the
essential elements of a good education. Mere cramming of the memory
with facts about arithmetic, grammar, geography, languages, etc., has
comparatively little effect in producing noble and useful lives.</p>


<p id='9.81' data-ref='bne_en-p566'>Bahá’u’lláh says that education must be universal: — </p>

    <q class='baha'>Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and

    commanded unto him, the Trustees are then to take from him that which
    is required for their instruction, if he be wealthy and, if not, the
    matter devolveth upon the House of Justice. Verily, have We made it a
    shelter for the poor and needy. He that bringeth up his son or the
    son of another, it is as though he hath brought up a son of Mine;
    upon him rest My Glory, My loving-kindness, My Mercy, that have

<p id='9.84' data-ref='bne_en-p569'>
In the Bahá’í view the child’s nature is not like so much wax
that can be molded indifferently to any shape according to the will
of the teacher. Nay, each from the first has his own God-given
character and individuality which can develop to the best advantage
only in a particular way; and that way in each case is unique. No two
people have exactly the same capabilities and talents, and the true
educator will never attempt to force two natures into the same mold.
In fact, he will never attempt to force any nature into any mold.
Rather he will reverently tend the developing powers of the young
nature, encourage and protect them, and supply the nourishment and
assistance which they need. His work is like that of a gardener
tending different plants. One plant likes the bright sunshine,
another the cool shade; one loves the water’s edge and another the
dry knoll; one thrives best on sandy soil and another on rich loam.
Each must have its needs appropriately supplied, else its perfections
can never be fully revealed. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='9.85' data-ref='bne_en-p570' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The Prophets acknowledge that education hath a great effect upon the
    human race, but They declare that minds and comprehensions are
    originally different. We see that certain children of the same age,
    nativity and race, nay, from the same household, under the tutorship
    of the same teacher, differ in minds and comprehensions. No matter
    how the shell is educated (or polished) it can never become the
    radiant pearl. The black stone will not become the world-illuminating
    gem. The thorny cactus can never by training and development become
    the blessed tree. That is to say, training doth not change the
    essential nature of the human gem, but it produceth a marvelous
    effect. By this effective power all that is latent, of virtues and
    capacities in the human reality, will be revealed.</q> </p>

<p id='9.86' data-ref='bne_en-p571'>
The thing of paramount importance in education is character training.
With regard to this, example is more effective than precept, and the
lives and characters of the child’s parents, teachers and habitual
associates are factors of the utmost importance. </p>



<p id='9.87' data-ref='bne_en-p572'>
The Prophets of God are the great educators of mankind, and Their
counsels and the story of Their lives should be instilled into the
child’s mind as soon as it is able to grasp them. Especially
important are the words of the Supreme Teacher, Bahá’u’lláh,
Who reveals the root principles on which the civilization of the
future must be built up. He says: — </p>

  <p id='9.88' data-ref='bne_en-p573' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Teach your children the verses revealed from the heaven of majesty
    and power, so that, in most melodious tones, they may recite the

<p id='9.89' data-ref='bne_en-p574'>
Training in arts, sciences, crafts and useful professions is regarded
as important and necessary. Bahá’u’lláh says: — </p>

  <p id='9.90' data-ref='bne_en-p575' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Knowledge is as wings to man’s life, and a ladder for his ascent.
    Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone. The knowledge of such
    sciences, however, should be acquired as can profit the peoples of
    the earth, and not those which begin with words and end with words.
    Great indeed is the claim of scientists and craftsmen on the peoples
    of the world. Unto this beareth witness the Mother Book on the day of
    His return. Happy are those possessed of a hearing ear. In truth,
    knowledge is a veritable treasure for man, and a source of glory, of
    bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer and gladness unto
    him.</q>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_576'>Treatment of Criminals</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='9.91' data-ref='bne_en-p576' class='nodropcap'>
In a talk on the right method of treating criminals, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
spoke as follows: — </p>

  <p id='9.92' data-ref='bne_en-p577' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>… the most essential thing is that the people must be educated in
    such a way … that they will avoid and shrink from perpetrating
    crimes, so that the crime itself will appear to them as the greatest
    chastisement, the utmost condemnation and torment. Therefore no
    crimes which require punishment will be committed.… </q> </p>



    <p id='9.93' data-ref='bne_en-p578' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>… if someone oppresses, injures, and wrongs another, and the
    wronged man retaliates, this is vengeance, and is censurable.… If
    ‘Amru dishonours Zaid, the latter has not the right to dishonour
    ‘Amru; if he does so, this is vengeance, and is very reprehensible.
    No, rather he must return good for evil, and not only forgive, but
    also, if possible, be of service to his oppressor. This conduct is
    worthy of man; for what advantage does he gain by vengeance? The two
    actions are equivalent; if one action is reprehensible, both are
    reprehensible. The only difference is that one was committed first,
    the other later.</q></p>


  <p id='9.94' data-ref='bne_en-p579' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>But the community has the right of defense and of self-protection;
    moreover, the community has no hatred nor animosity for the murderer:
    it imprisons or punishes him merely for the protection and security
    of others.… </q> </p>



  <p id='9.95' data-ref='bne_en-p580' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Thus when Christ said: “Whosoever shall smite thee on the right
    cheek, turn to him the left one also,” it was for the purpose of
    teaching men not to take personal revenge. He did not mean that if a
    wolf should fall upon a flock of sheep and wish to destroy it, that
    the wolf should be encouraged to do so. No, if Christ had known that
    a wolf had entered the fold and was about to destroy the sheep, most
    certainly he would have prevented it.… </q> </p>



  <p id='9.96' data-ref='bne_en-p581' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>… the constitution of the communities depends upon justice.…
    Then what Christ meant by forgiveness and pardon is not that, when
    nations attack you, burn your homes, plunder your goods, assault your
    wives, children, and relatives, and violate your honor, you should be
    submissive in the presence of these tyrannical foes, and allow them
    to perform all their cruelties and oppressions. No, the words of
    Christ refer to the conduct of two individuals towards each other: if
    one person assaults another, the injured one should forgive him. But
    the communities must protect the rights of man.… </q> </p>



  <p id='9.97' data-ref='bne_en-p582' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>One thing remains to be said: it is that the communities are day and
    night occupied in making penal laws, and in preparing and organizing
    instruments and means of punishment. They build prisons, make chains
    and fetters, arrange places of exile and banishment, and different
    kinds of hardships and tortures, and think by these means to
    discipline criminals; whereas, in reality, they are causing
    destruction of morals and perversion of characters. The community, on
    the contrary, ought day and night to strive and endeavor with the
    utmost zeal and effort to accomplish the education of men, to cause
    them day by day to progress and to increase in science and knowledge,
    to acquire virtues, to gain good morals and to avoid vices, so that
    crimes may not occur.</q>

<p id='9.98' data-ref='bne_en-p583'>
The importance of the press as a means of diffusing knowledge and
educating the people, and its power as a civilizing force, when
rightly directed, are fully recognized by Bahá’u’lláh. He
writes: — </p>

  <p id='9.99' data-ref='bne_en-p584' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>In this Day the secrets of the earth are laid bare before the eyes of
    men. The pages of swiftly-appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror
    of the world. They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers
    peoples and kindreds. They both reflect them and make them known.
    They are a mirror endowed with hearing, sight and speech. This is an
    amazing and potent phenomenon. However, it behoveth the writers
    thereof to be purged from the promptings of evil passions and desires
    and to be attired with the raiment of justice and equity. They should
    enquire into situations as much as possible and ascertain the facts,

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_587'>Conflict versus Concord</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='10.2' data-ref='bne_en-p587'>
During the past century scientists have devoted an immense amount of
study to the struggle for existence in the plant and animal world,
and, amid the perplexities of social life, many have turned for
guidance to the principles which have been found to hold good in the
lower world of nature. In this way they have come to regard rivalry
and conflict as necessities of life, and the ruthless killing out of
the weaker members of society as a legitimate or even necessary means
of improving the race. Bahá’u’lláh tells us, on the other hand,
that, if we wish to ascend the scale of progress, instead of looking
backward to the animal world, we must direct our gaze forward and
upward, and must take not the beasts, but the Prophets as our guides.
The principles of unity, concord and compassion taught by the
Prophets are the very antithesis of those dominating the animal
struggle for self-preservation, and we must choose between them, for
they cannot be reconciled. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='10.3' data-ref='bne_en-p588' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>In the world of nature the dominant note is the struggle for
    existence — the result of which is the survival of the fittest. The
    law of the survival of the fittest is the origin of all difficulties.
    It is the cause of war and strife, hatred and animosity, between
    human beings. In the world of nature there is tyranny, egoism,
    aggression, overbearance, usurpation of the rights of others and
    other blameworthy attributes which are defects of the animal world.
    Therefore, so long as the requirements of the natural world play
    paramount part among the children of men, success and prosperity are
    impossible. Nature is warlike, nature is bloodthirsty, nature is
    tyrannical, for <i>nature is unaware of God the Almighty</i>. That is
    why these cruel qualities are natural to the animal world.</q> </p>


  <p id='10.4' data-ref='bne_en-p589' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Therefore the Lord of mankind, having great love and mercy, has
    caused the appearance of the prophets and the revelation of the Holy
    Books, so that through divine education humanity may be released from
    the corruption of nature and the darkness of ignorance, be confirmed
    with ideal virtues and spiritual attributes, and become the
    dawning-place of merciful emotions.… </q> </p>



  <p id='10.5' data-ref='bne_en-p590' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>A hundred thousand times, alas! that ignorant prejudice, unnatural
    differences and antagonistic principles are yet displayed by the
    nations of the world toward one another, thus causing the retardation
    of general progress. This retrogression comes from the fact that the
    principles of divine civilization are completely abandoned, and the
    teachings of the prophets are forgotten.</q> </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_591'>The Most Great Peace</h3>

<p id='10.6' data-ref='bne_en-p591'>
In all ages the Prophets of God have foretold the coming of an era of
<q class='bible'>“peace on earth, goodwill among men.”</q> As we have already seen
Bahá’u’lláh, in the most glowing and confident terms, confirms
these prophecies and declares that their fulfillment is at hand.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='10.7' data-ref='bne_en-p592' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>… in this marvelous cycle, the earth will be transformed, and the
    world of humanity arrayed in tranquillity and beauty. Disputes,
    quarrels, and murders will be replaced by peace, truth, and concord;
    among the nations, peoples, races, and countries, love and amity will
    appear. Cooperation and union will be established, and finally war
    will be entirely suppressed.… Universal peace will raise its tent
    in the centre of the earth, and the Blessed Tree of Life will grow
    and spread to such an extent that it will overshadow the East and the
    West. Strong and weak, rich and poor, antagonistic sects and hostile
    nations — which are like the wolf and the lamb, the leopard and kid,
    the lion and calf — will act towards each other with the most
    complete love, friendship, justice, and equity. The world will be
    filled with science, with the knowledge of the reality of the

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_593'>Religious Prejudices</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='10.8' data-ref='bne_en-p593'>
In order to see clearly how the Most Great Peace may be established,
let us first examine the principle causes that have led to war in the
past and see how Bahá’u’lláh proposes to deal with each.</p>


<p id='10.9' data-ref='bne_en-p594'>
One of the most fertile causes of war has been religious prejudice.
With regard to this the Bahá’í teachings show clearly that
animosity and conflict between people of different religions and
sects have always been due, not to true religion, but to the want of
it, and to its replacement by false prejudices, imitations and
misrepresentations.</p>


<p id='10.10' data-ref='bne_en-p595' class='noid'>In one of His talks in Paris, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: — </p>

  <p id='10.11' data-ref='bne_en-p596' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Religion should unite all hearts and cause wars and disputes to
    vanish from the face of the earth; it should give birth to
    spirituality, and bring light and life to every soul. If religion
    becomes a cause of dislike, hatred and division it would be better to
    be without it, and to withdraw from such a religion would be a truly
    religious act. For it is clear that the purpose of a remedy is to
    cure, but if the remedy only aggravates the complaint, it had better
    be left alone. Any religion which is not a cause of love and unity is
    no religion.</q> </p>


<p id='10.12' data-ref='bne_en-p597' class='noid'>Later He says: — </p>

  <p id='10.13' data-ref='bne_en-p598' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>From the beginning of human history down to the present time the
    various religions of the world have anathematized and accused each
    other of falsity.… They have shunned each other most rigidly,
    exercising mutual animosity and rancor. Consider the record of
    religious warfare.… One of the greatest religious wars, the
    Crusades, extended over a period of two hundred years.… Sometimes
    the crusaders were successful, killing, pillaging and taking captive
    the Muslim people; sometimes the Muslims were victorious, inflicting
    bloodshed, death and ruin in turn upon the invaders. So they
    continued for two centuries, alternately fighting with fury and
    relaxing from weakness, until the European religionists withdrew from
    the East, leaving ashes of desolation behind them and finding their
    own nations in a condition of turbulence and upheaval.… Yet this
    was only one of the “Holy wars.” Consider and reflect.</q> </p>


  <p id='10.14' data-ref='bne_en-p599' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Religious wars have been many. Nine hundred thousand martyrs to the
    Protestant cause was the record of conflict and difference between
    that sect of Christians and the Catholics.… How many languished in
    prisons! How merciless the treatment of captives! All in the name of
    religion! …</q> </p>


  <p id='10.15' data-ref='bne_en-p600' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>[T]he Christians and Muslims considered the Jews satanic and the
    enemies of God. Therefore, they cursed and persecuted them. Great
    numbers of Jews were killed, their houses burned and pillaged, their
    children carried into captivity. The Jews in turn regarded the
    Christians as infidels and the Muslims as enemies and destroyers of
    the law of Moses. Therefore, they call down vengeance upon them and
    curse them even to this day.…</q> </p>


  <p id='10.16' data-ref='bne_en-p601' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>When the light of Bahá’u’lláh dawned from the East, He
    proclaimed the promise of the oneness of humanity. He addressed all
    mankind, saying, Ye are all the fruits of one tree. There are not
    two trees: one a tree of divine mercy, the other the tree of Satan.”…
    it is not meet that one human being should consider another human
    being as bad; nay, rather, all mankind are the servants of one God;
    God is the Father of all; there is not a single exception to that
    law. There are no people of Satan; all belong to the Merciful. There
    is no darkness; all is light. All are the servants of God, and man
    must love humanity from his heart. He must, verily, behold humanity
    as submerged in the divine mercy.”</q> </p>


  <p id='10.17' data-ref='bne_en-p602' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Bahá’u’lláh has made no exception to this rule. He said that
    among mankind there may be those who are ignorant; they must be
    trained.… Some are sick; they must be treated. Some are immature;
    they must be helped to attain maturity. In other respects humanity is
    submerged in the ocean of divine mercy.</q> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_603'>Racial and Patriotic Prejudices</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='10.18' data-ref='bne_en-p603'>
The Bahá’í doctrine of the unity of mankind strikes at the root
of another cause of war, namely, racial prejudice. Certain races have
assumed themselves to be superior to others and have taken for
granted, on the principle of “survival of the fittest,” that this
superiority gives them the right to exploit for their own advantage,
or even to exterminate, weaker races. Many of the blackest pages in
the world’s history are examples of the pitiless application of
this principle. According to the Bahá’í view people of every race
are of equal value in the sight of God. All have wonderful innate
capacities which only require suitable education for their
development, and each can play a part, which, instead of
impoverishing, will enrich and complete the life of all the other
members of the body of humanity. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='10.19' data-ref='bne_en-p604' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Concerning the prejudice of race; it is an illusion, a superstition
    pure and simple, for God created us all of one race.… In the
    beginning also there were no limits and boundaries between the
    different lands; no part of the earth belonged more to one people
    than to another. In the sight of God there is no difference between
    the various races. Why should man invent such a prejudice? How can we
    uphold war caused by such an illusion? God has not created men that
    they should destroy one another. All races, tribes, sects and classes
    share equally in the bounty of their Heavenly Father.</q> </p>


  <p id='10.20' data-ref='bne_en-p605' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The only real difference lies in the degree of faithfulness, of
    obedience to the laws of God. There are some who are as lighted
    torches; there are others who shine as stars in the sky of humanity.</q> </p>


  <p id='10.21' data-ref='bne_en-p606' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The lovers of mankind, these are the superior men, of whatever
    nation, creed or color they may be.</q> </p>



<p id='10.22' data-ref='bne_en-p607'>
Equally mischievous with racial prejudice is political or patriotic
prejudice. The time has now come when narrow national patriotisms
should be merged in the wider patriotism whose country is the world.
Bahá’u’lláh says: — </p>

  <p id='10.23' data-ref='bne_en-p608' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Of old it hath been revealed: “Love of one’s country is an
    element of the Faith of God.” The Tongue of Grandeur hath … in
    the day of His manifestation proclaimed: “It is not his to boast
    who loveth his country, but it is his who loveth the world.”
    Through the power released by these exalted words He hath lent a
    fresh impulse, and set a new direction, to the birds of men’s
    hearts, and hath obliterated every trace of restriction and
    limitation from God’s Holy Book.</q>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_609'>Territorial Ambitions</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='10.24' data-ref='bne_en-p609'>
Many are the wars which have been fought over pieces of territory
whose possession has been coveted by two or more rival nations. The
greed of possession has been as fertile a cause of strife among
nations as among individuals. According to the Bahá’í view, land
rightly belongs not to individual men or individual nations but to
humanity as a whole; nay, rather, it belongs to God alone, and all
men are but tenants. </p>



<p id='10.25' data-ref='bne_en-p610'>
On the occasion of the Battle of Benghazi<a data-fnid='1'></a>,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: — </p>

  <p id='10.26' data-ref='bne_en-p611' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The news of the Battle of Benghazi grieves my heart. I wonder at the
    human savagery that still exists in the world: How is it possible for
    men to fight from morning till night, killing each other, shedding
    the blood of their fellowmen? And for what object? To gain possession
    of a part of the earth! Even the animals when they fight have an
    immediate and more reasonable cause for their attacks. How terrible
    is it that men who are of the higher kingdom can descend to slaying
    and bringing misery to their fellow beings for the possession of a
    tract of land — the highest of created beings fighting to obtain the
    lowest form of matter, earth.</q> </p>


  <p id='10.27' data-ref='bne_en-p612' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Land belongs not to one people but to all people. The earth is not
    man’s home but his tomb.</q> </p>


  <p id='10.28' data-ref='bne_en-p613' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>However great the conqueror, however many countries he may reduce to
    slavery, he is unable to retain any part of these devastated lands
    but one tiny portion — his tomb.</q> </p>


  <p id='10.29' data-ref='bne_en-p614' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>If more land is required for the improvement of the condition of the
    people, for the spread of civilization … surely it would be
    possible to acquire peaceably the necessary extension of territory.
    But war is made for the satisfaction of men’s ambition. For the
    sake of worldly gain to the few terrible misery is brought to
    numberless homes, breaking the hearts of hundred of men and women.… </q> </p>



  <p id='10.30' data-ref='bne_en-p615' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>I charge you all that each one of you concentrate all the thoughts of
    his heart on love and unity. When a thought of war comes, oppose it
    by a stronger thought of peace. A thought of hatred must be destroyed
    by a more powerful thought of love. When soldiers of the world draw
    their swords to kill, soldiers of God clasp each other’s hands. So
    may all the savagery of men disappear by the mercy of God, working
    through the pure in heart and the sincere of soul. Do not think the
    peace of the world an ideal impossible to attain. Nothing is
    impossible to the divine benevolence of God. If you desire with all
    your heart friendship with every race on earth, your thought,
    spiritual and positive will spread; it will become the desire of
    others, growing stronger until it reaches the minds of all men.</q> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_616'>Universal Language</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='10.31' data-ref='bne_en-p616'>
Having glanced at the principal causes of war and how they may be
avoided, we may now proceed to examine certain constructive proposals
made by Bahá’u’lláh with a view to achieving the Most Great
Peace.</p>


<p id='10.32' data-ref='bne_en-p617'>
The first deals with the establishment of a universal auxiliary
language. Bahá’u’lláh refers to this matter in the <i>Book of
Aqdas</i> and in many of His Tablets. Thus in the Tablet of I<u>sh</u>ráqát
He says: — </p>

  <p id='10.33' data-ref='bne_en-p618' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>The sixth I<u>sh</u>ráq is union and concord amongst the children of
    men. From the beginning of time the light of unity hath shed its
    divine radiance upon the world, and the greatest means for the
    promotion of that unity is for the peoples of the world to understand
    one another’s writing and speech. In former Epistles We have
    enjoined upon the Trustees of the House of Justice either to choose
    one language from among those now existing or to adopt a new one, and
    in like manner to select a common script, both of which should be
    taught in all the schools of the world. Thus will the earth be
    regarded as one country and one home.</q> </p>



<p id='10.34' data-ref='bne_en-p619'>
About the time when this proposal of Bahá’u’lláh was first
given to the world, there was born in Poland a boy named Ludovic
Zamenhof, who was destined to play a leading part in carrying it into
effect. Almost from his infancy, the ideal of a universal language
became a dominant motive in Zamenhof’s life, and the result of his
devoted labors was the invention and widespread adoption of the
language known as Esperanto, which has now stood the test of many
years and has proved to be a very satisfactory medium of
international intercourse. It has the great advantage that it can be
mastered in about a twentieth part of the time required to master
such languages as English, French or German. At an Esperanto banquet
given in Paris in February 1913, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: — </p>

  <p id='10.35' data-ref='bne_en-p620' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Today one of the chief causes of the differences in Europe is the
    diversity of languages. We say this man is a German, the other is an
    Italian, then we meet an Englishman and then again a Frenchman.
    Although they belong to the same race, yet language is the greatest
    barrier between them. Were a universal auxiliary language in

    <q class='abd'>His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh wrote about this international
    language more than forty years ago. He says that as long as an
    international language is not adopted, complete union between the
    various sections of the world will be unrealized, for we observe that
    misunderstandings keep people from mutual association, and these
    misunderstandings will not be dispelled except through an

    <q class='abd'>Generally speaking, the whole people of the Orient are not fully
    informed of events in the West, neither can the Westerners put
    themselves in sympathetic touch with the Easterners; their thoughts
    are enclosed in a casket — the international language will be the
    master key to open it. Were we in possession of a universal language,
    the Western books could easily be translated into that language, and
    the Eastern peoples be informed of their contents. In the same way
    the books of the East could be translated into that language for the
    benefit of the people in the West. The greatest means of progress
    towards the union of East and West will be a common language. It will
    make the whole world one home and become the strongest impulse for
    human advancement. It will upraise the standard of the oneness of
    humanity. It will make the earth one universal commonwealth. It will
    be the cause of love between the children of men. It will cause good
    fellowship between the various races.</q> </p>

    <q class='abd'>Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof<a data-fnid='2'></a>
    has invented the Esperanto language. It has all the potential
    qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All
    of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for
    in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort
    and self-sacrifice on the part of its devotees Esperanto will become
    universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and
    spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a
    broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of
    the world, and become a part of the curriculum in all the public
    schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all
    the future international conferences and congresses, so that all
    people need acquire only two languages — one their own tongue and the
    other the international language. Then perfect union will be
    established between all the people of the world. Consider how
    difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one
    studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not
    know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost
    effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.</q> </p>

While these allusions to Esperanto are specific and encouraging, it
remains true that until the House of Justice has acted on the matter
in accordance with Bahá’u’lláh’s instruction the Bahá’í

<p id='10.41' data-ref='bne_en-p626'>
Another proposal frequently and powerfully advocated by Bahá’u’lláh
was that a Universal League of Nations should be formed for the
maintenance of international peace. In a letter to Queen Victoria,
written while He was still a prisoner in the barracks of ‘Akká,<a data-fnid='3'></a>
He said: — </p>

  <p id='10.42' data-ref='bne_en-p627' class='blockquote'>

<p id='10.44' data-ref='bne_en-p629'>
In 1875, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave a forecast of the establishment of a
Universal League of Nations, which is especially interesting at the
present time<a data-fnid='4'></a> in view of the strenuous
attempts now being made to establish such a league. He wrote: — </p>

  <p id='10.45' data-ref='bne_en-p630' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>True civilization will unfurl its banner in the midmost heart of the
    world whenever a certain number of its distinguished and high-minded
    sovereigns — the shining exemplars of devotion and
    determination — shall, for the good and happiness of all mankind,
    arise, with firm resolve and clear vision, to establish the Cause of
    Universal Peace. They must make the Cause of Peace the object of
    general consultation, and seek by every means in their power to
    establish a Union of the nations of the world. They must conclude a
    binding treaty and establish a covenant, the provisions of which
    shall be sound, inviolable and definite. They must proclaim it to all
    the world and obtain for it the sanction of all the human race. This
    supreme and noble undertaking — the real source of the peace and
    well-being of all the world — should be regarded as sacred by all
    that dwell on earth. All the forces of humanity must be mobilized to
    ensure the stability and permanence of this Most Great Covenant. In
    this all-embracing Pact the limits and frontiers of each and every
    nation should be clearly fixed, the principles underlying the
    relations of governments towards one another definitely laid down,
    and all international agreements and obligations ascertained. In like
    manner, the size of the armaments of every government should be
    strictly limited, for if the preparations for war and the military
    forces of any nation should be allowed to increase, they will arouse
    the suspicion of others. The fundamental principle underlying this
    solemn Pact should be so fixed that if any government later violate
    any one of its provisions, all the governments on earth should arise
    to reduce it to utter submission, nay the human race as a whole
    should resolve, with every power at its disposal, to destroy that
    government. Should this greatest of all remedies be applied to the
    sick body of the world, it will assuredly recover from its ills and
    will remain eternally safe and secure.</q>

Bahá’ís see grave deficiencies in the structure of the League of
Nations<a data-fnid='5'></a> which falls short of the type of
institution which Bahá’u’lláh described as essential to the

<p id='10.48' data-ref='bne_en-p633'>
Bahá’u’lláh also advocated the establishment of an
international court of arbitration, so that differences arising
between nations might be settled in accordance with justice and
reason, instead of by appeal to the ordeal of battle.</p>


<p id='10.49' data-ref='bne_en-p634'>
In a letter to the Secretary of the Mohonk Conference on
International Arbitration, in August 1911, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: — </p>

  <p id='10.50' data-ref='bne_en-p635' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>About fifty years ago in the Book of Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh
    commanded people to establish universal peace and summoned all the
    nations to the divine banquet of international arbitration, so that
    the questions of boundaries, of national honor and property, and of
    vital interests between nations might be settled by an arbitral court
    of justice, and that no nation would dare to refuse to abide by the
    decisions thus arrived at. If any quarrel arise between two nations
    it must be adjudicated by this international court and be arbitrated
    and decided upon like the judgment rendered by the Judge between two
    individuals. If at any time any nation dares to break such a

    everything which otherwise would be a cause of war. This mission of
    this tribunal would be to prevent war.</q> </p>


<p id='10.53' data-ref='bne_en-p638'>
During the quarter of a century preceding the establishment of the
League of Nations a permanent Court of Arbitration was established at
The Hague (1900), and many arbitration treaties were signed, but most
of these fell far short of the comprehensive proposals of
Bahá’u’lláh. No arbitration treaty was made between two great
Powers in which all matters of dispute were included. Differences
affecting “vital interests,” “honor” and “independence”
were specifically excepted. Not only so, but effective guarantees
that nations would abide by the terms of the treaties into which they
had entered were lacking. In the Bahá’í proposals, on the other
hand, questions of boundaries, of national honor and of vital
interest are expressly included, and agreements will have the supreme
guarantee of the World League of Nations behind them. Only when these
proposals are completely carried out will international arbitration
attain the full scope of its beneficent possibilities and the curse
of war be finally banished from the world.</p>

<p id='10.56' data-ref='bne_en-p641'>
As a religious body, Bahá’ís have, at the express command of
Bahá’u’lláh, entirely abandoned the use of armed force in their
own interests, even for strictly defensive purposes. In Persia many,
many thousands of the Bábís and Bahá’ís have suffered cruel
deaths because of their faith. In the early days of the Cause the
Bábís on various occasions defended themselves and their families
by the sword, with great courage and bravery. Bahá’u’lláh,
however, forbade this. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes: — </p>

  <p id='10.57' data-ref='bne_en-p642' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>When Bahá’u’lláh appeared, He declared that the promulgation of

    He, “it is better for you than to slay.” It is through the firmness
    and assurance of the faithful that the Cause of the Lord must be

    absolute detachment to exalt the Word of God, and, with eyes averted

The soundness of Bahá’u’lláh’s nonresistance policy has

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_646'>Righteous Warfare</h3>

<p id='10.61' data-ref='bne_en-p646'>
Although Bahá’u’lláh, like Christ, counsels His follows as
individuals and as a religious body to adopt an attitude of
nonresistance and forgiveness toward their enemies, He teaches that
it is the duty of the community to prevent injustice and oppression.
If individuals are persecuted and injured it is wrong for a community
to allow pillage and murder to continue unchecked within its borders.
It is the duty of a good government to prevent wrongdoing and to
punish offenders.<a data-fnid='6'></a> So also with the
community of nations. If one nation oppresses or injures another, it
is the duty of all other nations to unite to prevent such oppression.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes: — </p>


  <p id='10.62' data-ref='bne_en-p648' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>“It may happen that at a given time
    warlike and savage tribes may furiously attack the body politic with
    the intention of carrying on a wholesale slaughter of its members;
    under such a circumstance defense is necessary.”</q></p>


<p id='10.63' data-ref='bne_en-p647'>
Hitherto the usual practice of mankind has been that if one nation
attacked another, the rest of the nations of the world remained
neutral, and accepted no responsibility in the matter unless their
own interests were directly affected or threatened. The whole burden
of defense was left to the nation attacked, however weak and helpless
it might be. The teaching of Bahá’u’lláh reverses this position
and throws the responsibility of defense not specially on the nation
attacked, but on all the others, individually and collectively. As
the whole of mankind is one community, an attack on any one nation is
an attack on the community, and ought to be dealt with by the
community. Were this doctrine generally recognized and acted on, any
nation contemplating an aggression on another would know in advance
that it would have to reckon with the opposition not of that other
nation only, but of the whole of the rest of the world. This
knowledge alone would be sufficient to deter even the boldest and
most bellicose of nations. When a sufficiently strong league of
peace-loving nations is established war will, therefore, become a
thing of the past. During the period of transition from the old state
of international anarchy to the new state of international solidarity
aggressive wars will still be possible, and in these circumstances,
military or other coercive action in the cause of international
justice, unity and peace may be a positive duty. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
writes that in such case: — </p>

  <p id='10.64' data-ref='bne_en-p648' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>A conquest can be a praiseworthy thing, and there are times when war
    becomes the powerful basis of peace, and ruin the very means of
    reconstruction. If, for example, a high-minded sovereign marshals his
    troops to block the onset of the insurgent and the aggressor, or
    again, if he takes the field and distinguishes himself in a struggle
    to unify a divided state and people, if, in brief, he is waging war
    for a righteous purpose, then this seeming wrath is mercy itself, and
    this apparent tyranny the very substance of justice and this warfare
    the cornerstone of peace. Today, the task befitting great rulers is
    to establish universal peace, for in this lies the freedom of all

<p id='10.65' data-ref='bne_en-p649'>
Another factor which will help in bringing about universal peace is
the linking together of the East and the West. The Most Great Peace
is no mere cessation of hostilities, but a fertilizing union and
cordial cooperation of the hitherto sundered peoples of the earth
which will bear much precious fruit. In one of His talks in Paris,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: — </p>

    <q class='abd'>In the past, as in the present, the Spiritual Sun of Truth has always
    shone from the horizon of the East. In the East Moses arose to lead
    and teach the people. On the Eastern horizon rose the Lord Christ.
    Muḥammad was sent to an Eastern nation. The Báb arose in the
    Eastern land of Persia. Bahá’u’lláh lived and taught in the
    East. All the great spiritual teachers arose in the Eastern world.</q> </p>


  <p id='10.67' data-ref='bne_en-p651' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>But although the Sun of Christ dawned in the East, the radiance
    thereof was apparent in the West, where the effulgence of its glory
    was more clearly seen. The divine light of His teaching shone with a

    headway than in the land of its birth.</q> </p>

    <q class='abd'>In these days the East is in need of material progress and the West
    is in need of a spiritual ideal. It would be well for the West to
    turn to the East for illumination, and to give in exchange its
    scientific knowledge. There must be this interchange of gifts. The
    East and the West must unite to give to each other what is lacking.
    This union will bring about true civilization where the spiritual is
    expressed and carried out in the material. Receiving thus, the one
    from the other, the greatest harmony will prevail, all people will be
    united, a state of great perfection will be attained, there will be a
    firm cementing, and this world will become a shining mirror for the
    reflection of the attributes of God.</q> </p>


  <p id='10.69' data-ref='bne_en-p653' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>We all, the Eastern and the Western nations, must strive day and
    night, with heart and soul, to achieve this high ideal, to cement the
    unity between all the nations of the earth. Every heart will then be
    refreshed, all eyes will be opened, the most wonderful power will be
    given, the happiness of humanity will be assured.… This will be the

<p id='11.13' data-ref='bne_en-p665'>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that as a result of this precaution of
Bahá’u’lláh’s the strained relations between relatives-in-law
which have become proverbial in Christian and Muḥammadan countries
are almost unknown among the Bahá’ís, and divorce is also of very
rare occurrence. He writes on the subject of matrimony: — </p>

  <p id='11.14' data-ref='bne_en-p666' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Bahá’í marriage is union and cordial affection between the two
    parties. They must, however, exercise the utmost care and become
    acquainted with each other’s character. This eternal bond should be
    made secure by a firm covenant, and the intention should be to foster
    harmony, fellowship and unity and to attain everlasting life.… </q> </p>

  <p id='11.15' data-ref='bne_en-p667' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>In a true Bahá’í marriage the two parties must become fully
    united both spiritually and physically, so that they may attain
    eternal union throughout all the worlds of God, and improve the
    spiritual life of each other. This is Bahá’í matrimony.</q> </p>


<p id='11.16' data-ref='bne_en-p668'>
The Bahá’í marriage ceremony is very simple, the only requirement
being that the groom and the bride, in the presence of at least two
witnesses, each say: <q class='baha'>“We will all, verily, abide by the Will of
God.”</q></p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_669'>Divorce</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='11.17' data-ref='bne_en-p669'>
In the matter of divorce, as in that of marriage, the instructions of
the Prophets have varied in accordance with the circumstances of the
times. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states the Bahá’í teaching, with regard
to divorce, thus: — </p>

  <p id='11.18' data-ref='bne_en-p670' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The friends (Bahá’ís) must strictly refrain from divorce unless
    something arises which compels them to separate because of their
    aversion for each other; in that case, with the knowledge of the
    Spiritual Assembly, they may decide to separate. They must then be
    patient and wait one complete year. If during this year harmony is
    not reestablished between them, then their divorce may be realized.…
    The foundation of the Kingdom of God is based upon harmony and love,
    oneness, relationship and union, not upon differences, especially
    between husband and wife. If one of these two become the cause of
    divorce, that one will unquestionably fall into great difficulties,
    will become the victim of formidable calamities and experience deep
    remorse.</q>
     <span class='block reference'>(Tablet to the Bahá’ís of America.)</span> </p>


<p id='11.19' data-ref='bne_en-p671'>
In the matter of divorce, as in other matters, Bahá’ís will, of
course, be bound not only by the Bahá’í teaching, but also by the
laws of the country in which they live.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_672'>The Bahá’í Calendar</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='11.20' data-ref='bne_en-p672'>
Among different peoples and at different times many different methods
have been adopted for the measurement of time and fixing of dates,
and several different calendars are still in daily use, e.g., the
Gregorian in Western Europe, the Julian in many countries of Eastern
Europe, the Hebrew among the Jews, and the Muḥammadan in Muslim
communities.</p>


<p id='11.21' data-ref='bne_en-p673'>
The Báb signalized the importance of the dispensation which He came
to herald, by inaugurating a new calendar. In this, as in the
Gregorian Calendar, the lunar month is abandoned and the solar year
is adopted.</p>


<p id='11.22' data-ref='bne_en-p674'>
The Bahá’í year consists of 19 months of 19 days each (i.e. 361
days), with the addition of certain “Intercalary Days” (four in
ordinary and five in leap years) between the eighteenth and
nineteenth months in order to adjust the calendar to the solar year.
The Báb named the months after the attributes of God. The Bahá’í
New Year, like the ancient Persian New Year, is astronomically fixed,
commencing at the March equinox (usually March 21), and the Bahá’í
era commences with the year of the Báb’s declaration (i.e. 1844
A.D., 1260 A.H.).</p>


<p id='11.23' data-ref='bne_en-p675'>
In the not far distant future it will be necessary that all peoples
in the world agree on a common calendar.</p>


<p id='11.24' data-ref='bne_en-p676'>
It seems, therefore, fitting that the new age of unity should have a
new calendar free from the objections and associations which make
each of the older calendar unacceptable to large sections of the
world’s population, and it is difficult to see how any other
arrangement could exceed in simplicity and convenience that proposed
by the Báb.</p>


<p id='11.25' data-ref='bne_en-p677'>
The months in the Bahá’í Calendar are as follows:</p>

<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_678'>Spiritual Assemblies</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='11.26' data-ref='bne_en-p678'>
Before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá completed His earthly mission, He had laid a
basis for the development of the administrative order established in
Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings. To show the high importance to be
attributed to the institution of the Spiritual Assembly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
in a tablet declared that a certain translation must be approved by
the Spiritual Assembly of Cairo before publication, even though He
Himself had reviewed and corrected the text.</p>


<p id='11.27' data-ref='bne_en-p679'>
By Spiritual Assembly is meant the administrative body of nine
persons, elected annually by each local Bahá’í community, in
which is vested the authority of decision on all matters of mutual
action on the part of the community. This designation is temporary,
since in future the Spiritual Assemblies will be termed Houses of
Justice.</p>


<p id='11.28' data-ref='bne_en-p680'>
Unlike the organization of churches, these Bahá’í bodies are
social rather than ecclesiastical institutions. That is, they apply
the law of consultation to all questions and difficulties arising
between Bahá’ís, who are called upon not to carry them to the
civil court, and seek to promote unity as well as justice throughout
the community. The Spiritual Assembly is in no wise equivalent to the
priest or clergy, but is responsible for upholding the teachings,
stimulating active service, conducting meetings, maintaining unity,
holding Bahá’í property in trust for the community, and
representing it in its relations to the public and to other Bahá’í
communities.</p>


<p id='11.29' data-ref='bne_en-p681'>
The nature of the Spiritual Assembly, local and national, is
described more fully in the section devoted to the Will and Testament
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the final chapter, but its general functions
have been defined by Shoghi Effendi as follows: — </p>

  <p id='11.30' data-ref='bne_en-p682' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>The matter of Teaching, its direction, its ways and means, its
    extension, its consolidation, essential as they are to the interests
    of the Cause, constitute by no means the only issue which should
    receive the full attention of these Assemblies. A careful study of
    Bahá’u’lláh’s and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets will reveal
    that other duties, no less vital to the interests of the Cause,
    devolve upon the elected representatives of the friends in every
    locality.</q> </p>


<p id='11.31' data-ref='bne_en-p683'>
It is incumbent upon them to be vigilant and cautious, discreet and
watchful, and protect at all times the Temple of the Cause from the
dart of the mischief-maker and the onslaught of the enemy.</p>


<p id='11.32' data-ref='bne_en-p684'>
They must endeavor to promote amity and concord amongst the friends,
efface every lingering trace of distrust, coolness and estrangement
from every heart, and secure in its stead an active and whole-hearted
cooperation for the service of the Cause.</p>


<p id='11.33' data-ref='bne_en-p685'>
They must do their utmost to extend at all times the helping hand to
the poor, the sick, the disabled, the orphan, the widow, irrespective
of color, caste and creed.</p>


<p id='11.34' data-ref='bne_en-p686'>
They must promote by every means in their power the material as well
as the spiritual enlightenment of youth, the means for the education
of children, institute, whenever possible, Bahá’í educational
institutions, organize and supervise their work and provide the best
means for their progress and development.… </p>



<p id='11.35' data-ref='bne_en-p687'>
They must undertake the arrangement of the regular meetings of the
friends, the feasts and the anniversaries, as well as the special
gatherings designed to serve and promote the social, intellectual and
spiritual interests of their fellow-men.</p>


<p id='11.36' data-ref='bne_en-p688'>
They must supervise in these days when the Cause is still in its
infancy all Bahá’í publications and translations, and provide in
general for a dignified and accurate presentation of all Bahá’í
literature and its distribution to the general public.</p>


<p id='11.37' data-ref='bne_en-p689'>
The possibilities inherent in Bahá’í institutions can only be
estimated when one realizes how rapidly modern civilization is
disintegrating for lack of that spiritual power which can alone
supply the necessary attitude of responsibility and humility to the
leaders and the requisite loyalty to the individual members of
society.</p>

<p id='11.39' data-ref='bne_en-p691'>
The essential joyousness of the Bahá’í religion finds expression
in numerous feasts and holidays throughout the year.</p>


<p id='11.40' data-ref='bne_en-p692'>
In a talk on the Feast of Naw-Rúz, in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1912,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: — </p>

  <p id='11.41' data-ref='bne_en-p693' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>In the sacred laws of God, in every cycle and dispensation there are
    blessed feasts, holidays and workless days. On such days all kinds of
    occupations, commerce, industry, agriculture, etc., should be
    suspended.</q> </p>


  <p id='11.42' data-ref='bne_en-p694' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>All should rejoice together, hold general meetings, become as one
    assembly, so that the national oneness, unity and harmony may be
    demonstrated in the eyes of all.</q> </p>


  <p id='11.43' data-ref='bne_en-p695' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>As it is a blessed day it should not be neglected, nor deprived of
    results by making it a day devoted to the pursuit of mere pleasure.</q> </p>


  <p id='11.44' data-ref='bne_en-p696' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>During such days institutions should be founded that may be of
    permanent benefit and value to the people.… </q> </p>



  <p id='11.45' data-ref='bne_en-p697' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Today there is no result or fruit greater than guiding the people.
    Undoubtedly the friends of God, upon such a day, must leave tangible
    philanthropic or ideal traces that should reach all mankind and not
    pertain only to the Bahá’ís. In this wonderful dispensation,
    philanthropic affairs are for all humanity without exception, because
    it is the manifestation of the mercifulness of God. Therefore, my
    hope is that the friends of God, every one of them, may become as the
    mercy of God to all mankind.</q> </p>


<p id='11.46' data-ref='bne_en-p698'>
The Feasts of Naw-Rúz (New Year) and Riḍván, the Anniversaries of
the Birth of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, and of the Báb’s
Declaration (which is also the birthday of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá) are the
great joy-days of the year for Bahá’ís. In Persia they are
celebrated by picnics or festal gatherings at which music, the
chanting of verses and tablets, and short addresses suitable to the
occasion are contributed by those present. The intercalary days
between the eighteenth and nineteenth months (that is, February 26 to
March 1 inclusive) are specially devoted to hospitality to friends,
the giving of presents, ministering to the poor and sick, et cetera.</p>


<p id='11.47' data-ref='bne_en-p699'>
The anniversaries of the martyrdom of the Báb and the departure of
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are celebrated with solemnity
by appropriate meetings and discourses, the chanting of prayers and
Tablets.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_700'>Fast</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='11.48' data-ref='bne_en-p700'>
The nineteenth month, following immediately on the hospitality of the
intercalary days, is the month of the fast. During nineteen days the
fast is observed by abstaining from both food and drink from sunrise
to sunset. As the month of the fast ends at the March equinox, the
fast always falls in the same season, namely, spring in the Northern,
and autumn in the Southern, Hemisphere; never in the extreme heat of
summer nor in the extreme cold of winter, when hardship would be
likely to result. At that season, moreover, the interval between
sunrise and sunset is approximately the same all over the habitable
portion of the globe, namely, from about 6 A.M. to 6 P.M. The fast is
not binding on children and invalids, on travelers, or on those who
are too old or too weak (including women who are with child or have
babes at the breast).</p>


<p id='11.49' data-ref='bne_en-p701'>
There is much evidence to show that a periodical fast such as is
enjoined by the Bahá’í teachings is beneficial as a measure of
physical hygiene, but just as the reality of the Bahá’í fast does
not lie in the consumption of physical food, but in the commemoration
of God, which is our spiritual food, so the reality of the Bahá’í
fast does not consist in abstention from physical food, although that
may help in the purification of the body, but in the abstention from
the desires and lusts of the flesh, and in severance from all save
God. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='11.50' data-ref='bne_en-p702' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Fasting is a symbol. Fasting signifies abstinence from lust. Physical
    fasting is a symbol of that abstinence, and is a reminder; that is,
    just as a person abstains from physical appetites, he is to abstain
    from self-appetites and self-desires. But mere abstention from food
    has no effect on the spirit. It is only a symbol, a reminder.
    Otherwise it is of no importance. Fasting for this purpose does not
    mean entire abstinence from food. The golden rule as to food is, do
    not take too much or too little. Moderation is necessary. There is a
    sect in India who practice extreme abstinence, and gradually reduce
    their food until they exist on almost nothing. But their intelligence
    suffers. A man is not fit to do service for God with brain or body if
    he is weakened by lack of food. He cannot see clearly.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> (quoted by Miss E. S. Stevens in <i>Fortnightly Review</i>,
      June 1911).</span> </p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_703'>Meetings</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='11.51' data-ref='bne_en-p703'>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá attaches the greatest important to regular meetings
of the believers for united worship, for the exposition and study of
the teachings and for consultation regarding the progress of the
Movement. In one of His Tablets He says: — </p>

  <p id='11.52' data-ref='bne_en-p704' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>It is God’s purpose that in the West union and harmony may day by
    day increase among the friends of God and the handmaids of the
    Merciful. Not until this is realized can any advance be achieved. And
    the greatest means for the union and harmony of all is the gathering
    of the friends in spiritual meetings. This matter is very important
    and is a magnet to attract divine confirmations.</q> </p>


<p id='11.53' data-ref='bne_en-p705'>
In the spiritual meetings of Bahá’ís contentious argument and the
discussion of political or worldly affairs must be avoided; <i>the
sole aim of the believers should be to teach and learn Divine Truth</i>,
to have their hearts filled with Divine Love, to attain more perfect
obedience to the Divine Will, and to promote the coming of the
Kingdom of God. In an address given at New York in 1912, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said: — </p>

  <p id='11.54' data-ref='bne_en-p706' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>It is my hope that the meetings of the Bahá’í Assembly in New
    York shall become like meetings of the Supreme Concourse. When you
    assemble, you must reflect the lights of the heavenly Kingdom. Let
    your hearts be as mirrors in which the radiance of the Sun of Reality
    is visible. Each bosom must be a telegraph station — one terminus of
    the wire attached to the soul, the other fixed in the Supreme
    Concourse — so that inspiration may descend from the Kingdom of Abhá
    and questions of reality be discussed. Then opinions will coincide
    with truth; day by day there will be progression, and the meetings
    will become more radiant and spiritual. This attainment is
    conditioned upon unity and agreement. The more perfect the love and
    agreement, the more the divine confirmations and assistance of the
    Blessed Perfection will descend.</q> </p>


<p id='11.55' data-ref='bne_en-p707' class='noid'>In one of His Tablets He said: — </p>

  <p id='11.56' data-ref='bne_en-p708' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>At these meetings, there should be no extraneous conversation
    whatever. Rather, the assemblage should confine itself to reading and
    reciting the Holy Words, and to the discussion of matters relating to
    the Cause of God, expounding, for example, conclusive proofs and
    arguments, and the Writings of the Best Beloved of mankind. Those who
    present themselves at these gatherings must first array themselves in
    spotless clothing, turn their faces toward the Kingdom of Abhá, and
    then with lowliness and submissiveness enter in. During the readings
    they must maintain complete silence. Should anyone wish to speak, he
    should say his say in all humility, with exactitude and eloquence.</q> </p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_709'>The Nineteen Day Feast</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='11.57' data-ref='bne_en-p709'>
With the development of the Bahá’í administrative order since the
ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Nineteen Day Feast, observed on
the first day of each Bahá’í month, has assumed a very special
importance, providing as it does not only for community prayer and
reading from the Holy Books, but also for general consultation on all
current Bahá’í affairs and for the association of the friends
together. This Feast is the occasion when the Spiritual Assembly
makes its reports to the community and invites both discussion of
plans and suggestions for new and better methods of service.</p>

<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='11.58' data-ref='bne_en-p710'>
Bahá’u’lláh left instructions that temples of worship should be
built by His followers in every country and city. To these temples He
gave the name of “Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár,” which
means “Dawning Place of God’s Praise.” The Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár
is to be a nine-sided building surmounted by a dome, and as beautiful
as possible in design and workmanship. It is to stand in a large
garden adorned with fountains, trees and flowers, surrounded by a
number of accessory buildings devoted to educational, charitable and
social purposes, so that the worship of God in the temple may always
be closely associated with reverent delight in the beauties of nature
and of art, and with practical work for the amelioration of social
conditions.<a data-fnid='3'></a></p>


<p id='11.59' data-ref='bne_en-p711'>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_716'>Life After Death</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='11.64' data-ref='bne_en-p716'>
Bahá’u’lláh tells us that the life in the flesh is but the
embryonic stage of our existence, and that escape from the body is
like a new birth through which the human spirit enters on a fuller,
freer life. He writes: — </p>

  <p id='11.65' data-ref='bne_en-p717' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Know thou of a truth that the soul, after its separation from the
    body, will continue to progress until it attaineth the presence of
    God, in a state and condition which neither the revolution of ages
    and centuries, nor the changes and chances of this world, can alter.
    It will endure as long as the Kingdom of God, His sovereignty, His
    dominion and power will endure. It will manifest the signs of God and
    His attributes, and will reveal His loving kindness and bounty. The
    movement of My Pen is stilled when it attempteth to befittingly
    describe the loftiness and glory of so exalted a station. The honor
    with which the Hand of Mercy will invest the soul is such as no
    tongue can adequately reveal, nor any other earthly agency describe.
    Blessed is the soul which, at the hour of its separation from the
    body, is sanctified from the vain imaginings of the peoples of the
    world. Such a soul liveth and moveth in accordance with the Will of
    its Creator, and entereth the all-highest Paradise. The Maids of
    Heaven, inmates of the loftiest mansions, will circle around it, and
    the Prophets of God and His chosen ones will seek its companionship.
    With them that soul will freely converse, and will recount unto them
    that which it hath been made to endure in the path of God, the Lord
    of all worlds. If any man be told that which hath been ordained for
    such a soul in the worlds of God, the Lord of the throne on high and
    of earth below, his whole being will instantly blaze out in his great
    longing to attain that most exalted, that sanctified and resplendent
    station.… The nature of the soul after death can never be
    described, nor is it meet and permissible to reveal its whole
    character to the eyes of men. The Prophets and Messengers of God have
    been sent down for the sole purpose underlying their revelation hath
    been to educate all men, that they may, at the hour of death, ascend,
    in the utmost purity and sanctity and with absolute detachment, to
    the throne of the Most High. The light which these souls radiate is
    responsible for the progress of the world and the advancement of its
    peoples. They are like unto leaven which leaveneth the world of
    being, and constitute the animating force through which the arts and
    wonders of the world are made manifest. Through them the clouds rain
    their bounty upon men, and the earth bringeth forth its fruits. All
    things must needs have a cause, a motive power, an animating
    principle. These souls and symbols of detachment have provided, and
    will continue to provide, the supreme moving impulse in the world of
    being. The world beyond is as different from this world as this world
    is different from that of the child while still in the womb of its
    mother.</q>

    holy souls who find a pure eye and are favored with insight will, in
    the kingdom of lights, be acquainted with all mysteries, and will
    seek the bounty of witnessing the reality of every great soul. They
    will even manifestly behold the Beauty of God in that world. Likewise

    from time and place; it is another world and another universe. And
    know thou for a certainty that in the divine worlds the spiritual
    beloved ones will recognize one another, and will seek union with

Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá regard the descriptions of
Heaven and Hell given in some of the older religious writings as
symbolic, like the Biblical story of the Creation, and not as
literally true. According to Them, Heaven is the state of perfection,
and Hell that of imperfection; Heaven is harmony with God’s will
and with our fellows, and Hell is the want of such harmony; Heaven is
the condition of spiritual life, and Hell that of spiritual death. A
man may be either in Heaven or in Hell while still in the body. The
joys of Heaven are spiritual joys; and the pains of Hell consist in
the deprivation of these joys. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says:  — </p>

The unity of humanity as taught by Bahá’u’lláh refers not only
to men still in the flesh, but to all human beings, whether embodied
or disembodied. Not only all men now living on the earth, but all in
the spiritual world as well, are parts of one and the same organism
and these two parts are intimately dependent, one on the other.
Spiritual communion one with the other, far from being impossible or
unnatural, is constant and inevitable. Those whose spiritual
faculties are as yet undeveloped are unconscious of this vital
connection, but as one’s faculties develop, communications with
those beyond the veil gradually become more conscious and definite.

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_743'>The Nonexistence of Evil</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='11.94' data-ref='bne_en-p743'>
According to Bahá’í philosophy it follows from the doctrine of
the unity of God that there can be no such thing as positive evil.
There can only be one Infinite. If there were any other power in the
universe outside of or opposed to the One, then the One would not be
infinite. Just as darkness is but the absence or lesser degree of
light, so evil is but the absence or lesser degree of good — the
undeveloped state. A bad man is a man with the higher side of his
nature still undeveloped. If he is selfish, the evil is not in his
love of self — all love, even self-love, is good, is divine. The evil
is that he has such a poor, inadequate, misguided love of self and
such a lack of love for others and for God. He looks upon himself as
only a superior sort of animal, and foolishly pampers his lower
nature as he might pamper a pet dog — with worse results in his own
case than in that of the dog.</p>


<p id='11.95' data-ref='bne_en-p744' class='noid'>In one of His letters ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

    <q class='abd'>As to thy remark, that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá hath said to some of the
    believers that evil never exists, nay rather, it is a nonexistent
    thing, this is but truth, inasmuch as the greatest evil is man’s
    going astray and being veiled from truth. Error is lack of guidance;
    darkness is absence of light; ignorance is lack of knowledge;
    falsehood is lack of truthfulness; blindness is lack of sight; and
    deafness is lack of hearing. Therefore, error, blindness, deafness
    and ignorance are nonexistent things.</q> </p>


<p id='11.97' data-ref='bne_en-p746' class='noid'>Again He says: — </p>

  <p id='11.98' data-ref='bne_en-p747' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>In creation there is no evil; all is good. Certain qualities and
    natures innate in some men and apparently blameworthy are not so in
    reality. For example, from the beginning of his life you can see in a
    nursing child the signs of desire, of anger, and of temper. Then, it
    may be said, good and evil are innate in the reality of man, and this
    is contrary to the pure goodness of nature and creation. The answer
    to this is that desire, which is to ask for something more, is a
    praiseworthy quality provided that it is used suitably. So, if a man
    has the desire to acquire science and knowledge, or to become
    compassionate, generous and just, it is most praiseworthy. If he
    exercises his anger and wrath against the bloodthirsty tyrants who
    are like ferocious beasts, it is very praiseworthy; but if he does
    not use these qualities in a right way, they are blameworthy.… </q> </p>

    <q class='abd'>… It is the same with all the natural qualities of man, which

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_751'>Conflict Due to Error</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='12.2' data-ref='bne_en-p751'>
One of the fundamental teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that true
science and true religion must always be in harmony. Truth is one,
and whenever conflict appears it is due, not to truth, but to error.
Between so-called science and so-called religion there have been
fierce conflicts all down the ages, but looking back on these
conflicts in the light of fuller truth we can trace them every time
to ignorance, prejudice, vanity, greed, narrow-mindedness,
intolerance, obstinacy or something of the kind — something foreign
to the true spirit of both science and religion, for the spirit of
both is one. As Huxley tells us, “The great deeds of philosophers
have been less the fruit of their intellect than the direction of
that intellect by an eminently religious tone of mind. Truth has
yielded herself rather to their patience, their love, their
single-heartedness and self-denial than to their logical acumen.”
Boole, the mathematician, assures us that “geometric induction is
essentially a process of prayer — an appeal from the finite mind to
the Infinite for light on finite concerns.” The great Prophets of
religion and science have never denounced each other. It is the
unworthy followers of these great world teachers — worshipers of the
letter but not of the spirit of their teaching — who have always been
the persecutors of the later prophets and the bitterest opponents of
progress. They have studied the light of the particular revelation
which they hold sacred, and have defined its properties and
peculiarities as seen by their limited vision, with the utmost care
and precision. That is for them the one true light. If God in His
infinite bounty sends fuller light from another quarter, and the
torch of inspiration burns brighter than before from a new
torchholder, instead of welcoming the new lights they are angry and
alarmed. This new light does not correspond with their definitions.
It has not the orthodox color, and does not shine from the orthodox
place, therefore it must at all costs be extinguished lest it lead
men astray into the paths of heresy! Many enemies of the Prophets are
of this type — blind leaders of the blind, who oppose new and fuller
truth in the supposed interests of what they believe to be the truth.
Others are of baser sort and are moved by selfish interests to fight
against truth, or else block the path of progress by reason of
spiritual deadness and inertia.</p>

<p id='12.3' data-ref='bne_en-p752'>
The great Prophets of religion have always been, at Their coming,
despised and rejected of men. Both They and Their early followers
have given their backs to the smiters and sacrificed their
possessions and their lives in the path of God. Even in our own times
this has been so. Since 1844 A.D., many thousands of Bábís and
Bahá’ís in Persia have suffered cruel deaths for their faith, and
many more have borne imprisonment, exile, poverty and degradation.
The latest of the great religions has been “baptized in blood”
more than its predecessors, and martyrdoms have continued down to the
present day. With the prophets of science the same thing has
happened. Giordano Bruno was burned as a heretic in 1600 A.D. for
teaching, amongst other things, that the earth moved around the sun.
A few years later the veteran philosopher Galileo had to abjure the
same doctrine on his knees in order to escape a similar fate. In
later times, Darwin and the pioneers of modern geology were
vehemently denounced for daring to dispute the teaching of Holy Write
that the world was made in six days, and less than six thousand years
ago! The opposition to new scientific truth has not all come from the
Church, however. The orthodox in science have been just as hostile to
progress as the orthodox in religion. Columbus was laughed to scorn
by the so called scientists of his day, who proved to their own
satisfaction that if ships did succeed in getting down to the
Antipodes over the side of the globe, it would be absolutely
impossible for them to get up again! Galvani, the pioneer of
electrical science, was scoffed at by his learned colleagues, and
called the “frogs’ dancing master.” Harvey, who discovered the
circulation of the blood, was ridiculed and persecuted by his
professional brethren on account of his heresy and driven from his
lecture chair. When Stephenson invented his locomotive engine,
European mathematicians of the time, instead of opening their eyes
and studying the facts, continued for years to prove to their own
satisfaction that an engine on smooth rails could never pull a load,
as the wheels would simply slip round and round and the train make no
progress. To examples like these one might add indefinitely, both
from ancient and modern history, and even from our own times. Dr.
Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, had to battle for his wonderful
international language against the same sort of ridicule, contempt,
and stupid opposition which greeted Columbus, Galvani, and
Stephenson. Even Esperanto, which was given to the world so recently
as 1887, has had its martyrs.</p>

<p id='12.4' data-ref='bne_en-p753'>
In the last half century or so, however, a change has come over the
spirit of the times, a New Light of Truth has arisen which has
already made the controversies of last century seem strangely out of
date. Where are now the boastful materialists and dogmatic atheists
who, only a few short years ago, were threatening to drive religion
out of the world? And where are the preachers who so confidently
consigned those who did not accept their dogmas to the fires of hell
and the tortures of the damned? Echoes of their clamor we may still
hear, but their day is fast declining and their doctrines are being
discredited. We can see now that the doctrines around which their
controversies waxed most bitter were neither true science nor true
religion. What scientist in the light of modern psychical research
could still maintain that “brain secretes thought as the liver
secretes bile”? Or that decay of the body is necessarily
accompanied by decay of the soul? We now see that thought to be
really free must soar to the realms of psychical and spiritual
phenomena and not be confined to the material only. We realize that
what we now know about nature is but as a drop in the ocean compared
with what remains to be discovered. We therefore freely admit the
possibility of miracles, not indeed in the sense of the breaking of
nature’s laws, but as manifestations of the operation of subtle
forces which are still unknown to us, as electricity and X rays were
to our ancestors. On the other hand, who amongst our leading
religious teachers would still declare it is necessary to salvation
to believe that the world was made in six days, or that the
description of the plagues in Egypt as given in the Book of Exodus is
literally true, or that the sun stood still in the heavens (that is,
that the earth stopped its rotation) to let Joshua pursue his
enemies, or that if a man accept not the creed of St. Athanasius,
“without doubt he shall perish everlastingly”? Such beliefs may
still be repeated in form, but who accepts them in their literal
sense and without reservation? Their hold on people’s hearts and
minds has gone or is fast going. The religious world owes a debt of
gratitude to the men of science who helped to tear such worn-out
creeds and dogmas to tatters and allowed the truth to step forth
free. But the scientific world owes an even heavier debt to the real
saints and mystics who, through good report and ill, held to the
vital truths of spiritual existence and demonstrated to an
incredulous world that the life is more than meat and the unseen
greater than the seen. These scientists and saints were like the
mountain peaks which caught the first rays of the rising sun and
reflected them to the lower world, but now the sun has risen and its
rays are illuminating the world. In the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
we have a glorious revelation of truth which satisfies both heart and
mind, in which religion and science are at one.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_754'>Search after Truth</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='12.5' data-ref='bne_en-p754'>
Complete harmony with science is evident in the Bahá’í teachings
regarding the way in which we must seek the truth. Man must cut
himself free from all prejudice so that he may search after truth
unhindered.</p>


<p id='12.6' data-ref='bne_en-p755' class='noid'>‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='12.7' data-ref='bne_en-p756' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>In order to find truth we must give up our prejudices, our own small
    trivial notions; an open receptive mind is essential. If our chalice
    is full of self, there is no room in it for the water of life. The
    fact that we imagine ourselves to be right and everybody else wrong
    is the greatest of all obstacles in the path towards unity, and unity
    is essential if we would reach Truth, for Truth is one.… </q> </p>



<p id='12.8' data-ref='bne_en-p757'>
No one truth can contradict another truth. Light is good in
whatsoever lamp it is burning! A rose is beautiful in whatsoever
garden it may bloom! A star has the same radiance if it shines from
the East or from the West! Be free from prejudice; so will you love
the Sun of Truth from whatever point in the horizon it may arise. You
will realize that if the Divine Light of Truth shone in Jesus Christ,
it also shone in Moses and Buddha. This is what is meant by the
search after truth.</p>


<p id='12.9' data-ref='bne_en-p758'>
It also means that we must be willing to clear away all that we have
previously learned, all that would clog our steps on the way to
Truth; we must not shrink, if necessary, from beginning our education
all over again. We must not allow our love for any one religion or
any one personality so to blind our eyes that we become fettered by
superstition. When we are freed from all these bonds, seeking with
liberated minds, then shall we be able to arrive at our goal.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_759'>True Agnosticism</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='12.10' data-ref='bne_en-p759'>
The Bahá’í teaching is at one with science and philosophy in
declaring the essential nature of God to be entirely beyond human
comprehension. As emphatically as Thomas Huxley and Herbert Spencer
teach that the nature of the Great First Cause is unknowable, does
Bahá’u’lláh teach that <q class='baha'>“God comprehends all; He cannot be
comprehended.”</q> To knowledge of the Divine essence <q class='baha'>“the way is
barred and road is impassable,”</q> for how can the finite comprehend
the Infinite; how can a drop contain the ocean or a mote dancing in
the sunbeam embrace the universe? Yet the whole universe is eloquent
of God. In each drop of water are hidden oceans of meaning, and in
each mote is concealed a whole universe of significances, reaching
far beyond the ken of the most learned scientist. The chemist and
physicist pursuing their researches into the nature of matter have
passed from masses to molecules, from molecules to atoms, from atoms
to electrons and ether, but at every step the difficulties of the
research increase till the most profound intellect can penetrate no
farther, and can but bow in silent awe before the unknown Infinite
which remains ever shrouded in inscrutable mystery.</p>


  <p id='12.11' data-ref='bne_en-p760' class='blockquote'>
    Flower in the crannied wall,<br/>
    I pluck you out of the crannies.<br/>

    What you are, root and all, and all in all,<br/>

<p id='12.12' data-ref='bne_en-p761'>
If the flower in the crannied wall, if even a single atom of matter,
present mysteries which the most profound intellect cannot solve, how
is it possible for man to comprehend the universe? How dare he
pretend to define or describe the Infinite cause of all things? All
theological speculations about the nature of God’s essence are thus
swept aside as foolish and futile.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_762'>Knowledge of God</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='12.13' data-ref='bne_en-p762'>
But if the essence is unknowable, the manifestations of its bounty
are everywhere apparent. If the first cause cannot be conceived, its
effects appeal to our every faculty. Just as knowledge of a painter’s
pictures gives to the connoisseur a true knowledge of the artist, so
knowledge of the universe in any of its aspects — knowledge of nature
or of human nature, of things visible or of things invisible — is
knowledge of God’s handiwork, and gives to the seeker for Divine
truth a real knowledge of His Glory. <q class='bible'>“The Heavens declare the glory
of God; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork. Day unto day

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_763'>The Divine Manifestations</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='12.14' data-ref='bne_en-p763'>
All things manifest the bounty of God with greater or less clearness,
as all material objects exposed to the sun reflect its light in
greater or less degree. A heap of soot reflects a little, a stone
reflects more, a piece of chalk more still, but in none of these
reflections can we trace the form and color of the glorious orb. A
perfect mirror, however, reflects the sun’s very form and color, so
that looking into it is like looking at the sun itself. So it is with
the way in which things speak to us of God. The stone can tell us
something of the Divine attributes, the flower can tell us more, the
animal with its marvelous senses, instincts and power of movement,
more still. In the lowest of our fellowmen we can trace wonderful
faculties which tell of a wonderful Creator. In the poet, the saint,
the genius, we find a higher revelation still, but the great Prophets
and Founders of religions are the perfect mirrors by which the love
and wisdom of God are reflected to the rest of mankind. Other men’s
mirrors are dulled by the stains and the dust of selfishness and
prejudice, but these are pure and without blemish — wholly devoted to
the Will of God. Thus They become the greatest educators of mankind.
The Divine teachings and the Power of the Holy Spirit proceeding
through Them have been and are the cause of the progress of humanity,
for God helps men through other men. Each man who is higher in the
ascent of life is the means of helping those who are lower, and those
who are the highest of all are the helpers of all mankind. It is as
if all men were connected together by elastic cords. If a man rises a
little above the general level of his fellows, the cords tighten. His
former companions tend to draw him back, but with an equal force he
draws them upwards. The higher he gets, the more he feels the weight
of the whole world pulling him back, and the more dependent he is on
the divine support, which reaches him through the few who are still
above him. Highest of all are the great Prophets and Saviors, the
Divine “Manifestations” — those perfect men Who were each, in
Their day, without peer or companion, and bore the burden of the
whole world, supported by God alone. <q class='bible'>“The burden of our sins was
upon Him”</q> was true of each of Them. Each was the <q class='bible'>“Way, the Truth
and the Life”</q> to His followers. Each was the channel of God’s
bounty to every heart that would receive it. Each had His part to
play in the great divine plan for the upliftment of humanity.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_764'>Creation</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='12.15' data-ref='bne_en-p764'>
Bahá’u’lláh teaches that the universe is without beginning in
time. It is a perpetual emanation from the Great First Cause. The
Creator always had His creation and always will have. Worlds and
systems may come and go, but the universe remains. All things that
undergo composition, in time undergo decomposition, but the component
elements remain. The creation of a world, a daisy or a human body is
not “making something out of nothing”; it is rather a bringing
together of elements which before were scattered, a making visible of
something which before was hidden. By and by the elements will again
be scattered, the form will disappear, but nothing is really lost or
annihilated; ever new combinations and forms arise from the ruins of
the old. Bahá’u’lláh confirms the scientists who claim, not six
thousand, but millions and billions of years for the history of the
earth’s creation. The evolution theory does not deny creative
power. It only tries to describe the method of its manifestation; and
the wonderful story of the material universe which the astronomer,
the geologist, the physicist and the biologist are gradually
unfolding to our gaze is, rightly appreciated, far more capable of
evoking the deepest reverence and worship than the crude and bald
account of creation given in the Hebrew Scriptures. The old account
in the Book of Genesis had, however, the advantage of indicating by a
few bold strokes of symbolism the essential spiritual meanings of the
story, as a master painter may, by a few strokes of the brush, convey
expressions which the mere plodder with the most laborious attention
to details may utterly fail to portray. If the material details blind
us to the spiritual meaning, then we should be better without them;
but if we have once firmly grasped the essential meaning of the whole
scheme, then knowledge of the details will give our conception a
wonderful added richness and splendor and make it a magnificent
picture instead of a mere sketch plan.</p>

Bahá’u’lláh also confirms the biologist who finds for the body
of man a history reaching back in the development of the species
through millions of years. Starting from a very simple, apparently
insignificant form, the human body is pictured as developing stage by
stage, in the course of untold generations, becoming more and more
complex, and better and better organized until the man of the present
day is reached. Each individual human body develops through such a
series of stages, from a tiny round speck of jelly-like matter to the
fully developed man. If this is true of the individual, as nobody
denies, why should we consider it derogatory to human dignity to
admit a similar development for the species? This is a very different
thing from claiming that man is descended from a monkey. The human
embryo may at one time resemble a fish with gill-slits and tail, but
it is not a fish. It is a human embryo. So the human species<a data-fnid='1'></a>
may at various stages of its long development have resembled to the
outward eye various species of lower animals, but it was still the
human species, possessing the mysterious latent power of developing
into man as we know him today, nay more, of developing in the future,
we trust, into something far higher still.</p>

<p id='12.27' data-ref='bne_en-p776'>
The Bahá’í teachings with regard to body and soul, and the life
after death, are quite in harmony with the results of psychical
research. They teach, as we have seen, that death is but a new
birth — the escape from the prison of the body into a larger life,
and that progress in the afterlife is limitless.</p>


<p id='12.28' data-ref='bne_en-p777'>
A large body of scientific evidence has gradually been accumulating
which in the opinion of impartial but highly critical investigators
is amply sufficient to establish beyond all question the fact of a
life after death — of the continued life and activity of the
conscious “soul” after the dissolution of the material body. As
F. W. H. Myers says in his <i>Human Personality</i>, a work which
summarizes many of the investigations of the Psychical Research
Society: — </p>

  <p id='12.29' data-ref='bne_en-p778' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>Observation, experiment, inference, have led many inquirers, of whom
    I am one, to a belief in direct or telepathic intercommunication, not
    between the minds of men still on earth only, but between minds or
    spirits still on earth and spirits departed. Such a discovery opens
    the doors also to revelation.… </q> </p>

  <p id='12.30' data-ref='bne_en-p779' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>We have shown that amid much deception and self-deception, fraud and
    illusion, veritable manifestations do reach us from beyond the
    grave.… </q> </p>

  <p id='12.31' data-ref='bne_en-p780' class='blockquote'>
    <q class=''>By discovery and by revelation certain theses have been provisionally
    established with regard to such departed souls as we have been able
    to encounter. First and chiefly, I, at least, see ground to believe
    that their state is one of endless evolution in wisdom and in love.
    Their loves of earth persist, and most of all, those highest loves
    which find their outlet in adoration and worship.… Evil to them
    seems less a terrible than a slavish thing. It is embodied in no
    mighty Potentate; rather it forms as isolating madness from which
    higher spirits strive to free the distorted soul. There needs no
    chastisement of fire; self-knowledge is man’s punishment and his
    reward; self-knowledge and the nearness or the aloofness of companion
    souls. For in that world love is actually self-preservation; the
    Communion of Saints not only adorns but constitutes the Life
    Everlasting. Nay, from the laws of telepathy it follows that that
    communion is valid to us here and now. Even now the love of souls
    departed makes answer to our invocations. Even now our loving
    memory — love is itself a prayer — supports and strengthens those
    delivered spirits upon their upward way.</q> </p>


<p id='12.32' data-ref='bne_en-p781'>
The measure of agreement between this view, which is founded on
careful scientific research, and that of the Bahá’í teachings, is
truly remarkable.</p>







<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_782'>Unity of Mankind</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





  <p id='12.33' data-ref='bne_en-p782' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“Ye are all fruits of one tree, the leaves of one branch, the
    flowers of one garden.”</q>

 <p id='12.34'>
That is one of the most characteristic
sayings of Bahá’u’lláh, and another is like it: </p>

  <p id='12.35' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>“Glory is not
    his who loves his own country, but glory is his who loves his kind.”</q>
    Unity — unity of mankind, and of all created beings in God — is the
    main theme of His teaching. Here again the harmony between true
    religion and science is evident. With every advance in science the
    oneness of the universe and the interdependence of its parts has
    become more clearly evident. The astronomer’s domain is inseparably
    bound up with the physicist’s, and the physicist’s with the
    chemist’s, the chemist’s with the biologist’s, the biologist’s
    with the psychologist’s, and so on. Every new discovery in one
    field of research throws new light on other fields. Just as physical
    science has shown that every particle of matter in the universe
    attracts and influences every other particle, no matter how minute or
    how distant, so psychical science is finding that every soul in the
    universe affects and influences every other soul. Prince Kropotkin,
    in his book on <i>Mutual Aid</i>, shows most clearly that even among
    the lower animals, mutual aid is absolutely necessary to continued
    life, while in the case of man, the progress of civilization depends
    on the increasing substitution of mutual aid for mutual enmity. “Each
    for all and all for each” is the only principle on which a
    community can prosper.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_783'>The Era of Unity</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='12.36' data-ref='bne_en-p783'>
All the signs of the times indicate that we are at the dawn of a new
era in the history of mankind. Hitherto the young eagle of humanity
has clung to the old aerie in the solid rock of selfishness and
materialism. Its attempts to use its wings have been timid and
tentative. It has had restless longings for something still
unattained. More and more it has been chafing in the confinement of
the old dogmas and orthodoxies. But now the era of confinement is at
an end, and it can launch on the wings of faith and reason into the
higher realms of spiritual love and truth. It will no longer be
earthbound as it was before its wings had grown, but will soar at
will to the regions of wide outlook and glorious freedom. One thing
is necessary, however, if its flight is to be sure and steady. Its
wings must not only be strong, but they must act in perfect harmony
and coordination. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='12.37' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>“It cannot fly with
    one wing alone. If it tries to fly with the wing of religion alone it
    will land in the slough of superstition, and if it tries to fly with
    the wing of science alone it will end in the dreary bog of
    materialism.”</q></p>


<p id='12.38' data-ref='bne_en-p784'>
Perfect harmony between religion and science is the <i>sine qua non</i>
of the higher life for humanity. When that is achieved, and every
child is trained not only in the study of the sciences, and arts, but
equally in love to all mankind and in radiant acquiescence to the
Will of God as revealed in the progress of evolution and the
teachings of the Prophets, then and not till then, shall the Kingdom
of God come and His Will be done on earth as it is in Heaven; then
and not till then shall the Most Great Peace shed its blessings on
the world.</p>


  <p id='12.39' data-ref='bne_en-p785' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>“When religion, shorn of its
    superstitions, traditions and unintelligent dogmas, shows its
    conformity with science, then there will be a great unifying,
    cleansing force in the world, which will sweep before it all wars,
    disagreements, discords and struggles, and then will mankind be
    united in the power of the love of God.”</q>

<p id='13.2' data-ref='bne_en-p787'>
The interpretation of prophecy is notoriously difficult, and on no
subject do the opinions of the learned differ more widely. This is
not to be wondered at, for, according to the revealed writings
themselves, many of the prophecies were given in such a form that
they could not be fully understood until the fulfillment came, and
even then, only by those who were pure in heart and free from
prejudice. Thus at the end of Daniel’s visions the seer was told: — </p>

  <p id='13.3' data-ref='bne_en-p788' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bible'>But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the
    time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
    increased.… And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my
    Lord, what shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way,
    Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the
    end.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  Daniel xii, 4–9. </span></p>


<p id='13.4' data-ref='bne_en-p789'>
If God sealed up the prophecies until the appointed time, and did not
fully reveal the interpretation even to the prophets who uttered
them, we may expect that none but the appointed Messenger of God will
be able to break the seal and disclose the meanings concealed in the
casket of the prophetic parables. Reflection on the history of
prophecies and their misinterpretation in previous ages and
dispensations, combined with the solemn warnings of the prophets
themselves, should render us very chary of accepting the speculations
of theologians as to the real meaning of these utterances and the
manner of their fulfillment. On the other hand, when someone appears
who claims to fulfill the prophecies, it is important that we examine
his claim with open, unprejudiced minds. Should he be an impostor,
the fraud will soon be discovered and no harm will be done, but woe
to all who carelessly turn God’s Messenger from the door because He
comes in an unexpected form or time.</p>


<p id='13.5' data-ref='bne_en-p790'>
The life and utterances of Bahá’u’lláh testify that He is the
Promised One of all the Holy Books, Who has the power to break the
seals of the prophecies and to pour forth the <q class='baha'>“Sealed choice wine”</q>
of the divine mysteries. Let us hasten, then, to hear His
explanations and to reexamine in their light the familiar but often
mysterious words spoken by the prophets of old.</p>







<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_791'>The Coming of the Lord</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.6' data-ref='bne_en-p791'>
The <q class='bible'>“Coming of the Lord”</q> in the <q class='bible'>“last days”</q> is the one
“far-off divine event” to which all the Prophets look forward,
about which Their most glorious songs are sung. Now what is meant by
the “Coming of the Lord”? Surely God is at all times with His
creatures, in all, through all, and over all; “Closer is He than
breathing, nearer than hands and feet.” Yes, but men cannot see or
hear God immanent and transcendent, cannot realize His Presence,
until He reveals Himself through a visible form and talks to them in
human language. For the revelation of His higher attributes, God has
always made use of a human instrument. Each of the Prophets was a
mediator through whom God visited and spoke to His people. Jesus was
such a mediator, and the Christians have rightly regarded His
appearance as a coming of God. In Him they saw the Face of God and
through His lips they heard the Voice of God. Bahá’u’lláh tells
us that the “Coming” of the Lord of Hosts, the Everlasting
Father, the Maker and Redeemer of the World, which, according to all
the Prophets, is to take place at “the time of the end,” means no
other than His manifestation in a human temple, as he manifested
through the temple of Jesus of Nazareth, only this time with a fuller
and more glorious revelation, for which Jesus and all the former
Prophets came to prepare men’s hearts and minds.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_792'>Prophecies about Christ</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.7' data-ref='bne_en-p792'>
Through failing to understand the meaning of the prophecies about the
dominion of the Messiah, the Jews rejected Christ. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
says: — </p>

  <p id='13.8' data-ref='bne_en-p793' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The Jews still await the coming of the Messiah, and pray to God day
    and night to hasten His advent. When Jesus came they denounced and
    slew Him, saying: “This is not the One for Whom we wait. Behold,
    when the Messiah shall come, signs and wonders shall testify that He
    is in truth the Christ. The Messiah will arise out of an unknown
    city. He shall sit upon the throne of David, and behold, He shall
    come with a sword of steel, and with a scepter of iron shall He rule.
    He shall fulfill the Law of the Prophets. He shall conquer the East
    and the West, and shall glorify His chosen people the Jews. He shall
    bring with Him a reign of Peace during which even the animals shall
    cease to be at enmity with man. For behold, the wolf and the lamb
    shall drink from the same spring … and all God’s creatures shall
    be at rest.…”</q> </p>


<p id='13.9' data-ref='bne_en-p794'>
Thus the Jews thought and spoke, for they did not understand the
Scriptures nor the glorious truths that were contained in them. The
letter they knew by heart, but of the life-giving Spirit they
understood not a word.</p>


<p id='13.10' data-ref='bne_en-p795'>
Hearken, and I will show you the meaning thereof: Although Christ
came from Nazareth, which was a known place, He came also from
heaven. His body was born of Mary, but His Spirit came from heaven.
The sword He carried was the sword of His tongue, with which He
divided the good from the evil, the true from the false, the faithful
from the unfaithful, and the light from the darkness. His Word was
indeed a sharp sword! The throne upon which He sat is the Eternal
Throne from which Christ reigns forever, a heavenly throne, not an
earthly one, for the things of earth pass away but heavenly things
pass not away. He reinterpreted and completed the Laws of Moses and
fulfilled the Law of the Prophets. His Word conquered the East and
the West. His kingdom is everlasting. He exalted those Jews who
recognized Him. They were men and women of humble birth, but contact
with Him made them great and gave them everlasting dignity. The
animals who were to live with one another signified the different
sects and races, who, once having been at war, were now to dwell in
love and charity, drinking together the Water of Life from Christ the
Eternal Spring.</p>


<p id='13.11' data-ref='bne_en-p796'>
Most Christians accept these interpretations of Messianic prophecies
as applied to Christ; but with regard to similar prophecies about the
latter-day Messiah, many of them take up the same attitude as the
Jews, expecting a miraculous display on the material plane which will
fulfill the very letter of the prophecies.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_797'>Prophecies about the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.12' data-ref='bne_en-p797'>
According to the Bahá’í interpretations, the prophecies which
speak of <q class='bible'>“the time of the end,”</q> the <q class='bible'>“last days,”</q> the coming
of the <q class='bible'>“Lord of hosts,”</q> of the <q class='bible'>“everlasting Father,”</q> refer
especially, not to the advent of Jesus Christ, but to that of
Bahá’u’lláh. Take, for instance, the well-known prophecy in
Isaiah: — </p>

  <p id='13.13' data-ref='bne_en-p798' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bible'>The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that
    dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light
    shined.… For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff
    of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.
    For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments
    rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire. For
    unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government
    shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful,
    Counsellor, The Mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of
    Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no
    end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and
    to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even
    for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.</q>
     <span class='block reference'>— Isa. ix, 2–7. </span></p>


<p id='13.14' data-ref='bne_en-p799'>
This is one of the prophecies that has often been regarded as
referring to Christ, and much of it may quite fairly be thus applied,
but a little examination will show how much more fully and aptly it
applies to Bahá’u’lláh. Christ has, indeed, been a
light-bringer and Savior, but for nearly two thousand years since His
advent the great majority of the people of the earth have continued
to walk in darkness, and the children of Israel and many other of
God’s children have continued to groan under the rod of the
oppressor. On the other hand, during the first few decades of the
Bahá’í era, the light of truth has illumined the East and the
West, the gospel of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man
has been carried into all countries of the world, the great military
autocracies have been overthrown, and a consciousness of world unity
has been born which brings hope of eventual relief to all the
downtrodden and oppressed nationalities of the world. The great war
which from 1914 to 1918 convulsed the world, with its unprecedented
use of firearms, liquid fire, incendiary bombs and fuel for engines,
has indeed been “with burning and fuel of fire.”<a data-fnid='1'></a>
Bahá’u’lláh, by dealing at great length in His Writings with
questions of government and administration, and showing how they may
best be solved, has <q class='bible'>“taken the government upon His shoulders”</q> in
a way that Christ never did. With regard to the titles <q class='bible'>“everlasting
Father,”</q> <q class='bible'>“Prince of Peace,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh repeatedly refers
to Himself as the manifestation of the Father, of whom Christ and
Isaiah spoke, whereas Christ always referred to Himself as the Son;
and Bahá’u’lláh declares that His mission is to establish peace
on earth, while Christ said: <q class='jesus'>“I came not to send peace but a
sword,”</q> and as a matter of fact during the whole of the Christian
era wars and sectarian strifes have abounded.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_800'>The Glory of God</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.15' data-ref='bne_en-p800'>
The title “Bahá’u’lláh” is the Arabic for “Glory of God,”
and this very title is frequently used by the Hebrew prophets for the
Promised One Who is to appear in the last days. Thus in the 40th
chapter of Isaiah we read: — </p>

  <p id='13.16' data-ref='bne_en-p801' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bible'>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye
    comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is
    accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of
    the Lord’s hand double for all her sins. The voice of him that
    crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
    straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be
    exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the
    crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: And the
    glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
    together.</q>
    <span class='block reference'>Isa. xl, 1–5.</span> </p>


<p id='13.17' data-ref='bne_en-p802'>
Like the former prophecy, this has also been partly fulfilled in the
advent of Christ and His forerunner, John the Baptist; but only
partly, for in the days of Christ the warfare of Jerusalem was not
accomplished; many centuries of bitter trial and humiliation were yet
in store for her. With the advent of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh,
however, the more complete fulfillment dawned for Jerusalem, and her
prospects of a peaceful and glorious future seem now to be reasonably
assured.</p>


<p id='13.18' data-ref='bne_en-p803'>
Other prophecies speak of the Redeemer of Israel, the Glory of the
Lord, as coming to the Holy Land from the East, from the rising of
the sun. Now Bahá’u’lláh appeared in Persia, which is eastward
from Palestine, towards the rising of the sun, and He came to the
Holy Land, where He spent the last twenty-four years of His life. Had
He come there as a free man, people might have said that it was the
trick of an impostor in order to conform to the prophecies; but He
came as an exile and prisoner. He was sent there by the <u>Sh</u>áh
of Persia and the Sulṭán of Turkey, who can hardly be suspected of
any design to furnish arguments in favor of Bahá’u’lláh’s
claim to be the “Glory of God” Whose coming the Prophets
foretold.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_804'>The Branch</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.19' data-ref='bne_en-p804'>
In the prophecies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Zechariah are
several references to a man called the Branch. These have often been
taken by Christians as applying to Christ, but are regarded by
Bahá’ís as referring especially to Bahá’u’lláh.</p>


<p id='13.20' data-ref='bne_en-p805'>
The longest Bible prophecy about the Branch is in the 11th chapter of
Isaiah: — </p>

  <p id='13.21' data-ref='bne_en-p806' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bible'>And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
    Branch shall grow out of his roots: And the spirit of the Lord shall
    rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of
    counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the
    Lord… righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
    faithfulness the girdle of his reins. The wolf also shall dwell with
    the lamb, and the leopard … with the kid; and the calf and the
    young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead
    them.… They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for
    the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters
    cover the sea.… And it shall come to pass in that day, that the
    Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant
    of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and
    from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from
    Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. And he shall set up an
    ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel,
    and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of
    the earth.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  Isa. xi, 1–12. </span></p>


<p id='13.22' data-ref='bne_en-p807'>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarks about this and other prophecies of the
Branch: — </p>

  <p id='13.23' data-ref='bne_en-p808' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>One of the great events which is to occur in the day of the
    manifestation of that incomparable Branch, is the hoisting of the
    Standard of God among all nations; meaning that all the nations and
    tribes will come under the shadow of this Divine Banner, which is no
    other than the Lordly Branch itself, and will become a single nation.
    The antagonism of faiths and religions, the hostility of races and
    peoples, and the national differences, will be eradicated from
    amongst them. All will become one religion, one faith, one race, and
    one single people, and will dwell in one native land, which is the
    terrestrial globe. Universal peace and concord will be realized
    between all the nations, and that incomparable Branch will gather
    together all Israel: signifying that in this cycle Israel will be
    gathered in the Holy Land, and that the Jewish people who are
    scattered to the East and West, South and North, will be assembled
    together.</q> </p>


  <p id='13.24' data-ref='bne_en-p809' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Now see: these events did not take place in the Christian cycle, for
    the nations did not come under the One Standard which is the Divine
    Branch. But in this cycle of the Lord of Hosts all the nations and
    people will enter under the shadow of this Flag. In the same way,
    Israel, scattered all over the world, was not reassembled in the Holy
    Land in the Christian cycle; but in the beginning of the cycle of
    Bahá’u’lláh this divine promise, as is clearly stated in all
    the Books of the Prophets, has begun to be manifest. You can see that
    form all the parts of the world tribes of Jews are coming to the Holy
    Land; they live in villages and lands which they make their own, and
    day by day they are increasing to such an extent, that all Palestine
    will become their home.</q>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_810'>The Day of God</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.25' data-ref='bne_en-p810'>
The word “Day” in such phrases as “Day of God” and “Last
Day” is interpreted as meaning “Dispensation.” Each of the
great religion-founders has His “Day.” Each is like a sun. His
teachings have their dawn, their truth gradually illumines more and
more the minds and hearts of the people until they attain the zenith
of their influence. Then they gradually become obscured,
misrepresented and corrupted, and darkness overshadows the earth
until the sun of a new day arises. The day of the Supreme
Manifestation of God is the Last Day, because it is a day that shall
never end, and shall not be overtaken by night. His sun shall never
set, but shall illumine the souls of men both in this world and in
the world to come. In reality none of the spiritual suns ever set.
The suns of Moses, of Christ, of Muḥammad, and all the other
Prophets are still shining in heaven with undiminished luster. But
earthborn clouds have concealed their radiance from the people of
earth. The Supreme Sun of Bahá’u’lláh will finally disperse
these dark clouds, so that the people of all religions will rejoice
in the light of all the Prophets, and with one accord worship the one
God Whose light all the Prophets have mirrored forth.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_811'>The Day of Judgment</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.26' data-ref='bne_en-p811'>
Christ spoke much in parables about a great Day of Judgment when <q class='jesus'>“the
Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father … and … shall
reward every man according to his works”</q> <span class='ref'>(Matt. xvi, 27).</span> He
compares this Day to the time of harvest, when the tares are burned
and the wheat gathered into barns: — </p>

  <p id='13.27' data-ref='bne_en-p812' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bible'>So shall it be in the end of this world [consummation of the
    age]. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
    gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do
    iniquity; And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be
    wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth
    as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  Matt. xiii, 40–43. </span></p>


<p id='13.28' data-ref='bne_en-p813'>
The phrase <q class='bible'>“end of the world”</q> used in the Authorized Version of
the Bible in this and similar passages has led many to suppose that
when the Day of Judgment comes, the earth will suddenly be destroyed,
but this is evidently a mistake. The true translation of the phrase
appears to be <q class='bible'>“the consummation or end of the age.”</q> Christ
teaches that the Kingdom of the Father is to be established on earth,
as well as in heaven. He teaches us to pray: <q class='jesus'>“Thy Kingdom come, Thy
will be done on earth as it is in heaven.”</q> In the parable of the
Vineyard, when the Father, the Lord of the Vineyard, comes to destroy
the wicked husbandmen, He does not destroy the vineyard (the world)
also, but lets it out to other husbandmen, who will render Him the
fruits in their season. The earth is not to be destroyed, but to be
renewed and regenerated. Christ speaks of that day on another
occasion as <q class='jesus'>“the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the
throne of his glory.”</q> St. Peter speaks of it as <q class='bible'>“the times of
refreshing,”</q> <q class='bible'>“the times of restitution of all things, which God
hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world
began.”</q> The Day of Judgment of which Christ speaks is evidently
identical with the coming of the Lord of Hosts, the Father, which was
prophesied by Isaiah and the other Old Testament prophets; a time of
terrible punishment for the wicked, but a time in which justice shall
be established and righteousness rule, on earth as in heaven.</p>


<p id='13.29' data-ref='bne_en-p814'>
In the Bahá’í interpretation, the coming of each Manifestation of
God is a Day of Judgment, but the coming of the supreme Manifestation
of Bahá’u’lláh is the great Day of Judgment for the world cycle
in which we are living. The trumpet blast of which Christ and
Muḥammad and many other prophets speak is the call of the
Manifestation, which is sounded for all who are in heaven and on
earth — the embodied and the disembodied. The meeting with God,
through His Manifestation, is, for those who desire to meet Him, the
gateway to the Paradise of knowing and loving Him, and living in love
with all His creatures. Those, on the other hand, who prefer their
own way to God’s way, as revealed by the Manifestation, thereby
consign themselves to the hell of selfishness, error and enmity.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_815'>The Great Resurrection</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.30' data-ref='bne_en-p815'>
The Day of Judgment is also the Day of Resurrection, of the raising
of the dead. St. Paul in his First Epistle to the Corinthians says: — </p>

  <p id='13.31' data-ref='bne_en-p816' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bible'>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall
    all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
    trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
    incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put
    on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> — I Cor. xv, 51–53.<span></p>


<p id='13.32' data-ref='bne_en-p817'>
As to the meaning of these passages about the raising of the dead,
Bahá’u’lláh writes in the <i>Book of Íqán</i>: — </p>

  <p id='13.33' data-ref='bne_en-p818' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>… By the terms “life” and “death,” spoken of in the
    scriptures, is intended the life of faith and the death of unbelief.
    The generality of the people, owing to their failure to grasp the
    meaning of these words, rejected and despised the person of the
    Manifestation, deprived themselves of the light of His divine
    guidance, and refused to follow the example of that immortal Beauty.… </q> </p>



  <p id='13.34' data-ref='bne_en-p819' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>… Even as Jesus said: “Ye must be born again” [John iii, 7].
    Again He saith: “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit,
    he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the
    flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit”
    [John iii, 56]. The purpose of these words is that whosoever in every
    dispensation is born of the Spirit and is quickened by the breath of
    the Manifestation of Holiness, he verily is of those that have
    attained unto “life” and “resurrection” and have entered into
    the “paradise” of the love of God. And whosoever is not of them,
    is condemned to “death” and “deprivation,” to the “fire”
    of unbelief, and to the “wrath” of God.… </q> </p>



  <p id='13.35' data-ref='bne_en-p820' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>In every age and century, the purpose of the Prophets of God and
    their chosen ones hath been no other but to affirm the spiritual
    significance of the terms “life,” “resurrection,” and
    “judgment.” … Wert thou to attain to but a dewdrop of the
    crystal waters of divine knowledge, thou wouldst readily realize that
    true life is not the life of the flesh but the life of the spirit.
    For the life of the flesh is common to both men and animals, whereas
    the life of the spirit is possessed only by the pure in heart who
    have quaffed from the ocean of faith and partaken of the fruit of
    certitude. This life knoweth no death, and this existence is crowned
    by immortality. Even as it hath been said: “He who is a true
    believer liveth both in this world and in the world to come.” If by
    “life” be meant this earthly life, it is evident that death must
    needs overtake it.</q>
     <span class='block reference'>— <i>Kitáb-i-Íqán</i>.</span></p>


<p id='13.36' data-ref='bne_en-p821'>
According to the Bahá’í teaching the Resurrection has nothing to
do with the gross physical body. That body, once dead, is done with.
It becomes decomposed and its atoms will never be recomposed into the
same body.</p>


<p id='13.37' data-ref='bne_en-p822'>
Resurrection is the birth of the individual to spiritual life,
through the gift of the Holy Spirit bestowed through the
Manifestation of God. The grave from which he arises is the grave of
ignorance and negligence of God. The sleep from which he awakens is
the dormant spiritual condition in which many await the dawn of the
Day of God. This dawn illumines all who have lived on the face of the
earth, whether they are in the body or out of the body, but those who
are spiritually blind cannot perceive it. The Day of Resurrection is
not a day of twenty-four hours, but an era which has now begun and
will last as long as the present world cycle continues. It will
continue when all traces of the present civilization will have been
wiped off the surface of the globe.</p>

<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.38' data-ref='bne_en-p823'>
In many of His conversations Christ speaks of the future
Manifestation of God in the third person, but in others the first
person is used. He says: <q class='jesus'>“I go to prepare a place for you. And if I
go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you
unto myself”</q> <span class='ref'>(John xiv, 2–3)</span>. In the first chapter of Acts we
read that the disciples were told, at the ascension of Jesus: <q class='bible'>“This
same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in
like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.”</q> Because of these
and similar sayings, many Christians expect that when the Son of Man
comes <q class='bible'>“in the clouds of heaven and with great glory”</q> they shall
see in bodily form the very Jesus Who walked the streets of Jerusalem
two thousand years ago, and bled and suffered on the cross. They
expect to be able to thrust their fingers into the prints of the
nails on His hands and feet, and their hands into the spear wound in
His side. But surely a little reflection on Christ’s own words
would dissipate such an idea. The Jews of Christ’s time had just
such ideas about the return of Elias, but Jesus explained their
error, showing that the prophecy that <q class='bible'>“Elias must first come”</q> was
fulfilled, not by the return of the person and body of the former
Elias, but in the person of John the Baptist, who came <q class='bible'>“in the
spirit and power of Elias.”</q> <q class='bible'>“And if ye will receive it,”</q> said
Christ, <q class='baha'>“this is Elias, which was for to come. He that hath ears to
hear, let him hear.”</q> The <q class='bible'>“return”</q> of Elias, therefore, meant
the appearance of another person, born of other parents, but inspired
by God with the same spirit and power. These words of Jesus may
surely be taken to imply that the return of Christ will, in like
manner, be accomplished by the appearance of another person, born of
another mother, but showing forth the Spirit and Power of God even as
Christ did. Bahá’u’lláh explains that the <q class='bible'>“coming again”</q> of
Christ was fulfilled in the advent of the Báb and in his own coming.
He says: — </p>

    <q class='baha'>Consider the sun. Were it to say now, “I am the sun of yesterday,”
  it would speak the truth. And should it, bearing the sequence of time
  in mind, claim to be other than that sun, it still would speak the
  truth. In like manner, if it be said that all the days are but one
  and the same, it is correct and true. And if it be said, with respect
  to their particular names and designations, that they differ, that
  again is true. For though they are the same, yet one doth recognize
  in each a separate designation, a specific attribute, a particular
  character. Conceive accordingly the distinction, variation, and unity
  characteristic of the various Manifestations of holiness, that thou
  mayest comprehend the allusions made by the creator of all names and
  attributes to the mysteries of distinction and unity, and discover
  the answer to thy question as to why that everlasting Beauty should
  have, at sundry times, called Himself by different names and
  titles.</q>

<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.42' data-ref='bne_en-p827'>
Christ and His apostles mentioned many signs which would distinguish
the times of the <q class='jesus'>“Return”</q> of the Son of Man in the glory of the
Father. Christ said: — </p>

  <p id='13.43' data-ref='bne_en-p828' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='jesus'>And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that
    the desolation thereof is nigh.… For these be the days of
    vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.… for
    there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this
    people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be
    led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden
    down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles shall be

<p id='13.44' data-ref='bne_en-p829' class='noid'>Again He said: — </p>

    <q class='bible'>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name,
    saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. And ye shall hear of
    wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these
    things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall
    rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be
    famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All
    these are the beginning of sorrows. Then shall they deliver you up to
    be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all
    nations for my name’s sake. And then shall many be offended, and
    shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false
    prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity
    shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall
    endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel of the
    kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all
    nations; and then shall the end come.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  Matt. xxiv, 4–14. </span></p>


<p id='13.46' data-ref='bne_en-p831'>
In these two passages Christ foretold in plain terms, without veil or
covering, the things that must come to pass before the coming of the
Son of Man. During the centuries that have elapsed since Christ
spoke, every one of these signs has been fulfilled. In the last part
of each passage He mentions an event that shall mark the time of the
coming — in one case the ending of the Jewish exile and the
restoration of Jerusalem, and in the other the preaching of the
gospel in all the world. It is startling to find that both of these
signs are being literally fulfilled in our own times. If these parts
of the prophecy are as true as the rest, it follows that we must be
living now in the <q class='jesus'>“time of the end”</q> of which Christ spoke.</p>


<p id='13.47' data-ref='bne_en-p832'>
Muḥammad also mentions certain signs which will persist until the
Day of Resurrection. In the Qur’án we read: — </p>

  <p id='13.48' data-ref='bne_en-p833' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='quran'>When Alláh said: “O Jesus! Verily I will cause thee to die, and
  exalt thee towards Me, and clear thee of the charges of those who
  disbelieve, and will place those who follow thee [that is,
  Christians] above those who disbelieve [Jews and others], until the
  Day of Resurrection; then to Me shall be your return, so I will
  decide between you concerning that in which you differed.”</q>
     <span class='block reference'>— Súrih iii, 54. </span></p>


  <p id='13.49' data-ref='bne_en-p834' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='quran'>“The Hand of God,” say the Jews, “is chained up.” Their own
  hands shall be chained up — and for that which they have said shall
  they be cursed. Nay! outstretched are both His hands! At His own
  pleasure doth He bestow gifts. That which hath been sent down to thee
  from thy Lord will surely increase the rebellion and unbelief of many
  of them; and We have put enmity and hatred between them that shall
  last until the Day of Resurrection. Oft as they kindle a beacon fire
  for war shall God quench it.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  Súrih v, 69. </span></p>


  <p id='13.50' data-ref='bne_en-p835' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='quran'>And of those who say, “We are Christians,” have We accepted the
  Covenant. But they too have forgotten a part of what they were

  that shall last till the Day of Resurrection; and in the end will God
  tell them of their doings.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  Súrih v, 17. </span></p>


<p id='13.51' data-ref='bne_en-p836'>
These words also have been literally fulfilled in the subjection of
the Jews to Christian (and Muslim) peoples, and in the sectarianism
and strife which have divided both Jews and Christians among
themselves during all the centuries since Muḥammad spoke. Only
since the commencement of the Bahá’í era (the Day of
Resurrection) have signs of the approaching end of these conditions
made their appearance.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_837'>Signs in Heaven and Earth</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.52' data-ref='bne_en-p837'>
In the Hebrew, Christian, Muḥammadan and many other Scriptures,
there is a remarkable similarity in the description of the signs
which are to accompany the coming of the Promised One.</p>


<p id='13.53' data-ref='bne_en-p838' class='noid'>In the Book of Joel we read: — </p>

    the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, I will also gather all nations,
    and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat [Jehovah
    judgeth], and will plead with them there.… Multitudes, multitudes
    in the valley of decision: for the day of the Lord is near in the
    valley of decision. The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the
    stars shall withdraw their shining. The Lord also shall roar out of
    Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the
    earth shall shake; but the Lord will be the hope of his people.</q>
     <span class='block reference'>— Joel ii, 30–31; iii, 1–2, 14–16. </span></p>

<p id='13.57' data-ref='bne_en-p842' class='noid'>In the Qur’án we read: — </p>

     <span class='block reference'> —  Súrih lxxxi. </span></p>


<p id='13.59' data-ref='bne_en-p844'>
In the <i>Book of Íqán</i> Bahá’u’lláh explains that these
prophecies about the sun, moon and stars, the heavens and the earth,
are symbolical and are not to be understood merely in the literal
sense. The Prophets were primarily concerned with spiritual, not
material, things; with spiritual, not with physical, light. When They
mention the sun, in connection with the Day of Judgment, They refer
to the Sun of Righteousness. The sun is the supreme source of light,
so Moses was a sun for the Hebrews, Christ for the Christians, and
Muḥammad for the Muslims. When the Prophets speak of the sun being
darkened, what is meant is that the pure teachings of these spiritual
Suns have become obscured by misrepresentation, misunderstanding and
prejudice, so that the people are in spiritual darkness. The moon and
stars are the lesser sources of illumination, the religious leaders
and teachers, who should guide and inspire the people. When it is
said that the moon shall not give her light or shall be turned into
blood, and the stars shall fall from heaven, it is indicated that the
leaders of the churches shall become debased, engaging in strife and
contention, and the priests shall become worldly minded, concerned
about earthly instead of heavenly things.</p>


<p id='13.60' data-ref='bne_en-p845'>
The meaning of these prophecies is not exhausted by one explanation,
however, and there are other senses in which these symbols can be
interpreted. Bahá’u’lláh says that in another sense the words
“sun,” “moon,” and “stars” are applied to the ordinances
and instructions enacted in every religion. As in every subsequent
Manifestation the ceremonies, forms, customs and instructions of the
preceding Manifestations are changed in accordance with the
requirements of the times, so, in this sense the sun and moon are
changed and the stars dispersed.</p>


<p id='13.61' data-ref='bne_en-p846'>
In many cases the literal fulfillment of these prophecies in the
outward sense would be absurd or impossible; for example, the moon
being turned into blood or the stars falling upon the earth. The
least of the visible stars is many thousand times larger than the
earth, and were one to fall on the earth there would be no earth left
for another to fall on! In other cases, however, there is a material
as well as a spiritual fulfillment. For example, the Holy Land did
literally become desert and desolate during many centuries, as
foretold by the prophets, but already, in the Day of Resurrection, it
is beginning to <q class='bible'>“rejoice and blossom as the rose,”</q> as Isaiah
foretold. Prosperous colonies are being started, the land is being
irrigated and cultivated, and vineyards, olive groves and gardens are
flourishing where half a century ago there was only sandy waste.
Doubtless when men beat their swords into ploughshares and their
spears into pruning hooks, wildernesses and deserts in all parts of
the world will be reclaimed; the scorching winds and sandstorms that
blow from these deserts, and make life in their neighborhood
well-nigh intolerable, will be things of the past; the climate of the
whole earth will become milder and more equable; cities will no
longer defile the air with smoke and poisonous fumes, and even in the
outward, material sense there will be <q class='bible'>“new heavens and a new
earth.”</q></p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_847'>Manner of Coming</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='13.62' data-ref='bne_en-p847' class='nodropcap'>
  As to the manner of His coming at the end of the age, Christ said: — </p>

  <p id='13.63' data-ref='bne_en-p848' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bible'>And they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with
    power and great glory. And he shall send his angels with a great
    sound of a trumpet.… then shall he sit upon the throne of his
    glory: And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
    separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from
    the goats.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  Matt. xxiv, 30–31; xxv, 31–32. </span></p>


<p id='13.64' data-ref='bne_en-p849'>
Regarding these and similar passages Bahá’u’lláh writes in the
<i>Book of Íqán</i>: — </p>

  <p id='13.65' data-ref='bne_en-p850' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>… The term “heaven” denoteth loftiness and exaltation,
    inasmuch as it is the seat of the revelation of those Manifestations
    of Holiness, the Daysprings of ancient glory. These ancient Beings,
    though delivered from the womb of their mother, have in reality
    descended from the heaven of the will of God. Though they be dwelling
    on this earth, yet their true habitations are the retreats of glory
    in the realms above. Whilst walking amongst mortals, they soar in the
    heaven of the divine presence. Without feet they tread the path of
    the spirit, and without wings they rise unto the exalted heights of
    divine unity. With every fleeting breath they cover the immensity of
    space, and at every moment traverse the kingdoms of the visible and
    the invisible.… </q> </p>



  <p id='13.66' data-ref='bne_en-p851' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>… By the term “clouds” is meant those things that are contrary
  to the ways and desires of men. Even as He hath revealed in the verse
  already quoted: “As oft as an Apostle cometh unto you with that
  which your souls desire not, ye swell with pride, accusing some of
  being impostors and slaying others.” [Qur’án 2:87.] These
  “clouds” signify, in one sense, the annulment of laws, the
  abrogation of former Dispensations, the repeal of rituals and customs
  current amongst men, the exalting of the illiterate faithful above
  the learned opposers of the Faith. In another sense, they mean the
  appearance of that immortal Beauty in the image of mortal man, with
  such human limitations as eating and drinking, poverty and riches,
  glory and abasement, sleeping and waking, and such other things as
  cast doubt in the minds of men, and cause them to turn away. All such
  veils are symbolically referred to as “clouds.”</q> </p>


  <p id='13.67' data-ref='bne_en-p852' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>These are the “clouds” that cause the heavens of the knowledge
  and understanding of all that dwell on earth to be cloven asunder.
  Even as He hath revealed: “On that day shall the heaven be cloven
  by the clouds.” [Qur’án 25:25]. Even as the clouds prevent the
  eyes of men from beholding the sun, so do these things hinder the
  souls of men from recognizing the light of the divine Luminary. To
  this beareth witness that which hath proceeded out of the mouth of
  the unbelievers as revealed in the sacred Book: “And they have
  said: ‘What manner of apostle is this? He eateth food, and walketh
  the streets. Unless an angel be sent down and take part in His
  warnings, we will not believe.’” [Qur’án 25:7.] Other
  Prophets, similarly, have been subject to poverty and afflictions, to
  hunger, and to the ills and chances of this world. As these holy
  Persons were subject to such needs and wants, the people were,
  consequently, lost in the wilds of misgivings and doubts, and were
  afflicted with bewilderment and perplexity. How, they wondered, could
  such a person be sent down from God, assert His ascendancy over all
  the peoples and kindreds of the earth, and claim Himself to be the
  goal of all creation, — even as He hath said: “But for Thee, I
  would have not created all that are in heaven and on earth,” — and
  yet be subject to such trivial things? You must undoubtedly have been
  informed of the tribulations, the poverty, the ills, and the
  degradation that have befallen every Prophet of God and His
  companions. You must have heard how the heads of their followers were
  sent as presents unto different cities, how grievously they were
  hindered from that whereunto they were commanded. Each and every one
  of them fell a prey to the hands of the enemies of His Cause, and had
  to suffer whatsoever they decreed.… </q> </p>



  <p id='13.68' data-ref='bne_en-p853' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>… The All-Glorious hath decreed these very things, that are
  contrary to the desires of wicked men, to be the touchstone and
  standard whereby He proveth His servants, that the just may be known
  from the wicked, and the faithful distinguished from the infidel.… </q> </p>



  <p id='13.69' data-ref='bne_en-p854' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>And now, concerning His words: “And He shall send His angels.…”
  By “angels” is meant those who, reinforced by the power of the
  spirit, have consumed, with the fire of the love of God, all human
  traits and limitations, and have clothed themselves with the
  attributes of the most exalted Beings and of the Cherubim.… </q> </p>



  <p id='13.70' data-ref='bne_en-p855' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>As the adherents of Jesus have never understood the hidden meaning of
  these words, and as the signs which they and leaders of their Faith
  have expected have failed to appear, they therefore refused to
  acknowledge, even until now, the truth of those Manifestations of
  Holiness that have since the days of Jesus been made manifest. They
  have thus deprived themselves of the outpourings of God’s holy
  grace, and of the wonders of His divine utterance. Such is their low
  estate in this, the Day of Resurrection! They have even failed to
  perceive that were the signs of the Manifestation of God in every age
  to appear in the visible realm in accordance with the text of
  established traditions, none could possibly deny or turn away, not
  would the blessed be distinguished from the miserable, and the
  transgressor from the God-fearing. Judge fairly: Were the prophecies
  recorded in the Gospel to be literally fulfilled; were Jesus, Son of
  Mary, accompanied by angels, to descend from the visible heaven upon
  the clouds; who would dare to disbelieve, who would dare to reject
  the truth, and wax disdainful? Nay, such consternation would
  immediately seize all the dwellers of the earth that no soul would
  feel able to utter a word, much less to reject or accept the
  truth.</q>

<p id='13.71' data-ref='bne_en-p856'>
According to the above explanation the coming of the Son of Man, in
lowly human form, born of woman, poor, uneducated, oppressed and set
at naught by the great ones of the earth — this manner of coming is
the very touchstone by which He judges the people of earth and
separates them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from
the goats. Those whose spiritual eyes are opened can see through
those clouds and rejoice in the <q class='bible'>“power and great glory”</q> — the
very glory of God — which He comes to reveal; the others, whose eyes
are still holden by prejudice and error, can see but the dark clouds
and continue to grope in gloom, deprived of the blessed sunshine.</p>


  <p id='13.72' data-ref='bne_en-p857' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bible'>Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before
    me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple,
    even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in.… But who
    may abide the day of his coming? And who shall stand when he
    appeareth? For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’
    sope.… For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and

Note — The subject of fulfillment of prophecy is such an extensive
one that many volumes would be required for its adequate exposition.
All that can be done within the limits of a single chapter is to
indicate the main outlines of the Bahá’í interpretations. The
detailed Apocalypses revealed by Daniel and St. John have been left
untouched. Readers will find certain chapters of these dealt with in
<i>Some Answered Questions</i>. In the <i>Book of Íqán</i>, by

<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='14.2' data-ref='bne_en-p860'>
God, and God alone, has the power to do whatever He wills, and the
greatest proof of a Manifestation of God is the creative power of His
word — its effectiveness to change and transform all human affairs
and to triumph over all human opposition. Through the word of the
Prophets God announces His will, and the immediate or subsequent
fulfillment of that word is the clearest proof of the Prophet’s
claim and of the genuineness of His inspiration.</p>


<p id='14.3' data-ref='bne_en-p861'>
For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from the heaven, and
returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring
forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the

not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please,
and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. — Isa. lv,
10–11.</p>


<p id='14.4' data-ref='bne_en-p862'>
When the disciples of John the Baptist came to Jesus with the
question: <q class='bible'>“Art thou he that should come, or do we look for
another?”</q> the answer of Jesus was simply to point to the effects
wrought by His words: — </p>

  <p id='14.5' data-ref='bne_en-p863' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='bible'>Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see: The
    blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are

    not be offended in me.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  Matt. xi, 4–6. </span></p>


<p id='14.6' data-ref='bne_en-p864'>
Let us now see what evidence there is to show whether the words of
Bahá’u’lláh have this creative power which is distinctive of
the word of God.</p>


<p id='14.7' data-ref='bne_en-p865'>
Bahá’u’lláh commanded the rulers to establish universal peace,
and their prolongation of the policy of war since 1869–1870 has
overthrown many ancient dynasties, while each successive war has
produced less and less fruits of victory, until the European War of
1914–1918 revealed the historically startling fact that was has
become disastrous to victor and vanquished alike.<a data-fnid='1'></a></p>


<p id='14.8' data-ref='bne_en-p866'>
Bahá’u’lláh bade the rulers likewise to act as trustees of
those under their control, making political authority a means to true
general welfare. The progress toward social legislation has been
unprecedented.</p>


<p id='14.9' data-ref='bne_en-p867'>
He commanded limitation of the extremes of wealth and poverty, and
ever since, legislation for the establishment of minimum subsistence
levels and for graduated taxation of wealth by income and inheritance
taxes has been a constant concern. He commanded the abolition of both
chattel and economic slavery, and ever since, the progress toward
emancipation has been a ferment in all parts of the world.</p>


<p id='14.10' data-ref='bne_en-p868'>
Bahá’u’lláh declared the equality of men and women, expressed
through equal responsibilities and equal rights and privileges, and
since that declaration, the bonds by which women have been bound for
ages have been breaking, and woman has rapidly been securing her
rightful place as the equal and partner of man.</p>


<p id='14.11' data-ref='bne_en-p869'>
He declared the fundamental oneness of religions, and the succeeding
interval has witnessed the most determined efforts of sincere souls
in all parts of the world to achieve a new degree of tolerance, of
mutual understanding and of cooperation for universal ends. The
sectarian attitude has everywhere been undermined, and its historical
position has become more and more untenable. The basis of
exclusiveness in religion has been destroyed by the same forces
making nationalism of the self-contained type incapable of survival.</p>


<p id='14.12' data-ref='bne_en-p870'>
He commanded universal education, and made the independent
investigation of truth a proof of spiritual vitality. Modern
civilization has been stirred to its depths by this new leaven.
Compulsory education for children, and the extension of educational
facilities for adults, have become a primary policy of government.
Nations which deliberately seek to restrict that very policy have
aroused revolution within and suspicion and fear outside their
boundaries.</p>


<p id='14.13' data-ref='bne_en-p871'>
Bahá’u’lláh commanded the adoption of a universal auxiliary
language, and Dr. Zamenhof and others obeyed His call by devoting
their lives and genius to this great task and opportunity.</p>


<p id='14.14' data-ref='bne_en-p872'>
Above all, Bahá’u’lláh imbued humanity with a new spirit,
arousing new longings in minds and hearts and new ideals for society.
Nothing in all history is so dramatic and impressive as the course of
events since the dawn of the Bahá’í era in 1844. Year by year,
the power of a dead past prolonged through outworn ideas, habits,
attitudes and institutions has weakened, until at present every
intelligent man and woman on earth realizes that humanity is passing
through its most terrible crisis. On the one hand we see the new
creation arising as the light of Bahá’u’lláh’s teaching has
revealed the true path of evolution. On the other hand we see naught
but disaster and frustration in all realms where that light is
resisted or ignored.</p>


<p id='14.15' data-ref='bne_en-p873'>
Yet, to the faithful Bahá’í, these and countless other evidences,
impressive as they are, fail to give the real measure of the
spiritual majesty of Bahá’u’lláh. His life on earth, and the
irresistible force of His inspired words, stand as the only true
criterion of the will of God.</p>


<p id='14.16' data-ref='bne_en-p874'>
A study of the more detailed prophecies of Bahá’u’lláh and
their fulfillment will give powerful corroborative evidence. Of these
prophecies we shall now proceed to give a few examples, about the
authenticity of which there can be no dispute. They were widely
published and known before their fulfillment came about. The letter
which He sent to the crowned heads of the world, in which many of
these prophecies occur, were compiled in a book which was first
published in Bombay in the late nineteenth century. Several editions
have since been published. We shall also give some examples of
noteworthy prophecies by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_875'>Napoleon III</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='14.17' data-ref='bne_en-p875'>
In the year 1869 Bahá’u’lláh wrote to Napoleon III, rebuking
him for his lust of war and for the contempt with which he had
treated a former letter from Bahá’u’lláh. The Epistle contains
the following stern warning: — </p>

  <p id='14.18' data-ref='bne_en-p876' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>For what thou hast done, thy kingdom shall be thrown into confusion,
    and thine empire shall pass from thine hands, as a punishment for
    that which thou hast wrought. Then wilt thou know how thou hast
    plainly erred. Commotions shall seize all the people in that land,
    unless thou arisest to help this Cause, and followest Him Who is the
    Spirit of God (Jesus Christ) in this, the Straight Path. Hath thy
    pomp made thee proud? By My Life! It shall not endure; nay, it shall
    soon pass away, unless thou holdest fast by this firm Cord. We see
    abasement hastening after thee, whilst thou art of the heedless.</q> </p>


<p id='14.19' data-ref='bne_en-p877'>
Needless to say, Napoleon, who was then at the zenith of his power,
paid no heed to this warning. In the following year he went to war
with Prussia, firmly convinced that his troops could easily gain
Berlin; but the tragedy foretold by Bahá’u’lláh overwhelmed
him. He was defeated at Saarbruck, at Weisenburg, at Metz, and
finally in the crushing catastrophe at Sedan. He was then carried
prisoner to Prussia, and came to a miserable end in England two years
later.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_878'>Germany</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='14.20' data-ref='bne_en-p878'>
Bahá’u’lláh later gave an equally solemn warning to the
conquerors of Napoleon, which also fell on deaf ears and received a
terrible fulfillment. In the <i>Book of Aqdas</i>, which was begun in
Adrianople, and finished in the early years of Bahá’u’lláh’s
imprisonment in ‘Akká, He addressed the Emperor of Germany as
follows: — </p>

  <p id='14.21' data-ref='bne_en-p879' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O King of Berlin! … Do thou remember the one whose power
    transcended thy power (Napoleon III) and whose station excelled thy
    station. Where is he? Whither are gone the things he possessed? Take
    warning, and be not of them that are fast asleep. He it was who cast
    the Tablet of God behind him, when We made known unto him what the
    hosts of tyranny had caused Us to suffer. Wherefore, disgrace
    assailed him from all sides, and he went down to dust in great loss.
    Think deeply, O King, concerning him, and concerning them who, like
    unto thee, have conquered cities and ruled over men. The All-Merciful
    brought them down from their palaces to their graves. Be warned, be
    of them who reflect.… </q> </p>



  <p id='14.22' data-ref='bne_en-p880' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O banks of the Rhine! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as
    the swords of retribution were drawn against you; and you shall have
    another turn. And We hear the lamentations of Berlin, though she be
    today in conspicuous glory.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i>. </span></p>


<p id='14.23' data-ref='bne_en-p881'>
During the period of German successes in the Great War of 1914–1918,
and especially during the last great German offensive in the spring
of 1918, this well-known prophecy was extensively quoted by the
opponents of the Bahá’í Faith in Persia, in order to discredit
Bahá’u’lláh; but when the forward sweep of the victorious
Germans was suddenly transformed into crushing, overwhelming
disaster, the efforts of these enemies of the Bahá’í Cause
recoiled on themselves, and the notoriety which they had given to the
prophecy became a powerful means of enhancing the reputation of
Bahá’u’lláh.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_882'>Persia</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='14.24' data-ref='bne_en-p882'>
In the Book of Aqdas written when the tyrannical Náṣiri’d-Dín
<u>Sh</u>áh was at the height of his power, Bahá’u’lláh
blesses the city of Ṭihrán, which is the capital of Persia, and
His own birthplace, and says of it: — </p>

  <p id='14.25' data-ref='bne_en-p883' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Let nothing grieve thee, O Land of Tá (Ṭihrán), for God hath
    chosen thee to be the source of the joy of all mankind. He shall, if
    it be His will, bless thy throne with one who will rule with justice,
    who will gather together the flock of God which the wolves have
    scattered. Such a ruler will, with joy and gladness, turn his face
    towards, and extend his favors unto, the people of Bahá. He indeed
    is accounted in the sight of God as a jewel among men. Upon him rest
    forever the glory of God, and the glory of all that dwell in the
    kingdom of His Revelation.</q> </p>


  <p id='14.26' data-ref='bne_en-p884' class='blockquote'>

    thee — a name through which the Daystar of Grace hath shed its
    splendor, through which both earth and heaven have been illumined.</q> </p>

<p id='14.28' data-ref='bne_en-p886'>
So far, Persia has only begun to emerge from the period of confusion
foretold by Bahá’u’lláh, but already constitutional government
has been started, and signs are not lacking that a brighter era is at
hand.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_887'>Turkey</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='14.29' data-ref='bne_en-p887'>
To the Sulṭán of Turkey and his Prime Minister ‘Alí Pá<u>sh</u>á,
Bahá’u’lláh, then (in 1868) confined in a Turkish prison,
addressed some of His most solemn, grave warnings. To the Sulṭán
He wrote from the Barracks at ‘Akká: — </p>

  <p id='14.30' data-ref='bne_en-p888' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>… O thou who hast imagined thyself to be the most exalted of men …
    Thou, too, shalt … find thyself in grievous loss. Even if this
    Lifegiver and World Reformer be in thine estimation guilty of
    sedition and strife, what crime could have been committed by a group
    of women, children, and suckling mothers that they should be thus
    afflicted with the scourge of thine anger and wrath? Ye have
    plundered and unjustly despoiled a group of people who have never
    rebelled in your domains, nor disobeyed your government, but rather
    kept to themselves and engaged day and night in the remembrance of
    God.… A handful of clay is greater in the sight of God than all
    your dominion and your sovereignty, and all your might and your
    fortune. Should it be His wish, He would scatter you in dust. Soon
    will He seize you in His wrathful anger, sedition will be stirred up
    in your midst, and your dominions will be disrupted. Then will ye
    wail and lament, and will find none to help or succor you.… Be
    expectant, however, for the wrath of God is ready to overtake you.
    Erelong will ye behold that which hath been sent down from the Pen of
    My command.</q> </p>


<p id='14.31' data-ref='bne_en-p889' class='noid'>And to ‘Alí Pá<u>sh</u>á He wrote: — </p>

  <p id='14.32' data-ref='bne_en-p890' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Thou hast, O Chief, committed that which hath caused Muḥammad, the
    Apostle of God, to lament in the most sublime Paradise. The world
    hath made thee proud, so much so that thou hast turned away from the
    Face through whose brightness the Concourse on high hath been
    illumined. Soon thou shalt find thyself in manifest loss! Thou didst
    conspire with the Persian Ambassador to harm Me, though I had come
    unto you from the source of majesty and grandeur with a Revelation
    that hath solaced the eyes of the favored ones of God.…</q> </p>


  <p id='14.33' data-ref='bne_en-p891' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>Hast thou imagined thyself capable of extinguishing the fire which
    God hath kindled in the heart of creation? Nay, by Him Who is the
    Eternal Truth, couldst thou but know it. Rather, on account of what
    thy hands have wrought, it blazed higher and burned more fiercely.
    Erelong will it encompass the earth and all that dwell therein.… </q> </p>



  <p id='14.34' data-ref='bne_en-p892' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>The day is approaching when the Land of Mystery [Adrianople] and what

    be raised, and the evidences of mischief shall be revealed on all
    sides, and confusion shall spread by reason of that which hath
    befallen these captives at the hands of the hosts of oppression. The
    course of things shall be altered, and conditions shall wax so
    grievous, that the very sands on the desolate hills will moan, and
    the trees on the mountain will weep, and blood will flow out of all
    things. Then wilt thou behold the people in sore distress.…</q> </p>

    <q class='baha'>Thus hath the True One come and the command of Him Who is the

    His Revelation throughout the world.</q> </p>


<p id='14.36' data-ref='bne_en-p894' class='noid'>Again in the <i>Book of Aqdas</i> He wrote: — </p>

    <q class='baha'>O Spot [Constantinople] that art situate on the shores of the two
    seas! The throne of tyranny hath, verily, been established upon thee,

    wise that the Concourse on high and they who circle around the
    Exalted Throne have wailed and lamented. We behold in thee the
    foolish ruling over the wise, and darkness vaunting itself against
    the light. Thou art indeed filled with manifest pride. Hath thine
    outward splendor made thee vainglorious? By Him Who is the Lord of
    mankind! It shall soon perish, and thy daughters and thy widows and
    all the kindreds that dwell within thee shall lament. Thus informeth

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_897'>America</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='14.39' data-ref='bne_en-p897'>
In the <i>Book of Aqdas</i>, revealed in ‘Akká in 1873,
Bahá’u’lláh appealed to America as follows: — </p>

  <p id='14.40' data-ref='bne_en-p898' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='baha'>O Rulers of America and the Presidents of the Republics therein …
    Give ear unto that which hath been raised from the Dayspring of
    Grandeur: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Lord of
    Utterance, the All-Knowing. Bind ye the broken with the hands of
    justice, and crush the oppressor who flourisheth with the rod of the
    commandments of your Lord, the Ordainer, the All-Wise.</q>
     <span class='block reference'> —  <i>Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i>. </span></p>


<p id='14.41' data-ref='bne_en-p899'>
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His addresses in America and elsewhere
frequently expressed the hope, the prayer and the assurance that the
banner of international peace would be first raised in America. At
Cincinnati, Ohio, on November 5, 1912, He said: — </p>

  <p id='14.42' data-ref='bne_en-p900' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>America is a noble nation, the standard-bearer of peace throughout
    the world, shedding light to all regions. Foreign nations are not
    untrammeled and free from intrigues and complications like the United
    States; therefore, they are not able to bring about universal
    harmony. But America — praise be to God! — is at peace with all the
    world and is worthy of raising the flag of brotherhood and
    international agreement. When this is done, the rest of the world
    will accept. All nations will join in adopting the teachings of
    Bahá’u’lláh revealed more than fifty years ago. In His Epistles
    He asked the parliaments of the world to send their wisest and best
    men to an international world conference which should decide all
    questions between the peoples and establish universal peace.… This
    would be the highest court of appeal, and the parliament of man so
    long dreamed of by poets and idealists would be realized.</q> </p>


<p id='14.43' data-ref='bne_en-p901'>
The appeals of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have already
been responded to, in a large measure, by the United States of
America, and in no country of the world have the Bahá’í teachings
met with readier acceptance. The role assigned to America, of
summoning the nations to international peace, has as yet, however,
been only partially played, and Bahá’ís are awaiting with
interest the developments which the future has in store.<a data-fnid='2'></a></p>

<p id='14.44' data-ref='bne_en-p902'>
Both Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on many occasions
foretold with surprising accuracy the coming of the Great War of
1914–1918. At Sacramento, California, on October 26, 1912,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: — </p>

  <p id='14.45' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>“The European continent is like an
    arsenal, a storehouse of explosives ready for ignition, and one spark

<p id='14.46' data-ref='bne_en-p903'>
In many of His addresses in America and Europe He gave similar
warning. In another address in California in October 1912 He said: — </p>

  <p id='14.47' data-ref='bne_en-p904' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>We are on the eve of the Battle of Armageddon referred to in the
    sixteenth chapter of Revelation. The time is two years hence, when

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_909'>Social Troubles After the War</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='14.52' data-ref='bne_en-p909'>
Both Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also foretold a period
of great social upheaval, conflict and calamity as an inevitable
result of the irreligion and prejudices, the ignorance and
superstition, prevalent throughout the world. The great international
military conflict was but one phase of this upheaval. In a Tablet
dated January, 1920, He wrote: — </p>

  <p id='14.53' data-ref='bne_en-p910' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>O ye lovers of truth! O ye servants of mankind! As the sweet
    fragrance of your thoughts and high intentions has breathed upon me,
    I feel that my soul is irresistibly prompted to communicate with you.</q> </p>


  <p id='14.54' data-ref='bne_en-p911' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Ponder in your hearts how grievous is the turmoil in which the world
    is plunged; how the nations of the earth are besmeared with human
    blood, nay their very soil is turned into clotted gore. The flame of
    war has caused so wild a conflagration that the world in its early
    days, in its middle ages, or in modern times has never witnessed its
    like. The millstones of war have ground and crushed many a human
    head, nay, even more severe has been the lot of these victims.
    Flourishing countries have been made desolate, cities have been laid
    level with the ground, and smiling villages have been turned into
    ruin. Fathers have lost their sons, and sons turned fatherless.
    Mothers have shed tears of blood in mourning for their youths, little
    children have been made orphans, and women left wanderers and
    homeless. In a word, humanity, in all its phases, has been debased.
    Loud is the cry and wailing of orphans, and bitter the lamentations
    of mothers which are echoed by the skies.</q> </p>


  <p id='14.55' data-ref='bne_en-p912' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The prime cause for all these happenings is racial, national,
    religious, and political prejudice, and the root of all this
    prejudice lies in outworn and deepseated traditions, be they
    religious, racial, national, or political. So long as these
    traditions remain, the foundation of human edifice is insecure, and
    mankind itself is exposed to continuous peril.</q> </p>


  <p id='14.56' data-ref='bne_en-p913' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Now in this radiant age, when the essence of all beings has been made
    manifest, and the hidden secret of all created thing has been
    revealed, when the morning light of truth has broken and turned the
    darkness of the world into light, is it meet and seemly that such a
    frightful carnage which brings irretrievable ruin upon the world
    should be made possible? By God! that cannot be.</q> </p>


  <p id='14.57' data-ref='bne_en-p914' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Christ summoned all the people of the world to reconciliation and
    peace. He commanded Peter to return his sword unto its scabbard. Such
    was His wish and counsel, and yet they that bear His name have
    unsheathed the sword! How great the difference between their deeds
    and the explicit text of the Gospel!</q> </p>


  <p id='14.58' data-ref='bne_en-p915' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Sixty years ago Bahá’u’lláh, even as the shining sun, shone in
    the firmament of Persia, and proclaimed that the world is wrapt in
    darkness and this darkness is fraught with disastrous results, and
    will lead to fearful strife. In His prison city of ‘Akká, He
    apostrophized in unmistakable terms the Emperor of Germany, declaring
    that a terrible war shall take place, and Berlin will break forth in
    lamentation and wailing. In like manner, whilst the wronged prisoner
    of the Sulṭán of Turkey in the citadel of ‘Akká, He clearly and
    emphatically wrote him that Constantinople will fall a prey to grave
    disorder, in such wise that the women and children will raise their
    moaning cry. In brief, He addressed epistles to all the chief rulers
    and sovereigns of the world, and all that He foretold has been
    fulfilled. From His pen of glory flowed teachings for the prevention
    of war, and these have been scattered far and wide.</q> </p>


  <p id='14.59' data-ref='bne_en-p916' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>His first teaching is the search after truth. Blind imitation, He
    declared, killeth the spirit of man, whereas the investigation of
    truth frees the world from the darkness of prejudice.</q> </p>


  <p id='14.60' data-ref='bne_en-p917' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>His second teaching is the oneness of mankind. All men are but one
    fold, and God the loving Shepherd. He bestoweth upon them His most
    great mercy, and considers them all as one. “Thou shalt find no
    difference amongst the creatures of God.” They are all His
    servants, and all seek His bounty.</q> </p>


  <p id='14.61' data-ref='bne_en-p918' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>His third teaching is that religion is the most mighty stronghold. It
    should be conducive to unity, rather than be the cause of enmity and
    hate. Should it lead to enmity and hate better not have it at all.
    For religion is even as medicine, which if it should aggravate the
    disease, its abandonment would be preferred.</q> </p>


  <p id='14.62' data-ref='bne_en-p919' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Likewise, religious, racial, national, and political prejudice, all
    are subversive of the foundation of human society, all lead to
    bloodshed, all heap ruin upon mankind. So long as these remain, the
    dread of war will continue. The sole remedy is universal peace. And
    this is achieved only by the establishment of a supreme Tribunal,

  <p id='14.68' data-ref='bne_en-p925' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>Bahá’u’lláh frequently predicted that there would be a period
    when irreligion and consequent anarchy would prevail. The chaos will
    be due to too great liberty among people who are not ready for it,
    and in consequence there will have to be a temporary reversion to
    coercive government, in the interests of the people themselves and in
    order to prevent disorder and chaos. It is clear that each nation now
    wishes complete self-determination and freedom of action, but some of
    them are not ready for it. The prevailing state of the world is one
    of irreligion, which is bound to result in anarchy and confusion. I
    have always said that the peace proposals following the great war
    were only a glimmer of the dawn, and not the sunrise.</q> </p>

Amid these troublous times, however, the Cause of God will prosper.
The calamities caused by selfish struggle for individual existence,

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets make it clear that this prophecy refers

Mírzá Aḥmad Sohrab recorded in his diary the following prophecy
about ‘Akká and Haifa uttered by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá while seated by
the window of one of the Bahá’í Pilgrim Homes at Haifa on
February 14, 1914: — </p>

  <p id='14.83' data-ref='bne_en-p939' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The view from the Pilgrim Home is very attractive, especially as it
    faces the Blessed Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh. In the future the
    distance between ‘Akká and Haifa will be built up, and the two
    cities will join and clasp hands, becoming the two terminal section
    of one mighty metropolis. As I look now over this scene, I see so
    clearly that it will become one of the first emporiums of the world.
    This great semicircular bay will be transformed into the finest
    harbor, wherein the ships of all nations will seek shelter and
    refuge. The great vessels of all peoples will come to this port,
    bringing on their decks thousands and thousands of men and women from
    every part of the globe. The mountain and the plain will be dotted
    with the most modern buildings and palaces. Industries will be
    established and various institutions of philanthropic nature will be
    founded. The flowers of civilization and culture from all nations
    will be brought here to blend their fragrances together and blaze the
    way for the brotherhood of man. Wonderful gardens, orchards, groves
    and parks will be laid out on all sides. At night the great city will
    be lighted by electricity. The entire harbor from ‘Akká to Haifa
    will be one path of illumination. Powerful searchlights will be
    placed on both sides of Mount Carmel to guide the steamers. Mount
    Carmel itself, from top to bottom, will be submerged in a sea of
    lights. A person standing on the summit of Mount Carmel, and the
    passengers of the steamers coming to it, will look upon the most
    sublime and majestic spectacle of the whole world.</q> </p>

    uplifted towards the throne of the Almighty.</q> </p>

    patiently, step by step, through these various cities, according to
    His own definite and eternal plan, so that the prophecies and
    predictions as foretold by the Prophets might be fulfilled. This
    golden thread of promise concerning the Messianic Millennium runs
    through the Bible, and it was so destined that God in His own good
    time would cause its appearance. Not even a single word will be left
    meaningless and unfulfilled.</p>

<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_943'>Progress of the Cause</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='15.2' data-ref='bne_en-p943'>
Unfortunately it is impossible, within the space at our disposal, to
describe in detail the progress of the Bahá’í Faith throughout
the world. Many chapters might be devoted to this fascinating
subject, and many thrilling stories related about the pioneers and
martyrs of the Cause, but a very brief summary must suffice.</p>


<p id='15.3' data-ref='bne_en-p944'>
In Persia the early believers in this revelation met with the utmost
opposition, persecution and cruelty at the hands of their fellow
countrymen, but they faced all calamities and ordeals with sublime
heroism, firmness and patience. Their baptism was in their own blood,
for many thousands of them perished as martyrs; while thousands more
were beaten, imprisoned, stripped of their possessions, driven from
their homes or otherwise ill-treated. For sixty years or more anyone
in Persia who dared to own allegiance to the Báb or Bahá’u’lláh
did so at the risk of his property, his freedom and even his life.
Yet this determined and ferocious opposition could no more check the
progress of the Movement than a cloud of dust could keep the sun from
rising. </p>



<p id='15.4' data-ref='bne_en-p945'>
From one end of Persia<a data-fnid='1'></a> to the other
Bahá’ís are now to be found in almost every city and town, and
even amongst the nomad tribes. In some villages the whole population
is Bahá’í and in other places a large proportion of the
inhabitants are believers. Recruited from many and diverse sects,
which were bitterly hostile to each other, they now form a great
fellowship of friends who acknowledge brotherhood, not only with each
other, but with all men everywhere, who are working for the
unification and upliftment of humanity, for the removal of all
prejudices and conflict, and for the establishment of the Kingdom of
God in the world.</p>


<p id='15.5' data-ref='bne_en-p946'>
What miracle could be greater than this? Only one, and that the
accomplishment throughout the entire world of the task to which these
men have set themselves. And signs are not lacking that this greater
miracle, too, is in progress. The Faith is showing an astonishing
vitality, and is spreading, like leaven, through the lump of
humanity, transforming people and society as its spreads.<a data-fnid='2'></a></p>


<p id='15.6' data-ref='bne_en-p947'>
The relatively small number of Bahá’ís may still seem
insignificant in comparison with the followers of the ancient
religions, but they are confident that a divine Power has blessed
them with the high privilege of serving a new order into which will
throng the multitudes of East and West at no distant day. </p>



<p id='15.7' data-ref='bne_en-p948'>
While, therefore, it remains true that the Holy Spirit has reflected
from pure hearts in all countries still unconscious of the Source,
and the growth of the Faith can be witnessed in the many efforts
outside the Bahá’í community to promote one or another of
Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings, nevertheless the lack of any
enduring foundation in the old order is convincing proof that the
ideals of the Kingdom can only become fruitful within the framework
of the Bahá’í community.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_949'>Prophethood of Báb and Bahá’u’lláh</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='15.8' data-ref='bne_en-p949'>
The more we study the lives and teachings of the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh, the more impossible does it seem to find any
explanation of Their greatness, except that of Divine Inspiration.
They were reared in an atmosphere of fanaticism and bigotry. They had
only the most elementary education. They had no contact with Western
culture. They had no political or financial power to back Them. They
asked nothing from men, and receive little but injustice and
oppression. The great ones of earth ignored or opposed Them. They
were scourged and tortured, imprisoned and subjected to direst
calamities in the fulfillment of Their mission. They were alone
against the world, having no help but that of God, yet already Their
triumph is manifest and magnificent.</p>


<p id='15.9' data-ref='bne_en-p950'>
The grandeur and sublimity of Their ideals, the nobility and
self-sacrifice of Their lives; Their dauntless courage and
conviction, Their amazing wisdom and knowledge, Their grasp of the
needs of both Eastern and Western peoples, the comprehensiveness and
adequacy of Their teachings, Their power to inspire wholehearted
devotion and enthusiasm in Their followers, the penetration and
potency of Their influence, the progress of the Movement They
founded — surely these constitute proofs of Prophethood as convincing
as any which the history of religion can show.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_951'>A Glorious Prospect</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='15.10' data-ref='bne_en-p951'>
The Bahá’í glad tidings disclose a vision of the Bounty of God
and of the future progress of humanity, which is surely the greatest
and most glorious Revelation ever given to mankind, the development
and fulfillment of all previous Revelations. Its purpose is nothing
less than the regeneration of mankind and the creation of <q class='bible'>“new
heavens and a new earth.”</q> It is the same task to which Christ and
all the Prophets have devoted Their lives, and between these great
teachers there is no rivalry. It is not by this Manifestation or by
that, but by <i>all together</i>, that the task will be accomplished.</p>


<p id='15.11' data-ref='bne_en-p952' class='noid'>As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: — </p>

  <p id='15.12' data-ref='bne_en-p953' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>It is not necessary to lower Abraham to raise Jesus. It is not
    necessary to lower Jesus to proclaim Bahá’u’lláh. We must
    welcome the Truth of God wherever we behold it. The essence of the
    question is that all these great Messengers came to raise the Divine
    Standard of Perfections. All of them shine as orbs in the same heaven
    of the Divine Will. All of them give Light to the world.</q> </p>


<p id='15.13' data-ref='bne_en-p954'>
The task is God’s, and God calls not only the Prophets but all
mankind to be His co-workers in this creative process. If we refuse
His invitation, we shall not hinder the work from going on, for what
God wills shall surely come to pass. If we fail to play our part He
can raise up other instruments to perform His purpose; but we shall
miss the real aim and object of our own lives. At-one-ment with
God — becoming His lovers, His servants, the willing channels and
mediums of His Creative Power, so that we are conscious of no life
within us but His Divine and abundant life — that, according to the
Bahá’í teaching, is the ineffable and glorious consummation of
human existence.</p>


<p id='15.14' data-ref='bne_en-p955'>
Humanity, however, is sound at heart, for it is made <q class='bible'>“in the image
and likeness of God,”</q> and when at last it sees the truth, it will
not persist in the paths of folly. Bahá’u’lláh assures us that
erelong the call of God will be generally accepted, and mankind as a
whole will turn to righteousness and obedience. <q class='bible'>“All sorrow will
then be turned into joy, and all disease into health,”</q> and the
kingdoms of this world shall become <q class='bible'>“the kingdoms of our Lord, and
of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever”</q> <span class='ref'>(Rev. xi, 15)</span>.
Not only those on earth, but all in the heavens and on the earth,
shall become one in God and rejoice eternally in Him.</p>







<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_956'>Renewal of Religion</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='15.15' data-ref='bne_en-p956'>
The state of the world today surely affords ample evidence that, with
rare exceptions, people of all religions need to be reawakened to the
real meaning of their religion; and that reawakening is an important
part of the work of Bahá’u’lláh. He comes to make Christians
better Christians, to make Muslims real Muslims, to make all men true
to the spirit that inspired their Prophets. He also fulfills the
promise made by all these Prophets, of a more glorious Manifestation
which was to appear in the <q class='bible'>“Fullness of Time”</q> to crown and
consummate Their labors. He gives a fuller unfolding of spiritual
truths than His predecessors, and reveals the Will of God with regard
to all the problems of individual and social life that confront us in
the world today. He gives a universal teaching which affords a firm
foundation on which a new and better civilization can be built up, a
teaching adapted to the needs of the world in the new era which is
now commencing.</p>







<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_957'>Need for New Revelation</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='15.16' data-ref='bne_en-p957'>
The unification of the world of humanity, the welding together of the
world’s different religions, the reconciliation of Religion and
Science, the establishment of Universal Peace, of International
Arbitration of an International House of Justice, of an International
Language, the Emancipation of Women, Universal Education, the
abolition not only of Chattel Slavery, but of Industrial Slavery, the
Organization of Humanity as a single whole, with due regard to the
rights and liberties of each individual — these are problems of
gigantic magnitude and stupendous difficulty in relation to which
Christians, Muḥammadans and adherents of other religions have held
and still hold the most diverse and often violently opposed views,
but Bahá’u’lláh has revealed clearly defined principles, the
general adoption of which would obviously make the world a paradise.</p>








<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_958'>Truth Is for All</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='15.17' data-ref='bne_en-p958'>
Many are quite ready to admit that the Bahá’í teachings would be
a splendid thing for Persia and for the East, but imagine that for
the nations of the West they are unnecessary or unsuitable. To one
who mentioned such a view, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied: — </p>

  <p id='15.18' data-ref='bne_en-p959' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>As to the meaning of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh, whatever has to
    do with the universal good is divine, and whatever is divine is for
    the universal good. If it be true, it is for all; if not, it is for
    no one; therefore a divine cause of universal good cannot be limited
    to either the East or the West, for the radiance of the Sun of Truth
    illumines both the East and the West, and it makes its heat felt in
    the South and in the North — there is no difference between one Pole
    and another. At the time of the Manifestation of Christ, the Romans
    and Greeks thought His Cause was especially for the Jews. They
    thought they had a perfect civilization and nothing to learn from
    Christ’s teachings, and by this false supposition many were
    deprived of His Grace. Likewise know that the principles of
    Christianity and the Commandments of Bahá’u’lláh are identical
    and their paths are the same. Every day there is progress; there was
    a time when this divine institution (of progressive revelation) was
    in embryo, then newborn, then a child, then an intellectual youth;
    but today it is resplendent with beauty and shining with the greatest
    brilliancy.</q> </p>


  <p id='15.19' data-ref='bne_en-p960' class='blockquote'>
    Happy is he who penetrates the mystery and takes his place in the
    world of the illumined ones.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_961'>The Last Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='15.20' data-ref='bne_en-p961'>
With the passing of its beloved leader, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Bahá’í
Faith entered on a new phase of its history. This new phase
represents a higher state in the existence of the same spiritual
organism, a more mature and consequently a more responsible
expression of the faith felt by its members. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had
devoted His superhuman energy and unique capacity to the task of
spreading His love for Bahá’u’lláh throughout the East and
West. He had lighted the candle of faith in countless souls. He had
trained and guided them in the attributes of the personal spiritual
life. In view of the momentous importance of the Last Will and
Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the gravity of the issues it raises
and the profound wisdom underlying its provisions, we give a few
extracts which vividly portray the spirit and leading principles
which animated and guided ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and are transmitted as a
rich heritage to His faithful followers: — </p>

  <p id='15.21' data-ref='bne_en-p962' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>O ye beloved of the Lord! In this sacred Dispensation, conflict and
    contention are in no wise permitted. Every aggressor deprives himself
    of God’s grace. It is incumbent upon everyone to show the utmost
    love, rectitude of conduct, straight forwardness and sincere
    kindliness unto all the peoples and kindreds of the world, be they
    friends or strangers. So intense must be the spirit of love and
    loving kindness, that the stranger may find himself a friend, the
    enemy a true brother, no difference whatsoever existing between them.
    For universality is of God and all limitations earthly.… </q> </p>



    <p id='15.22' data-ref='bne_en-p963' class='blockquote'>
      <q class='abd'>Wherefore, O my loving friends! Consort with all the peoples,
      kindreds and religions of the world with the utmost truthfulness,
      uprightness, faithfulness, kindliness, good-will and friendliness,
      that all the world of being may be filled with the holy ecstasy of
      the grace of Bahá, that ignorance, enmity, hate and rancor may
      vanish from the world and the darkness of estrangement amidst the
      peoples and kindreds of the world may give way to the Light of Unity.
      Should other peoples and nations be unfaithful to you show your
      fidelity unto them, should they keep aloof from you attract them to
      yourself, should they show their enmity be friendly towards them,
      should they poison your lives, sweeten their souls, should they
      inflict a wound upon you, be a salve to their sores. Such are the
      attributes of the sincere! Such are the attributes of the truthful.</q> </p>


    <p id='15.23' data-ref='bne_en-p964' class='blockquote'>
      <q class='abd'>O ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon you to be submissive
      to all monarchs that are just and to show your fidelity to every
      righteous king. Serve ye the sovereigns of the world with utmost
      truthfulness and loyalty. Show obedience unto them and be their
      well-wishers. Without their leave and permission do not meddle with
      political affairs, for disloyalty to the just sovereign is disloyalty
      to God Himself.</q> </p>

      have lamented my troubles and my distress, and of the envious ones a
      number have shed tears because of my cares, my exile and my
      afflictions. They did this because they found naught in me but
      affection and care and witnessed naught but kindliness and mercy. As
      they saw me swept into the flood of tribulation and adversity and
      exposed even as a target to the arrows of fate, their hearts were
      moved with compassion — “The Lord is our witness; naught have we
      seen from him but faithfulness, generosity and extreme compassion.”
      The Covenant-breakers, foreboders of evil, however, waxed fiercer in
      their rancor, rejoiced as I fell a victim to the most grievous
      ordeal, bestirred themselves against me and made merry over the

With ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing, the time had come to establish
the administrative order which has been termed the pattern and
nucleus of the world order which it is the special mission of the
religion of Bahá’u’lláh to establish. The Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá consequently marks a turning point in Bahá’í
history, dividing the era of immaturity and irresponsibility from
that era in which the Bahá’ís themselves are destined to fulfill
their spirituality by enlarging its scope from the realm of personal
experience to that of social unity and cooperation. The three
principal elements in the administrative plan left by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
are: —
<br><br>
  1. “The Guardian of the Cause of God,” <br>
  2. “The Hands of the Cause of God,” and <br>
  3. “The Houses of Justice, Local, National and International.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá appointed His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, to
the responsible position of <q class='abd'>“Guardian of the Cause”</q>
(Valíyy-i-Amru’lláh). Shoghi Effendi is the eldest son of
Ḍíyá’íyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum, the eldest daughter of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. His father, Mírzá Hádí, is a relative of the
Báb (although not a direct descendant, as the Báb’s only child
died in infancy). Shoghi Effendi was twenty-five years of age, and
was studying at Balliol College, Oxford, at the time of his
grandfather’s passing. The announcement of his appointment is made
in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will as follows: — </p>

    the loved ones of the Abhá Beauty to turn unto Shoghi Effendi — the
    youthful branch branched from the two hallowed and sacred Lote-Trees
    and the fruit grown from the union of the two offshoots of the Tree
    of Holiness, — as he is the sign of God, the chosen branch, the
    Guardian of the Cause of God, he unto whom all the A<u>gh</u>ṣán,
    the Afnán, the Hands of the Cause of God and His loved ones must

    Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever

    things, must be the essence of purity, must show in himself the fear
    of God, knowledge, wisdom and learning. Thus, should the first-born
    of the Guardian of the Cause of God not manifest in himself the truth
    of the words, “The child is the secret essence of its sire,”
    that is, should he not inherit of the spiritual within him (the
    Guardian of the Cause of God) and his glorious lineage not be matched
    with a goodly character, then must he (the Guardian of the Cause of

During His own lifetime Bahá’u’lláh appointed a few tried and
trusted friends to assist in directing and promoting the work of the
Movement, and gave them the title of <i>Ayádíyi-Amru’lláh</i>

provision in His Will for the establishment of a permanent body of

<!-- =================================== -->
<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_982'>The Administrative Order</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='15.40' data-ref='bne_en-p982'>
It has been the general characteristic of religion that organization
marks the interruption of the true spiritual influence and serves to
prevent the original impulse from being carried into the world. The
organization has invariably become a substitute for religion rather
than a method or an instrument used to give the religion effect. The
separation of peoples into different traditions unbridged by any
peaceful or constructive intercourse has made this inevitable. Up to
the present time, in fact, no Founder of a revealed religion has
explicitly laid down the principles that should guide the
administrative machinery of the Faith He has established.</p>


<p id='15.41' data-ref='bne_en-p983'>
In the Bahá’í Cause, the principles of world administration were
expressed by Bahá’u’lláh, and these principles were developed
in the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, more especially in His <i>Will
and Testament</i>.</p>


<p id='15.42' data-ref='bne_en-p984'>
The purpose of this organization is to make possible a true and
lasting unity among peoples of different races, classes, interests,
characters, and inherited creeds. A close and sympathetic study of
this aspect of the Bahá’í Cause will show that the purpose and
method of Bahá’í administration is so perfectly adapted to the
fundamental spirit of the Revelation that it bears to it the same
relationship as body to soul. In character, the principles of Bahá’í
administration represent the science of cooperation; in application,
they provide for a new and higher type of morality worldwide in
scope.… </p>



<p id='15.43' data-ref='bne_en-p985'>
A Bahá’í community differs from other voluntary gatherings in
that its foundation is so deeply laid and broadly extended that it
can include any sincere soul. Whereas other associations are
exclusive, in effect if not in intention, and from method if not from
ideal, Bahá’í association is inclusive, shutting the gates of
fellowship to no sincere soul. In every gathering there is latent or
developed some basis of selection. In religion this basis is a creed
limited by the historical nature of its origin; in politics this is
party or platform; in economics this is a mutual misfortune or mutual
power; in the arts and sciences this basis consists of special
training or activity or interest. In all these matters, the more
exclusive the basis of selection, the stronger the movement — a
condition diametrically opposed to that existing in the Bahá’í
Cause. Hence the Cause, for all its spirit of growth and progress,
develops slowly as regards the numbers of its active adherents. For
people are accustomed to exclusiveness and division in all affairs.
The important sanctions have ever been warrants and justifications of
division. To enter the Bahá’í Movement is to leave these
sanctions behind — an experience which at first invariably exposes
one to new trials and sufferings, as the human ego revolts against
the supreme sanction of universal love. The scientific must associate
with the simple and unlearned, the rich with the poor, the white with
the colored, the mystic with the literalist, the Christian with the
Jew, the Muslim with the Parsee: and on terms removing the advantage
of long established presumptions and privileges.</p>


<p id='15.44' data-ref='bne_en-p986'>
But for this difficult experience there are glorious compensations.
Let us remember that art grows sterile as it turns away from the
common humanity, that philosophy likewise loses its vision when
developed in solitude, and that politics and religion never succeed
apart from the general needs of mankind. Human nature is not yet
known, for we have all lived in a state of mental, moral, emotional
or social defense, and the psychology of defense is the psychology of
inhibition. But the love of God removes fear; the removal of fear
establishes the latent power, and association with others in
spiritual love brings these powers into vital, positive expression. A
Bahá’í community is a gathering where this process can take place
in this age, slowly at first, as the new impetus gathers force, more
rapidly as the members become conscious of the powers unfolding the
flower of unity among men.… </p>



<p id='15.45' data-ref='bne_en-p987'>
The responsibility for and supervision of local Bahá’í affairs is
vested in a body known as the Spiritual Assembly. This body (limited
to nine members) is elected annually on April 21st, the first day of
Riḍván (the Festival commemorating the Declaration of Bahá’u’lláh)
by the adult declared believers of the community, the voting list
being drawn up by the outgoing Spiritual Assembly. Concerning the
character and functions of this body, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written
as follows: — </p>

  <p id='15.46' data-ref='bne_en-p988' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>It is incumbent upon every one [every believer] not to take any step
    [of Bahá’í activity] without consulting the Spiritual Assembly,
    and they must assuredly obey with heart and soul its bidding and be
    submissive unto it, that things may be properly ordered and well
    arranged. Otherwise every person will act independently and after his
    own judgment, will follow his own desire, and do harm to the Cause.</q> </p>


  <p id='15.47' data-ref='bne_en-p989' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity
    of motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God,
    attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst
    His loved ones, patience and long-suffering in difficulties and
    servitude to His exalted Threshold. Should they be graciously aided
    to acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of Bahá
    shall be vouchsafed to them. In this day, assemblies of consultation
    are of the greatest importance and a vital necessity. Obedience unto
    them is essential and obligatory. The members thereof must take
    counsel together in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or
    discord may arise. This can be attained when every member expresseth
    with absolute freedom his own opinion and must on no account feel
    hurt for not until matters are fully discussed can the right way be
    revealed. The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the
    clash of differing opinions. If after discussion, a decision be
    carried unanimously well and good; but if, the Lord forbid,
    differences of opinion should arise, a majority of voices must
    prevail.… </q> </p>



  <p id='15.48' data-ref='bne_en-p990' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The first condition is absolute love and harmony amongst the members
    of the assembly. They must be wholly free from estrangement and must
    manifest in themselves the Unity of God, for they are the waves of
    one sea, the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of
    one sun, the trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden. Should
    harmony of thought and absolute unity be nonexistent, that gathering
    shall be dispersed and that assembly be brought to naught.</q></p>


  <p id='15.49' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='abd'>The second
    condition: They must when coming together turn their faces to the
    Kingdom on High and ask aid from the Realm of Glory.… Discussions
    must all be confined to spiritual matters that pertain to the
    training of souls, the instruction of children, the relief of the
    poor, the help of the feeble throughout all classes in the world,
    kindness to all peoples, the diffusion of the fragrances of God and
    the exaltation of His Holy Word. Should they endeavor to fulfill
    these conditions the Grace of the Holy Spirit shall be vouchsafed
    unto them, and that assembly shall become the center of the Divine
    blessings, the hosts of Divine confirmation shall come to their aid,
    and they shall day by day receive a new effusion of Spirit.</q>

<p id='15.50' data-ref='bne_en-p991' class='noid'>Expounding this subject, Shoghi Effendi writes: — </p>

  <p id='15.51' data-ref='bne_en-p992' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>… nothing whatever should be given to the public by any individual
    among the friends, unless fully considered and approved by the
    Spiritual Assembly in his locality; and if this (as is undoubtedly
    the case) is a matter that pertains to the general interest of the
    Cause in that land, then it is incumbent upon the Spiritual Assembly
    to submit it to the consideration and approval of the national body
    representing all the various local assemblies. Not only with regard
    to publication, but all matters without any exception whatsoever,
    regarding the interests of the Cause in that locality, individually
    or collectively, should be referred exclusively to the Spiritual
    Assembly in that locality, which shall decide upon it, unless it be a
    matter of national interest, in which case it shall be referred to
    the national [Bahá’í] body. With this national body also will
    rest the decision whether a given question is of local or national
    interest. (By national affairs is not meant matters that are
    political in their character, for the friends of God the world over
    are strictly forbidden to meddle with political affairs in any way
    whatsoever, but rather things that affect the spiritual activities of
    the body of the friends in that land.)</q> </p>


  <p id='15.52' data-ref='bne_en-p993' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>Full harmony, however, as well as cooperation among the various local
    assemblies and the members themselves, and particularly between each
    assembly and the national body, is of the utmost importance, for upon
    it depends the unity of the Cause of God, the solidarity of the
    friends, the full, speedy and efficient working of the spiritual
    activities of His loved ones.… </q> </p>


  <p id='15.53' data-ref='bne_en-p994' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>The various Assemblies, local and national, constitute today the
    bedrock upon the strength of which the Universal House [of Justice]
    is in future to be firmly established and raised. Not until these
    function vigorously and harmoniously can the hope for the termination
    of this period of transition be realized.…</q> </p>


  <p id='15.54' data-ref='bne_en-p995' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>… bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God is not
    dictatorial authority but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but
    the spirit of frank and loving consultation. Nothing short of the
    spirit of a true Bahá’í can hope to reconcile the principles of
    mercy and justice, of freedom and submission, of the sanctity of the
    right of the individual and of self-surrender, of vigilance,
    discretion and prudence on the one hand, and fellowship, candor and
    courage on the other.</q> </p>


  <p id='15.55' data-ref='bne_en-p996' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>The local Spiritual Assemblies of a country are linked together and
    coordinating through another elected body of nine members, the
    National Spiritual Assembly. This body comes into being by means of
    an annual election held by elected delegates representing the local
    Bahá’í communities.… The National Convention in which the
    delegates are gathered together is composed of an elective body based
    upon the principle of proportional representation.… These National
    Conventions are preferably held during the period of Riḍván, the
    twelve days beginning April 21st which commemorate the Declaration
    made by Bahá’u’lláh in the Garden of Riḍván near Ba<u>gh</u>dád.
    The recognition of delegates is vested in the outgoing National
    Spiritual Assembly.</q> </p>


  <p id='15.56' data-ref='bne_en-p997' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>A National Convention is an occasion for deepening one’s
    understanding of Bahá’í activities and of sharing reports of
    national and local activities for the period of the elapsed year.…
    The function of a Bahá’í delegate is limited to the duration of
    the National Convention and participation in the election of the new
    National Spiritual Assembly. While gathered together, the delegates
    are a consultative and advisory body whose recommendations are to be
    carefully considered by the members of the elected National Spiritual
    Assembly.… </q> </p>



<p id='15.57' data-ref='bne_en-p998'>
The relation of the National Spiritual Assembly to the local
Spiritual Assemblies and to the body of the believers in the country
is thus defined in the letters of the Guardian of the Cause:</p>


  <p id='15.58' data-ref='bne_en-p999' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>Regarding the establishment of “National Assemblies,” it is of
  vital importance that in every country, where the conditions are
  favorable and the number of the friends has grown and reached a
  considerable size … that a “National Spiritual Assembly” be
  immediately established, representative of the friends throughout
  that country.</q> </p>


  <p id='15.59' data-ref='bne_en-p1000' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>Its immediate purpose is to stimulate, unify and coordinate by
  frequent personal consultations, the manifold activities of the
  friends as well as the local Assemblies; and by keeping in close and
  constant touch with the Holy Land, initiate measures, and direct in
  general the affairs of the Cause in that country.</q> </p>


  <p id='15.60' data-ref='bne_en-p1001' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>It serves also another purpose, no less essential than the first, as
  in the course of time it shall evolve into the National House of
  Justice (referred to in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will as the “secondary
  House of Justice”), which according to the explicit text of the
  Testament will have, in conjunction with the other National
  Assemblies throughout the Bahá’í world, to elect directly the
  members of the International House of Justice, that Supreme Council
  that will guide, organize and unify the affairs of the Movement
  throughout the world.… </q>
   <span class='block reference'> - Shoghi Effendi, <i>Bahá’í Administration</i> pg. 73</span></p>



<p id='15.61' data-ref='bne_en-p1002'>
This National Spiritual Assembly, which, pending the establishment of
the Universal House of Justice, will have to be re-elected once a
year, obviously assumes grave responsibilities, for it has to
exercise full authority over all the local Assemblies in its
province, and will have to direct the activities of the friends,
guard vigilantly the Cause of God, and control and supervise the
affairs of the Movement in general.</p>


<p id='15.62' data-ref='bne_en-p1003'>
Vital issues, affecting the interests of the Cause in that country
such as the matter of translation and publication, the
Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, the Teaching Work, and other
similar matters that stand distinct from strictly local affairs, must
be under the full jurisdiction of the National Assembly.</p>


<p id='15.63' data-ref='bne_en-p1004'>
It will have to refer each of these questions, even as the local
Assemblies, to a special Committee, to be elected by the members of
the National Spiritual Assembly, from among all the friends in that
country, which will bear to it the same relation as the local
committees bear to their respective local Assemblies.</p>


<p id='15.64' data-ref='bne_en-p1005'>
With it, too, rests the decision whether a certain point at issue is
strictly local in its nature, and should be reserved for the
consideration and decision of the local Assembly, or whether it
should fall under its own province and be regarded as a matter which
ought to receive its special attention.… </p>



<p id='15.65' data-ref='bne_en-p1006'>
… it is bounden duty, in the interest of the Cause we all love and
serve, of the members of the incoming National Assembly, once elected
by the delegates at Convention time, to seek and have the utmost
regard, individually as well as collectively, for the advice, the
considered opinion and the true sentiments of the assembled
delegates. Banishing every vestige of secrecy, of undue reticence, of
dictatorial aloofness, from their midst, they should radiantly and
abundantly unfold to the eyes of the delegates, by whom they are
elected, their plans, their hopes, and their cares. They should
familiarize the delegates with the various matters that will have to
be considered in the current year, and calmly and conscientiously
study and weigh the opinions and judgments of the delegates. The
newly elected National Assembly, during the few days when the
Convention is in session and after the dispersal of the delegates,
should seek ways and means to cultivate understanding, facilitate and
maintain the exchange of views, deepen confidence, and vindicate by
every tangible evidence their one desire to serve and advance the
common weal.… </p>



<p id='15.66' data-ref='bne_en-p1007'>
The National Spiritual Assembly, however, in view of the unavoidable
limitations imposed upon the convening of frequent and long-standing
sessions of the Convention, will have to retain in its hands the
final decision on all matters that affect the interests of the Cause
… such as the right to decide whether any local Assembly is
functioning in accordance with the principles laid down for the
conduct and the advancement of the Cause.… </p>



<p id='15.67' data-ref='bne_en-p1008'>
Concerning the matter of drawing up the voting list to be used at the
annual local Bahá’í elections, the responsibility for this is
placed upon each local Spiritual Assembly, and as a guidance in the
matter the Guardian has written the following:</p>


<p id='15.68' data-ref='bne_en-p1009'>
… to state very briefly and as adequately as present circumstances
permit the principal factors that must be taken into consideration
before deciding whether a person may be regarded as a true believer
or not. Full recognition of the station of the Forerunner, the
Author, and the True Exemplar of the Bahá’í Cause, as set forth
in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Testament; unreserved acceptance of, and
submission to, whatsoever has been revealed by their Pen; loyal and
steadfast adherence to every clause of our Beloved’s sacred Will;
and close association with the spirit as well as the form of the
present day Bahá’í administration throughout the world — these I
conceive to be the fundamental and primary considerations that must
be fairly, discreetly and thoughtfully ascertained before reaching
such a vital decision.</p>

And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath ordained as
the source of all good and freed from all error, it must be elected

manifestations of the fear of God and daysprings of knowledge and
understanding, must be steadfast in God’s faith and the
well-wishers of all mankind. By this House is meant the Universal
House of Justice, that is, in all countries a secondary House of
Justice must be instituted, and these secondary Houses of Justice
must elect the members of the Universal one.<a data-fnid='6'></a>
Unto this body all things must be referred. It enacted all ordinances
and regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy Text.
By this body all the difficult problems are to be resolved and the
Guardian of the Cause of God is its sacred head and the distinguished
member for life of that body. Should he not attend in person its
deliberations, he must appoint one to represent him.… This House of
Justice enacteth the laws and the government enforceth them. The
legislative body must reinforce the executive, the executive must aid
and assist the legislative body so that through the close union and
harmony of these two forces, the foundation of fairness and justice
may become firm and strong, that all the regions of the world may
become even as Paradise itself.… </p>

Even at the present time, the Bahá’ís in all parts of the world
maintain an intimate and cordial association by means of regular

proof that the burden of prejudice and the historical factors of
division can be entirely overcome through the spirit of oneness
established by Bahá’u’lláh.</p>

<h3 class='subhead toc2' id='subhead_1014'>The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh</h3>
<!-- =================================== -->





<p id='15.73' data-ref='bne_en-p1014'>
The larger implications of this order are explained by Shoghi Effendi
in successive communications addressed to the Bahá’í community
since February, 1929: — </p>

  <p id='15.74' data-ref='bne_en-p1015' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>I cannot refrain from appealing to them who stand identified with the
  Faith to disregard the prevailing notions and the fleeting fashions
  of the day, and to realize as never before that the exploded theories
  and the tottering institutions of present-day civilization must needs
  appear in sharp contrast with those God-given institutions which are
  destined to arise upon their ruin.… </q> </p>



  <p id='15.75' data-ref='bne_en-p1016' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>For Bahá’u’lláh … has not only imbued mankind with a new and
  regenerating Spirit. He has not merely enunciated certain universal
  principles, or propounded a particular philosophy, however potent,
  sound and universal these may be. In addition to these He, as well as
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá after Him, has, unlike the Dispensations of the
  past, clearly and specifically laid down a set of Laws, established
  definite institutions, and provided for the essentials of a Divine
  Economy. These are destined to be a pattern for future society, a
  supreme instrument for the establishment of the Most Great Peace, and
  the one agency for the unification of the world, and the proclamation
  of the reign of righteousness and justice upon the earth.… </q> </p>



  <p id='15.76' data-ref='bne_en-p1017' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>Unlike the Dispensation of Christ, unlike the Dispensation of
  Muḥammad, unlike all the Dispensations of the past, the apostles of
  Bahá’u’lláh in every land, wherever they labor and toil, have
  before them in clear, in unequivocal and emphatic language, all the
  laws, the regulations, the principles, the institutions, the
  guidance, they require for the prosecution and consummation of their
  task.… Therein lies the distinguishing feature of the Bahá’í
  Revelation. Therein lies the strength of the unity of the Faith, of
  the validity of a Revelation that claims not to destroy or belittle
  previous Revelations, but to connect, unify, and fulfill them.… </q> </p>



  <p id='15.77' data-ref='bne_en-p1017.5' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>Feeble though our Faith may now appear in the eyes of men, who either
  denounce it as an offshoot of Islam, or contemptuously ignore it as
  one more of those obscure sects that abound in the West, this
  priceless gem of Divine Revelation, now still in its embryonic state,
  shall evolve within the shell of His law, and shall forge ahead,
  undivided and unimpaired, till it embraces the whole of mankind. Only
  those who have already recognized the supreme station of Bahá’u’lláh,
  only those whose hearts have been touched by His love, and have
  become familiar with the potency of His spirit, can adequately
  appreciate the value of this Divine Economy — His inestimable gift to
  mankind.</q>

  in its features —  that a harassed humanity must strive.…  </p>


  <p id='15.79' data-ref='bne_en-p1020' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>How pathetic indeed are the efforts of those leaders of human
  institutions who, in utter disregard of the spirit of the age, are
  striving to adjust national processes, suited to the ancient days of
  self-contained nations, to an age which must either achieve the unity
  of the world, as adumbrated by Bahá’u’lláh, or perish. At so
  critical an hour in the history of civilization it behooves the
  leaders of all the nations of the world, great and small, whether in
  the East or in the West, whether victors or vanquished, to give heed
  to the clarion call of Bahá’u’lláh and, thoroughly imbued with
  a sense of world solidarity, the <i>sine quâ</i> non of loyalty to
  His Cause, arise manfully to carry out in its entirety the one
  remedial scheme He, the Divine Physician, has prescribed for an
  ailing humanity. Let them discard, one for all, every preconceived
  idea, every national prejudice, and give heed to the sublime counsel
  of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the authorized Expounder of His teachings. You
  can best serve your country, was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s rejoinder<a data-fnid='7'></a>
  to a high official in the service of the federal government of the
  United States of America, who had questioned Him as to the best
  manner in which he could promote the interests of his government and
  people, if you strive, in your capacity as a citizen of the world, to
  assist in the eventual application of the principles of federalism
  underlying the government of your own country to the relationships
  now existing between the peoples and nations of the world.… </q> </p>



  <p id='15.80' data-ref='bne_en-p1021' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>Some form of a world Super-State must needs be evolved, in whose
  favor all the nations of the world will have willingly ceded every
  claim to make war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights
  to maintain armaments, except for purposes of maintaining internal
  order within their respective dominions. Such a state will have to
  include within its orbit an International Executive adequate to
  enforce supreme and unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant
  member of the commonwealth; a World Parliament whose members shall be
  elected by the people in their respective countries and whose
  election shall be confirmed by their respective governments; and a
  Supreme Tribunal whose judgment will have a binding effect even in
  such cases where the parties concerned did not voluntarily agree to
  submit their case to its consideration. A world community in which
  all economic barriers will have been permanently demolished and the
  interdependence of Capital and Labor definitely recognized; in which
  the clamor of religious fanaticism and strife will have been forever
  stilled; in which the flame of racial animosity will have been
  finally extinguished; in which a single code of international law — the
  product of the considered judgment of the world’s federated
  representatives — shall have as its sanction the instant and coercive
  intervention of the combined forces of the federated units; and
  finally a world community in which the fury of a capricious and
  militant nationalism will have been transmuted into an abiding
  consciousness of world citizenship — such indeed, appears, in its
  broadest outline, the Order anticipated by Bahá’u’lláh, an
  Order that shall come to be regarded as the fairest fruit of a slowly
  maturing age.… </q> </p>



  <p id='15.81' data-ref='bne_en-p1022' class='blockquote'>
    <q class='shoghi'>Let there be no misgivings as to the animating purpose of the
  world-wide Law of Bahá’u’lláh. Far from aiming at the
  subversion of the existing foundations of society, it seeks to
  broaden its basis, to remold its institutions in a manner consonant
  with the needs of an ever-changing world. It can conflict with no
  legitimate allegiances, nor can it undermine essential loyalties. Its
  purpose is neither to stifle the flame of a sane and intelligent
  patriotism in men’s hearts, nor to abolish the system of national
  autonomy so essential if the evils of excessive centralization are to
  be avoided. It does not ignore, nor does it attempt to suppress, the
  diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of language
  and tradition, of thought and habit, that differentiate the peoples
  and nations of the world. It calls for a wider loyalty, for a larger
  aspiration than any that has animated the human race.… </q> </p>

  Prophets of old were allowed to advance. Its message is applicable
  not only to the individual, but concerns itself primarily with the

  monarchical or republican; no intermediary scheme of a purely
  aristocratic order; nor even any of the recognized types of
  theocracy, whether it be the Hebrew Commonwealth, or the various
  Christian ecclesiastical organizations, or the Imamate or the

    <q class='shoghi'>Let no one, while this System is still in its infancy, misconceive

  The bedrock on which this Administrative Order is founded is God’s
  immutable Purpose for mankind in this day. The Source from which it
  derives its inspiration is no one less than Bahá’u’lláh
  Himself.… The central, the underlying aim which animates it is the
  establishment of the New World Order as adumbrated by Bahá’u’lláh.
  The methods it employs, the standard it inculcates, incline it to
  neither East nor West, neither Jew nor Gentile, neither rich nor

  as a further stage in a chain of progressive Revelations, nor even as
  the culmination of one of a series of recurrent prophetic cycles, but
  rather as marking the last and highest stage in the stupendous
  evolution of man’s collective life on this planet. The emergence of
  a world community, the consciousness of world citizenship, the
  founding of a world civilization and culture … should … be

  furthermost limits in the organization of human society, though man,

  personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them
  are definitely and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as
  far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose
  members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately
  control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will
  enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy
  the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. A
  world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the
  decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world
  legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the whole
  commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its
  compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise
  between the various elements constituting this universal system. A
  mechanism of world intercommunication will be devised, embracing the
  whole planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and
  functioning with marvelous swiftness and perfect regularity. A world
  metropolis will act as the nerve center of a world civilization, the
  focus towards which the unifying forces of life will converge and
  from which its energizing influences will radiate. A world language
  will either be invented or chosen from among the existing languages
  and will be taught in the schools of all the federated nations as an
  auxiliary to their mother tongue. A world script, a world literature,
  a uniform and universal system of currency, of weights and measures,
  will simplify and facilitate intercourse and understanding among the
  nations and races of mankind. In such a world society, science and
  religion, the two most potent forces in human life, will be
  reconciled, will cooperate, and will harmoniously develop. The press
  will, under such a system, while giving full scope to the expression
  of the diversified views and convictions of mankind, cease to be
  mischievously manipulated by vested interests, whether private or
  public, and will be liberated from the influence of contending
  governments and peoples. The economic resources of the world will be
  organized, its sources of raw materials will be tapped and fully

    <q class='shoghi'>National rivalries, hatred, and intrigues will cease, and racial
  animosity and prejudice will be replaced by racial amity,

  permanently removed, economic barriers and restrictions will be
  completely abolished, and the inordinate distinction between classes
  will be obliterated. Destitution on the one hand, and gross
  accumulation of ownership on the other, will disappear. The enormous
  energy dissipated and wasted on war, whether economic or political,
  will be consecrated to such ends as will extend the range of human
  inventions and technical development, to the increase of the
  productivity of mankind, to the extermination of disease, to the
  extension of scientific research, to the raising of the standard of
  physical health, to the sharpening and refinement of the human brain,

<p id='ep.1' data-ref='bne_en-p1043'>
Under the inspired guidance of Shoghi Effendi the Bahá’í Cause
grew steadily in size and in the establishment of its Administrative
Order, so that by 1951 there were eleven functioning National
Spiritual Assemblies. At that point the Guardian turned to the
development of the institutions of the Faith at its international
level, appointing the International Bahá’í Council, the
forerunner of the Universal House of Justice, and, shortly
thereafter, the first contingent of the Hands of the Cause of God.
Hitherto Shoghi Effendi has raised certain eminent Bahá’ís to the
rank of Hands of the Cause posthumously, one of them being Dr. John
E. Esslemont, but it was only in 1951 that he adjudged the time ripe
to begin the full development of this important institution. In rapid
succession between 1951 and 1957 he appointed thirty-two Hands and
extended the range of their activities, instituting in each continent
Auxiliary Boards consisting of believers and appointed by the Hands
to be their deputies, assistants and advisors. Twenty-seven of these
Hands were living at the time of his passing.</p>


<p id='ep.2' data-ref='bne_en-p1044'>
Through a series of letters, some addressed to Bahá’ís throughout
the world, and others to those in specific countries, the Guardian
deepened their understanding of the teachings, built up the
administrative institutions of the Faith, trained the believers in
their correct and effective use, and in 1937 launched the American
Bahá’í Community on its implementation of the Divine Plan for the
diffusion of Bahá’u’lláh’s Message. This Divine Plan had been
revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a number of Tablets written during
the years of the First World War and constitutes the charter for the
propagation of the Faith.</p>


<p id='ep.3' data-ref='bne_en-p1045'>
Within the framework of this charter a number of teaching plans were
carried out, first in the Western Hemisphere, then also in Europe,
Asia, Australasia and Africa until in 1953 the Guardian called for a
“decade-long, world-embracing, spiritual crusade” to carry the
Faith to all the remaining independent states and principal
dependencies of the world.</p>


<p id='ep.4' data-ref='bne_en-p1046'>
In 1957, as the midway point of the crusade approached, the Guardian,
exhausted by thirty-six years of unremitting labor, died while on a
visit to London.</p>


<p id='ep.5' data-ref='bne_en-p1047'>
As Shoghi Effendi had no heir, the work of the Faith after November
1957 was coordinated and directed by the twenty-seven Hands of the
Cause until the victorious completion of the crusade in April 1963,
at which time the first Universal House of Justice was elected by the
members of fifty-six National Spiritual Assemblies convened at the
Bahá’í World Center in Haifa by the Hands of the Cause.</p>


<p id='ep.6' data-ref='bne_en-p1048'>
Immediately following this historic election, Bahá’ís from all
parts of the globe gathered in London at the first World Congress of
the Faith to celebrate the Centenary of the Declaration of
Bahá’u’lláh and to rejoice in the worldwide spread of His
Faith.</p>


<p id='ep.7' data-ref='bne_en-p1049'>
The supreme institution of the Faith today is the Universal House of
Justice, created by Bahá’u’lláh in His <i>Most Holy Book</i>,
invested with authority to legislate on all matters not covered in
the Bahá’í Writings, and assured divine guidance in the Sacred
Text itself. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in His Will and testament, lays down
the method of election of the Universal House of Justice, defines its
station and duties more clearly, and asserts that it is under the
direct guidance of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh and is the body to
which all must turn.</p>


<p id='ep.8' data-ref='bne_en-p1050'>
The unique and distinguishing feature of the Bahá’í Faith is the
Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, the bedrock upon which the Faith
raises all its structures and bases its development. Its uniqueness
is that for the first time in religious history the Manifestation of
God, in clear and unambiguous language, provides for the authorized
interpretation of His Word, and ensures the continuity of the
divinely appointed authority which flows from the Source of the
Faith.</p>


<p id='ep.9' data-ref='bne_en-p1051'>
Interpretation of Scripture has always in earlier religions been a
most fertile source of schism. Bahá’u’lláh, in the Book of His
Covenant, vested in His eldest son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, full powers
for the interpretation of His Writings and for the direction of His
Cause. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in His Will and Testament, appointed His
eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Faith and sole
interpreter of the Writings. There is no priesthood within the Faith
and no individual may claim special station or guidance; authority is
vested in institutions created within the Bahá’í Scriptures.</p>


<p id='ep.10' data-ref='bne_en-p1052'>
By virtue of these unique provisions, the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
has been preserved from schism, from the depredations of unauthorized
leadership, and above all from the infiltration of man-made doctrines
and theories, which in the past have shattered the unity of
religions. Pure and inviolate, the revealed Word of Bahá’u’lláh,
with its authorized interpretation, remains throughout the
Dispensation the uncorrupted and incorruptible source of spiritual

In 1968 the Universal House of Justice took action to provide for the
future carrying out of the specific functions of protection and
propagation vested in the Hands of the Cause, by the establishment of
Continental Boards of Counselors. Each Board consists of a number of
Counselors appointed by the Universal House of Justice, and they work
in close collaboration with the Hands of the Cause of God. The
appointment and direction of Auxiliary Boards is now the duty of the
Boards of Counselors, and the activities of the Hands, of whom just
one is still living, have been extended to be worldwide. In June 1973
the Universal House of Justice established in the Holy Land an
International Teaching Centre and assigned it the activities of the
Continental Board of Counselors and as liaison between them and the
Universal House of Justice.</p>


<p id='ep.12' data-ref='bne_en-p1054'>
The Guardian had written of future global teaching plans to be
carried out under the direction of the Universal House of Justice,
and the first of these, a Nine Year Plan, was launched in 1964. This
was followed by a Five Year Plan (1974–1979), a Seven Year Plan
(1979–1986), a Six Year Plan (1986–1992), a Three Year Plan
(1993–1996), a Four Year Plan (1996–2000), a Twelve Month Plan
(2000–2001), and a Five Year Plan, which will terminate at Riḍván
2006. By early 2006, the Bahá’í Faith had been established in 191
independent states and 45 dependent territories or overseas
departments; There were Bahá’ís living in over 100,000 localities
throughout the world; Bahá’í literature had been translated into
at least 802 languages; an eighth Bahá’í Temple had completed in
India in 1986, and plans for construction of a ninth Temple in
Santiago, Chile, were under way; there were 179 National or Regional
Spiritual Assemblies and at least five million Bahá’ís. Bahá’ís
are now energetically pursuing a Five Year Plan designed to further
expand and consolidate the growth of the Faith throughout the world.</p>


<p id='ep.13' data-ref='bne_en-p1055'>
Most encouraging of all has been the response of the peoples of
Africa, India, Southeast Asia and Latin America, where large numbers
have begun to enter the Cause, bringing about a new stage in the
development of the administrative and social activities of the
worldwide Bahá’í community.</p>

One of the two great factions — <u>Sh</u>í‘ih and Sunní — into

<p><a name="footnote-bne_en-chapter2-4"></a>
On this point a historian remarks: “The belief of many people in
the East, especially the believers in the Báb (now Bahá’ís) was
this: that the Báb received no education, but that the Mullás, in
order to lower Him in the eyes of the people, declared that such
knowledge and wisdom as He possessed were accounted for by the
education He had received. After deep search into the truth of this
matter we have found evidence to show that in childhood for a short
time He used to go to the house of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muḥammad
(also known as ‘Ábid) where He was taught to read and write in
Persian. It was this to which the Báb referred when He wrote in the
book of Bayán: ‘O Muḥammad, O my teacher! … ’<br/>
<br/>
“The
remarkable thing is this, however, that this <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>,
who was His teacher, became a devoted disciple of his own pupil, and
the uncle of the Báb who was like a father to him, whose name was
Ḥájí Siyyid ‘Alí, also became a devout believer and was
martyred as a Bábí.<br/>
<br/>
“The understanding of these
mysteries is given to seekers after truth, but we know this, that
such education as the Báb received was but elementary, and that
whatever signs of unusual greatness and knowledge appeared in Him
were innate and from God.”<a href="">

The Imám of the <u>Sh</u>í‘ihs is the divinely ordained successor
of the Prophet whom all the faithful must obey. Eleven persons
successively held the office of Imám, the first being ‘Alí, the
cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet. The majority of the <u>Sh</u>í‘ihs
hold that the twelfth Imám, called by them the Imám Mihdí,
disappeared as a child into an underground passage in 329 A.H., and
that in the fullness of time he will come forth, overthrow the
infidels and inaugurate an era of blessedness.<a href="">

Lord Curzon, in his book, <i>Persia and the Persian Question</i>,
published in 1892, the year of Bahá’u’lláh’s death,
writes: — <br/>
<br/>
“The lowest estimate places the present
number of Babis in Persia at half a million. I am disposed to think,
from conversations with persons well qualified to judge, that the
total is nearer one million. They are to be found in every walk of
life, from the ministers and nobles of the Court to the scavenger or
the groom, not the least arena of their activity being the Mussulman
priesthood itself.… <br/>
<br/>
“If Babism continues to grow at
its present rate of progression, a time may conceivably come when it
will oust Mohammedanism from the field in Persia. This, I think, it
would be unlikely to do, did it appear upon the ground under the flag
of a hostile faith. But since its recruits are won from the best
soldiers of the garrison whom it is attacking, there is greater
reason to believe that it may ultimately prevail.” (Vol. i, pp.
449–503).<a href=""> ↩</a></p>


<p><a name="footnote-bne_en-chapter15-2"></a>
By 2006, five million is considered to be an acceptable, albeit
conservative, estimate of the number of believers in the worldwide
