 <p id='1'> O Zayn! Upon thee be My glory and My loving-kindness. <span data-pg='489'></span> Nothing that existeth in the world of being hath ever been or ever will be worthy of mention. However, if a person be graciously favoured to offer a penny-worth — nay even less — in the path of God, this would in His sight be preferable and superior to all the treasures of the earth. It is for this reason that the one true God — exalted be His glory — hath in all his heavenly Scriptures praised those who observe His precepts and bestow their wealth for His sake. Beseech ye God that He may enable everyone to discharge the obligation of Ḥuqúq, inasmuch as the progress and promotion of the cause of God depend on material means. If His faithful servants could realize how meritorious are benevolent deeds in these days, they would all arise to do that which is meet and seemly. In His hand is the source of authority and He ordaineth as He willeth. He is the Supreme Ruler, the Bountiful, the Equitable the Revealer, the All-Wise. </p>

Ere long will they perceive the truth of that which the Tongue of Grandeur hath uttered aforetime and will utter hereafter. And such benefits will indeed accrue if the Ḥuqúq is offered with the utmost joy and radiance and in the spirit of perfect humility and lowliness. </p>

Touching on this particular subject We have bidden thus: Ye may relinquish the whole world but must not allow the detraction of even one jot or tittle from the dignity of the Cause of God. Jináb-i-Amín — upon him be My glory — must also refrain from mentioning this matter, for it is entirely dependent upon the willingness of the individuals themselves. They are well acquainted with the commandment of God and are familiar with that which was revealed in the Book. Let him who wisheth observe it, and let him who wisheth ignore it. Verily, thy Lord is the Self-Sufficing, the All-Praised. Indeed, independence of all things is a door of guidance unto His faithful servants. Well is it with them that have severed themselves from the world and have arisen to serve His Cause. Verily, they are numbered with the people of Bahá at the court of His resplendent Beauty. </p>

As to other possessions in silver or otherwise, it is payable when they equal this in value, not in number. The Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable only once; for example if a person acquireth a thousand mi<u>th</u>qáls in gold and payeth the Ḥuqúq thereof, the Right of God ceaseth to be applicable to that amount, except in regard to what accrueth to it through commerce and transactions; when such profits reach the prescribed minimum, one must carry out what God hath decreed.

If the property is not equal to the debts, the estate must be distributed in direct proportion to each debt. The settlement of debts is a most important command set forth in the Book. Well is it with him who ascendeth unto God, without any obligations to Ḥuqúqu’lláh and to His servants. It is evident that the Ḥuqúqu’lláh hath priority over all other liabilities; however, as a token of mercy, He Who is <span data-pg='496'></span> the Dawning-Place of Revelation hath commanded that which hath been revealed by His life-giving and omniscient Pen in this Tablet. </p>

 <p id='25'> This is the Book of Generosity which hath been revealed by the King of Eternity. Whoso adorneth himself with this virtue hath distinguished himself and will be blessed by the All-Merciful from His exalted Kingdom of Glory. However, despite his high rank and prominent position, were he to pass beyond the limits, he would be regarded among the prodigal by the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Cling ye unto moderation. This is the commandment that He Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High hath enjoined upon you in His Generous Book. O ye that are the exponents of generosity and the manifestations thereof! Be generous unto them whom ye find in manifest poverty. O ye that are possessed of riches! Take heed lest outward appearance deter you from benevolent deeds in the path of God, the Lord of all mankind. </p>

 <p id='25.2'> Say: I swear by God! No one is despised in the sight of the Almighty for being poor. Rather is he exalted, if he is found to be of them who are patient. Blessed are the poor that are steadfast in patience, and woe betide the rich that hold back Ḥuqúqu’lláh and fail to observe that which is enjoined upon them in His Preserved Tablet. Say: Pride not yourselves on earthly riches ye possess. Reflect upon your end and upon the recompense of your works that hath been ordained in the Book of God, the Exalted, the Mighty. Blessed is the rich man whom earthly possessions have been powerless to hinder from turning unto God, the Lord of all names. Verily he is accounted among the most distinguished of men before God, the Gracious, the All-Knowing. </p>

 <p id='25.3'> Say: The appointed Day is come. This is the Springtime of benevolent deeds, were ye of them that comprehend. Strive ye with all your might, O <span data-pg='497'></span> people, that ye may bring forth that which will truly profit you in the worlds of your Lord, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised. </p>

 <p id='25.4'> Say: Hold ye fast unto praiseworthy characteristics and goodly deeds and be not of them that tarry. It behoveth everyone to cleave tenaciously unto that which is conducive to the exaltation of the Cause of God, your Lord, the Mighty, the Powerful. </p>

 <p id='25.5'> Say: Behold ye not the world, its changes and chances, and its varying colours? Wherefore are ye satisfied with it and with all the things therein? Open your eyes and be of them that are endued with insight. The day is fast approaching when all these things will have vanished as fast as the lightning, nay even faster. Unto this beareth witness the Lord of the Kingdom in this wondrous Tablet. </p>

 <p id='25.6'> Wert thou to be enraptured by the uplifting ecstasy of the verses of God, thou wouldst yield thanks unto thy Lord and say: <q class=''>“Praise be unto Thee, O Desire of the hearts of them that hasten to meet Thee!”</q> Rejoice then with exceeding gladness, inasmuch as the Pen of Glory hath turned unto thee and hath revealed in thy honour that which the tongues of creation and the tongues of transcendence are powerless to describe. </p>

However in recent years We have, in view of the exigencies of the times, accepted the payment of the Ḥuqúq, but have forbidden solicitation thereof. Everyone must have the utmost regard for the dignity of the Word of God and for the exaltation of His Cause. Were a person to offer all the treasures of the earth at the cost of debasing the honour of the Cause of God, were it even less than a grain of mustard, such an offering would not be permissible. All the world hath <span data-pg='498'></span> belonged and will always belong to God. If one spontaneously offereth Ḥuqúq with the utmost joy and radiance it will be acceptable, and not otherwise. The benefit of such deeds reverteth unto the individuals themselves. This measure hath been ordained in view of the necessity for material means, for <q class=''>“averse is God from putting aught into effect through its means.”</q> Thus instructions were given to receive the Ḥuqúq. </p>

 <p id='46'> To discharge one’s obligations is highly praiseworthy in the sight of God. However, it is not permitted to solicit Ḥuqúq from anyone. Beseech ye the one true God to enable His loved ones to offer that which is the Right of God, inasmuch as the observance of this injunction would cause one’s possessions to be purified and protected and would become the means of attracting goodly gifts and <span data-pg='505'></span> heavenly blessings. </p>

 <p id='47'> O Samandar! How many are the souls who with the utmost endeavour and effort, collect a handful of worldly goods and greatly rejoice in this act and yet in reality the Pen of the Most High hath decreed this wealth for others; that is, it is not meant to be their lot or it may even fall into the hands of their enemies! We seek shelter in God from such an evident loss. One’s life is wasted; by day and by night, troubles are endured, and wealth becometh a source of affliction. Most of the wealth of men is not pure. Should they follow what is revealed by God, they would, in all circumstances, be protected under His bounty and blessed by His mercy. </p>

 <p id='48'> There can be no doubt that whatsoever hath been revealed from the All-Glorious Pen, be it ordinances of prohibitions, conferreth benefits upon the believers themselves. For example, among the commandments is that of the Ḥuqúqu’lláh. If the people attain the privileges of paying the Ḥuqúq, the one true God, exalted by His glory, will of a certainty confer blessing upon them. Moreover, such payment will enable them and their offspring to benefit from their possessions. As thou dost observe, large portions of people’s wealth are lost to them as God causeth strangers, or heirs in comparison with whom strangers would have been preferable, to lay hands on their possessions. </p>

 <p id='48.2'> God’s consummate wisdom is far beyond any description or fitting mention. Verily, people see with their own eyes and yet deny; they are aware, yet they pretend not to know. Had they observed the ordinance of God they would have attained the good of this world and the next. </p>

 <p id='53'> As to what thou hast written concerning the Right of God: The binding injunction of God is set forth in the Book, but this matter is conditional upon the willingness of the individual themselves; inasmuch as the one true God — magnified be His glory — hath, by reason of His all-encompassing mercy, acquainted everyone with that which is enjoined in the Book. Well is it with them that act accordingly. </p>

 <p id='53.2'> Demanding the Ḥuqúq hath never been regarded with favour. Every deed must be performed in a spirit of joy and radiance.

 <p id='53.4'> It hath been enjoined that whatsoever the loved ones of God may offer as gifts for His holy court, should be treated as the donor wisheth, lest the <span data-pg='507'></span> hearts of the faithful and the souls of the true believers be obscured by the dust of despondency and sorrow. But in the case of gifts that are offered as Ḥuqúq it is permissible to have them sold.... </p>

Whoso is willing to tender payments for Ḥuqúq with the utmost joy, radiance and good-pleasure, his offering may be accepted; otherwise God is the Self-Sufficient, the All-Praised. </p>

 <p id='53.6'> Consider that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’án — exalted in His Word: <q class=''>“Some of them injure themselves through evil deeds, others follow a middle course, and others vie with each other in charitable works”</q>.<a data-fnid='8'></a> Indeed any benefits arising from praiseworthy deeds shall fall to the individuals that have performed them.

<!-- ========================================== -->
<section class='content selection no-pad' data-oid='1159' id='comp-61' data-sectionnum='61' data-author='abd' data-sourcetext='true'>
  <div class='section_header toc2 no-pad' id='comp-61_'>
  <h3 class='sectionnum smaller'> — 61 — </h3> 
   </div>

 <p id='61'> As preordained by the Fountainhead of Creation, the temple of the world hath been fashioned after the image and likeness of the human body. In fact each mirroreth forth the image of the other, wert thou but to observe with discerning eyes. By this is meant that even as the human <span data-pg='509'></span> body is this world which is outwardly composed of different limbs and organs, is in reality a closely integrated, coherent entity, similarly the structure of the physical world is like unto a single being whose limbs and members are inseparably linked together. </p>

 <p id='61.2'> Were one to observe with an eye that discovereth the realities of all things, it would become clear that the greatest relationship that bindeth the world of being together lieth in the range of created things themselves, and that co-operation, mutual aid and reciprocity are essential characteristics in the unified body of the world of being, inasmuch as all created things are closely related together and each is influenced by the other or deriveth benefit therefrom, either directly or indirectly. </p>

 <p id='61.3'> Consider for instance how one group of created things constituteth the vegetable kingdom, and another the animal kingdom. Each of these two maketh use of certain elements in the air on which its own life dependeth, while each increaseth the quantity of such elements as are essential for the life of the other. In other words, the growth and development of the vegetable world is impossible without the existence of the animal kingdom, and the maintenance of animal life is inconceivable without the co-operation of the vegetable kingdom. Of like kind are the relationships that exist among all created things. Hence it was stated that co-operation and reciprocity are essential properties which are inherent in the unified system of the world of existence, and without which the entire creation would be reduced to nothingness. </p>

 <p id='61.4'> In surveying the vast range of creation thou shalt perceive that the higher a kingdom of created things is on the arc of ascent, the more conspicuous are the signs and evidences of the truth that co-operation and reciprocity at the level of a higher order are greater than those that exist at the level of a lower order. For example the evident signs of this fundamental reality are more discernible in the vegetable kingdom than in the mineral, and still more manifest in the animal world than in the vegetable. </p>

 <p id='61.5'> And thus when contemplating the human world thou beholdest this wondrous phenomenon shining resplendent from all sides with the utmost perfection, inasmuch as in this station acts of co-operation, mutual assistance and reciprocity are not confined to the body and to things that pertain to the material world, but for all conditions, whether physical or <span data-pg='510'></span> spiritual, such as those related to minds, thoughts, opinions, manners, customs, attitudes, understandings, feelings or other human susceptibilities. In all these thou shouldst find these binding relationships securely established. The more this inter-relationship is strengthened and expanded, the more will human society advance in progress and prosperity. Indeed without these vital ties it would be wholly impossible for the world of humanity to attain true felicity and success. </p>

 <p id='61.6'> Now consider, if among the people who are merely the manifestations of the world of being this significant matter is of such importance, how much greater must be the spirit of co-operation and mutual assistance among those who are the essences of the world of creation, who have sought the sheltering shadow of the heavenly Tree, and are favoured by the manifestations of divine grace; and how the evidences of this spirit should, through their earnest endeavour, their fellowship and concord, become manifest in every sphere of their inner and outer lives, in the realm of the spirit and divine mysteries and in all things related to this world and the next. Thus there can be no doubt that they must be willing even to offer up their lives for each other. </p>

 <p id='61.7'> This is the basic principle on which the institution of Ḥuqúqu’lláh is established, inasmuch as its proceeds are dedicated to the furtherance of these ends. Otherwise the one true God hath ever been and will always be independent of all else beside Him. Even as He hath enabled all created things to partake of His boundless grace and loving-kindness, likewise is He able to bestow riches upon His loved ones out of the treasuries of His power. However, the wisdom of this command is that the act of giving is well-pleasing in the sight of God. Consider how well-pleasing must this mighty act be in His estimation that He hath ascribed it unto His Own Self. Rejoice ye then, O people of generosity! </p>

 <p id='61.8'> We earnestly hope that in this Most Great Cycle the wondrous attributes of the All-Merciful may, through the infinite bounty and blessings of the King of Glory, find expression in the lives of the servants of God in such wise that the sweet savours thereof will shed fragrance upon all regions. </p>

 <p id='61.9'> This matter needeth further details, but We have treated it in brief. </p>

  <div class='section_header toc2 no-pad' id='comp-78_'>
  <h3 class='sectionnum smaller'> — 78 — </h3> 
   </div>

 <p id='78'> Question: As to the matter of Ḥuqúq, does it mean 1/19th of one’s net income or one’s gross income? For example, in America, there is a tax on the gross income, after certain exemptions are made. How is the Ḥuqúq to be worked out? </p>

 <p id='78.2'> Answer: The substance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s explanation was: After one has paid all his necessary expenses 19% of what is left is then taken by him and given as Ḥuqúq. For example, if a person has 100 piastres left after all his expenses have been paid, then 19 piastres are taken as Ḥuqúq for the Cause of God. This is done at the end of the year after he has ascertained what his expenses are. For every hundred piastres, 19 are taken for Ḥuqúq. </p>

 <p id='78.3'> He pays this once, then there is no more Ḥuqúq to be paid on that sum. It is finished. Next year he will pay on the amount he has left over in his possession after his expenses have been deducted, and after the amount he paid Ḥuqúq on the previous year is also deducted. </p>

 <p id='78.4'> For example, at the end of the first year a man who has 1000 piastres left after all his expenses are paid, then 190 piastres are taken as Ḥuqúq: at the end of the next year after all expenses are determined, he may have 2000 piastres left. As he has already paid Ḥuqúq on 1000 piastres the previous year this sum is deducted from the 2000 and he pays Ḥuqúq on 1000 piastres (or 190 piastres). The third year the net amount of what he owns may be 2500 piastres, he deducts 2000 piastres from this amount and pays 19 per cent on 500 piastres or 95 piastres. If at the end of the 4th year he has 2500 Piastres, no <span data-pg='515'></span> Ḥuqúq is taken. </p>

 <p id='78.5'> Question: In the deduction of our necessary expenses, are contributions to the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, teaching and other activities of the Cause considered a part of Ḥuqúq or should they be taken separately? </p>

 <p id='78.6'> Answer: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied that Ḥuqúq was separate and independent of these and came first. After that had been determined then the other affairs could be looked after. He smiled and said when Ḥuqúq is given ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will ascertain how much of it is for the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, how much for teaching and how much for the needy, etc. </p>

 <p id='96'> Since the Ḥuqúqu’lláh has, according to the injunction in the Book, been designated as one of the institutions of the Cause, and inasmuch as the fulfilment of this obligation is binding on the people of Bahá, therefore it is deemed appropriate that your Spiritual Assembly should fully familiarize the dear friends in Persia with the significance of this momentous responsibility and to promulgate gradually in the entire community such ordinances related to Ḥuqúqu’lláh as are laid down in His perspicuous Book. Obviously in pursuance of the explicit Texts solicitation of the Ḥuqúqu’lláh is not permissible, but it is the responsibility of those Trustees of the Cause to address appeals of a general character to the dear friends, so that they may become more informed about this essential obligation.

Thus they must first settle their obligations concerning Ḥuqúqu’lláh, then they may make other contributions at their own <span data-pg='520'></span> discretion, inasmuch as the disposition of the funds of the Ḥuqúqu’lláh is subject to decision by the Authority in the Cause to which ail must turn, whereas the purposes of contributions to other Funds may be determined by the donors themselves. </p>

Through issuing announcements, distributing leaflets and in gatherings, schools and conferences held by the followers of our Zealous Lord, they should be guided and encouraged to observe strictly and conscientiously that which His divine commandment has enjoined upon them, so that those believers who are adorned with the fear of God may be shielded from the dire consequences foreshadowed in His ominous warnings, may become the recipients of His assured blessings and be enabled to partake of the outpourings of His infallible spiritual grace. </p>

  <div class='section_header toc2 no-pad' id='comp-100_'>
  <h3 class='sectionnum smaller'> — 100 — </h3> 
   </div>

 <p id='100'> Some of the dear friends who observe their Ḥuqúqu’lláh obligations have written asking about the relationship that exists between contribution to the Funds and the payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh. That is, if a person who intends to meet his Ḥuqúqu’lláh obligations offers contributions to other Funds and projects instead, would be exempted from the payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh or not? </p>

 <p id='100.2'> The Holy Texts relevant to this matter are clear but, since this question has been repeatedly asked by the friends, it was decided to elucidate it for their information. </p>

 <p id='100.3'> Payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh is a spiritual obligation binding on the people of Bahá. The injunction is laid down in the Most Holy Book, and clear and conclusive explanations are embodied <span data-pg='521'></span> in various Tablets. </p>

 <p id='100.4'> Every devoted believer who is able to meet the specified conditions, must pay the Ḥuqúqu’lláh, without any exception. Indeed according to the explicit Text of the Most Holy Book, failure to comply with this injunction is regarded as a betrayal of trust, and the divine call: <q class=''>“Whoso dealeth dishonestly with God will in justice be exposed,”</q> is a clear reference to such people. </p>

 <p id='100.5'> The Centre of the Covenant has affirmed the obligation of Ḥuqúq in these words: <q class=''>“The Lord as a sign of His infinite bounties hath graciously favoured His servants by providing for a fixed money offering [Ḥuqúq], to be dutifully presented unto Him though He, the True One and His servants have been at all times independent of all created things.”</q> </p>

 <p id='100.6'> This weighty ordinance, as testified by the Pen of Glory is invested with incalculable benefit and wisdom. It purifies one’s possessions, averts loss and disaster, conduces to prosperity and honour and imparts divine increase and blessing. It is a sacrifice offered for and related to God, and an act of servitude leading to the promotion of His Cause. As affirmed by the Centre of the Covenant, Ḥuqúq offerings constitute a test for the believers and enable the friends to become firm and steadfast in faith and certitude. </p>

 <p id='100.7'> In brief, payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh is one of the binding spiritual responsibilities of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh and the proceeds thereof revert to the Authority in the Cause to whom all must turn. Moreover, the Ancient Beauty — magnified be His praise — has affirmed that after the establishment of the Universal House of Justice necessary rulings would be enacted in this connection in conformity with that which God has purposed, and that no one, except the Authority to which all must turn, has the right to dispose of this Fund. In other words, whatever portion of one’s wealth is due to the Ḥuqúqu’lláh belongs to the World Centre of the Cause of God, not to the individuals concerned. </p>

 <p id='100.8'> Thus the friends should not follow their own volition and judgement in using any of the funds set aside for Ḥuqúqu’lláh for any other purpose, even for charitable contributions of the Faith. </p>

 <p id='100.9'> We earnestly hope that everyone may be privileged to observe this sacred and blessed obligation which would ensure the attainment of true happiness and would serve to promote the execution of Bahá’í enterprises <span data-pg='522'></span> throughout the world. </p>

 <p id='100.10'> Verily God is Self-Sufficient above the need of His creatures. </p>

 <p id='101'> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in one of His Tablets has stated: <q class=''>“Disposition of the Ḥuqúq, wholly or partly, is permissible, but this should be done by permission of the authority in the Cause to whom all must turn.”</q> The provision in His Will and Testament that the Ḥuqúqu’lláh <q class=''>“is to be offered through the guardian of the Cause of God...”</q> is clearly in accord with this principle. In another Tablet ‘Abdu’l-Bahá referred to the Universal House of Justice as <q class=''>“the authority to whom all must turn”</q> and it is clear that in the absence of the Guardian it is the supreme and central institution of the Cause. Moreover, before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá’u’lláh had revealed the following: <q class=''>“There is a prescribed ruling for the Ḥuqúqu’lláh. After the House of Justice hath come into being the law thereof will be made manifest, in conformity with the Will of God.”</q> In accordance with these explicit texts it is clearly within the jurisdiction of the Universal House of Justice to decide about the receipt and disbursement of Ḥuqúqu’lláh at the present time. </p>

 <p id='103'> We are deeply touched by your loving letter of 27 December, 1972 expressing the wish to follow the law of Ḥuqúqu’lláh with respect to your inheritance from your mother. </p>

 <p id='103.2'> Although, as you correctly state, this Law is not at present applicable to the friends in the West, any believer is free to observe it if he wishes. </p>

 <p id='103.3'> This Law of the Aqdas stipulates that nineteen per cent of one’s capital is payable as Ḥuqúqu’lláh when such capital has reached an amount of at least <q class=''>“nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls in gold”</q> .... In determining the amount a believer should pay, he should first deduct any debts and expenses he <span data-pg='523'></span> may have, and pay nineteen per cent of the remainder of his capital if it is equal to at least nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold. </p>

 <p id='103.4'> If you decide that you wish to observe this Law of the Aqdas at the present time, you should determine the total value of your inheritance in cash and other assets less any expenses or debts you may have, and consider the circumstances under which you may be able to pay Ḥuqúqu’lláh on the net value of your inheritance. The time and conditions of payment are left to each individual. </p>

 <p id='103.5'> For example, if one’s assets include property or shares in addition to cash, he may find it disadvantageous or inconvenient to pay nineteen per cent of the value of the non-cash assets until they are disposed of, at which time he would prefer to fulfil this spiritual obligation. Any expenses that may be involved in disposing of one’s assets should be deducted before calculating the net value on which Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable. </p>

 <p id='104.2'> The same principle applies to those friends who spend lavishly on their families, who purchase or build residences and furnish them far in excess of their needs, and rationalize these expenditures in their desire to avoid payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh. Likewise those friends who marry non-Persians and reside in Europe or other countries should not be pressed, but informed and left to decide for themselves. </p>

 <p id='105'> ...many details in the computation of Ḥuqúqu’lláh have been left by Bahá’u’lláh to the judgement and conscience of the individual believer. For example, He exempts such household equipment and furnishings as are needful, but He leaves it to the individual to decide which items are necessary and which are not. Contributions to the funds of the Faith cannot be considered as part of one’s payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh; <span data-pg='524'></span> moreover, if one owes Ḥuqúqu’lláh and cannot afford to both to pay it and to make contributions to the Fund, the payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh should take priority over making contributions. But as to whether contributions to the Fund may be treated as expenses in calculating the amount of one’s assets on which Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable; this is left to the judgement of each individual in the light of his own circumstances. </p>

 <p id='105.2'> The Guardian’s secretary wrote on his behalf that <q class=''>“one mi<u>th</u>qál consists of nineteen nakhuds. The weight of twenty-four nakhuds equals four and three-fifths grammes. Calculations may be made on this basis”</q>. Nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls therefore equal 69.191667 grammes. One troy ounce equals 31.103486 grammes, thus 19 mi<u>th</u>qáls equal 2.224563 oz. At the current rate of $339.10 per ounce, 19 mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold would amount to $754.35. </p>

 <p id='105.3'> Thus on a savings of $754.35 an amount of $143.33 (i.e. 19%) would be payable as Ḥuqúqu’lláh. </p>

 <p id='109.2'> In answering this question one should remember that the Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable on possessions that are indisputably recognized as being one’s own and not on property that one merely controls or uses.

 <p id='110'> The Universal House of Justice has received your letter of 10 September, 1982 enquiring about the responsibility of a Bahá’í couple to pay Ḥuqúqu’lláh where one partner is American and the other Persian, and we have been instructed to provide you with the following clarification. </p>

<p id='110.2' class='blockquote'> 1. Your letter refers to basing the calculation of Ḥuqúqu’lláh on one’s income. As you will realize from a study of the texts, however, the computation is made on the net value of one’s possessions after deducting a number of exempt items such as residence and necessary furnishings, and on subsequent annual increases to this net property arising from surplus income after the payment of necessary expenses. It is, moreover, calculated on <span data-pg='526'></span> units of property equal in value to 19 mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold (2.22456 troy ounces). </p>

<p id='110.3' class='blockquote'> 2. No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the share of a couple’s property on which Ḥuqúqu’lláh should be paid where one partner is a westerner and the other a Persian. This depends upon the way the husband and wife themselves regard the ownership of the family’s property. Thus it is basically a matter for consultation between husband and wife and, as stated previously, Bahá’u’lláh has left many of the details of computation of Ḥuqúqu’lláh to the judgement of the individual believers. </p>
