The initial steps should be relentlessly followed by additional measures designed to hasten the incorporation of your Assembly, to accelerate the multiplication of Local Assemblies, groups and isolated centres, throughout the Provinces of the Dominion, to insure the stability of the outpost of the Faith which must be established in Newfoundland, and to incorporate a steadily growing element, representative of both the Indian and Eskimo races, into the life of the community. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='398'> Obstacles, however formidable, will have to be determinedly surmounted. Any reverses that sooner or later may be suffered should be met with stoic fortitude, and speedily offset by victories in other fields. The glorious vision now unveiled to your eyes must never be dimmed. The illuminating promises enshrined in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets should not be forgotten for a 

     <pb n='110'>moment. The quality of the success already achieved by so small a number, over so extensive a field, in so brief a period, at so precarious an hour in the destinies of mankind, should spur on the elected representatives of this now fully fledged community to achieve in as short a period, over still more extensive an area, and despite a severer crisis than any as yet encountered, victories more abiding in their merit and more conspicuous in their brilliance than any as yet won in the service and for the glory of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. </pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='526'> A community which, in the course of less than fifty years, has to its credit such an imperishable record of international service, and standing now on the threshold of a new epoch in its evolution, recognized as a self-governing member of the family of Bahá’í national communities, functioning according to a Plan of its own conceived for its orderly and efficient development, must, if it is to maintain the standard of excellence it has already attained, display on a still wider front, and continue to demonstrate, a no less profound spirit of dedication, as it forges ahead, in the years to come, along the road laid down for it by the Centre of the Covenant Himself in His historic Tablets. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='527'> As co-partner with the American Bahá’í community in the execution of the Divine Plan, it must evince in both the administrative and pioneer fields, a heroism that may be truly worthy of its high calling. In the remote and inhospitable regions of the North, amidst the Eskimos of Greenland and the Indians of the Dominion of Canada; throughout the Provinces of a far flung territory where newly fledged Assemblies, and nuclei of future Bahá’í institutions in the form of groups and isolated centres, lie scattered; in its relationships and negotiations with the local, provincial and national representatives of civil authority in issues affecting matters of personal status and the independence of the Faith and the establishment of its endowments; in its contact with the masses and in its effort to publicize the Faith, enhance its prestige and disseminate its literature, this community, so young, so vibrant with life, so laden with blessings, so rich in promise, must rise to such heights and achieve such fame as shall eclipse the radiance of its past administrative and pioneer achievements. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='528'> Then and only then will this community acquire the spiritual potentialities that will enable it to discharge, as befits a co-heir of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, the tremendous responsibilities, 

     <pb n='143'>and fulfil the functions, devolving upon it beyond the oceans, and in all the continents of the globe. </pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='529'> May this community, the leaven placed by the hands of Providence in the midst of a people belonging to a nation, likewise young, dynamic, richly endowed with material resources, and assured of a great material prosperity by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, play its part not only in lending a notable impetus to the world-wide propagation of the Faith it has espoused, but contribute, as its resources multiply and as it gains in stature, to the spiritualization and material progress of the nation of which it forms so vital a part. </p>

     <pb n='145'>30 October 1951</pb> </p>

<p id='542'> To the National Spiritual Assembly </p>

<p id='543'> Dear Bahá’í Friends: </p>

<p id='544'> <a name='fr1'></a><a href='#fn1' class='Sfootnumber'>1</a> for the Arctic made the Guardian very happy; this, as well as the sailing of Mr. Bischoff <a data-fnid='36'></a> for Greenland, marks the opening stage of the campaign to carry the Faith to the Eskimos, a plan set forth by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and very dear to His heart. </p>
    <aside data-fnid='36'>Palle Bischoff-Danish believer, the first pioneer to Greenland (1951–54).</aside>

<p class='Stext2' id='545'> <a name='fr3'></a><a href='#fn3' class='Sfootnumber'>3</a> He Himself Who nourished and watched over it with such loving care from the earliest days of its inception, Who, in unmistakable language and on more than one occasion, foreshadowed its glorious future, both materially and spiritually, is from His station on high, gazing down upon the youthful efforts exerted by a community so dear to His heart, so newly launched upon a course which He Himself has charted. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='546'> This final phase of the first Plan, undertaken by a newly fledged, repeatedly blessed community, as it speeds to a close, must witness an upsurge of spirit, of courage and determination, a display of activity, a demonstration of self-sacrifice and of solidarity such as to eclipse its brightest achievements in the past. The highly meritorious tasks initiated in both Greenland and Newfoundland need not be enlarged at the present hour, but should, under no circumstances, be allowed to suffer any setback. The work started among the Eskimos and Indians should be maintained at its present level, and should not be permitted to decline. An extraordinary concentration of effort, systematic, determined and sustained, is however required throughout all the nine provinces of the Dominion, aiming at an unprecedented flow of contributions by the entire body of the believers, each according to his or her means, into the National Treasury; a marked increase in the number of pioneers; a much greater dispersion; a higher degree of austerity; a still nobler display of consecration-all of which must result in a speedy multiplication of Assemblies and groups, which constitutes the core of the Plan, and on which hinges its fortunes. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='547'> The fleeting months ahead will be truly decisive. Upon the success of the present Plan must depend, not only the joint tribute to be paid by the Canadian Bahá’í Community to the memory of the Founder of the Faith on the occasion of the centenary of the Birth of His Revelation, but also the rapid unfoldment of subsequent stages of the Mission which the Tablets 

     <pb n='149'>of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá so clearly and emphatically entitle it to fulfil. </pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='548'> The opportunity given to this Community is precious, unutterably precious. The fate of this first historic Plan now hangs in the balance. The present chance, if lost, cannot be retrieved. The issues on which hinge the successful prosecution of the Plan are so weighty that none can assess them at present. The needs of a sorely-stricken society, groping in its distress for God’s redemptive Message, are growing more acute with every passing hour. The Canadian Bahá’í Community, newly emerged as an independent member of the Bahá’í World Community, so richly blessed through its elevation to the rank of a chosen prosecutor of a Divine Plan, unique, in many respects, among its sister communities in both Hemispheres in the manifold blessings bestowed upon it, can neither afford to flinch for a moment or hesitate in the discharge of its sacred duty. Every effort exerted by this community, during these fate-laden months, every sacrifice willingly endured by its members, will, if they but persevere, be richly blessed by Him Who brought it into being, who nursed it through His love, Who conferred upon it so distinguished a Mission, Who made such magnificent promises regarding its future, and Who will continue to sustain it though His unfailing, His abounding grace and favour. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='549'> May this Community, ever aware of the position it occupies, and of the bright prospects unfolding before it, brace itself for one, last, supreme effort, and ensure, while there is yet time, the complete and total success of the enterprise to which it stands committed. </p>

We are all familiar with the tremendous sums that have gone into the upkeep of Green Acre over the years, without so far bringing returns commensurate with the investment of our limited Bahá’í monies.

To this institution you will soon be adding the Maxwell Home <a data-fnid='47'></a> in Montreal, which should be viewed in the nature of a national Shrine, because of its association with the beloved Master, during His visit to Montreal.

<p id='663'> <a name='fr5'></a><a href='#fn5' class='Sfootnumber'>5</a> and, gradually, where the Cause is strong enough, in other Provinces. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='664'> <a name='fr6'></a><a href='#fn6' class='Sfootnumber'>6</a> of the Dominion of Canada and the settlement of pioneers in the thirteen virgin territories and islands, eleven of which are situated in North America and two in the South Pacific Ocean, may be regarded as the most important. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='665'> Prompt and effective measures must, no matter how great the sacrifice involved, be taken to ensure that, ere the termination of the first two years of the Plan, these two paramount objectives, which constitute the opening phase of the Plan, will have been fully attained. The entire Community must arise, as it has never risen before, to meet the challenge of the present hour. The time fixed for the achievement of the initial victories of the Plan is admittedly brief. The prizes to be won in distant fields, under the most trying circumstances, by the members of a community so youthful, so circumscribed in number and resources, are so precious that none of them can as yet even dimly imagine their transcendent glory. On the homefront, as well as in the far-off islands of the Pacific Ocean, in both the teaching and administrative fields, the Canadian Bahá’í Community must labour incessantly in anticipation of the fulfilment of the inspiring prophecies made by the Centre of the Covenant Who, repeatedly and in unmistakable language, promised to this Community a glorious future, and predicted both the material and spiritual advancement of the nation of which it forms a part. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='666'> On the success of this initial stage in the unfoldment of its Mission in foreign fields-a stage which will witness the departure of the Canadian pioneers from their homeland, in the northern regions of the Western Hemisphere, to the South Sea Islands-must depend the degree to which they will be active in days to come in other continents of the globe and their neighbouring islands. As the chosen allies of the chief executors of the Master’s Divine Plan, they shoulder a responsibility which is at once staggering, sacred and inescapable. The greater their exertions, the more abundant will be the outpouring of celestial grace vouchsafed to them by the Author of the Plan Himself, Who in His immortal Tablets has more than once assured 

     <pb n='184'>of His unfailing aid all who arise to serve His Father’s Cause. </pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='667'> Now is the hour to demonstrate to the entire Bahá’í world those qualities which the heroes of God, unfurling in the Western Hemisphere the banners of a World Crusade destined to be carried over the entire surface of the globe, must possess in order to accomplish their exalted Mission. The Canadian Bahá’í Community must stand in the vanguard of this conquering army of Bahá’u’lláh. They must prove themselves increasingly worthy of their high calling as this momentous Crusade steadily unfolds. They must put their entire trust in Him Who guides its destinies from His station on high. They must dedicate themselves heart and soul to the fulfilment of all its objectives without delay, without any exception. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='668'> That they may acquit themselves of their task, as befits their high station in this great spiritual adventure, that they may enrich their heritage, and noise abroad the fame of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh through a whole-hearted and valiant participation in this world-girdling spiritual Crusade, is the object of my constant prayer and one of my most cherished hopes. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='786'> [From the Guardian:] </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='787'> Dear and valued co-workers: </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='788'> The Canadian Bahá’í Community, having recently entered the second phase of the World Spiritual Crusade so auspiciously launched by the followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, on the morrow of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of His prophetic Mission, may well pride itself on the quality as well as the number of achievements which, in both the teaching and administrative spheres of Bahá’í activity, have distinguished its stewardship to His Cause ever since its emergence as an independent national entity in the world-encompassing Bahá’í Brotherhood. Its mission in foreign lands has been befittingly inaugurated in the course of the opening phase of this world-girdling Crusade. The expansion and consolidation of its activities on the homefront have kept pace with the progress of the work initiated by its pioneers beyond the borders of its homeland in both the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific Islands. It has, moreover, launched upon its twofold historic enterprise aiming at the acquisition of its new national administrative Headquarters and the purchase of the site of its future Temple. It has, in addition, been enriched through the donation and legal transfer of a House <a data-fnid='60'></a> uniquely associated with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s historic visit to the Dominion of Canada, and destined to be regarded as the foremost Bahá’í Shrine throughout that Dominion. </p>
    <aside data-fnid='60'>Maxwell Home, 1548 Pine Avenue West, Montreal, Quebec—‘Abdu’l-Bahá stayed in this house during His visit to Montreal in 1912. It was given to the Canadian Bahá’í community by Hand of the Cause Rúḥíyyih <u>Kh</u>ánum in 1953.</aside>

<p class='Stext2' id='789'> The years immediately ahead must witness an intensification of effort, on the part of all of its members, as well as its 

     <pb n='207'>elected national representatives, which will at once safeguard the prizes won in distant fields, and lend a notable impetus to the consolidation of its administrative institutions within its borders. </pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='790'> The selection of the site for the national Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds and for the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár in Canada must be made with the utmost care and promptitude. Measures must, without delay, be taken for the construction of the administrative Headquarters of its National Assembly. The process of multiplication of isolated centres, groups and Assemblies must gather momentum in the course of the current year. The incorporation of firmly established Local Spiritual Assemblies must simultaneously be accelerated, in order to strengthen the structure of these newly established institutions, and pave the way for the establishment of local Bahá’í endowments. The one remaining virgin territory assigned to it must be speedily opened, and every precaution taken to ensure its preservation in the future. Particular attention should be directed to Iceland and Greenland, as the two foremost objectives of this community in connection with the work of consolidation assigned to its members. The meritorious effort exerted so devotedly and patiently by its national elected representatives for the purpose of obtaining official recognition by the Civil Authorities for the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate <a data-fnid='61'></a> should be pursued with the utmost diligence, vigilance and caution. </p>
    <aside data-fnid='61'>The Bahá’í marriage ceremony was first legally recognized in Ontario and British Columbia in 1958.</aside>

<p class='Stext2' id='791'> While the members of this valiant, this highly gifted, forward marching and deeply consecrated community, and particularly its alert and zealous national representatives, labour to attain these immediate goals, that constitute the distinguishing features and the prime objectives of this newly opened phase of the Crusade, the measures initiated recently in the Holy Land to transfer eventually part of the international Bahá’í endowments on Mount Carmel to the name of the newly-established Branch of the Canadian National Spiritual Assembly will be steadily and energetically pursued, as a mark of abiding appreciation of the magnificent and exemplary achievements of 

     <pb n='208'>this Community in recent years in the service of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. </pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='792'> A Community, whose founder <a data-fnid='62'></a> has conferred upon it such splendid benefits and whose dust now lies on the far-off shores of the South American continent; which has been exalted by reason of the eminent services which two other members <a data-fnid='63'></a> <a data-fnid='64'></a> of her family have rendered, in the Holy Land, to the world Bahá’í community; which can, moreover boast of the enduring and historic achievements of yet another Hand of the Cause <a data-fnid='65'></a> —the third nominated from the ranks of its members; and which, in the course of the past year, has set a further example of steadfastness and devotion through the action of outstanding members <a data-fnid='66'></a> <a data-fnid='67'></a> of its National Assembly who have forsaken their homes to settle in the African continent-such a community can well assert its capacity and determination to consummate, within the allotted time, the laborious and mighty task it has risen to shoulder. </p>
    <aside data-fnid='62'>May Ellis Maxwell-spiritual mother of the Canadian Bahá’í community, became a believer in 1898, visited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa in 1899 and returned to Paris to found the first Bahá’í centre on the European continent, married Sutherland Maxwell and settled in Montreal in 1902, achieved <q class=''>“the priceless honour”</q> of a <q class=''>“martyr’s death”</q> in Argentina in 1940.

    <aside data-fnid='65'>Siegfried Schopflocher-known as the <q class=''>“Temple Builder”</q> because of his great contributions to the completion of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the West, appointed a Hand of the Cause of God in 1952, died in Montreal in 1953. For a review of his <q class=''>“numerous, magnificent services”</q> see The Bahá’í World Vol. XII,664–666, In Memoriam.</aside>
    <aside data-fnid='66'>Emeric and Rosemary Sala-members of the National Spiritual Assembly 1948–53. During the first and second Seven Year Plans, they pioneered to Venezuela (1940–41) and travelled throughout Latin America. In 1953 they pioneered to South Africa, and returned to Canada in 1968. In 1971 they pioneered to Mexico, where Rosemary died in 1980. Emeric passed away in 1990. See The Bahá’í World Vol. XVIII, <biblscope type='Page'>713–715</biblscope>, and Vol. XX, In Memoriam.</aside>

<p class='Stext2' id='793'> The rapidity of its expansion, its sound development, the steadiness, the single-mindedness, the tenacity, the enthusiasm, the unity and staunchness of its members, augur well for the remarkable material and spiritual progress which the nation to which it belongs must achieve in the years to come, in accordance with the explicit promise enshrined in the Tablets of the Divine Plan by the Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='794'> May this community march forward on its destined path with renewed vigour, with undimmed vision, with complete unity, with utter consecration, and be enabled to play an immortal part in the execution of the great tasks ahead, and worthily contribute to the prodigious efforts now being collectively exerted by the followers of the Most Great Name, in every continent of the globe, for the world-wide establishment and ultimate triumph of a long-persecuted, divinely impelled, world-redeeming Faith. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='874'> [From the Guardian:] </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='875'> Dear and valued co-workers: </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='876'> The steady progress of the manifold activities in which the Canadian Bahá’í Community is now so devotedly and unflaggingly engaged is a source of great joy and satisfaction to all who have, in recent years, observed its growth and noted its consolidation throughout that vast and promising Dominion. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='877'> Though some of its most capable and active members have, urged by a compelling force to forsake their homes and settle in distant fields, ceased to lend to the members of this brave and greatly consecrated community their valued support, and though a few others to be reckoned among its oldest and most distinguished supporters have passed to the Abhá Kingdom, leaving a gap difficult indeed to fill, yet the body of the Canadian believers, far from flinching or relaxing in its noble endeavours, has amply demonstrated its capacity to assume and discharge its heavy and multiple responsibilities, has steadily enlarged the scope of its achievements, has preserved its unity, and coherence, and set an inspiring example to Bahá’í communities, both young and old, throughout all the continents of the globe. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='878'> The superb feats achieved by this community’s indomitable pioneers far beyond the Arctic Circle, in neighbouring islands of both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as in far off isolated territories; the incorporation of the elected body of its national representatives; the notable increase in the number of its members; its response to the urgent needs of the National Fund; and the rapid enlargement in the scope of its teaching and administrative activities, are all evidences of the intense vitality of the faith which animates it, and of the firm attachment of its members to the Cause which it has espoused. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='879'> Though much bas been achieved in various fields, the work that still remains unaccomplished is so vital and urgent that none of its members can afford to relax for a moment, or to 

     <pb n='225'>lose sight of the significance and sacredness of the immediate tasks now confronting it. </pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='880'> The virgin areas, so laboriously opened, must, under no circumstances, be neglected; nay rather constant attention must be focused upon them in order to consolidate the glorious historic work initiated in those areas. The island of Anticosti, the one remaining goal as yet unattained, and the only island in the Atlantic Ocean as yet unopened in pursuance of the Ten Year Plan, should continue to be the object of the special solicitude of the national elected representatives of this community. The purchase of the site of the Mother Temple of the Dominion of Canada and the establishment of the national Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds constitute a double task that can brook no further delay, as the entire Bahá’í world, having hailed the erection of such an indispensable institution in no less than eighteen countries scattered throughout the continents and oceans of the Globe, is now intently fixing its eyes on this community, so richly blessed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, eager to witness this twofold consummation destined to considerably enrich the record of the services rendered by its members. The acceleration in the process of incorporating firmly established Local Assemblies is yet another objective to which the closest attention must be paid-a task which will, to a very great extent, contribute, from a legal standpoint, to the consolidation of these Assemblies. No less important and vital is the multiplication of isolated centres and groups, the rapid increase in the number of Local Assemblies, and the steady numerical growth of the community-the one enduring foundation on which the security and future prosperity of the community must ultimately rest. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='881'> The sudden and indeed tragic turn of events in the land of the birth of our Faith <a data-fnid='69'></a> must act as an unprecedented and powerful stimulus to the spirit which animates the members of the Canadian Bahá’í Community. It must not, indeed it cannot for a moment, dampen their ardour, deflect them from their purpose, or weaken their resolve to accomplish the tasks assigned 

     <pb n='226'>to them under the Ten Year Plan. </pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='882'> Conscious of their inescapable, their sacred and multiple responsibilities; spurred on by the realization of the great and varied sacrifices being made, and the vicissitudes experienced, by the great mass of their long-suffering brethren in Bahá’u’lláh’s native land; mindful of the prophecies made by the Centre of the Covenant regarding the spiritual and material destiny of their country; following the noble and immortal example set by the founder <a data-fnid='70'></a> of their community and by the two Hands of the Cause <a data-fnid='71'></a> ranking among its foremost members; encouraged by their own splendid achievements in recent years; thankful for the unrestricted freedom enabling them to proclaim, unreservedly and far and wide, the fundamental verities of their Faith; and fully aware of the shortness of the time allotted to them for the performance of their arduous and mighty task, the members of the Canadian Bahá’í Community must arise, at this very hour, and evince such a wholehearted dedication to the mission they have pledged themselves to carry out as to astonish the entire Bahá’í world, and bring everlasting consolation to the hearts of the persecuted followers of the Faith in the land of its birth. </p>

<p id='957'> Dear Bahá’í Friends: </p>

<p id='958'> <a name='fr1'></a><a href='#fn1' class='Sfootnumber'>1</a> was immensely welcome, and enabled the Guardian to take off his list one of the few remaining virgin territories (aside from those 

     <pb n='239'>under Soviet domination) on the list of countries to be opened to the Faith under the Ten Year Plan.</pb> </p>

<p id='959'> <a name='fr2'></a><a href='#fn2' class='Sfootnumber'>2</a> but never the blessing of resident local Bahá’ís. It deserves particular attention at this time. </p>

<p id='960'> <a name='fr3'></a><a href='#fn3' class='Sfootnumber'>3</a> grave built. This is a task which is indeed a precious trust for your Assembly. When the friends realize that her grave will become in the future a place of visitation, they will appreciate the bounty bestowed upon the Canadian Community through being able to claim one of the most distinguished of all pioneers as a member of their Community. </p>

<p id='961'> <a name='fr4'></a><a href='#fn4' class='Sfootnumber'>4</a> a member of your Assembly, as his guest here in the Holy Land, and he feels 

     <pb n='240'>sure that this contact has forged yet another link between the Canadian Bahá’ís and the World Centre.</pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='962'> <a name='fr5'></a><a href='#fn5' class='Sfootnumber'>5</a> and he feels that his understanding of it is quite correct. The Assemblies must be wise and gentle in dealing with such cases, but at the same time must not tolerate a prolonged and flagrant disregard of the Bahá’í Teachings as regards alcohol. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='963'> [From the Guardian:] </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='964'> Dear and valued co-workers: </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='965'> The Canadian Bahá’í Community, whose members are so valiantly participating in the furtherance of the World Spiritual Crusade, now claiming the attention of the entire body of followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in all continents of the globe, has ever since the inception of this world-embracing enterprise, proved itself capable of carrying its share of responsibility in the accomplishment of this collective, colossal task, and has rendered services that have enriched the annals 

     <pb n='242'>of the Faith, not only in a land so dear to the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but in far-off islands and territories which it is the mission of this Community to illuminate and conquer. </pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='966'> Ever since the emergence of this progressive, youthful and dynamic community, as an independent entity, and particularly since the inception of the Ten Year Plan, it has demonstrated, on several occasions, those qualities which alone can provide the guarantee of success in carrying out, as a worthy ally of her sister community in the Great Republic of the West, the sacred and historic Mission assigned to it by the Author of the Tablets of the Divine Plan. The staunchness of the faith of its members, their unyielding resolve, their ceaseless efforts, their willingness to sacrifice, their exemplary loyalty, their steadfast courage, have, time and again, been strikingly displayed, and served to fortify the hopes which I have always cherished for their future destiny. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='967'> The vastness of the field in which this firmly knit, irresistibly advancing, steadily consolidating community now operates, stretching as it does from the Atlantic to the Pacific seaboards, and touching, on the one hand, the fringes of the Arctic Region, and extending, on the other, as far as the islands of the South Pacific, contrasts with the extremely restricted area, in which, for so many years, and until recently, the administrative activities of this community were confined. The diversity and multiplicity of the enterprises in which it finds itself now engaged, the manner in which it is consolidating its strength, enlarging its membership, safeguarding the unity of its members, and noising abroad its fame, may be regarded as additional evidences of its spiritual vigour, and of its rapid rise to maturity at so significant a period in the evolution of the Faith throughout the Western Hemisphere. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='968'> At this crucial hour, when the Plan to which this highly promising community stands committed is entering on the third phase in its unfoldment, the responsibilities confronting its members are at once manifold, pressing and inescapable. The situation on the homefront, so extensive and so varied in character, calls for careful consideration and energetic action on the part of your Assembly. The steady increase in the number 

     <pb n='243'>of those enlisted under the banner of the Faith must be paralleled by a multiplication of Assemblies, groups and isolated centres. The incorporation of all firmly established Assemblies must simultaneously be accelerated. The virgin areas now opened, and particularly Anticosti, Greenland, Iceland and Franklin, as well as those territories deprived recently of the benefits of a resident pioneer, must be made the object of the special attention and solicitude of your Assembly, for upon the preservation of these hard-won prizes must depend the ultimate triumph of this community’s collective and historic task, and the enhancement of the prestige it has deservedly won in recent years throughout the Bahá’í world. </pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='969'> Of equal importance is the strenuous yet highly meritorious obligation to add, steadily and rapidly, to the number of the American Indian and Eskimo adherents of the Faith, and to ensure their active participation in both the teaching and administrative spheres of Bahá’í activity-a task so clearly emphasized by the Pen of the Centre of the Covenant, and in the consummation of which the Canadian Bahá’í Community is destined to play so conspicuous a part. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='970'> Above all, the utmost endeavour should be exerted by your Assembly to familiarize the newly enrolled believers with the fundamental and spiritual verities of the Faith, and with the origins, the aims and purposes, as well as the processes of a divinely appointed Administrative Order, to acquaint them more fully with the history of the Faith, to instil in them a deeper understanding of the Covenants of both Bahá’u’lláh and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, to enrich their spiritual life, to rouse them to a greater effort and a closer participation in both the teaching of the Faith and the administration of its activities, and to inspire them to make the necessary sacrifices for the furtherance of its vital interests. For as the body of the avowed supporters of the Faith is enlarged, and the basis of the structure of its Administrative Order is broadened, and the fame of the rising community spreads far and wide, a parallel progress must be achieved, if the fruits already garnered are to endure, in the spiritual quickening of its members and the deepening 

     <pb n='244'>of their inner life. </pb> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='971'> The duties incumbent upon this community, and particularly its elected national representatives, multiply with every passing day. Heavy is the burden they carry. Rich and immense are the possibilities stretching before them. Priceless are the rewards which a befitting discharge of their multiple responsibilities must bring in its wake. Boundless are the favours and bestowals which a loving and watchful Providence is ready to confer upon those who will arise to meet the challenge of the present hour. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='972'> May the members of this community, as well as its elected representatives, consecrate themselves anew to the mission which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has conferred upon them, and immortalize their stewardship to the Faith of His Father through acts which future generations will unanimously acclaim and for which they will feel eternally grateful. </p>

<p id='1052'> To the National Spiritual Assembly </p>

<p id='1053'> Dear Bahá’í Sister: </p>

<p id='1054'> <a name='fr1'></a><a href='#fn1' class='Sfootnumber'>1</a> and upholding his claims actively, then they would come into an entirely different category. If this is the case, you should inform the Guardian, but otherwise the friends should be advised to just leave these people alone, for their influence can be nothing but negative and destructive, and the less they breathe the breath, so to speak, of those who have turned their back on the light of this Faith, the better. </p><a name='fr2'></a><a href='#fn2' class='Sfootnumber'>2</a>

<p id='1055'> <a name='fr3'></a><a href='#fn3' class='Sfootnumber'>3</a> the lone Canadian pioneer, is demonstrating the Bahá’í spirit in such an exemplary manner. It is hard for the friends to appreciate, when they are isolated in one of these goal territories, and see that they are making no progress in teaching others, are living in inhospitable climes for the most part, and are lonesome for Bahá’í companionship and activity, that they represent a force for good, that they are like a light-house of Bahá’u’lláh shining at a strategic point and casting its beam out into the darkness. This is why he so consistently urges these pioneers not to abandon their posts. Apropos of this, he hopes that it will again be possible in the near future to get someone into Anticosti. It is a great pity that the friend <a data-fnid='77'></a> who went there could not remain. </p>
    <aside data-fnid='77'>Mary Zabolotny (McCulloch)—Knight of Bahá’u’lláh for Anticosti Island (1956), passed away 1996.</aside>

<p class='Stext2' id='1056'> <a name='fr5'></a><a href='#fn5' class='Sfootnumber'>5</a> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='1057'> The utmost care and vigilance, however, should be exercised by this youthful and dynamic community, so richly laden with the prizes it has so deservedly won, lest the momentum, so painstakingly gained in recent years, in both the teaching and administrative spheres of Bahá’í activity, be lost or reduced. The standard of dedication and of efficiency, attained, while pursuing the goals it has pledged itself to achieve, must never be allowed, through apathy, neglect or faint-heartedness, to be lowered. The vision that has fired its members, on the occasion of the centenary celebrations which witnessed the launching of the Ten Year Plan must, no matter how prolonged or arduous the task, never grow dim. Their unswerving fidelity 

     <pb n='266'>to the Covenant established by the Author of their Faith, and their attachment to the ideals and precepts enshrined in His Revelation, should, under no circumstances, no matter how active and subtle the machinations of its enemies, both within and without, be weakened. The momentous and highly exacting task, initiated far beyond the confines of their homeland-a task which posterity will recognize as the opening chapter of their glorious Mission overseas-must be pursued with undiminished diligence, nay with redoubled zeal, and renewed determination and dedication. The no less vital obligation to expand, and consolidate the manifold activities conducted on the homefront, from the Atlantic to the Pacific seaboard, and from the northern confines of the Great Republic of the West to the fringes of the Arctic Ocean, must be faithfully discharged. The setbacks and difficulties that have, unexpectedly and most unfortunately, been recently experienced in connection with the acquisition of both the national Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds and the site of the future Mother Temple of Canada, must be faced with resolution and vigour, and a definite and permanent solution be found which will ensure the full attainment of these twofold primary objectives. The long overdue conversion of the American Indians, the Eskimos and French Canadians, as well as the representatives of other minorities permanently residing within the borders of that vast Dominion, must receive, in the months immediately ahead, such an impetus as to astonish and stimulate the members of all Bahá’í communities throughout the length and breadth of the Western Hemisphere. The independent character of the Faith they profess and champion must, moreover, be fully vindicated through a closer adherence, on the part of the rank and file of the believers, to its distinguishing tenets and precepts, as well as through a fuller recognition by the civil authorities <a data-fnid='78'></a> concerned of the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate and of the Bahá’í Holy Days. The integrity of the fundamental teachings of the Faith, its security, the healthy and steady development, and ultimate fruition, of its nascent institutions, must, above all, 

      <pb n='267'>be ensured and safeguarded, for upon these will depend the consummation of the Mission with which the Author of the Tablet of the Divine Plan has chosen to entrust them. </pb></pb> </p>
    <aside data-fnid='78'>The decision by the Superior Court in Montreal in 1958 which recognized the independent character of the Bahá’í Faith and exempted the Bahá’í Shrine from taxation is recorded in The Bahá’í World Vol. XIII, 662–664.</aside>

    <p> </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='1058'> The few remaining years, separating the steadfast and high-minded members of the Canadian Bahá’í Community, striving so assiduously to achieve their goals, from the time fixed for the termination of a swiftly unfolding Crusade, are rapidly slipping by. A community which, ever since its inception, has, through the instrumentality of its most distinguished members, and particularly its founder <a data-fnid='79'></a> and those nearest to her, as well as a number of her spiritual children and associates, won such prizes at the World Centre of the Faith, in Latin America, in Europe, in Africa and in the Pacific area-such a community, at this crucial hour, cannot afford to either stand still, falter or hesitate. As this World Crusade sweeps majestically forward and draws nearer to its close, exploits, as superb as those its sons and daughters have successively achieved in widely scattered areas of the globe, must continue to distinguish and ennoble the imperishable record of its services. </p>
    <aside data-fnid='79'>May Ellis Maxwell-spiritual mother of the Canadian Bahá’í community, became a believer in 1898, visited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa in 1899 and returned to Paris to found the First Bahá’í centre on the European continent, married Sutherland Maxwell and settled in Montreal in 1902, achieved <q class=''>“the priceless honour”</q> of a <q class=''>“martyr’s Death”</q> in Argentina in 1940. For a review of the vast range of her contributions to the Faith in Europe and America, see The Bahá’í World Vol. VIII, 631–642, In Memoriam.</aside>

<p class='Stext2' id='1059'> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s prophetic words regarding the future of its homeland, spiritually as well as materially-the initial evidences of which are becoming more apparent every day, must not be lost sight of for a moment, however exacting and all-absorbing the strenuous task ahead, however complex the problems its prosecution involves, however burdensome the preoccupations which it must needs engender. </p>

<p class='Stext2' id='1060'> Afire with that same love that burned so brightly in the hearts of its earliest pioneers, holding fast to the strong cord of the spiritual precepts and administrative principles of the Faith it bas so whole-heartedly espoused, confident of its ability to achieve, in its entirety, the Mission entrusted to it by the Author of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, this community must forge ahead, with undeviating loyalty, with indomitable courage, with unbreakable unity, and exemplary consecration, striving to scale loftier heights, and widening constantly the range of its operations, on the American mainland as well as in neighbouring and distant islands, until each and every objective 

     <pb n='268'>of its allotted task has been triumphantly attained. </pb> </p>
