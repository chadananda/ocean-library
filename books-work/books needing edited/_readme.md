## Instructions:

The following documents need to be formatted with HTML. Do not do this in an HTML editor. Do it in a text editor like Sublime so that we don't get a mess of unwanted HTML entities and extra markup.
 
* All sections (letters) will need to have a header with proper classes and ids

* All paragraphs will need a numeric id in the format X.X (see example: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/382588/ocean2.0/Library/books-work/4.%20proofed-done/shoghi-directives.html) 

* dates and signatures get date and signature classes

* everything except numbered paragraphs get the class 'noid'

* when html is complete, drop it into the "completed html" folder
