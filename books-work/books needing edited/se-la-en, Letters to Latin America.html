Messages from and on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to Latin America <!-- New Letter -->20 April 1923 [Mexico] Dr. E. FisherMy dear brother,Your letter of March 22nd written to our beloved Shoghi Effendi has been received. As he is at present wholly occupied with affairs of great importance, he is corresponding only with the assemblies of the friends all over the world and not with the individuals. So he instructed me to answer your letter.He was much pleased with the tone of your letter which implies firmness in meeting difficulties and perseverance in the service of the Cause of God. This was the way the Beloved lived. A true friend follows His footstep.As to your recuperation in Haifa, as the summer is approaching and the weather becomes very hot in this season it will prove injurious to your health. Sanitary conditions here are still very bad. Those who are not accustomed to such climate are apt to suffer greatly.He prays at the Holy Shrines for the improvement of your health and for your confirmation in guiding the people to the Kingdom of God. Your services rendered at Stuttgart to the Cause of God are highly esteemed by the German Bahá’ís and also by our dear Shoghi Effendi. The seeds you sowed in that land have grown beautifully. How happy you should feel, dear brother. How can physical difficulties tell on any person who has stored such a happiness in his heart! Trust in His love and support and your physical difficulties will be removed too!Dear Shoghi Effendi sends you his love and assures you of his remembering you at the Holy Shrines. We hope to hear delightful news from you.With kind wishes and Bahá’í greeting I remain,Your brother in His love,‘Azíz’u’lláh S. Bahádur <!-- New Letter -->10 March 1925 [Leonora Holsapple, Brazil] LOVING APPRECIATION. AWAITING LETTERS. <!-- New Letter -->23 May 1925 [Brazil] Miss Leonora Holsapple Alláh–u–Abhá!Dear Bahá’í Sister,I enclose an 8-page folder which Shoghi Effendi has revised and which he wishes to have translated into and published in as many languages as possible. Could you arrange to have it translated into and printed in Portuguese? If so Shoghi Effendi would be greatly obliged and would be glad tohelp financially if the friends in Brazil cannot easily and conveniently meet the expense themselves. If you could also arrange for its translation into Spanish, so much the better, but if you cannot conveniently do so, please let Shoghi Effendi know so that he may make other arrangements for the translation. On the last page of the Portuguese translation you could put addresses in Brazil to which inquirers may apply for information, literature etc. and any other Bahá’í information of local interest, or a short list of books recommended.We hope the work of our beloved Cause is progressing satisfactorily in Brazil and that energetic and capable workers are arising to teach and serve.Shoghi Effendi joins in warmest greetings and heartfelt prayers for your welfare and that of the friends.26 May 1925To the Bahá’í Friends in Bahia, Brazil c/o Miss Leonora S. HolsappleAlláh–u–Abhá!Dear Bahá’í Brothers and Sisters,Your brother in the service of the Beloved, J. E. EsslemontShoghi Effendi was delighted to get your greetings from the first Naw-Rúz Feast in Bahia. The Greatest Holy Leaf and the other members of the Holy Household also reciprocate your loving greetings most heartily. They all hope that year by year your group may grow in numbers, in strength and devotion, thus hastening the fulfilment of the Master’s glowing prophecies about Bahia.Shoghi Effendi assures you of his warm appreciation of your devoted efforts to spread the Cause in Brazil and assures you of his heartfelt prayers that you may be guided and assisted in your noble task.Your brother in the service of the Beloved, J. E. Esslemont <span data-pg='2'/> </span>My dear and precious fellow-workers:Your most welcome letter has rejoiced my heart. I am so glad to have received a direct word from you and the memory of your working for the Cause in those distant fields is a great encouragement and inspiration to me in my work. I will always remember you individually and collectively in my prayers at the three holy Shrines and assure you of my keen desire to help you and serve you in any way I can. Persevere in your efforts, do not regard your small numbers nor your limitations and your present-day influence. Fix your gaze on the all-conquering Spirit of Bahá’u’lláh and remember that the time will surely come when Bahia and the whole of Brazil will joyously respond to and universally recognize the call of Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá. Happy are you, the pioneers of this glorious Cause!Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->26 May 1925 [Brazil] Miss Leonora S. Holsapple Dear Bahá’í Sister,Since writing you on May 23rd I have been asked by Shoghi Effendi to reply on his behalf to your kind letters of 12th March and 21st April. He is very pleased to hear that you have been translating the teachings from English into Portuguese and should like, if possible, to have copies of all these translations-in print, if they have been printed, and in manuscript, if not.We are very glad to hear that when you last wrote the manuscript of <q class=''>“Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era”</q> was ready for the publisher. So far as I know your translation will be the first to be published, although others are in preparation. We are exceedingly grateful both to you and to Snr. Faria Ribeiro, for the self-sacrificing pains you have taken over the translation and shall be glad to see the volume when it appears. We are delighted also to hear that Snr. Faria and Snr. Costa are now working with you on a new translation of Hidden Words. Shoghi Effendi has recently revised his translation of the Arabic Hidden Words and the revised form will be published in America shortly. He hoped to revise the Persian Section also, but has been so overburdened with other duties for the last few months that he has found it impossible to undertake the revision, and it will have to be postponed for some months yet, I fear.Shoghi Effendi feels that for the present it would be a pity to interrupt the valuable work you are doing for the Cause in Brazil, somewhat disheartening though it may be, at times. This is the time of seed-sowing, not of fruit-gathering. It is not surprising that Theosophist and Spiritualist Groups lose interest, as naturally their first concern is for their own Group. Much more important than <q class=''>“interesting”</q> large numbers whose interest does not go further than attending meetings (provided they are sufficiently attractive) and reading some of the literature to satisfy their intellectual curiosity, is the discovery of a single soul here and there who is really athirst for the teachings and who when he finds the <q class=''>“water of Life”</q> will be like the germinating seed in springtime, that when the rain comes strikes root and sends up its shoots towards heaven, and in due time bears fruit, it may be 30, 60 or 100-fold. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said that if every true Bahá’í gets one other to become a true Bahá’í in the course of a year, the Cause will soon illumine the whole world. One soul who becomes really selfless and devoted to the service of the Beloved is worth a thousand who are only <q class=''>“interested”</q>, and large meetings have little value unless they lead to the discovery by some really thirsty souls of the true <q class=''>“water of Life”</q>.Think how few became real, devoted, selfless followers of Christ during His lifetime, and how disappointing were the results of the big gatherings He often addressed! The merest little handful of <span data-pg='3'/> </span>apparently unimportant and uninfluential men and women followers was the apparent result of His three years’ unremitting and self-sacrificing labour. Yet subsequent history showed that His labours were not wasted. That little handful of people changed the world.So we must not be disappointed if our labours outwardly show little fruit in the early stages. We must go on patiently <q class=''>“living the life”</q>, especially seeking those who are thirsty for the <q class=''>“water of Life”</q> and hungry for the <q class=''>“bread of Life”</q>, be they important or unimportant in the eyes of the world.Shoghi Effendi hopes that it will be possible for the friends in the U.S.A. to send some teachers to Bahia to assist you in your work. Undoubtedly that would give a fresh impetus to the Cause, and Bahia might be made a base for missionary work in other parts of Brazil. The field there is immense. It was a very good move on your part to write to the Teaching Committee suggesting that this opportunity be made known to the Bahá’ís. Shoghi Effendi in his letter to the forthcoming Convention at Greenacre will urge upon the friends there the importance of sending teachers to outposts of the Cause such as yours in Bahia.The results of your work among the factory workers are encouraging.Shoghi Effendi assures you of his heartfelt prayers for blessing on the noble efforts ofMiss Mickle and yourself and your little group of helpers. The Beloved Master spoke glowing words about the future of the Cause in Bahia and without doubt the confirmations of the Spirit will be with those who sincerely strive to give effect to His glorious promises by spreading the Cause there.When the right time comes we trust you will have the happiness and blessing of a visit to Haifa.Shoghi Effendi is very tired at present and hopes to get away soon for rest and change. The climate of Haifa is very trying during the summer months. The doctors have just ordered me away from Haifa for the summer and I shall probably be leaving for the Black Forest (Baden, Germany) in a few days’ time. I hope to resume my work here in the latter part of September.The Greatest Holy Leaf was rather seriously ill last week but is much better again, I am glad to say.Shoghi Effendi, the members of the Holy Family and all the friends here join in loving greetings and best wishes,Your brother in the service of the Beloved, J.E. EsslemontDear spiritual sister:I always eagerly await your news and every information you can give me as to the progress of your valuable work. Never feel disheartened. Remain steadfast and confident. The hour of triumph will strike and the record of your heroic efforts and services will ever adorn the annals of this mighty Cause. I assure you of my continued prayers. <!-- New Letter -->7 November 1925 [Brazil] Miss Leonora HolsappleShoghi <span data-pg='4'/> </span>Dear Bahá’í Sister,Our beloved Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, has instructed me to write this letter acquainting you with the situation of the House of Bahá’u’lláh in Ba<u>gh</u>dád, where He resided during His sojourn in Ba<u>gh</u>dád.As this place is very much sanctified to the Bahá’í world, the beloved Master ordered one of the Bahá’í friends in Ba<u>gh</u>dád over 30 years ago to buy it. He bought it for the beloved Master, but somehow it was registered in the name of that friend. This House had been occupied by us and in our possession till five years ago when the fanatic neighbouring Muḥammadans, becoming alarmed by the rapid progress of the Cause and being filled with jealousy, brought a suit against us, claiming that that Bahá’í friend in whose name the House was registered, was a Muḥammadan and had left no heir and so the House must be left in the charge of a board of religious Trustees.They did not succeed in this. Then they raised another suit against us, that is, they produced an heiress and maintained that the House belongs to her. This suit lasted over three years, and seven months ago they were defeated in this too, because the same claimants had brought two contradictory suits about the same property.Then, being defeated in the Court of First Instance, they appealed to the Supreme Court of ‘Iráq, the country of which Ba<u>gh</u>dád is the Capital. Everybody was almost sure that this, their last step, would meet with failure also. But to our astonishment we hear that on October 22nd, the Supreme Court decided in their favour. Here politics interfered. The president of this Court being English and seeing clearly our rights, remained in our favour, but the other members of the Court, being native and wishing to ingratiate themselves with the Muslim inhabitants, formed the majority and decided against us.On hearing this sad news, our Guardian communicated to all Bahá’í centres to address themselves to the High Commissioner in Ba<u>gh</u>dád by cable and letter, appealing for the reconsideration of the case and the execution of what is just.Now our dear Guardian wishes you also to kindly communicate with the High Commissioner of ‘Iráq, first by cable and then by letter in behalf of the Bahá’ís in South America, appealing for justice and declaring the attachment of the Bahá’ís to that sacred Spot. For your information I enclose a copy of the cable which our Guardian has communicated to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada. You need not communicate to the King of ‘Iráq and the British Central Authorities in London.Shoghi Effendi sends you his loving greeting with best wishes for your success in the service of the Beloved of our hearts. He assures you of his ardent prayers at the Holy Shrines for you.Your respectful brother in His love, ‘Azíz’u’lláh S. BahádurHigh Commissioner’s address: His ExcellencyThe High Commissioner Ba<u>gh</u>dád. <!-- New Letter -->27 December 1925 [Leonora Holsapple, Brazil] My dear Bahá’í Sister, <span data-pg='5'/> </span>Our Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, has been very glad to receive your long, interesting and encouraging letter of November 15th.The news of your many efforts towards the spread of the Cause in Brazil and the already apparent results of your work have been a source of immeasurable joy to Shoghi Effendi and have assured him of the future progress of the Movement there.You must be glad in your pioneer work in Bahia and although as all pioneer work it is difficult and needs much wisdom and perseverance, we trust that it won’t be long before you can make of Bahia a Bahá’í stronghold in South America.Shoghi Effendi has been very pleased with the paper you are regularly publishing. He hopes that it will in future gain in importance and obtain a wide circulation and he will be very glad to extend to you every possible help in his power and express his views on your work. It is only due to your unflinching faith and devotion that already so much has been accomplished, and the burning fire within you, kept and fed by our gracious Master, will always move you onward and help and strengthen you in your work. Of the prayers of Shoghi Effendi and of the whole family of the Master, you must rest assured. Their thoughts are always with you and they pray to God that you may be guided to do His divine Will.The pamphlets which you have had translated and published, copies of which you have sent to Shoghi Effendi, are of great benefit at this early stage of your work, but we trust that the translation of the book of the late Dr. Esslemont will give the Spanish people a book to read with the greatest care and thought. We hope that you will succeed in having it properly translated.I wonder if you have heard of the sad news of the passing away of our devoted brotherDr. J. E. Esslemont? He was of such great help to Shoghi Effendi and his effective work for the Cause had only started. He passed away here in Haifa and was buried in our Bahá’í cemetery. He has left us a book, however, that will keep his memory always fresh in our thoughts.By the time this letter reaches you, you must have heard and communicated with the authorities in ‘Iráq in connection with the Houses of Bahá’u’lláh there. We are all very hopeful that soon justice will be seen to and the Bahá’ís will be given their true right of ownership.I am sure you would be interested to know that the Cause has made wonderful progress in North and Central Germany of late and also in Austria. In Hamburg they have a splendid Assembly where through the efforts of Dr. Grossmann, a new Bahá’í, they are doing some fine work. Mr. Herrigel is also doing well in Austria.In Geneva Mrs. Stannard, an English friend, has established an International Centre andMiss Martha Root, who has been to South America, works with her also. They succeeded in making good connections with the Esperanto Congress in Geneva last summer. <span data-pg='6'/> </span>Here in Haifa our Guardian is in good health. We have as yet no American pilgrims but we are expecting a few.With much love from all,My dear Bahá’í sister:Yours in His service SoheilI always welcome your letters from that far-away and promising country and desire to assure you that I ever remember you in my prayers and beseech for you Divine Guidance, strength and comfort in the arduous but sacred task which you have so bravely chosen for yourself. Persevere in your labours and remember that the seed you are so patiently and laboriously sowing will in the fullness of time yield an abundant harvest. Do not feel disheartened and rest assured of our affection, gratitude, admiration and constant prayers for you.Your true brother,ShoghiI urge you to send a number of these leaflets in both Spanish and Portuguese to Mrs. Stannard, 19 Boulevard Georges Favon, Geneva. She has established in the heart of Europe a vigorous and promising centre. A few also I urge you to send to the American National Spiritual Assembly and to Miss Martha Root.ShoghiIf you send some to the Theosophical Societies it will be very helpful. I have not yet received copies of your magazine. Please send it to me regularly.ShoghiYour letter of December 21st was gladly welcomed by our dear Guardian. It is always to him a source of pleasure to know of your work and to feel that even in that far-away country you are earnestly endeavouring to promote the Cause that is so dear to our hearts. Brazil is a vast and promising country and we trust that you will sow seeds that in future will envelop the entire country and its people. Such pioneer work as yours is worthy of the greatest praise.Shoghi Effendi was glad to receive copies of your wire and letter which you sent to the High Commissioner in ‘Iráq. They were both splendidly worded and I am sure it must have affected him very much to see Bahá’ís from South America protesting against an unjust decision in Mesopotamia.Although the government has not yet given its decision in the case, we are very hopeful that the interests of the Cause will be safeguarded and the Houses that are so rich in sacred memories to every Bahá’í will be turned over to us. We are still awaiting results though the office of the High Commissioner must have been flooded with wires of protest from almost every country in the world. <!-- New Letter -->28 January 1926 [Leonora Holsapple, Brazil] My dear Bahá’í Sister, <span data-pg='7'/> </span>We have had with us for the last few days some of the friends from California. We trust that some day you will be able to come to Haifa perhaps accompanied by the first party of real Brazilian Bahá’ís. I hardly need to assure you that our prayers are always with you and that our Guardian will be glad to help you in every way in your splendid work.The magazines which you had sent him were received with many thanks.Shoghi Effendi is in very good health and actively busy co-operating with his friends and fellow — workers throughout the world. He will never fail to ask our Gracious Master to bless your work and to aid and guide you in your earnest endeavours.With all good wishes and much love from the family, Yours in His love,SoheilMy dear fellow-worker:I am glad and gratified to learn that the voice of Bahia has reinforced the call of the Bahá’ís of the world for justice and fairness in connection with Bahá’u’lláh’s House. May this combined effort, so spontaneously and gloriously displayed, yield the desired result. I assure you of my continued prayers for your welfare, happiness and success.Your brother and well-wisher,ShoghiI have received the November issue of your promising Magazine and hope to receive soon the December number. Your communications regarding the House were splendid. I will inform you if the situation requires it in future.Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->16 October 1926 [Brazil] Dear Miss Holsapple:Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated August 15th 1926 as well as of the letter of the Assembly. He wants you to assure the friends of his earnest prayers and of his hope that, through your combined efforts, the Cause will make great progress in that land.Concerning your own plans, Shoghi Effendi believes that you should stay in that land until the work is fully and firmly established. We have had many cases when a new Assembly was lost to the Cause because there was no more a person to bring them together. Shoghi Effendi advises you to take up this post of a teacher which has been offered to you. It will on the one hand provide you with the financial needs, and on the other, open up new channels for service. As a teacher of English you could come in contact with many young people and win them over to the Cause.Shoghi Effendi is most appreciative of your services, he will pray for your success and eagerly awaits the news of your victories. <span data-pg='8'/> </span>With deepest love I remain,My dearly-beloved sister:Yours in His service, Rúḥí AfnánYour continued presence in Brazil is, I feel, vitally important and of the greatest value. If you can find an occupation that will enable you to visit a number of states in that country it will be highly satisfactory. The bound issues of the Bahá’í periodical which you so steadfastly publish have been received and I truly appreciate your patient, self-sacrificing efforts. The Master is guiding you from on high and is truly pleased with your manifold activities. Do not despair or feel despondent, recall the promise of Bahá’u’lláh and the emphatic assurances of our Beloved. Take heart and redouble in your highly-valued efforts.Your true brother,ShoghiThe first issue of the bi-monthly magazine has been read with deep admiration. <!-- New Letter -->15 April 1927 [Brazil]Dear Bahá’í Sister, Miss Leonora S. Holsapple,Our beloved Guardian thanks you warmly for your interesting letter to him, dated January 23, 1927.He is most interested in all the details of your work, and is very glad you have entered into correspondence with Miss Root, asking her for addresses of any friends in Portugal who would like to have your Magazine.Shoghi Effendi is pleased to hear that you have received such friendly replies from the Theosophical Societies of South and Central America and Spain-this should open a fresh and promising field for Bahá’í work.Certainly Shoghi Effendi will pray at the Holy Shrines for the group at Recife, and for the de Barros family in particular, who have been so good in helping you to organize public meetings, as well as some in their own home. This service is much appreciated by Shoghi Effendi.He is also much interested to hear of the old man in prison, formerly a fierce bandit, who is corresponding with and sending leaflets to other persons.Your letter has given the Guardian a much clearer insight into the situation which you have to meet and he is most pleased that you have written to him so fully.Please rest assured of the constant and earnest prayers of Shoghi Effendi that you may be abundantly blessed and guided in all the good efforts you are making to serve the Bahá’í Faith, and for yourself that you may be strengthened and helped in all ways. <span data-pg='9'/> </span>The Greatest Holy Leaf and the holy Household send you warm greetings and best wishes, in which I venture to join.Your sincere fellow-worker, Ethel J. RosenbergMy dear and valued co-worker:Your detailed letter has stimulated my hopes and renewed my vigour and strength in the service of the Cause. I would urge you to concentrate on a few capable and receptive souls and by close association, helpfulness and loving kindness, imbue them with the spirit of unreserved allegiance to the Cause. I am very grateful for the translations of the appreciations of the Queen of Rumania and I trust you will be helped in future by competent assistants in the all-important field of translation. Persevere in your labours, and do not hesitate to write to me whenever you feel urged to do so.Your true brother,ShoghiI shall be delighted to receive a copy of your translations and particularly <q class=''>“Some AnsweredQuestions”</q>. <!-- New Letter -->18 August 1927 [Leonora Holsapple, Brazil] My dear Bahá’í Sister,I thank you very much on behalf of our dear Shoghi Effendi for your letter of May 16th.He is always very glad to hear from you and to learn of your pioneer work for the progress of our common Cause in that vast and far-away country. It was indeed encouraging and hopeful to read your vivid account of the various meetings and activities to which you bent all your efforts. That they will some day flower and flourish, seeds you have faithfully sown, is beyond the shadow of a doubt, and with you is and shall ever be the loving prayers of our kindly Guardian.He also trusts that your return to America will be the occasion of a happy family reunion and there you will find, even among the Bahá’ís of America, rest, strength and a sense of merited appreciation which will aid and strengthen you in the mighty and glorious task that awaits you in Brazil.Shoghi Effendi desires and earnestly hopes, however, that upon your return you will make a special effort perhaps with the help of others to maintain the publication of your magazine. It is a flickering light of hope, shining though humbly, yet mercifully, upon its readers; who knows but it may some day turn into a torch and blaze the path of righteousness to teeming millions of humanity. <span data-pg='10'/> </span>Always interested in your efforts and sanguinely hopeful of the best results, our Guardian wishes me to assure you as never before of his good wishes and prayers.Yours in His service, Soheil AfnánMy precious sister:I feel that you should concentrate on Bahia and Ceara and not dissipate your energies along too many different lines. Your letters are always stimulating and refreshing to me. Your name, I assure you, will adorn the annals of the Cause and will inspire many a Bahá’í pioneer in future. You cannot realize the splendour and significance of the work you are doing at present. May God grant you strength, and patience in your exacting yet sublime task.ShoghiA great pleasure to our dear Guardian to receive your letter of September 19th from on board the boat, and it meant very interesting reading, and also the enclosures you had sent.Shoghi Effendi has been very glad of your journey to the various centres in and around Panama on your way to Bahia. Of course not much can be expected from these hurried visits but once the contact is made perhaps you could keep connections with them even from Bahia through correspondence. You are all alone in such a wide and endless field but that makes it all the more absorbing when one puts his heart and soul into it. Of that there is no doubt that our Guardian will always pray for you and expects to see through your sustained efforts innumerable centres in and around Bahia established as beacon lights of guidance for the teeming millions of the continent.With all good wishes for your work and heartfelt greetings, Sincerely in His service,Soheil AfnánMy dear co-worker:I rejoice to learn of your activities and progress in those distant countries-until now a virgin soil for the seeds of our beloved Faith — and of your determination to resume your pioneer work in Brazil. I am deeply grateful to you for the translation you have sent me and hope to receive the rest in the not distant future.

In fact in the great work that he shoulders he is much encouraged and aided by the thought that far across the seas in far-away Brazil, he has devoted friends to think of him and to co-operate with him in our common endeavour to serve mankind and to bring peace of heart and the spirit of true brotherhood in the world. <span data-pg='14'/> </span>He wants me to assure you also of his affection and of his prayer that you may study more and more the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh and with the application of His principles establish a great Bahá’í centre in that promising country.With loving regards,My dear co-workers:Yours in His Name, Soheil AfnánYour joint and most welcome message has rejoiced my heart.

In all pioneer work, the beginning is difficult and results are very slow to come, but the seeds you have so lovingly and devotedly sown in Bahia will never be lost nor altogether die away. In fact to work earnestly when no results are apparent, to teach the Cause to people who receive it coldly and indifferently, is no easy or encouraging task and only those who like yourself are fortified by an unflinching faith and a courage that is born of the burning fire of conviction can stand it.In years to come those seeds will some day flourish and if we are there to witness it or not, He will bless our endeavour. Perhaps it would be useful to try and reach different classes of people as their outlook often differs.With the assurance of the Guardian’s affection and prayers, Sincerely yours,Soheil Afnán <span data-pg='15'/> </span>My dear and precious co-worker:Persevere in your arduous and historic labours. I will continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart. Will you kindly send direct to Mr. Horace Holley in New York and as soon as possible a report on your activities and the progress of the Cause during the last 2 years in Brazil and South America for incorporation in the forthcoming issue of <q class=''>“The Bahá’í World”</q>? I feel it is essential and valuable. Will you also send to my address to Haifa, as soon as possible (latest by end of March), a group photograph of the Bahá’ís and those interested in Brazil?Your true and affectionate brother,ShoghiI strongly feel that you should undertake the translation of Dr. Esslemont’s book into Spanish rather than attempt other translations into Portuguese. May the Beloved assist you and inspire you in this great work!Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->5 April 1930 [Brazil] Dear Miss Holsapple:Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated March 12th as well as the enclosed photo of the friends there. He hopes that through your constant efforts this group will daily increase in number, that you will be able to attract many noble souls and establish many centres.The work that you have undertaken in opening up a new field is surely difficult and for some time may seem discouraging. But the truth is that we should be patient and give time for the seed to germinate. In every country where the Cause entered newly, little sign of progress was seen at first, but soon the Movement obtained its acceleration and greater speed was acquired. So much so, that now in some countries where the Cause has been existing for some time, groups are beginning to enter. Individuals are no more counting. Shoghi Effendi hopes that before long you will experience the same thing and see that land aflame with the love of God.The translation of the literature is surely very important, for books can do the follow-up work as no single person. And among our literature Dr. Esslemont’s book is the most comprehensive.In closing may I assure you of Shoghi Effendi’s prayers and loving greetings. Yours ever sincerely,Rúḥí AfnánMy dear and precious co-worker:Your most welcome photograph has reached me in time, and I thank you from all my heart. I am now looking forward to the translation of Esslemont’s book into Spanish, and I will pray that you <span data-pg='16'/> </span>may be guided and fortified by the spirit of our beloved Master Who I am sure is guiding you, watching over you and sustaining you in your labours.

He sincerely hopes that this group you mention in your letter will keep on their interest, study the teachings thoroughly and end by forming a properly constituted Assembly. Once this is formed then the work will take an easier and more encouraging turn. Have them also study the <q class=''>“Íqán”</q> for there are found the basic tenets of the Faith. The work may be discouraging just at present but that is true of every pioneer work. Bahá’u’lláh has, however, promised us ultimate success.Anyhow while visiting the Shrines Shoghi Effendi will think of you and of your little group and ask for you all divine help and guidance. Please convey to them his loving greetings.This year we have had quite a large group of pilgrims from America. For a few days all the rooms of the Pilgrim House were occupied. Most of them have gone but we still have a few.The Greatest Holy Leaf is quite well and as the weather is getting warmer she can leave her room.With best wishes,My dear and valued co-worker:Yours ever sincerely, Rúḥí AfnánThe memory of your visit is still fresh in my mind and I am looking forward to the time when you will be able to send your spiritual children to the Holy Land.

With my loving appreciation of your unsparing efforts,Your true brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->26 March 1932 [Brazil] Dear Miss Holsapple:Shoghi Effendi wishes me to drop you these few lines mainly to enquire about you and your work. It is a very long time he has not heard from you, nor received any report concerning the progress <span data-pg='17'/> </span>of the services you are rendering to the Faith. Those who are in the field should always keep in touch with the centre and write even though they have nothing of great interest to report. So please write.The other subject concerning which Shoghi Effendi wishes me to write to you is the Spanish translation of Dr. Esslemont’s book. When you were here in Haifa you told him that you were going to attempt it as soon as you returned home; but you never wrote to say how that work is progressing. Shoghi Effendi wishes you to exert all your efforts along that line. He believes that it is very important to have this book translated into as many different languages as possible for the need may suddenly arise and we may be unprepared to satisfy it. He would very much like to send some financial help for its publication when the translation is completed. You may be interested to know that it is already published in a dozen different languages, and there are many other translations being made.In closing may I express to you Shoghi Effendi’s loving greetings and assure you of his prayers. Yours ever sincerely,Rúḥí Afnán <!-- New Letter -->30 July 1932 [Leonora Holsapple, Brazil] Dear Bahá’í Sister,I am directed by Shoghi Effendi to acknowledge the receipt of your kind letter dated July 1st, 1932 and to extend to you as well as to our Bahia friends the expression of his loving appreciation and sympathy.The general tone of your letter seemed to indicate how slow the Cause is progressing in Brazil, and this lack of responsiveness on the part of the Brazilian public has apparently served to discourage some of the believers. I cannot but sympathize with them. For the religious crisis through which we are now passing, besides being unprecedented in its intensity, is being coupled with economic conditions of the most distressing character. Human society is today attacked by both spiritual and material forces and under the pressure of these combined powers the very basis of our social life is being gradually undermined.But we Bahá’ís, who are fully conscious of the outcome of such world-wide catastrophic changes, cannot remain discouraged and let our activities be paralysed. For we have been promised by our Master that the future is ours and that, however heedless the people may be, however cynical their outlook upon our principles and teachings may appear, yet such a state of affairs is but only transitory and will only serve to pave the way for the spread and the triumph of the Cause.Shoghi Effendi wishes you, therefore, to persevere, to remain firm as a rock and to face courageously any obstacle that may seem to hinder your work. He is fully conscious of the difficulties of every sort which you have to face and solve. But he sincerely hopes that through your devotion and self-sacrifice you will be able to overcome them all. He wishes you also to do your best for gettingDr. Esslemont’s book translated into Spanish as such a work will constitute the first Bahá’í book in that language. With the assurance of his best wishes for yourself as well as for the rest of our friends,Yours sincerely, H. RabbáníDear co-worker: <span data-pg='18'/> </span>I was so pleased and cheered to hear from you after such a long silence, and trust that you will continue to keep in close touch with me and inform me frequently of the progress of your valued activities. I feel deeply attached to your work.Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->28 October 1932 [Leonora Holsapple, Brazil] Dear Bahá’í Sister,Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated October 8th.He appreciates your sympathy in the inestimable loss that he has in the passing of the Greatest Holy Leaf. You have been amongst the fortunate believers who had the privilege to meet her in this world and upon whom she has personally bestowed her kindness and blessing. I am sure that this cherished memory will be to you a source of strength to encourage you in your efforts to serve the Cause to which she has offered her life.The Guardian has sent you in August a copy of the tribute that he has written to her; apparently it has not reached you; therefore he is sending you another copy, hoping that this time it will reach you safely. It is a touching report of dear <u>Kh</u>ánum’s life, where the Guardian emphasizes the various stages of her sufferings, testifying to her astounding devotion and love to her Almighty Father and Beloved Brother.Shoghi Effendi greatly values the efforts that you are exerting to serve the Cause in Brazil. He urges you not to feel disheartened if now the result is not favouring you. Be sure that your single — handed endeavour will certainly one day produce the most wonderful results. The light of guidance, which has been shed before you by Bahá’u’lláh, will effectively help you to prepare the hearts of the people to receive His Message. The Guardian’s sympathy and cheerful hope in your task will follow you and fortify you in your noble enterprise.Shoghi Effendi was glad to hear that Esslemont’s <q class=''>“New Era”</q> will be soon published in Spanish. It is a marvellous effect of your laborious attempts. Of course it will be a great help to you as it will assist you to display to the reader the history and the teachings of the Cause. He is pleased to announce to you that this same book has been translated and published into fourteen languages, and is being translated into another sixteen additional languages.He is sending you enclosed a cheque for nine pounds sterling, as his contribution towards its publication. He hopes that it will be soon printed and attract the attention of the public.I should like to assure you, dear Bahá’í sister, of the Guardian’s prayers at the Holy Shrines, for the success of your efforts and the attainment of an ultimate victory in the spreading of the Faith.With my best personal wishes,Faithfully in His Name, Mehranguise Rabbání <span data-pg='19'/> </span>Dear co-worker:Your letter truly cheered my sad and overburdened heart. I value the sentiments it conveyed as well as the news it imparted.

I shall be glad to receive 50 (fifty) copies of the Spanish version of Dr. Esslemont’s book for the library in the Mansion of Bahá’u’lláh at Bahjí close to His sacred Shrine.

He was very glad to obtain some news from you, for it was a long time he had not heard anything from you. Those who are scattered in isolated places, endeavouring to promote the Faith, should write the Guardian every now and then and give him any news they have regarding the progress of their work. By keeping in touch with the centre they may be able to face their problems better.Shoghi Effendi wishes you to exert your efforts towards having the work on the Spanish translation of Dr. Esslemont’s book completed as soon as possible. To provide such first-class books for circulation is the first requisite for an intensive teaching work, this is why the Guardian attributes so much importance to the publication of this book in as many languages as possible.Shoghi Effendi wishes me also to ask you to send him fifty copies of the Portuguese translation of <q class=''>“Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era”</q>. He needs them to distribute in case some visitor may ask for them.Under separate cover he is sending you a copy of that book translated by Lydja Zamenhof into Esperanto. They say it is a wonderful piece of work. She has translated other books as well and they could be obtained through Dr. H. Grossmann of Germany.In closing may I assure you of Shoghi Effendi’s prayers and best wishes for your success in serving the Faith.Yours ever sincerely, Rúḥí Afnán <span data-pg='20'/> </span>Dear and valued co-worker:Your letter imparted intense gladness to my heart.

BakerShoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge on his behalf the receipt of your welcome letter dated August 18th, 1933, and to express his deepest appreciation of your precious efforts in connection with the Spanish translation and publication of Dr. Esslemont’s book. He hopes that its wide and speedy circulation will pave the way for the extension of the Cause in South America. The most valuable book to be translated next to that of Dr. Esslemont is, undoubtedly, the <q class=''>“Book of Certitude”</q> by Bahá’u’lláh, which contains the very essence of the Teachings, and because of its clarity and its relative simplicity can greatly appeal to every thoughtful reader. Dr. Esslemont’s book gives a general panorama of the Cause and is the best introductory book on the subject. The <q class=''>“Íqán”</q> deepens the knowledge of the reader by acquainting him with some of the basic theological problems of the Faith. It is, therefore, indispensable for every student of the Movement, and its publication should be considered as an essential step for the effective and wide spread of the Teachings.The Guardian will also advise you to translate <q class=''>“Some Answered Questions”</q>, which is in many ways unique in the literature of the Faith. <q class=''>“The Dawn-Breakers”</q> can be also of a great help in spreading the Teachings. But as it is too voluminous a work to be translated at present it would be preferable if you could simply translate some of its important chapters and have them published in a magazine. <span data-pg='21'/> </span>In closing let me assure you once more of Shoghi Effendi’s best wishes and of his fervent prayers for the advancement and success of your work.Yours in His service, H.

The translation and eventual publication of the Spanish version of the <q class=''>“New Era”</q> will add fresh laurels to those you have already won in your career of service to so precious and sacred a Cause. I am looking forward to the day when I can place the printed edition in the international library in the Mansion close to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. Persevere, be happy and confident.Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->28 December 1933 [Leonora Holsapple, Brazil] Dear Bahá’í Sister,The Guardian was deeply gratified to receive your letter of December 11th, and to learn once more of your ever-expanding and highly-meritorious services to the Cause. He hopes that your stay in the States has been beneficial to you, both spiritually and physically, and that you are now refreshed and quite ready to resume your teaching work in Brazil. Your departure from Bahia has left a gap in the teaching field which you alone can effectively fill in. May the Beloved assist and strengthen you by the divine and invisible army of His hosts, and may He enable you to win fresh victories in the path of service.Concerning the Spanish version of the <q class=''>“New Era”</q>, the Guardian has already requested you, in one of his former communications, to send him fifty copies of this book. But he has as yet received nothing. He wishes you, therefore, to inquire about this matter, and to forward to his address 50 copies of the Spanish translation. He fully approves of your suggestion to send out [a] few copies to Spain and to various other parts of South America, as he feels that such an action is bound to give some publicity to the Cause. He would advise you to send copies of this same book to important university libraries in the South. For professors and scholars will probably be interested in that subject which will surely be a novelty to most of them, and they may be led to review the book in the newspapers or through the pages of their religious and scientific reviews.In closing please extend Shoghi Effendi’s loving greetings to Mrs. Higman of Worcester and to Mrs. Rachel Small of Boston whenever you write to them. May I also assure you of his fervent prayers on your behalf and on behalf of your father, sister and aunt. May the Almighty keep and strengthen you all.Yours in His service, H.

I will continue to pray for you from all my heart, and wish to renew my plea for perseverance and redoubled activity despite the difficulties with which you are beset and which you will no doubt surmount through the all-conquering power of Bahá’u’lláh.Your true brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->8 March 1934 [Leonora Holsapple, Brazil] Dear Bahá’í Sister,On behalf of the Guardian I wish to acknowledge the receipt of your most welcome letter of January 31st, and to thank you for the fifty copies of the Spanish version of Dr. Esslemont’s <q class=''>“Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era”</q> all of which have reached him safely.I feel I must express once more his deep and abiding appreciation of the spirit and the manner in which you are promoting the interests of the Faith in Brazil.

He wishes me to convey to you his renewed and deep-felt appreciation of your teaching activities in South America, and particularly in Brazil, where, thanks to your valued endeavours and to the warm assistance extended to you by that indefatigable pioneer teacher of the Cause Miss Leonora Holsapple, a genuine interest in the Teachings has been aroused.Shoghi Effendi trusts that after your departure from that country, you will continue communicating with those whom you have succeeded in attracting to the Message, and with the view of intensifying and maintaining their interest in the Faith. He fully agrees with your suggestion that without some exact knowledge of the theory and practice of the Administration, it would be impossible to establish a permanent group of believers capable of developing one day into an Assembly. The Bahá’í teacher must not only strive to deliver and expound the Message, he must, in addition, make an effort to consolidate his teaching work by establishing a small group of sincere and active people who have a genuine interest in the Cause. The only power that can hold these people together, and unify and direct their activities, is the Administration, which does not only give them a clear vision of the task they have to perform, but also provides them with the necessary incentive to translate into actions and deeds the ideals they have embraced.In view of that, it would be quite splendid if in addition to the purely teaching side of your activities you make a special effort to teach and establish the Administration in the countries you visit.The Guardian has lately received a letter from the Honolulu Assembly, expressing their appreciation of your teaching activities in their centre, and requesting him to ask you to pay a second visit to their group some time during the coming winter. Shoghi Effendi thinks, that in case this trip does not interfere with your teaching plans in South America, it would be very useful if you undertake a journey to Honolulu. The friends there are in great need of competent teachers, and would immensely appreciate any assistance you may extend to them in this respect.Wishing you always full success in your labours, and with Shoghi Effendi’s best wishes and prayers for your welfare and guidance,Yours in His service, H. RabbáníDear and highly valued co-worker:You have in the course of your South American tour added fresh laurels to the crown which your endeavours in distant fields have won you in the service of the Cause. I am highly gratified and deeply thankful. I would urge you to do all you possibly can, through correspondence and consultation with the American National Assembly, in order to maintain the interest and consolidate the work you have so splendidly initiated in the southern continent. I will pray for your success from the bottom of my heart.Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->26 July 1935 [Leonora Holsapple, Brazil] Beloved Bahá’í Sister,The Guardian has read with deepest interest and satisfaction your warm and welcome message of May 31st, and has been greatly encouraged to learn of the slow, though steady progress which the <span data-pg='24'/> </span>Cause is making in South America. He is specially gratified that Mrs. Loulie Mathews’ visit has been of such a tremendous help and encouragement to you, and that through her a few people of capacity have been attracted to the Faith.The problem of converting the natives is, as you rightly state, an exceedingly difficult one. But not until it has been solved, even though partially, can there be any hope of establishing the Cause firmly and permanently in the South American States. Foreigners, of course, have to start the work. But their work should be mainly centred on finding the ways and means whereby the natives can be won to the Cause.This is, therefore, what the Guardian wishes you to concentrate upon. Your immediate objective should be to bring together a small group of beginners, to cultivate and deepen their interest in the Message, to make them accept it in its wholeness, and to give them the scope as well as the stimulus to help in spreading it among their fellow-countrymen. When such a group of native Bahá’ís is established you can then feel confident that the work will continue progressing, with some slight drawbacks, of course, but without any serious danger.Your task, though highly difficult, is by no means insurmountable. Your perseverance can and will, no doubt, remove any obstacle that may threaten to hinder the progress of your work. The Guardian is continually praying for you, that Bahá’u’lláh may continue to keep, guide and strengthen you in your magnificent and pioneering labours for the establishment of the Faith in South America.With regard to Senor Bayo of Madrid referred to in your letter, he wrote a letter to the Guardian last winter. In reply Shoghi Effendi sent him some literature in Spanish, and also wrote him a letter of appreciation and encouragement. But since he has received no word from him. His wife must have probably turned away his attention from the Cause.With warmest Bahá’í greetings from the Guardian,Yours in His service,H. RabbáníDear and valued co-worker:The impetus which Mrs. Mathews’ visit has lent to your teaching activities will, I am sure, enable you to extend the scope and deepen the influence of your magnificent and unsparing efforts for the establishment of the Faith of God in that far-off country. I will pray that your historic work, performed with such diligence, devotion and loyalty, may be crowned with signal success. I shall ever remember you at the holy Shrines.

You should, in any case, keep in closest touch with them through correspondence and extend to them any assistance they need in their teaching activities.With regard to your activities in connection with the training and education of children in the Cause: the Guardian would approve of this type of work in which you are engaged, as he feels that through it you can bring many souls into the Faith. It is certainly far more vital than the purely humanitarian activities, inasmuch as its primary purpose is the teaching of the Cause.The Guardian does not think it advisable, however, that you should concentrate all your efforts on this type of Bahá’í activity, and would consider it premature for you to expand it beyond its present scope.He is praying for your guidance and for the success of your efforts. Yours in His service,H. RabbáníMay the Beloved guide your steps, cheer your heart, fulfil your hopes, remove all obstacles from your path, and enable you to establish a firm foundation for His Faith and its institutions,Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->8 May 1937 [Haik Kevorkian, Argentina] Dear Mr. Kevorkian,The Guardian has just received your most welcome letter dated April 9th and is indeed delighted to learn of your safe arrival in Buenos Aires. He is also very pleased to know that you stopped on your way in Bahia, and called on our distinguished pioneer friend, Miss Leonora Holsapple. For although short your visit must have meant so much to her. She herself has written about her meeting with you and your family, and expressed the great joy and inspiration which this contact with Eastern believers had brought to her heart. You should certainly keep in closest touch with her through correspondence, and if feasible, by occasional visits to Bahia. <span data-pg='29'/> </span>What has also deeply rejoiced the Guardian is the news of the conversion of Mr. Khalili to the Cause. He trusts that now that he is fully convinced of the truth of the Bahá’í message, he will strive heart and soul to spread it as widely as his time and means permit. He would be most pleased to hear from him, and of the teaching work in which he is engaged. Do encourage him to persevere and to be confident in the guidance and unfailing assistance of Bahá’u’lláh.In view of the fact that you are living so far from the East, and are not in sufficient touch with any nearby Bahá’í centre, the Guardian has thought it advisable to direct the Haifa Spiritual Assembly to send you regularly a copy of their English news-letter, which gives a report of the major activities of the Cause throughout the East and particularly Persia and the Near Eastern countries. He hopes that through this medium you will be able to maintain your contacts with the Oriental believers. He does not know whether the American National Spiritual Assembly is sending you a copy of the <q class=''>“News-Letter”</q>; in case you do not receive this bulletin, be sure to write that body to this effect.Although the feast of Ri ván has just ended, I wish nevertheless to convey to you, and to each and every member of your dear family, the Guardian’s best wishes and his heartiest greetings for a very happy feast.With his renewed and loving appreciation to you all,Yours ever in the Cause,H. RabbáníDear co-worker:I wish to assure you in person of my continued, my ardent and loving prayers for your welfare, your spiritual advancement, and the success of your pioneer and meritorious efforts. Persevere in your arduous yet noble task, and rest assured that the Beloved will bless richly your high endeavours.Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->26 May 1937 [Beatrice Irwin, Mexico] Dear Miss Irwin,Your welcome communications of December 28th, February 4th, March 8th and May 2nd with enclosures have been duly received and their contents have been read with profoundest interest by our beloved Guardian. He is most happy that you have safely reached Mexico, and that your long-cherished hope of teaching the Cause in that country has at last been fulfilled. Your knowledge of the history and social conditions of that land, and the great sympathy you feel towards its people, fully qualify you, indeed, to undertake this teaching journey, whose many benefits to the Cause you cannot fully estimate at present. You should be confident that the seeds you are now patiently sowing will in due time bear an abundant fruitage. Be happy, therefore, and whole-heartedly persevere in your valuable endeavours.Your chief objective, the Guardian feels, should be to establish a nucleus of firm, loyal and enlightened believers who would be able, after your departure, to carry forward your teaching work. Individual and personal contacts are most helpful for the formation of such a group, and you should, therefore, make every effort to approach such individuals as you think will be able to embrace the Cause. Such souls are necessarily few in number, but they can be found and easily reached, provided one makes the necessary investigations and effort. <span data-pg='30'/> </span>The Guardian is, in the mean time, ardently praying that the mission you have undertaken to accomplish may be crowned with success, and bring forth such good results as to encourage you to prolong for some time your stay in Mexico.Yours ever in the Cause,H. RabbáníMay the Beloved bless you and keep you, and graciously and continually assist you to render memorable services to His Faith and its rising institutions,Your true brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->29 May 1937 [Nellie French, Chile] Dear Mrs. French,Your letters dated February 26th, and March 24th have duly reached the Guardian, and the news of the success of your teaching trip to South America has deeply rejoiced his heart. He is happy too that the trip has proved to be so beneficial to Mr. French’s health, and that you also have been so refreshed through this change of air, and reinvigorated spiritually through contact with the friends and sympathizers of the Cause in the different centres you have visited on your way.He fervently hopes that the seeds you have sown in this journey will soon take root and germinate, and thus give you added stimulus to undertake such teaching trips in the future.It will surely rejoice you to learn, in this connection, that the teaching work in South America has been lately reinforced through the settlement in Buenos Aires of an Armenian Bahá’í family of five persons who were formerly living in Aleppo, Syria. The man, by name of Nazar Kevorkian, is a fine believer, having been a very active worker in Aleppo for many years. On his way to Argentina he stopped at Haifa and met the Guardian, who advised him, immediately upon his arrival in Buenos Aires, to inform the American National Spiritual Assembly of his plans to settle in Argentina.The Guardian hopes that with this Bahá’í family as a nucleus, the Cause in Buenos Aires will have a great chance of expanding. He wishes you to endeavour, by any means you can, to further stimulate the progress that has been so unexpectedly accomplished.With the assurance of his prayers for your success and guidance, and for the confirmation of Mr. Nils Chrisander, whom you have contacted during your last cruise to South America,Yours ever in the Cause,H. RabbáníWishing you signal success in the high endeavours you are continually exerting, both at home and in distant fields, for the spread of the Faith and the rise and consolidation of its institutions,Your true brother,Shoghi <span data-pg='31'/> </span> <!-- New Letter -->10 September 1937 [Beatrice Irwin, Mexico] Dear Miss Irwin,The Guardian has received your welcome communication of the first August and was indeed pleased to hear of the further progress of your activities in Mexico. He hopes that these six months of uninterrupted and concentrated effort will have the result of preparing the ground for a more intense and widespread teaching activity throughout that land. The few individuals you have attracted, though still unable to constitute a working group, should, now that you are away from the country, be encouraged to persevere in their efforts for the study of the Teachings. The Guardian would therefore urge that you correspond with them as frequently and regularly as possible, so as to keep alive, nay deepen, their interest in the Faith. They should be stimulated to correspond with individual Bahá’ís and centres, and to cultivate fellowship with the friends, even though only by means of correspondence.As regards the general conditions affecting the teaching work in Mexico: The Guardian knows full well that both the Catholic and the anti-clerical elements there make it exceedingly difficult for the friends to teach in a proper and effective way. The people are either bigoted Christians or have a purely materialistic outlook on life and in the continual conflict between these two forces the chance for confirming new souls and for establishing a properly functioning Assembly is rather slight. There is too much fear, prejudice and social agitation at present; but it is hoped later on conditions will prove more favourable for the effective penetration of the Cause.In the mean time the Guardian would recommend that you maintain through correspondence your contact with those whom you have succeeded in attracting to the Teachings. May they all become soon confirmed believers, and arise in their turn to carry forward the Message.Yours ever in His service,H. RabbáníWishing you all success in your notable and historic task, Your true brother,Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->14 December 1937 [Brazil] Dear Miss Holsapple,The copies of the Spanish version of the <q class=''>“Kitáb-i-Íqán”</q> which you have sent the Guardian have duly reached him, and he is indeed most pleased and grateful to know that this important publication is at last ready, and is available in sufficient quantity for teaching purposes throughout Spanish-speaking countries. This book is the more welcome and timely in view of the teaching campaign which is now being organized and efficiently conducted in South America, and it is hoped that its circulation will result in awakening widespread and intense interest in the Cause among all sections of the population.The Guardian feels indescribably grateful to you for this historic service you have rendered the Faith by undertaking in person the translation of the book, and for having so kindly accepted to arrange <span data-pg='32'/> </span>for its publication. He will continue to pray for you at the Holy Shrines that you may be given strength and capacity to render still more outstanding services to the Cause in the years to come.Be confident, happy and persevere in your noble and historic efforts, Yours ever in His service,H. Rabbání <!-- New Letter -->10 January 1938 [Brazil] Dear Miss Holsapple,The Guardian wishes me to thank you for your letter dated December fifth, and also to acknowledge the receipt of the one hundred copies of the Spanish translation of the <q class=''>“Íqán”</q> which reached him safely a few weeks ago. The book is beautifully printed and is very handy, and is indeed a most timely publication, in view of the teaching activity which is being intensely carried out in various parts of South America, and which necessitates an increasing number of Bahá’í publications in Spanish.As regards your suggestion to issue a new Portuguese edition of the Esslemont book, following the newly-revised English edition, and also your idea of a monthly Bahá’í periodical in which articles both in Spanish and Portuguese might be printed, he would advise you to consult with the Inter — America Committee as to the advisability of taking any action in those matters at present. He is certain that through such co-operation you will be guided in fostering the very best and most vital interests of the Faith throughout South America.May I again assure you of his prayers for the success and continued extension of your activities in Brazil, and for the promotion of your work with the children. He hopes that the classes you are conducting will prove effective means for the confirmation of new souls in the Cause.With the season’s best greetings to you,Yours ever in His service,H.

He certainly wishes you to use this occasion to do some teaching work in these northern countries, where we have <span data-pg='33'/> </span>already had many travelling teachers and where the ground seems to have been well prepared for intensified teaching activity.Although the number of individual believers and centres in these regions is almost negligible, yet those few Bahá’ís we have are of exceptional devotion to the Cause, and have, in spite of their limited means and capacity, rendered services that are indeed historic.In Oslo there is a Bahá’í lady, a nurse, who has recently translated the book of Dr. Esslemont into Norwegian. Her address is:Strömsreien 20, Apt. 42, Oslo. In Stockholm: Miss A. Zetterlund, Kochsqatan 35, B.In Copenhagen: Miss Johanna Sörensen, Skorlaet 4, Hellerup bei Copenhagen.The Guardian would also advise you to visit the friends in England, and in Germany, if you happen to be there, although, as you may know, the friends in the latter country are under severe restrictions, the Faith having been suppressed there last summer. Nevertheless, there would be no objection to your meeting some of the friends privately.Wishing you and your husband every success in your trip, and with the Guardian’s deepest appreciation of your teaching services in Peru,Yours very sincerely,H. RabbáníMay the Beloved, Whose far-flung Faith you serve with such fidelity and zeal, inspire you to enrich the record of your services, and to extend the scope of your activities and accomplishments,Your true and grateful brother, ShoghiFrom a message dated 10 September 1938 to the National Spiritual Assembly of United States and Canada:The marked deterioration in world affairs, the steadily deepening gloom that envelops the storm-tossed peoples and nations of the Old World, invest the Seven Year Plan, now operating in both the North and South American continents, with a significance and urgency that cannot be overestimated.(from This Decisive Hour)From a message dated 25 December 1938 to the beloved of God and the handmaids of the Mercifulthroughout the United States and Canada:...they must, whenever they contemplate undertaking any specific mission in the countries of Latin America, endeavor, whenever feasible, to acquire a certain proficiency in the languages spoken by the inhabitants of those countries, and a knowledge of their customs, habits, and outlook. <q class=''>“The teachers going to those parts,”</q> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, referring in one of the Tablets of the Divine Plan to the Central American Republics, has written, <q class=''>“must also be familiar with the Spanish language.”</q> <span data-pg='34'/> </span>It should not, for a moment, be forgotten that Central and Southern America embrace no less than twenty independent nations, constituting approximately one-third of the entire number of the world’s sovereign states, and are destined to play an increasingly important part in the shaping of the world’s future destiny. With the world contracting into a neighborhood, and the fortunes of its races, nations and peoples becoming inextricably interwoven, the remoteness of these states of the Western Hemisphere is vanishing, and the latent possibilities in each of them are becoming increasingly apparent.It should be remembered that the carrying out of the Seven Year Plan involves, insofar as the teaching work is concerned, no more than the formation of at least one center in each of the Central and South American Republics. The hundredth anniversary of the birth of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh should witness, if the Plan already launched is to meet with success, the laying, in each of these countries, of a foundation, however rudimentary, on which the rising generation of the American believers may, in the opening years of the second century of the Bahá’í era, be able to build. Theirs will be the task, in the course of successive decades, to extend and reinforce those foundations, and to supply the necessary guidance, assistance, and encouragement that will enable the widely scattered groups of believers in those countries to establish independent and properly constituted local Assemblies, and thereby erect the framework of the Administrative Order of their Faith. The erection of such a framework is primarily the responsibility of those whom the community of the North American believers have converted to the Divine Message.The careful translation of such important Bahá’í writings as are related to the history, the teachings, or the Administrative Order of the Faith, and their wide and systematic dissemination, in vast quantities, and throughout as many of these Republics as possible, and in languages that are most suitable and needed, would appear to be the chief and most urgent measure to be taken simultaneously with the arrival of the pioneer workers in those fields. <q class=''>“Books and pamphlets,”</q> writes ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in one of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, <q class=''>“must be either translated or composed in the languages of these countries and islands, to be circulated in every part and in all directions.”</q> In countries where no objections can be raised by the civil authorities or any influential circles, this measure should be reinforced by the publication, in various organs of the Press, of carefully worded articles and letters, designed to impress upon the general public certain features of the stirring history of the Faith, and the range and character of its teachings.Every laborer in those fields, whether as traveling teacher or settler, should, I feel, make it his chief and constant concern to mix, in a friendly manner, with all sections of the population, irrespective of class, creed, nationality, or colour, to familiarize himself with their ideas, tastes, and habits, to study the approach best suited to them, to concentrate, patiently and tactfully, on a few who have shown marked capacity and receptivity, and to endeavor, with extreme kindness, to implant such love, zeal, and devotion in their hearts as to enable them to become in turn self-sufficient and independent promoters of the Faith in their respective localities....An effort, moreover, can and should be made, not only by representative Bahá’í bodies, but also by prospective teachers, as well as by other individual believers, deprived of the privilege of visiting those shores or of settling on that continent, to seize every opportunity that presents itself to make the acquaintance, and awaken the genuine interest, of such people who are either citizens of these countries, or are in any way connected with them, whatever be their interests or profession. Through the kindness shown them, or any literature which may be given them, or any connection which they may establish with them, the American believers can thereby sow such seeds in their hearts as might, in future circumstances, germinate and yield the most unexpected results. Care, however, should, at all times, be exercised, lest in their eagerness to further the international interests of the Faith they frustrate their purpose, and turn away, through any act that might be misconstrued as an attempt to proselytize and bring undue pressure upon them, those whom they wish to win over to their Cause. <span data-pg='35'/> </span>I would particularly direct my appeal to those American believers...who may find it possible, whatever be their calling or employment, whether as businessmen, school teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, office workers, and the like, to establish permanently their residence in such countries as may offer them a reasonable prospect of earning the means of livelihood.(from The Advent of Divine Justice)From a message dated 28 January 1939 to the National Spiritual Assembly of United States andCanada:Very soon we shall be entering the second half of the last decade of this, the first century of the Bahá’í Era. The five remaining years should essentially be consecrated to the imperative, the spiritual needs of the remaining Republics of both Central and South America, for whose entry into the fellowship of Bahá’u’lláh the Plan was primarily formulated. The prime requisite for the definite opening of what may come to be regarded as one of the most brilliant chapters in American Bahá’í history is the completion of the initial task which American Bahá’í pioneers must perform in the nine remaining states and provinces as yet unassociated with the organic structure of the Faith....Dearly-beloved friends! What better field than the vast virgin territories, so near at hand, and waiting to receive, at this very hour, their full share of the onrushing tide of Bahá’u’lláh’s redeeming grace? What theatre more befitting than these long-neglected nine remaining states and provinces in which the true heroism of the intrepid pioneers of His World Order can be displayed? There is no time to lose. There is no room left for vacillation. Multitudes hunger for the Bread of Life. The stage is set. The firm and irrevocable Promise is given. God’s own Plan has been set in motion. It is gathering momentum with every passing day. The powers of heaven and earth mysteriously assist in its execution. Such an opportunity is irreplaceable. Let the doubter arise, and himself verify the truth of such assertions. To try, to persevere, is to ensure ultimate and complete victory.(from This Decisive Hour) <!-- New Letter -->13 March 1939 [Loulie Mathews, Mexico] Dear Bahá’í Sister,Your welcome communications of January 23rd and of February 9th, as well as the copy of the letter addressed to you by Mrs. Stewart regarding the Inter-America teaching campaign, have duly reached our beloved Guardian, and their contents read with feelings of utmost satisfaction.He has also received the copies of the printed translation of the prayers in Spanish, and wishes me to assure you, and through you the Inter-America Committee, of his thanks and gratitude, and to express his full satisfaction at the progress of your plans for the publication of Bahá’í literature in Spanish. The booklet of prayers is quite attractive, and indeed excellent in production, and the translation, it is hoped, is also of a high literary standard, and accurate in rendering. He trusts further translations are ready for printing, and that sufficient funds have been allotted and are available for this purpose.The Guardian was also most delighted to note that your meeting with the National Spiritual Assembly in California has been marked with such singular success, and that the members were all so responsive and generous to your suggestions, and to those offered by Mr. Mathews. He values beyond words the loving co-operation which he is so ably extending to you throughout your teaching travels, and will pray that your joint and self-sacrificing exertions in this field may continue to widen in range, and be crowned with ever-increasing success. <span data-pg='36'/> </span>As to the news of the wonderful and quite unexpected results so rapidly won by dearMrs. Stewart during her recent journey to Argentina and the adjoining countries, the Guardian believes that, in view of the unprecedented success accomplished by this able and distinguished teacher, and also in view of the warm response which the Message is receiving in these South American states, no effort should be spared in order to enable Mrs. Stewart to prolong her stay and to prepare the ground for the formation of a Spiritual Assembly in the near future.The Guardian also feels it would be an excellent idea for Mr. Pedro Espinosa, our dear Mexican believer, to attend the Convention this April, and whole-heartedly approves of the National Spiritual Assembly’s decision to extend to him such an invitation. His contact with the American believers, and in particular with the members of the National Spiritual Assembly, cannot but help in deepening his knowledge of the Cause, and intensifying his love and devotion to the Faith.Assuring you again of the Guardian’s prayers for your health and your continued confirmation in your services,Yours ever sincerely, H. RabbáníDear and precious co-worker:Your last letter of February 11 has also reached me, and I grieve to learn of the condition of dear Nils, for whom I will assuredly pray from the depth of my heart. I deeply sympathize with him and pray that he may be given the strength to withstand these trials and to persevere in his work of service to the Cause, which he has so ably and magnificently started. I am glad to hear that Mrs. Stewart has prolonged her stay and am replying to a letter I just received from her. As to your own dear self I am thrilled by the news you give me and by the manner in which you discharge your manifold and vital duties. I am so pleased to know that Mr. Mathews is so closely collaborating with you.

The Guardian views with approval your suggestion, that in consideration of the special social and political conditions prevailing there, it would be more advisable to engage the services of Bahá’í men teachers rather than of women, and particularly those men pioneers who have the widest experience in teaching, and the best possible qualifications.With reference to the organization of the newly-formed groups and Assemblies in Central and South America, and the proper administrative status they should be given at present: every locality in each one of these Latin countries should have its own study group, and this as a nucleus for the formation of an independent Assembly in the future. As the number of Local Assemblies increases within each state, a National Assembly for that state will be formed. In the mean time, the American National Spiritual Assembly, the National Teaching Committee and the Inter-America Committee are empowered to assist, stimulate and supervise the evolution of the existing groups, with the view of enabling them to develop into properly organized and effectively functioning Local Spiritual Assemblies. No combination of these Latin states, under the jurisdiction of one National Spiritual Assembly, can or should be effected. In the future, each state will have its separate National Assembly, exactly as is the case now with other national communities having a National Assembly...In closing, Shoghi Effendi wishes me to stress the all-importance of the teaching work in Central America. While the teaching campaign in South America should be continually and vigorously prosecuted, special attention, he feels, should be directed to Central America, aiming at the permanent establishment of at least one believer in each one of its republics, before the end of the present year. <span data-pg='38'/> </span>With the renewed expression of his abiding gratitude, and of his unbounded admiration for your invaluable services to the Cause, and with loving greetings,Yours most sincerely, H. RabbáníDear and prized co-worker:I am filled with joy and gratitude as I consider the phenomenal progress which your committee has achieved in recent months. Your share is outstanding and truly exemplary. The Central American campaign offers an unprecedented challenge and a glorious opportunity to the American believers. It is impossible to overestimate its urgency, its paramount importance. It is perhaps the most difficult stage in the inter-American teaching campaign to which the entire community is now solemnly committed. While the work in South America should not be allowed to fall into abeyance, attention should primarily be concentrated in the present year on the Central American republics. All that is required is the definite settlement of at least one believer in each of these republics. Everything else must be subordinated to the requirements of this prime objective. I feel sure that your great resourcefulness, intense zeal, and undoubted abilities and magnificent courage will all be consecrated to this supreme end, this historic enterprise.Affectionately, ShoghiMessage dated 26 May 1939 to the National Spiritual Assembly of United States and Canada:NEWLY LAUNCHED CENTRAL AMERICAN CAMPAIGN MARKS OFFICIAL INAUGURATION LONG-DEFERRED WORLD MISSION CONSTITUTING ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ́’S DISTINCTIVE LEGACY BAHÁ́’Í COMMUNITY NORTH AMERICA.

In many of its features, particularly the presence of our new Mexican believers, symbolizing the inter-American teaching mission inaugurated by the Seven Year Plan, it has been certainly a historic gathering of momentous and far-reaching significance. May the spirit engendered by this admirable convention continue to animate, sustain and guide all the attendants, and through them the entire community of the American believers, in the stupendous task they have been called upon to accomplish throughout this year.The Guardian is most delighted to know of the arrangements you have made with the National Spiritual Assembly to have five Spanish Bahá’í publications issued by September next, and will pray that this work may be carried out smoothly, efficiently and according to full schedule.In this connection, he wishes me to stress once again the paramount importance of speeding up by every means the steady penetration of the teaching campaign in the remaining Latin republics of Central America. A supreme and combined effort, he feels, should be exerted by all the teaching bodies concerned to open up, however tentatively, each of these remaining countries ere the termination of the present Bahá’í year, so that with this first step accomplished the teaching campaign may be systematically extended throughout South America, during the next and succeeding years.You may have already read the Guardian’s recent cable on the subject of the Central American teaching campaign, which he has characterized as marking the official inauguration of the world mission which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has summoned the American believers to undertake in His <q class=''>“Tablets of the Divine Plan”</q>. Considering, therefore, the vital significance of the present phase in the collective teaching activities of the American Bahá’í community, every believer should be made to realize the heavy burden of responsibility that has been placed upon his or her shoulder, and also to appreciate the incomparably glorious privilege, and the unique and indeed priceless honour that have been so richly bequeathed to him in the fulfilment of such a vast teaching mission.The Guardian is confidently looking forward to seeing your committee take such lead in this matter, and obtain such united and continued support from both the National Spiritual Assembly and the general body of the believers, as would enable it to steadily forge ahead in the immediate and pressing task of opening up the whole of Central America to the light of the Cause. <span data-pg='40'/> </span>May Bahá’u’lláh illumine your path, remove every obstacle in your way, and continue to sustain and strengthen you and your dear co-workers in the attainment of this supreme objective.Yours ever in His service, H. RabbáníDear and prized co-worker:Your letter of June 19 has also reached me, and I was so delighted and reassured that I could not refrain from cabling you and expressing my eagerness and appreciation. With a heart filled with gratitude, joy and expectation I long to receive from you the stirring news that the Central Republics will, ere the close of this present year, be definitely and permanently settled. Every issue, even the cause of teaching in South America, should be subordinated during this year to the urgent and paramount needs of Central America, the first, the most critical, significant and most difficult stage in the inter — American campaign which, under your immediate direction, is so gloriously unfolding. Redouble your noble and historic endeavours, and be ever happy, thankful and assured. Much love to Mr. Mathews.ShoghiFrom a message dated 28 July 1939 to the National Spiritual Assembly of United States and Canada:Their immediate task under the Seven Year Plan, the object of which is the establishment of a minimum of one Bahá’í centre in each of the Republics of Middle and South America, has now been gloriously ushered in through the settlement of one pioneer in most of the Central American Republics, and bids fair to be recognized by posterity as the original impulse imparted to an enterprise that will go round the world. That impulse must, as time goes by, communicate itself to the farthest extremities of Latin America, and must be reinforced, in every manner, by as many of the American believers as possible. The broader the basis of this campaign and the deeper its roots, the finer the flower into which it shall eventually blossom. That its call may be heeded, that its implications may be recognized and its potentialities progressively unfold is my earnest prayer, and the supreme longing of my heart.(from This Decisive Hour) <!-- New Letter -->29 July 1939 [to Louise Caswell, USA] Dear Bahá’í Sister,The Guardian has received your letter of the 28th June, and was inexpressibly rejoiced at the news of your projected teaching trip to Panama. He hopes now that the National Spiritual Assembly and the Inter-America Committee have chosen you to undertake this teaching mission, no obstacle will hinder you from carrying out your plan, and that by September next you will surely embark on your journey, fully determined to make this trip as successful and enduring in its results as possible.Your project to take a course in Spanish at the University of Panama, and also to live with a Spanish family while there, with the view of perfecting your knowledge of that language, Shoghi Effendi feels is most splendid, and he would urge you from now to make every effort to learn Spanish, so as to be able to speak it sufficiently well in order to start teaching once you reach Panama.A good knowledge of that language is indeed indispensable for all those pioneers who intend to teach either in Central or South America, and it should be the main concern of the teaching bodies in <span data-pg='41'/> </span>charge of the Central and South American teaching campaign to provide all such prospective pioneers with the fullest opportunity not only to acquire a perfect mastery of Spanish, but in addition to familiarize themselves, as thoroughly as possible, with the history, customs, and the social and religious background and traditions of the people in these Latin American countries. The Summer School, one of whose chief aims is to train and prepare the believers to become well-qualified and competent teachers, offers indeed good prospects of developing into a training ground for all prospective Central and South American Bahá’í pioneers, and it would be therefore most opportune if the Committees in charge of our three Summer Schools decide to start classes for the teaching of Spanish, and of any such subjects as would be helpful for teaching in Spanish-speaking countries.The Guardian, knowing how heavy the burden of your financial responsibilities is at present, particularly as your son will be soon entering the University of California, wishes me to assure you that he will specially and most fervently pray that your business affairs may be soon untangled and settled in a way that would be most satisfactory to you and most conducive to the furtherance of your teaching work in Panama.With the renewed expression of his abiding appreciation of your untiring services for the extension and consolidation of the Cause in Knoxville, and wishing you continued guidance and confirmation in your labours,Yours very sincerely, H. RabbáníDear and prized co-worker:You stand on the threshold of a great and historic mission, so high in rank, so weighty with responsibility, so arduous in nature, so rich in possibilities, so unique in its significance. Perseverance will enable you to reap an abundant harvest. I will specially, continually and ardently pray for you, and am eager to hear of the progress of your historic work. The Master is well pleased with you, watches over you and will bless richly your endeavours. Rest assured and be happy.Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->24 October 1939 [Philip Marangella, Cuba] Dear Mr. Marangella,Your delightful message dated August 10th was received and read with grateful appreciation by our beloved Guardian. He deeply regrets, however, that owing to present circumstances, and also due to the heavy pressure of work on him during the last few weeks, he could not answer you earlier.He felt so encouraged at the report of your splendid teaching achievements in Cuba during the last few months, and noted with special gratification the valuable contacts you have been able to establish with so many individuals of high and responsible position in Havana. His fervent hope is that such avenues of contact as you have been able to find will permit you, in the near future, to bring into the Faith people of capacity and spiritual understanding who, through the power of their wealth and social position, and first and foremost through their devotion to the Cause, and their enthusiasm to promote its truth, will contribute in their turn in further extending the scope and strengthening the foundations of the teaching work throughout that island. His prayers will be specially and most ardently <span data-pg='42'/> </span>offered to Bahá’u’lláh that He may richly bless your labours, and crown your efforts with complete success.The Guardian wishes me to seize this opportunity of extending to you and to Mrs. Marangella his heartfelt good wishes on the occasion of your marriage, and of assuring you also of his prayers that this union may prove a step toward more effective service on the part of you both to the Faith in Latin America.With his warmest good wishes and loving greetings to you both, Yours in His service,H.

He is delighted and deeply thankful that you should have offered yourself for pioneer service in that country, and has full hope that with the unfailing help and guidance of Bahá’u’lláh and your own persistent, vigorous and self-sacrificing efforts you will carry your mission to a successful conclusion.It pleased him to know of the opportunities you have had of delivering the Message to so many people while on your way to South America, and he trusts that these contacts will someday blossom and bear fruit for the growth and establishment of the Cause in these Latin American countries.Your meeting with dear Miss Holsapple and Mr. and Mrs. Worley in Brazil, and the news of recent Bahá’í translations into Portuguese undertaken and completed by the former, was also a source of deep gratification to the Guardian. He earnestly hopes that such individual efforts on behalf of our pioneers will be welcomed and encouraged by the Inter-America Committee, and result in further stimulating the advancement of the teaching work in these southern territories.The Guardian would advise that you consult the Inter-America Committee, and in particular our dear and distinguished sister Mrs. Stewart, whose experiences in the field of inter-American teaching stand truly unique, regarding the most suitable type of literature to be used by teachers in Central and South America. In general, however, he would recommend that Bahá’í teachings on the subject of world unity should be used, and special stress be laid on the principle of the oneness of mankind, which constitutes indeed the very core of the Message of Bahá’u’lláh.As regards your suggestion concerning the establishment of a summer school in Montevideo: Shoghi Effendi indeed welcomes your idea, and is delighted to know that in consultation with our first believer in Uruguay, Mr. Simon Rosenzweig, you have already started working out tentative plans in <span data-pg='43'/> </span>this connection. He will pray for the success of your endeavours, but would advise that before deciding on any definite scheme, you seek the considered view and obtain the full sanction of both the National Spiritual Assembly and the Inter-America Committee.With his renewed and most loving greetings,Yours in His service,H. RabbáníDear and valued co-worker:Your exemplary response to the teaching call addressed to the American believers has evoked profound feelings of admiration in my heart. I will specially pray for your success from the bottom of my heart, and am eager to learn of the progress of your ceaseless activities in such a distant field and under such difficult circumstances. The Master must indeed be well pleased with you.

Knowing as you certainly do of the glowing references made by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá regarding the spiritual future of that country, you should consider it your high and sacred privilege to be the first Bahá’í pioneers working in that land, and you should rest assured that Divine confirmations will strengthen and bless your efforts, and will enable you to attain your hearts’ highest desire in service to His Cause.The Guardian is glad to know that you are both endeavouring to perfect your knowledge of Spanish and would urge you to persevere in your efforts, so that you may acquire a good mastery of that language and thus be able to present and teach the Message in an effective manner.Also he views with great favour your plan of establishing contact with as many sections and classes of the population as possible, and hopes that you will equally succeed in attracting to the Faith individuals of high social position and influence, as well as those of lowly and humble origin who, no matter how limited in their capacity and influence, can nevertheless, once introduced into the Cause, render services of far-reaching value, outshining those which their fellow-believers of higher origin and of better social standing may be able to accomplish.Assuring you both of his prayers for the confirmation of your teaching services, and with renewed and affectionate greetings,Yours in His service,H.

You should, however, remain confident in the assurance that Bahá’u’lláh, Whose Word you have so nobly and so heroically arisen to promote, will strengthen and bless your efforts, and provide you with all the opportunities and means you require for the execution of your task.The Guardian regrets to hear that so far you have not been able to secure a suitable position, but hopes that soon you will obtain a job that will permit you to carry on your pioneer work independently of any financial assistance from the National Spiritual Assembly and the Inter-America Committee. The beginning, as in every undertaking, must be hard and difficult, particularly in such an environment which is entirely new to you. But you should persist, and confidently strive to overcome each and every obstacle in your way, and thus pave the way for the consolidation and further extension of your pioneer work.The plan you have in mind to enter school together with Mr. Eichenauer with the view of perfecting your knowledge of Spanish, and also of acquiring a better intellectual training, particularly along lines most suited to your teaching work in Latin America, meets with the Guardian’s whole — hearted approval. He wishes you both every success in your endeavours in this field. <span data-pg='46'/> </span>Assuring you also of his prayers for the confirmation of your teaching efforts, and for your own welfare and protection in these hard and trying times,Cordially yours, H.

Laden with the fruits garnered through wellnigh half a century of toilsome service to the Cause she so greatly loved, heedless of the warnings of age and ill health, and afire with the longing to worthily demonstrate her gratitude in her overwhelming awareness of the bounties of her Lord and Master, she set her face towards the southern outpost of the Faith in the New World, and laid down her life in such a spirit of consecration and self-sacrifice as has truly merited the crown of martyrdom.(from This Decisive Hour)From a message dated 24 April 1940 to the Convention of the United States and Canada:OVERJOYED ELATED DYNAMIC ENERGY INVINCIBLE VALOUR AMERICAN BELIEVERS IMPELLED THEM FAR OUTSTRIP GOAL FIXED THIRD YEAR SEVEN YEAR PLAN.

You have sown the seeds and, God willing, some day the harvest will be bountiful.With loving Bahá’í greetings,Dearly-beloved co-workers:Yours in His service, R. RabbáníThe work you have done, the sacrifices you have made, the historic mission you have initiated, are highly praiseworthy, meritorious and unforgettable. I will specially pray for you both that in whatever field you may labour in the days to come, Bahá’u’lláh may reinforce, guide and bless you and aid you to enrich the record of your pioneer services.Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->15 April 1941 [Louise Caswell, Cora Oliver, Panama] Dear Bahá’í Pioneers:Shoghi Effendi has instructed me to answer your letter to him of March 2nd.He was most happy to receive all your good news, as well as the enclosed photos. The range of your combined activities seems to hold very bright promise for a future harvest of Bahá’ís.You may be sure his ardent prayers are offered for your teaching work and for the confirmation of the souls newly attracted.The Guardian was pleased to learn that such a capable young person as Emerita Guevara has declared herself a believer, and he hopes she will be able to serve her fellow-countrymen as a Bahá’í. <span data-pg='56'/> </span>In these dark days such bright reports of the work of the Faith in far-off lands greatly cheer Shoghi Effendi as well as the Bahá’ís of other, less fortunate, parts of the globe.Assuring you both of his ardent prayers for your work, With Bahá’í love,Yours in His service, R.

Not only would you be near Wilfred and able to help him in every way, but also your mature experience as a Bahá’í, and, as you point out, a Bahá’í woman from a freer, more progressive country, would enable you to teach and attract the souls and fulfil a function which no one else is able to at present in that country.Shoghi Effendi was very sorry to learn that ... has as yet not entirely adjusted his sensitive nature to his life. You may be sure the Guardian’s prayers are often offered on his behalf. He hopes ... will let nothing discourage him and not allow himself to be disturbed by the trials concomitant to any important undertaking in the service of the Cause. All these things are secondary; the main point is that he has the great privilege of pioneering in the Faith at such an important hour in human history.The Guardian feels it is better for you not to call on .... All efforts to recall him to his old self have proved fruitless, and now he must be left to the guidance of his own conscience and the mercy of God.The good news of the friends in Buenos Aires was most welcome, and Shoghi Effendi appreciated very much your visiting them as well as other centres on your route.Assuring you of his loving prayers both for yourself and your dear son, 57With Bahá’í greetings,I remain yours in His service,R.

Your knowledge of Spanish, your knowledge of the teachings, and your great devotion to the Cause, all fit you for this all-important task, and Shoghi Effendi hopes you will devote yourself to the work in these countries of such vital importance at present. He will pray that every obstacle be removed from your path to enable you to accomplish this great service.He was pleased to hear that Mr. Bishop is feeling better and is helping you in your devoted efforts for the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.The spread of the Cause in countries of such mixed population and wide range of social development-and often lack of development-must naturally engender many delicate problems. But the Cause is so great that these momentary difficulties are soon lost in the workings of its benign and unifying powers.The Guardian hopes that you will keep in touch with him and give him the good news of your activities.Assuring you of his prayers for you and Mr. Bishop, as well as your mother, and with loving Bahá’í greetings, I remainYours in His service, R.

He welcomes you as his Bahá’í co-worker, in this wonderful Faith which serves all mankind, and he hopes that you, together with your brother, will render the Cause great services in this newly opened country of Argentina.The work done by dear Philip Sprague in that country will never be forgotten. The reports he has sent to the Guardian of the Bahá’ís of Buenos Aires, their work and their great devotion to the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, have been a source of genuine comfort to his heart in these dark days. He rejoices with you all at the bright prospect of the spread and increase of the Faith in that city and country, and you may be sure his loving prayers and thoughts are very often with you all.He deeply appreciates the loving spirit which impelled the friends of that city to visit the grave of Mrs. Maxwell. The devotion to the Cause of God which inspired her whole life was truly exemplary, and he feels sure that her spirit must be an inspiration to you all.The Bahá’í youth, as well as all the believers, must at all times conduct their activities in an atmosphere so truly Bahá’í and non-political in every way that their government could have no reason to doubt for a moment the motives of the Faith or the loyalty of its various adherents in their respective countries.The unity of the believers, their spirituality and detachment from the storms now sweeping with such fury through the hearts of the majority of the world’s citizens, are their greatest protection and safeguard at this time.Shoghi Effendi will particularly pray for the work of the Bahá’í youth of that city-that they may grow to become outstanding servants of the Cause in that new and promising field: South America.Assuring you of his loving prayers for yourself and his hopes for your future services to the Faith, <span data-pg='59'/> </span>In with Bahá’í love,Yours in His service,R.

They have accepted the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh with both faith and understanding. They are united in their determination to establish it firmly, in all its beauty and purity, in Argentina. Such a spirit, he feels convinced, will attract the divine outpouring of the Holy Spirit and enable them to become one of the most outstanding new Bahá’í communities.Shoghi Effendi was very pleased to know that you all profited by the visit of Mr. Philip Sprague. He is a truly outstanding Bahá’í, and his profound devotion to the Faith is an example to all. The Guardian hopes he will again be able to visit Buenos Aires; in his letters he has shown his great admiration for you personally and for all the Argentine Bahá’ís.The Guardian was also very pleased to note that you were able to remove entirely any misapprehension as to the motives and purpose of the Bahá’í Faith from the minds of the police. The whole teaching of the Cause is so sane and well balanced that, unless grossly misrepresented, no one could possibly take exception to it. <span data-pg='60'/> </span>He wishes you to assure all the members of the Spiritual Assembly, as well as all the Bahá’ís of Buenos Aires, of his constant loving prayers for their happiness and their services to the Faith.

May He enable you to follow in the footsteps of that valiant soul, May Maxwell, whose dust reposes in your city, and whose association with your centre, through her self-sacrifice and death, is an eternal inspiration to all who labour in your promising country.Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->5 July 1941 [Marie Poghaharian, Argentina] Dear Bahá’í Sister:The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer your letter to him of May 27th.He was very happy to receive the good news of the progress of the Cause in Buenos Aires, and the effort that all the friends are making to increase the harmony of their Bahá’í community life and deepen their understanding of the teachings. No doubt very great responsibilities rest upon the shoulders of all the Bahá’ís at present-for they are the custodians of the teachings and order of Bahá’u’lláh. They will find themselves tested from within and without, but tests, like a storm that shakes a tree, only drive its roots deeper and make it more determined to live and grow.The Guardian feels confident that the friends of Buenos Aires will prove themselves to be one of the leading Bahá’í communities of that great continent. He cherishes great hopes for their future work, and he often prays for them.He was also very pleased to learn that you and your brother are so active in the work, and feels sure you will be able to render, both within the community and in the field of teaching, many valuable services to the Faith.He would advise you to make a thorough study of <q class=''>“The Dawn-Breakers”</q>, the narrative of Nabíl, as this is not only of historical importance but a profound source of inspiration, and should be greatly appreciated by the sensitive and warm-hearted Latin people of South America.Assuring you of his loving prayers, and with Bahá’í love,I remain yours in His service, 61Yours in His service,Dear and valued co-workers:With Bahá’í love, R.

This constitutes a landmark in the southward march of the Faith of God, and you andMrs. Ford should feel the most justifiable pride and feelings of triumph at this truly great achievement.The loving and ardent prayers of the Guardian will continue to be offered on your behalf and on behalf of the members of this precious new community and those who are not as yet declared believers.Shoghi Effendi was very pleased to note that both you and Mrs. Ford have been elected to the Spiritual Assembly. In this way you can assist the new Bahá’ís to understand and practise the administration through active participation with them in handling the affairs of the community.The spiritual and intellectual nature of Latin peoples should tend to make them very profound and excellent Bahá’ís. The Guardian has the highest hopes for their future services to the Cause of God and the important contributions they will make to its unfoldment and establishment.Assuring you of his profound appreciation for your services and his loving prayers for your future work,I wish to congratulate you most heartily on such a wonderful and glorious achievement.

And now the publication of the Finnish edition of the Esslemont book is yet another evidence of the transcending power of the Cause of God, and greatly rejoices the heart of the Guardian. He is profoundly grateful to you for this great service you have rendered the Faith.He has received about half of the consignment of books you had sent to him, and he would deeply appreciate your sending him some more if you can find any way of doing so. Books come safely at present from the United States, it is just a question of time.Regarding a new translation into Finnish: he feels that the <q class=''>“Gleanings”</q> would, indeed, be the best book at present to concentrate on, and if there is any way that the able translator you have in Finland can undertake this work, he strongly advises her to do so. He will pray that, in spite of the greatly increased difficulties now prevailing, due to the spread of the war northward, that this matter can be arranged by you.Also kindly convey his love and the assurance of his prayers to those believers there with whom you are in contact.Your own tireless and devoted labours for the Faith are a source of great joy and comfort to the Guardian’s heart. He was so happy to hear you had gone to Cuba to help the work there. The need for pioneers is so great, and your previous experience must enable you to be of great value in this all — important field.His prayers will often be with you, that God may guide your steps, confirm your work, and protect and bless you in every way.With Bahá’í love,Dear co-worker:Yours in His service, R.

He is happy to hear that he is a friend of the Cause and in sympathy with its aims and purpose. He will pray for you both, and that your marriage may be a blessed one.Your residence in Recife should enable you-as you yourself anticipate-to carry the teachings into yet another Brazilian city and thus add to the record of your untiring and fruitful labours in the service of the beloved Faith.From many sources Shoghi Effendi has heard testimonies of the friends as to the wonderful services you have rendered the Cause in South America.Also he deeply appreciates the translation work you have been able to do, and hopes you are in close touch with the Inter-America Committee so that they can consult with you about those works most needed in the Portuguese language, and aid you in every way.The way in which the Cause is spreading throughout Latin America is indeed a source of pride and happiness to the Guardian.

Your tireless services there have been richly rewarded, and you should feel very proud and happy.Your noble intention to continue in the pioneer field of South America by going to Guatemala meets with his entire approval, and he hopes your labours there will prove as successful as in Costa Rica. He trusts it will be possible for you to make the necessary arrangements with the Inter-America Committee to continue in the field of service.It would be very good if the Assembly of Costa Rica could register themselves officially.

It seems unbelievable they should have taken so long!He was very happy to at last hear from you directly. The news of the splendid services you have been rendering the Faith in Paraguay has reached him from many of the friends, and he most deeply appreciates your devotion and self-sacrifice.It is very hard indeed for you that, added to the rigours and difficulties of teaching the Cause, all alone, in a strange and difficult land, you should have had the worry and unhappiness of your mother’s condition to bear. But it is just such tests and afflictions as these which temper the souls of the believers and bless, with the bitter tears of a deep sacrifice, their work for the Cause of God.When one realizes how supremely important the South American teaching campaign is, it is not to be expected that it can be carried on without a degree of sacrifice on the part of the sponsors and pioneers greater than any they have hitherto been called upon to make. This sacrifice is their crown! How small their victory would be if it were not over bitter opposition!Therefore you should feel the greatest joy that God tested you and did not find you wanting.Shoghi Effendi was very relieved to hear, through the kindness of dear Philip Sprague, that you had arrived safely in New York, as the last news he had of you was that you were very ill and going to Buenos Aires. He trusts that you have fully recovered your health, and that after seeing your family and resting, if necessary, some time at home, you will again feel able to carry on your work in South America-a work which you seem to be richly endowed to execute with success and tact.When you write to the dear believers you were able to confirm in Paraguay, please convey to them the expression of the Guardian’s love and the assurance of his prayers on their behalf, that they may grow strong in the service of the Faith and build up a fine centre in their native land.

Upon their steadfastness, courage and devotion must depend, to an ever-increasing degree, the progress of the work not only in Argentina but nearby places.

Anyway he was delighted by all the good news you conveyed, and has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.You have, indeed, been very blessed and privileged in the work you have done these last years in Central America. The Guardian hopes that all this presages still greater services in the future. You are now well equipped with a knowledge of both the language and peoples of Central America, and this should aid you all your life in achieving ever greater victories for the Faith you love and which, already, has rewarded you by rich confirmations and blessings. <span data-pg='71'/> </span>The news you give, of the soundness, sincerity and devotion of the Bahá’ís in the various centres you visited on your recent trip, greatly cheered the Guardian. He hopes that this spring will witness the establishment of more Spiritual Assemblies, as they are of such supreme importance in fulfilling the Plan. Indeed, such united, organized, and active spiritual centres will be of the utmost importance to the work of the future — especially in view of the steadily worsening international situation.The Guardian assures you he will pray for your guidance and protection during these difficult times, and for the divine confirmations for your noble work.With Bahá’í love and greetings,Yours in the service of the Faith,R. RabbáníP.S. All the clippings you enclosed, as well as the translations of them and the photograph, were received. The Guardian was delighted by the excellent spirit in which the Faith is being presented to the public.Dear and valued co-worker:I was so pleased to receive your letter, for I long to keep in close and constant touch with the beloved pioneers who are rendering such great and historic services to the Cause. I feel proud of you all, am constantly praying on your behalf, admire your courage and constancy and cherish the brightest hopes for your future. Persevere, however great the obstacles ahead, however dark the coming days. Bahá’u’lláh is your Guide, your Sustainer, and Protector at all times and under all conditions.Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->9 March 1942 [Louise Caswell, Panama] Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your letter of December 8th has just been received, and the Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He was very sorry to hear that you were not able to prevent Peter from going into the Canadian Air Force. This must be a source of both sorrow and anxiety to you. However he is still very young, and God willing he will mature and come to have a more balanced view of things in the future.Your report of the work in Central America was most encouraging, and the Guardian was very happy to receive it. The rapidity with which the work of spreading the Faith is progressing is not only remarkable but an abiding tribute to the devotion, loyalty, and perseverance of the American Bahá’ís.With each passing day the challenge grows greater. The obstacles are more formidable now than when the Seven Year Plan was conceived. However this but makes each victory more precious, each sacrifice more worthy! <span data-pg='72'/> </span>No doubt also the tumultuous character of world events is opening the eyes of people as never before, and rousing many souls who were hitherto passive and indifferent, into active truth-seekers. It is these that will reward the efforts of the believers with an ever-increasing harvest.The Guardian was pleased to hear that you now have a suitable meeting-place in your home, and he hopes that the fine groundwork you have laid will give rise to a firm, active and mature Bahá’í community. Permanency is of the utmost importance in the teaching work in pioneer fields, for we can never tell what storms these young communities may have to weather by themselves in the future.He assures you that his most loving prayers will continue to be offered on your behalf, and for the success of your, and Mrs. Oliver’s noble work.He will also pray for the protection and guidance of your son.With warm Bahá’í greetings,R. RabbáníMay the Almighty bless, abundantly and continually, the remarkable work you are achieving in the service of His Faith, remove all obstacles, however formidable, from your path, and enable you to add to the laurels that you have admittedly won in His path,Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->28 March 1942 [to Edward and Carrie Kinney, USA] Dear Bahá’í Friends:Your most welcome letters of November 30th, from Mr. Kinney, and January 26th, fromMrs. Kinney, as well as your joint letter of February 17, enclosing the photograph of Pacora Blue Mountain, our dear Inca Bahá’í, have all been received, and the Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He was very happy to hear of the successful teaching work which Mr. Blue Mountain is carrying on. The conversion of the original inhabitants of North and South America to the Faith is a cause for great rejoicing, and will no doubt bring rich blessings in its wake.Those who teach, as well as those who become confirmed, in Latin American countries cannot be too careful, in these days of political strife and intrigue, to make clear the entirely non-political nature of the Bahá’í Cause, and the intention of its adherents to keep entirely aloof from political matters and controversies. Otherwise, through arousing strong antagonisms, we may find ourselves actively opposed or even banned.The Guardian wishes to add a word of explanation in connection with the statement you report in your letter: In the <q class=''>“Dispensation”</q>, page 58, it states that the Guardian is the permanent head of the International House of Justice. The Arabic words, used in the original text of the Will and Testament of the Master, mean <q class=''>“cannot be removed”</q>, which the Guardian feels is implied in the term <q class=''>“permanent”</q> used in the <q class=''>“Dispensation”</q>. He deprecates the believers wasting their time discussing these subjects, when there is so much important work to do in order to complete the Seven Year Plan, and he hopes you both will be able to aid in stimulating all concerned to greater, united, effort. <span data-pg='73'/> </span>New York is called the <q class=''>“City of the Covenant”</q> because of the Master’s statements on the Covenant made there. Such an honour and blessing should lead the believers of that city to strive to become examples of unity, zeal, and devotion, and to aspire to quicken, eventually, the entire spiritual life of that great metropolis.Concerning Mrs. Kinney’s request for a name for Irma Mariasche’s baby: the Guardian has inevitably refused such requests, as he cannot depart from a long-established principle, nor make any exceptions. However, he assures you of his loving prayers for the child.When the Guardian refers to any souls as pillars of the Faith, he does so in recognition of their services without implying any special function, and such a praise on his part should of course stimulate them to render even greater services in teaching the Cause and aiding it in every way possible.In closing, he wishes to assure you both of his loving prayers for all those whom you mentioned in your letters, and of his deep and affectionate gratitude for your staunch and tireless labours in the Holy Faith. He will often remember you in his prayers.With Bahá’í love, R. RabbáníDear and prized co-workers:You are often in my thoughts and prayers these days. The staunchness of your faith, your exemplary fidelity, your burning zeal, your magnificent services greatly contribute to the alleviation of the burden of cares that weigh upon me. I will continue to supplicate the Beloved, Whose Cause you are so nobly upholding, to protect, sustain, cheer and guide you, and aid you to win still greater victories for His invincible Faith.Your true and grateful brother, ShoghiFrom a message dated 25 April 1942 to the National Convention United States and Canada:VAST INTERCONTINENTAL TEACHING CAMPAIGN VISIBLY YIELDING FIRST-FRUITS EVERY REPUBLIC LATIN AMERICA.

We should view the Cause in the light of a perfect system, operating as yet through very imperfect instruments. Gradually, through the deepening of individual spiritual consciousness and the general change the world itself must undergo, the perfection of this divine system will become manifest and fully operative.All the news from the Americas-North and South-is good news these days, and this greatly heartens the Guardian. The formation of ten Latin American Assemblies is truly a great step forward, and one you can yourself take a personal pride in, as you aided its realization!The Guardian assures you, as well as your dear husband, of his continued loving prayers.

The Guardian has directed me to answer you on his behalf, and express his deep satisfaction with all you are, and have been, accomplishing.He was very pleased to see that your younger brother, Marshall, has been so stirred by your exploits that he has followed you to South America, and is actively aiding the work there. Young men such as yourselves, so surprisingly dedicated to a movement which the uninitiated might associate with mature people of a philosophical bent of mind, so free from the current dissipated habits of most young people, are in a position to capture the attention and respect of both young and old alike. This Cause, although it embraces with equal esteem people of all ages, has a special message and mission for the youth of your generation. It is their charter for their future, their hope, their guarantee of better days to come. Therefore the Guardian is especially happy that the young Bahá’ís are active in the pioneer work. He hopes your brother will feel the urge to go into pioneer work as you have.The formation of your first Spiritual Assembly in Honduras was a source of great joy to him, and he hopes you will do all in your power to strengthen it and help it to function smoothly. It is the nucleus of all community life, and requires often adjustment and sacrifice from all concerned, until they learn how to function according to the higher laws of Bahá’u’lláh.The Guardian found the publicity you had received very sympathetic in tone. If the South Americans have the courtesy, kindness, and warmth expressed in these papers, as well as the deep capacity for faith and steadfastness, so characteristic of the Latins, they should indeed make wonderful Bahá’ís.The Guardian would advise you to be very careful about associating with Orientals and preferably avoid them. They are sometimes connected with Covenant-breakers, whether they know it or not, such as one of those whom you name in your letter, who is the son-in-law of a well-known Covenant-breaker here.Assuring you of his most loving continued prayers on your behalf, and on behalf of your brother, With Bahá’í love,R. RabbáníP.S. The Guardian answered your last letter. He hopes by now his reply has safely reached you. <span data-pg='77'/> </span>Dear and valued co-worker:Your letters, as well as those received from the believers regarding your historic services and accomplishments, fill me with pride, joy and gratitude. I shall ever remember the great work you are achieving with feelings of unqualified admiration. My fervent and continued prayers surround and accompany you wherever you labour. Persevere, be happy and thankful for so great a privilege and for so fine and enduring a record of service to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh.Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->5 July 1942 [Marie Poghaharian, Argentina] Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your letter of May 31st has just been received, and taken a very short time on the way as you can see, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He was especially made happy by the news you conveyed of the harmony and love now prevailing in the Buenos Aires community. The great gift that Bahá’u’lláh has brought to the world is unity, and only by the intensity of the love of the believers for God, and for each other, can this unity be established.He has great hopes for the Latin American believers, because they are a people who, by inheritance and tradition, are warm-hearted, spiritual as well as intellectual, and form deep religious attachments. He feels sure that as you all grow in knowledge of the teachings of the Faith and, above all, practice its laws and principles, you will come to be a shining example of Bahá’í community life to other Latin American centres.Already the rôle of the Buenos Aires friends is increasing in importance; they are now able to aid nearby centres-like Montevideo-and establish new groups, as well as the translation work which they have aided and facilitated during the past two years.He was very happy to hear that you are now on the Assembly. This is both a great blessing for you, and will help you to grow in Bahá’í experience. He hopes you will do all in your power, together with your fellow-members, to preserve the happiness and harmony of the community’s life, and to spread the teachings and strengthen the institutions of the Faith in that city and in that land.Assuring you of his continued loving prayers on your behalf, and on behalf of your brother, and all the dear Buenos Aires friends,With Bahá’í love, R. Rabbání <span data-pg='78'/> </span>May the Almighty bless abundantly and continually the efforts you are so devotedly exerting for the promotion of our beloved Faith, and may He enable you to aid in consolidating the centre which the dear and valued friends in that city have now established.Your true brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->26 July 1942 [Carlos Porras, LSA of San José, Costa Rica] Dear Bahá’í Brother:Your letter of June 14th brought great joy to the heart of the Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.The progress which the Bahá’ís of Costa Rica have made during the past year is little short of astounding, and shows the deep receptivity the people of that country have to the new message of God which Bahá’u’lláh has proclaimed to the world. You must all indeed be both proud and grateful that you live in a land so tolerant of progress, and which enables you to establish the blessed institutions ordained by our Faith.The establishment of the new Spiritual Assembly of Punta Arenas is a great step forward, and the legal registration of the Cause and approval of the government marks a milestone in the progress of the Cause not only in Costa Rica but in Latin America.The more the Guardian receives news from the Central and South American republics, the more firmly he becomes convinced of the great capacity possessed by the peoples of Latin America. They are proving themselves to be both deeply spiritual and intellectual, and he cherishes the greatest hopes for their future development and their contributions to this glorious Faith of ours.How wonderful that in less than a hundred years the message that originated in the heart of Persia should have spread to the heart of Central America, and kindled such love and devotion and hope as now burns in the hearts of the new believers in that distant continent!The Guardian hopes that you will not only succeed in establishing further centres in your own native land, but that the activities of the Costa Rican Bahá’ís will spread to neighbouring countries and aid in the establishment of the Faith there.He sends you, and all your devoted co-workers, the expression of his warm and heartfelt love, and his high hopes for your further services in our beloved Faith.With Bahá’í greetings,Dear and valued co-workers:Yours in the service of the blessed Faith, R. RabbáníI am thrilled by the news conveyed by your most welcome letter, which is a striking testimony of the radiant spirit that so powerfully animates you in the service of our glorious Faith. Your Assembly, and indeed all the believers in Costa Rica, are often in my thoughts and prayers.

When you see the fruits which your labours have borne in relatively so short a time you have no right to feel discouraged or despondent, but, on the contrary, should be overjoyed and filled with assurance.The Guardian feels that, if your health permits, and the way opens for you to go, there is at present no more meritorious way of serving our beloved Cause than in the pioneer field, particularly in the Latin American countries. The magnitude and full implications of the work which you and your fellow pioneers are accomplishing is beyond your power to grasp at present, but in the future it will be seen in its true proportions, and your sacrifices and trials will seem to you utterly insignificant in comparison to the glorious development of the Faith which it was your privilege to help inaugurate.The Guardian will always be happy to hear from you, and he wants you to know his prayers are with you, and that he hopes you will go on to accomplish even greater work in the future than in the past.He will pray for the guidance and protection of the fine young believer, Mr. Fillon, whose article you enclosed in your letter.With Bahá’í love, R.

The radio broadcasts, the hopeful prospects of a future summer-school, the two new study groups in new centres, and the aid the Buenos Aires friends hope to extend to Paraguay-all these are the evidences of a deep spiritual vitality in the friends of Argentina, and should cause you and all of them keen happiness!The Guardian would be very happy to hear that you, or another friend, had gone to the aid of the little group left in Paraguay by dear Miss Cheney.

If they feel you should undertake such a trip, you have his full approval in this matter.He will certainly pray for the speedy improvement of your health, and that wherever you are you may render the Cause many noble services.He was happy to hear of the active devotion of your brother to the Faith, and wishes you to assure him, too, of his most loving prayers.With the help of Mrs. Collins, a very outstanding and devoted believer, he is sure the Cause will make ever greater progress in the great republic of the south, Argentina.With Bahá’í love and greetings,R.

Bahá’u’lláh has urged marriage upon all people as the natural and rightful way of life. He has also, however, placed strong emphasis on its spiritual nature, which, while in no way precluding a normal physical life, is the most essential aspect of marriage. That two people should live their lives in love and harmony is of far greater importance than that they should be consumed with passion for each other. The one is a great rock of strength on which to lean in time of need; the other a purely temporary thing which may at any time die out.He will pray for your true happiness and the solution of all your problems, as well as for the progress of the noble work you are carrying on in that land.With Bahá’í greetings, R.

Once the ground has been gained the second great task is not to lose it! This forms one of the heaviest obligations carried by the American believers: to see that they consolidate work already so laboriously, and often at the cost of great sacrifice on the part of the pioneer, initiated, and carry it forward to its first consummation, in other words a Spiritual Assembly.The Rio de Janeiro community should become one of the strongest Bahá’í groups in South America, and no doubt it will ever-increasingly be able to aid other struggling centres and establish new ones. <span data-pg='82'/> </span>The Guardian will supplicate in the Holy Shrines that the way may open for you, or someone else, to go to Paraguay.

If you can arrange to go to Magallanes he thinks it would be, indeed, a great service to the Cause during this last year of our first Bahá’í Century.You should never allow the many dark thoughts and dark forces in the world today to weigh on your mind or depress you.

Perhaps you could obtain from your creditors an extension of time in which to pay them off and thus pay less monthly.Even if you have made mistakes in the past you need not make them again, and instead of feeling depressed you should profit by experience and set yourself resolutely to manage your life more capably in the future.

He hopes that you will be able to kindle their loyalty and enthusiasm, and enable them to establish the Cause there on a permanent basis.The Guardian will certainly pray for your guidance, and that your work may be blessed and fruitful. He does not feel that you should allow yourself to get so discouraged, either with yourself or with others. When we see before us the ideal state of the believers, we naturally get discouraged with their present condition.

However, if the believers there have increased in number, he feels it would be highly meritorious for her to go and help the work in some South American Republic which needs pioneers to strengthen the Bahá’í teachings there. No doubt you can advise and help this young soul to do what is best.The way the Cause has leapt ahead, both in North and South America, this last year is truly inspiring and the Guardian is very proud of the American believers’ achievements and the steadfast devotion they are showing in the face of many difficulties.If you could manage to attend the 1944 Convention it would be a wonderful experience for you, and one you richly deserve after so many years of dedicated service to our beloved Faith.

The Latin races have always been distinguished by their intelligence and religious nature, and he hopes that the Cause all over the world will greatly benefit by this influx of South American believers who are so devoted to it, so spiritual and so enthusiastic.Unfortunately the Guardian will not be able to attend the Convention in 1944. His duties in Haifa are far too pressing for him to leave this country and journey so far away. But his thoughts will constantly be with the friends on that historic occasion, and he hopes that one, at least, of the Cuban believers will be able to attend the celebrations in Wilmette.These days he has a tremendous amount of work to do, as the Bahá’ís East and West are increasing their activities during this last year of our first century. Indeed the work they are achieving, in spite of the war, is truly remarkable and a testimony to the way God helps those who arise to serve His Cause. <span data-pg='92'/> </span>He will pray for you all in the Holy Shrines, and he wishes you to know that the wonderful way the Cause is developing in Cuba rejoices his heart, and raises in him great hopes for the future of the Faith in that country.With warm Bahá’í love,R.

The presence of these Latin American friends will be a great addition to that memorable occasion, and afford them an opportunity of seeing the first Western House of Worship and the portrait of the blessed Báb, as well as of meeting with their fellow — Bahá’ís in North America.

It is practically impossible for those who take part in these first stirrings of the world order of Bahá’u’lláh in new lands to properly estimate their value and place in history.He has been greatly overburdened with work these last few years, and that is why his correspondence-particularly during the months preceding the Centenary-has often had to wait upon more important matters. That is why he has not answered your letters earlier, particularly that in which you and Mr. Reindorp ask his advice about your marriage.He does not interfere in such intimate personal matters; but he sees no reason why you should not join your lives in service to the Faith, as long as you both desire to do so. Bahá’u’lláh has upheld <span data-pg='102'/> </span>marriage as a most sacred and praiseworthy institution, and surely there is no better or more beautiful bond that can unite the hearts of two people than a common love for God and His work.He will pray for your guidance and happiness and also for all the believers you mention in your letters.With the assurance of his best wishes for you both, and his loving greetings, R.

Otherwise he would have replied to your letters sooner. He wishes to thank you for the article on Chile, which has already been forwarded to the United States with the manuscript of <q class=''>“The Bahá’í World”</q> Volume IX, and also for the poem you enclosed in one of your letters.He does not want you to feel for a moment that you have failed; your presence in Magallanes at the end of our first Bahá’í Century meant that the light of the Faith had penetrated there, the first foundation been laid. Now an Assembly can be formed in the future based on your work.Also he does not want you to brood upon the past. The very nature of the bond binding believers together opens them to suffering and test and trial. The thing the friends must strive for most is unity-particularly in the new Centres of Central and South America. Love, an infinite degree of patience and forbearance, are necessary, and he feels sure that when you return to Santiago you will be of great help to the work there in these ways. The purpose of the Cause is to weave extremes together in the indestructible fabric of one common Faith. There is room for every type and every personality as long as the individual is sincere and firmly grounded in the fundamentals of the Cause.There are dark forces in the world today of despair and hatred and suspicion; the believers must, as the Master said, turn their backs on these and their faces to Him, confident of His help and protection.He wants to assure you that when circumstances permit you are most welcome to visit Haifa in the future. Also his loving and special prayers are offered on your behalf, for your work, your health and your happiness.With Bahá’í love,R. RabbáníP.S.

(Kindness of Mrs. Gayle Woolson)Dear Bahá’í Friends:Your true and grateful brother, ShoghiYour letter of July 15th written by Mrs. Woolson, and signed by all the Latin American believers and pioneers who attended the special conference arranged for the Central and South American representatives, July 9th to 16th, has been received by the beloved Guardian with great joy, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.It has been a source of great satisfaction to him that so many of the friends from Latin America were able to visit the Temple and to meet with their North American brothers and sisters. He feels sure that this association in the bonds of Bahá’í love will be productive of far-reaching results in the Western Hemisphere. It is the first time in Bahá’í history that so many duly appointed representatives of so many independent countries have gathered together, and it foreshadows the gatherings of the future, when the believers from the four corners of the globe will gather to discuss plans for the beloved Cause and to exchange ideas and suggestions.He hopes that in the Latin American countries the Faith will now spread at a rapid pace. He feels that there is a great future in the Cause ahead of these new and vital Central and South American republics, and he is most anxious that the native believers (of Spanish, Portuguese, Indian or mixed stock) should themselves be active in spreading the teachings as travellers, pioneers, administrators and teachers.He wishes to assure each and every one of you of his most loving and ardent prayers offered on your behalf in the Holy Shrines. He looks forward with longing to the day when he can greet you personally, and meantime asks you to convey his warm greetings to all the believers in your respective countries.With Bahá’í love, R.

The prizes won so painstakingly in both the North and South American continents must be preserved at all costs. A mighty impetus should, at however great a sacrifice, be lent to the multiplication of Bahá’í centres in Latin America, to the expansion of Bahá’í literature, to the translation of the Bahá’í sacred writings, to the proclamation of the verities of the Faith to the masses, to the strengthening of the bonds binding the newly-fledged communities to each other, and to the deepening of the spiritual life of their members.The task so marvellously initiated in the Latin Republics must be further consolidated ere the prosecutors of the world Plan bequeathed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá can embark on further stages, of still greater significance, in their world teaching Mission. <!-- New Letter -->10 October 1944 [Marcia Steward, Chile] APPROVE LOVING FERVENT PRAYERS. <!-- New Letter -->17 October 1944 [Argentina]Bahá’í Youth Committee of Buenos AiresDear Bahá’í Friends:(from This Decisive Hour)The beloved Guardian has received your warm letter of July 13th, together with the copy of the news letter you are publishing there, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He is pleased to see you have undertaken this work under the auspices of the Spiritual Assembly, and he wishes you every success in it. <span data-pg='106'/> </span>Your youth group has the opportunity of doing great work for the Cause there, and he urges you to persevere, study the teachings deeply, develop yourselves as public speakers (in so far as possible) and seek to attract other young people to your meetings.You may be sure his loving prayers will be offered for you all and for the progress of your devoted labours for the beloved Cause.With warm Bahá’í love and greetings,R.

He feels that the plan you and Mrs. Atwater have made of your remaining there and consolidating the excellent work she has so painstakingly accomplished, while she proceeds to Santiago to help the Assembly and strengthen the community, is very sound and he fully approves of it.He sees no objection to your joint plan of starting a bookstore (or stores) in Chile, providing you both feel that such an enterprise will be successful from a business point of view. He has always approved of the idea of pioneers becoming financially independent as far as possible and thus doing away with the impression of our having paid teachers.Also he heartily approves of your sister, Mrs. Thornton, joining you in Chile and serving thus in the South American field.You have entered a new phase of your Bahá’í life, and you may be sure that you will very often be remembered in his prayers in the Shrines, that Bahá’u’lláh may richly bless your efforts and guide you in your teaching work.He deeply values the devoted enthusiasm which animates both you and dear Mrs. Atwater. 108With warm Bahá’í greetings,R.

He would be immensely pleased if a firm and flourishing Assembly in Sucre could be developed in the near future. To have more than one administrative centre in a country is a great stimulus to the Faith, and leads a step further in the direction of these Latin republics eventually having their own National Spiritual Assemblies.He will certainly remember, in his prayers at the Holy Threshold, all those whom you have mentioned in your letters-it is a wonderful privilege for you pioneers to touch the receptive souls with the wand of faith and see them come alive in the Cause of God!The valiant and selfless services of dear John Stearns will not be forgotten, and the country is indeed blessed where a pioneer not only taught but remained and died still loving and glorifying his Faith. <span data-pg='110'/> </span>He assures you again of his loving prayers on your behalf, for the success of your devoted labours and the solution of your personal problems.

He was very pleased to see the faces of the dear Bahá’ís in Chile, and wishes you to convey his loving greetings to them all.He was very encouraged by all the good news conveyed in your letters, and would have answered you before but for the pressure of other work. He has been particularly pleased to hear that the united efforts of yourself, Mr. Lamb and Mr. Canales are now going to bear fruit in the form of an Assembly in Punta Arenas this year.Regarding the various points you raised in your letters:The Master said that Socrates-the Prince of the Grecian philosophers-received inspiration and instruction from the Hebrew Prophets; so we cannot say that Greece was devoid of contact with any Prophetic Source.Spiritual Assemblies are at present limited to nine members, but they can be enlarged in the future when circumstances require it.He does not intervene in purely local administrative matters, and it is for the Assembly to decide, if the absence of a member is prolonged, when they should hold an election to replace that person. The principle is that the nine members of the Spiritual Assembly should be reasonably available for meetings. If their absence from town is prolonged, someone else must fill the vacancy. This would naturally apply to you or anyone else.He feels that you should devote your energies primarily to teaching the Cause there in Chile. If you have time and inclination to do some outside writing, there is no objection. <span data-pg='112'/> </span>Also, as regards your desire to teach at some future date in Af<u>gh</u>ánistán: At present no one can foresee what conditions will be like in that and many other disturbed countries.

He has instructed me to answer both on his behalf, and I am forwarding herewith, in your care, his reply to the Assembly. I might add it was most thoughtful of you to enclose a translation, as it takes time to have it sent out here to a translator.The formation of this very important Assembly was a source of deep joy for him, and he feels that your persevering efforts, and those of Mrs. Oliver and all the other dear friends, have at last borne fruit in a worthy form; he hopes that the believers there will now go forward, with the greatest love and unity, to the accomplishment of the many tasks that lie ahead, such as increasing the community’s members, holding regular public meetings, teaching the Indians, etc.He very greatly appreciates your own constant labours in this small but significant republic, and assures you that he will continue to pray for you, that your efforts may be richly blessed and that you may be guided and strengthened in your devoted labours for the Faith.With Bahá’í love, R. RabbáníDear and valued co-worker:I am so glad to receive the splendid news conveyed by your letter, and I wish to assure you of my heartfelt and abiding appreciation of your constant, your devoted, and meritorious activities and services to our beloved Faith.

He has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.As you know it has been his ardent desire and hope for some years now to have a permanent centre of our glorious Faith established in that distant southernmost city of the world, and it has given him deep satisfaction to see that the faithful and unsparing efforts of such souls as Mrs. Steward,Mr. Lamb, and Mr. Canales have now been rewarded through the establishment of your Assembly.He hopes you will exert every effort to increase the number of believers in your city, so that the status of your Assembly will be permanently assured, and there will be no danger of its reverting to a group, through lack of sufficient members of the Faith being resident there.He was very pleased to see that the Bahá’ís of Chile are now going to concentrate their efforts on establishing an Assembly in Valparaiso; he fully approves of this plan, and hopes that by next April it will be completed and the third Chilean Assembly elected.From what he has heard, and judging by the great progress made by the Cause in your land, he hopes that it will soon become one of the leading members of the Bahá’í Cause in South America. You may be sure he will pray for its future in the Holy Shrines here in Haifa.He will also pray for each and every one of you, that God may guide you to serve His Faith and bless your devoted labours.With warm Bahá’í greetings, R.

The Faith needs friends as well as adherents, and you should always endeavour to attract the hearts of enlightened leaders to its teachings.The work done by dear John Stearns and other pioneers will never be forgotten; it is the Guardian’s ardent hope that from the ranks of the Latin American Bahá’ís pioneers will increasingly be found who will carry on the work in Central and South America among their own people.You may be sure his loving prayers will be offered for the success of your teaching work and for your guidance and protection in administering the affairs of the Cause there.With warm Bahá’í love,Yours in His service,R.

Your letter, I neglected to say, was dated August 9th.He is particularly happy to see that through the devoted labours of your Assembly the Message is now reaching the interior of the island. Cuba seems to be one of the leading Latin American countries enrolled under the banner of Bahá’u’lláh, and the Guardian cherishes the brightest hopes for its future.The publicity you are now receiving should bring the Cause before the public in a very favourable light, and he hopes you will win for it many new adherents, as well as many sympathizers and friends. It is very important to gain admirers of the Faith in prominent positions; the very fact that they do not claim to be Bahá’ís, but praise our teachings, is an excellent aid to the spread of the Cause.It will make you all happy to know that the Guardian is in excellent health, and has been able to rest more this summer after his very exhausting labours of the last few years in preparation for the Centenary.He assures you he will particularly remember the Havana Assembly and community in his prayers, and supplicate that on the excellent foundation you have laid may now arise many new Assemblies in that promising and friendly land.With Bahá’í love and greetings, R.

He hopes that the Cause will gradually spread among the Indian and other coloured members of the population, and thus demonstrate its truly universal and unbiased character.Regarding your question about the status of the Canal Zone and the peculiarities attendant upon its unique position; he feels this matter should be taken up by the American National Spiritual Assembly and then, if they wish, they can refer to him for any advice they may feel they need.You may be sure that he will pray that you may be guided and sustained in your devoted services to our beloved Faith-services which he greatly appreciates.Please convey to all the dear friends there his loving greetings.

The Guardian feels that you might point out to him that if he, as a Bahá’í, should insist on the right to support a certain political party whose platform he considers highly meritorious, he cannot very well deny the same degree of freedom to other believers; which would mean that within the ranks of a Faith whose primary objective is to unite all men as one great family under God, there would be Bahá’ís opposed to each other, vying with each other, and because of the very nature of politics, in violent disagreement with each other. Where then would be the example of harmony and unity for which the world is seeking?The Guardian will pray that ... may feel moved to sacrifice his political associations in order to fully support the divine system which is the remedy for all the ills of all the people in the world. He will also pray that your friend ... will feel moved to courageously espouse the Faith which she so admires.Your long and patient service in Peru has yielded a fruitful harvest, and the Guardian is very pleased over the report you have given him. He feels you are the best one to decide whether you should at present go home for a rest or not, as you can better judge if your temporary absence will seriously affect the work there or not. Meantime you may be sure he will pray for your continued success, guidance, and health.With warm Bahá’í love,R. RabbáníP.S.

He has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.The Universal Friendship Club which you have formed should be an excellent means of contacting progressive and thinking young people, and of gradually introducing them to the Bahá’í Teachings.There are so many movements in the world at present akin to various Bahá’í principles; indeed we can almost say that the principles of Bahá’u’lláh have been adopted by thinking people all over this planet. But what they do not realize, and what the Bahá’ís must therefore teach them, is that these principles, however perfect, will never be able to create a new society unless and until they are animated by the spirit which alone changes the hearts and characters of men, and that spirit is recognition of their Divine Origin in a Teacher sent from God; in other words, Bahá’u’lláh. When they recognize this, their hearts will change and a change of heart is what people need, not merely a change of intellectual outlook.He will pray that each one of you may be blessed in serving our beloved Faith, and that your club may be a means of attracting to it many sincere and devoted young people, like yourselves.With warm Bahá’í greetings and good wishes,R.

The double task already undertaken to enlarge the basis of the administrative structure of the Faith throughout the states and provinces of the North American continent and throughout Latin America, and to proclaim its truths and principles to the masses, should be relentlessly pursued, whilst the range of the operation of the Plan is being steadily enlarged. The administrative centres-foci at which the ever-expanding activities of a rising Order must converge-whose total number had not exceeded forty at the time of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to America, which at the inception of the first Seven Year Plan had risen to three hundred, and had swelled to over a thousand ere the expiry of the first Bahá’í century, should, through resolute effort and careful planning, be continually and speedily multiplied. Particular care should be constantly exercised to enable the groups scattered throughout the length and breadth of the states and provinces of the United States and Canada to attain Assembly status, and assume gradually the responsibilities and functions assigned to them in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. A corresponding increase in the number of such centres throughout both Central and South America should likewise be aimed at. Bolder measures designed to proclaim <span data-pg='142'/> </span>the verities of the Faith, its tenets, its claims and the purpose of its institutions, through the press and radio, through displays, exhibits and conferences, and through a wider dissemination of its literature in English, Spanish and Portuguese, as well as a more convincing presentation of its aims and teachings to the leaders of public opinion, should, moreover, be seriously and systematically undertaken not only in the mother country but also throughout the Latin Republics where the structural basis of Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic Order has already been established.Parallel with this double process of consolidation and construction particular attention should be devoted to the provision of the necessary means whereby the newly fledged centres in the Dominion of Canada and throughout the Republics of Latin America can be co-ordinated and further consolidated, through the formation of three National Spiritual Assemblies, designed to participate in time in the international elections that must precede the constitution of the First Universal House of Justice. The erection of these three pillars, raising to eleven the number of existing National Spiritual Assemblies, which are to be designated in future as Secondary Houses of Justice, and are designed to support the highest legislative body in the administrative hierarchy of the Faith, will, as the Divine Plan continues to unfold, be supplemented by the formation of similar bodies which, as they multiply, will, of necessity, broaden the basis, and reinforce the representative character, of the supreme elective Institution which, in conjunction with the institution of Guardianship, must direct and co-ordinate the activities of a world-encircling Faith. Through the formation of these National Spiritual Assemblies, as the implications of the Divine Plan gradually unfold in the coming years, the American Bahá’í Community will, in addition to its missionary activities throughout five continents and the islands of the seven seas, be contributing directly to the laying of the foundation, and hastening the formation, of an institution which, when constituted, will have consummated the threefold process involved in the erection of the total structure of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.... No less than fourteen Republics of Latin America were provided with such Assemblies. Active groups began to function in the remaining Republics, raising thereby the number of sovereign states within the pale of the Faith to sixty. Extension work in which the newly constituted Assemblies were vigorously participating was initiated. Two of the newly fledged Assemblies in Latin America, as well as a considerable number in the United States, were incorporated. An International School to provide training for Bahá’í teachers in Central and South America was founded. Considerable literature in Spanish and Portuguese was disseminated. Newspaper and radio publicity, teacher training courses, and Bahá’í Youth Symposiums were inaugurated. A distributing centre of Bahá’í literature for Latin America was established in the capital of Argentina, and the outposts of the Faith, in the Western Hemisphere, were pushed as far north as Anchorage in Alaska, in the vicinity of the Arctic Circle, and as far as the extremity of Chile, to Magallanes, the world’s southernmost city.(from This Decisive Hour) <!-- New Letter -->21 June 1946 [Louise Caswell, Panama] Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your letters of January 26th and June 9th have been received, as well as the photograph of the Assembly of Panama, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.He is delighted that the Cause is now firmly established there, the believers united and active, and the work in general progressing so well.He was also very happy to hear of the prospect of the possible formation of another Assembly in Concepción, and hopes you, and the other friends who are able, will assist and stimulate the work there. <span data-pg='143'/> </span>The sooner the work in Latin America is on a permanent foundation the better, as this will release veteran pioneers like yourself for work abroad.

Please assure Mrs. Guillon that the Guardian very deeply appreciates the generous-hearted devotion which has impelled her to make this offer of land.He feels, however, that the best thing to do would be to keep the property in her own name until the South American National Spiritual Assembly is formed, and then to seek their advice as to whether it is suitable for the purpose she desires. This body will be of great help in consolidating, coordinating and expanding the work of the Faith in Latin America’s southern countries, and it is only proper such matters should be referred to it-also the Cause in Chile by that time will be in a better position to receive and administer endowments.He rejoices over the great progress the Faith is making there, and assures you all of his loving prayers for your success.With Bahá’í greetings,R.

The people of the world are in such a disturbed state that we can see daily the evidences of their great need to hear of and accept the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh.He was pleased to hear recently from Madame de Cuéllar of the results of her successful teaching trip to Sucre; he appreciates very much the services of this devoted couple, and wishes you to please convey to her and Col. de Cuéllar his loving greetings.Your devoted and steadfast labours to promote the Faith are very deeply valued by the Guardian, and he assures you of his frequent prayers for the progress of the Cause there and for your dear self.With Bahá’í greetings,R. RabbáníHe wants particularly to assure you of his prayers on behalf of your dear brother’s soul and for your parents as well. <span data-pg='150'/> </span>May the Almighty bless continually your meritorious labours, aid you to extend the range of your activities, reinforce the foundation you have so devotedly laid, and win memorable victories for the institutions of His Faith,Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->29 July 1946 [Artemus Lamb, Chile] Dear Bahá’í Brother:Your letters dated February 4th, April 5th and June 11th have been received, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.He is very happy to know your dear sister is now happier, and more like her old self, and the dark thoughts she had have been dispelled. Covenant-breaking is truly a spiritual disease, and the whole viewpoint and attitude of a Covenant-breaker is so poisonous that the Master likened it to leprosy, and warned the friends to breathe the same air was dangerous. This should not be taken literally; He meant when you are close enough to breathe the same air you are close enough to contact their corrupting influence. Your sister should never imagine she, loyal and devoted, has become a <q class=''>“carrier”</q>!He is delighted with the news you convey of the work in Punta Arenas and in Chile in general. He feels you should, by all means, travel and assist both the Assemblies of Valparaiso and Santiago, as well as do all you can to aid in the establishment of a fourth Chilean Spiritual Assembly. Chile is certainly becoming outstanding!He is very pleased that you were able to visit the Convention, and, on returning to continue your important work in Chile, also visit so many other Bahá’í centres en route. The Latin American believers must work really hard now for their two future National Spiritual Assemblies. This is a great step forward, and they have a part, now, for the first time, in the Divine Plan.He assures you of his continued loving prayers on your behalf. With warmest greetings,R. RabbáníDear and valued co-worker:I am so pleased and grateful for your splendid achievements. I admire your devotion, zeal, and perseverance. The work you are achieving in Chile, and particularly in Punta Arenas, is truly historic and exemplary. Persevere in your great task, be happy, and rest assured that I will continue to pray for your success from the depths of my heart.Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->31 July 1946 [Marcia Steward, Costa Rica, Panama, Chile] 151Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your letters dated April 28th (written in conjunction with others) and June 19th have been received, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.The Guardian has never under any circumstances mentioned that your letters or your writing (which is quite legible) were a burden to him-so rest assured. His mail is, alas! very heavy and tiring, but he considers it essential to keep in contact with those who are doing pioneer work, like your dear self.It is certainly time, all over the world, for Bahá’ís to sever any affiliations they have with churches, political groups, etc., before being enrolled as believers; we must explain to the newcomers that it would be sheer hypocrisy on their part to remain in churches when they now believe Christ has returned with new laws in a new Dispensation!He feels you should postpone any plans about Spain for the time being, as your services are required in Latin America. The prospective formation of two National Assemblies for Latin America will necessitate a great deal of work during the next four years. The Latin believers must assume more and more responsibility for the proper conduct of their affairs, and also increase the number of their Spiritual Assemblies. You can help them greatly in this through uniting them and assisting them to become maturer Bahá’ís.He urges you to never have any dark thoughts, but just go ahead with your work confidently and happily.His loving prayers, you may be sure, surround you.With Bahá’í love,R. RabbáníP.S. Your letter of July 14th has just been received with the article for <q class=''>“Bahá’í World”</q>—which, with slight changes-he is sending on to Mr. Holley. He is sure it will be of great interest to the friends. As regards your diary: you can, if you so desire, will it to the Guardian, but it would be better if it were to go to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States of America. Another Bahá’í in the States has entrusted sealed documents to that body, not to be opened till after his death-or some period of time set by him-and these and any other things are quite safe in the hands of this well-organized National Assembly. It would be a pity to destroy the diary. The Guardian urges you to not be discouraged!May the Beloved bless continually your magnificent activities, sustain you, at all times, in your high endeavours, remove all obstacles from your path, and enable you to add fresh laurels to the crown you have already won in the service of His Faith, <!-- New Letter -->31 July 1946 [Chile]Mrs. Millicent B. de SchulderYour true and grateful brother, Shoghi <span data-pg='152'/> </span>Mr. Esteban Canales Dear Bahá’í Friends:Your letter of April 28th, written from Valparaiso with Mrs. Steward, has been received, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.He is delighted at the progress the Cause has made in Valparaiso, and he deeply appreciates the devoted labours which you have rendered it in that city.He hopes you will do all you can to consolidate the work there, and ensure the permanence of this new and important Assembly.You may be sure he will pray for you both in the Holy Shrines.

The most important thing of all is that the Latin believers should arise to shoulder their own work, produce their own teachers and administrators, and become capable of managing all their own affairs prior to the election of their National Assemblies. They seem now to be well on the right way to accomplishing these aims, and he is truly delighted with the progress made!He was, likewise, very encouraged to hear about the bright prospects for the summer school there, which he hopes will develop, in the near future, into a flourishing Bahá’í institution.There seems to be some error in the cable he sent the conference, and so I am enclosing a complete copy in case some of the sentences were omitted through the double transmission to Argentina from Haifa via Wilmette.He deeply appreciates all you and your fellow-Bahá’ís in Argentina are doing for the spread of the Cause there and throughout South America, as well as for the publishing work.You may be sure his loving prayers are with you. 1568 February 1947 [Shirley Warde, Argentina] Dear Bahá’í Sister:Dear and valued co-worker:With Bahá’í love, R.

No wonder you are so happy!He hopes you and your husband will continue to assist the teaching work in Sucre, and that you will, by all means, do some teaching work in Cochabamba-if that seems the next most receptive spot to the establishment of yet another Bahá’í group.You may be sure he will pray for dear Helen as well as for Sr. Ayala of Sucre, that they may both deepen in the Faith and render it many services.He also will pray for the success of the many undertakings of your dear husband and yourself, that Bahá’u’lláh may richly bless you.With warm love, R.

The Guardian hopes that the great inspiration which the friends attending this conference so strongly felt, will be carried into far-reaching action throughout that continent and in your own country.The news that you hope to have a second Assembly, in Quito, established this coming April, greatly rejoiced him, and he will pray that your labours there, and in other parts of Ecuador, will yield a rich harvest before 1951, when the South American National Spiritual Assembly is established. The Latin American friends have a great future to look forward to in the service of God and humanity!You may be sure he will pray for your Assembly and all its members, that Bahá’u’lláh may strengthen, guide, and bless you in your service to His Faith.With Bahá’í love, R.

The Cause in Chile is growing very rapidly, and the more it spreads the more the attention of the public will be fixed upon it. This imposes a heavy responsibility on the believers, as they must show forth such a spirit of love and unity among themselves as will attract the hearts of others and encourage them to enter the Faith in large numbers. We must always remember that the Teachings are perfect, and that the only reason more of our fellow men have not as yet embraced them is because we Bahá’ís, the world over, are ourselves not yet as selfless and radiant mirrors of Bahá’u’lláh’s Truth as we should and could be!

He has since heard that the whole ceremony attracted the interest of many people there and was very beautiful and dignified.You have the greatest bond that can unite two people-love for the Cause of God and for humanity, and this will enrich and cement your human union; as you cling to it, you will find your marriage blessed and fortified.The English believers are now becoming so numerous that one finds them serving the Faith in many parts of the world, and this pleases Shoghi Effendi very much, as they have much to contribute to our Bahá’í international community.He hopes you both-representatives of the Old and the New World-will perform many valuable services for the Cause in South America.He assures you he will pray for your success and for your happiness.With cordial good wishes to you both,R.

As he has been very occupied with various problems he felt you would understand his not replying to you immediately.The Buenos Aires Conference, so outstandingly successful, greatly pleased him. It certainly appears that the South American Bahá’ís are maturing rapidly, and fitting themselves to elect and maintain their own National Spiritual Assembly by the appointed time! All this is directly due to the dedicated, self-sacrificing services of the little band of North American pioneers, of which you are a most valuable part.The Cause in Chile seems to hold great promise, and he hopes that ere long it will have Assemblies scattered all over the country.

He feels, if the sad experience of your long illness is still too fresh in your mind, and your husband consents to the plan, you could do some teaching in Europe; but to leave him permanently, unless you both have tried again and feel your marriage-such a sacred bond-to be impossible, is not right. <span data-pg='165'/> </span>May the Beloved bless your meritorious efforts, reward you for your services to His Faith, and enable you to promote, at all times, the vital interests of its God-given institutions, <!-- New Letter -->16 April 1947 [Cora Oliver, Panama] ASSURE YOU LOVING PRAYERS. <!-- New Letter -->26 April 1947 [LSA La Paz, Bolivia]Your true brother, ShoghiDELIGHTED.

As a result of this expansion Spiritual Assemblies have been established in all the remaining Republics, the number of localities where Bahá’ís reside has been raised to over a hundred,  166almost double the number of localities in which the Faith had been introduced after the completion of the first Seven Year Plan, the number of Spiritual Assemblies has swelled to no less than thirty-seven, three of which have been duly incorporated, a notable impetus has been given to the activities of the distributing centres of Bahá’í literature in Argentina and Panama, historic conferences have been held in these two Republics, summer schools have been inaugurated in Argentina and Chile, and a tract of land has been presented as a site for the first Mas hr iqu’l-Ad hk ár in Latin America. No community since the inception of the hundred-year-old Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, not even the community of the Most Great Name in the North American continent, can boast of an evolution as rapid, a consolidation as sound, a multiplication of centres as swift, as those that have marked the birth and rise of the community of His followers in Latin America.The colossal tasks that now summon this Latin American Bahá’í community to a challenge, cannot but dwarf, if faithfully and promptly accomplished, the magnificent achievements that have immortalized the first decade of organized activity in Latin American Bahá’í history. The seed-sowing stage associated, in the main, with the labours and travels of that saintly soul, that star-servant of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, the incomparable Martha Root, links this decade of organized Bahá’í activity in Latin America with both the closing years of the Heroic Age of our Faith and the first fifteen years of the initial epoch of the Age we live in.The emergence of organized local communities in most of the Republics of Latin America will be for ever associated with the exploits that have shed such lustre on the first stage of the Divine Plan launched during the concluding years of that first epoch of the Formative Age of our Faith. The constitution of two independent duly elected National Spiritual Assemblies for the northern and southern zones of Latin America is now to be regarded as one of the most vital objectives of the second Seven Year Plan, whose inauguration synchronizes with the opening years of the second Bahá’í century, and which will be chiefly associated with the first phase of the second epoch of that Age. The emergence of these two National Assemblies, precursors of the institutions which must participate in the election, and contribute to the support, of the Universal House of Justice-the last crowning unit in the erection of the fabric of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh-must lead, gradually and uninterruptedly, and in the course of successive epochs of the Formative Age, to the constitution, in each of the Republics of Central and South America, of a properly elected, fully representative National Assembly, constituting thereby the last stage in the administrative evolution of that Faith throughout Latin America.In order that these future tasks may be carried out with dispatch, efficiency, harmony and in strict accordance with the administrative and spiritual principles of our Faith, the Latin American promoters of the present Seven Year Plan must focus their attention on the requirements of the present hour, close their ranks, reinforce the bonds of unity, of solidarity and of co-operation which unite them, rededicate themselves individually to the sacred, all-important and vital task of teaching, exert strenuous endeavours to deepen their knowledge of the history and fundamentals of their Faith, steep themselves in the spirit and the lore of its teachings and acquire special training for future pioneer activity throughout the length and breadth of the vast stretches of territory which extend from the confines of the Great Republic in the north to the Straits of Magellan in the south.The process of the steady multiplication of Spiritual Assemblies, already numbering thirty-seven, of groups whose number equals that of the Assemblies, and of the forty localities where isolated believers reside, must vigorously and uninterruptedly continue. The incorporation of well-grounded Spiritual Assemblies, following the example set by the Spiritual Assemblies of San José, Costa Rica, of Bogotá, Colombia, and of Asunción, Paraguay, as a preliminary to the incorporation of the future National Assemblies to be established in Latin America, must be strenuously and efficiently carried out. A beginning, however modest, should be made in the direction of establishing local funds, supported by native believers and designed to supplement the financial assistance extended by the parent community in North America, for the furtherance of pioneer activity, for the dissemination of Bahá’í literature, for <span data-pg='167'/> </span>the maintenance of local Bahá’í headquarters, for the gradual initiation of Bahá’í endowments, such as the land offered for a Bahá’í Temple in Chile, for the holding of conferences and of summer schools, for the creation of publicity agencies, and for the conduct and expansion of youth activities.Strong and sustained support should be given to the vitally needed and highly meritorious activities started by the native Latin American travelling teachers, particularly in the pioneer field, who, as the mighty task progresses, must increasingly bear the brunt of responsibility for the propagation of the Faith in their homelands. Full advantage should be taken of the facilities provided by the use of practical workshop courses in Latin American pioneering at the International School in Temerity Ranch. The two summer schools in Ezeiza and Santiago, as well as the one planned in Vera Cruz, should be utilized, not only as centres for the acquisition of Bahá’í learning, but as training grounds for pioneering among the Spanish — and Portuguese-speaking populations of all the Republics of Latin America. The regional conferences held in Buenos Aires and Panama should be followed by conferences of a similar character, at which a growing number of attendants from among the ranks of Latin American believers will assume an ever-increasing share of responsibility in the initiation and conduct of the affairs of a continually evolving community. A deliberate effort should be made to increase, through correspondence teaching and its extension to all the Spanish-speaking countries, the number of the active supporters of the Faith, so desperately needed in view of the vastness of the field, the mighty responsibilities that have been incurred, the smallness of the number of labourers, and the shortness of the time at their disposal.Other agencies, such as publicity and advertising in the press, the multiplication of accurate and improved radio scripts, the extension of teaching projects through regional teaching committees, visual education and the organization of public meetings, should be fully utilized to capture the attention, win the sympathy, and secure the active and unreserved support of a steadily increasing proportion of the population of the various Latin American Republics. The publishing activities of a constantly growing community should, likewise, be stimulated, their scope should be continually widened, the quality of Bahá’í publications, in Spanish, Portuguese and French, be improved, and their dissemination over a wide area be ensured. The two Spanish Bulletins, the one already published in Santiago and the other planned in San José, should, likewise, as an adjunct to Bahá’í publications, be developed and widely circulated. The contact established with the two hundred and forty-four Masonic Lodges should be reinforced by similar contacts with schools as well as business firms established throughout the various Republics, for the sole purpose of giving further publicity to the Faith, and winning ultimately fresh recruits to the strength of its followers.Particular attention, I feel, should, at this juncture, be directed to the various Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants of the Latin Republics, whom the Author of the Tablets of the Divine Plan has compared to the <q class=''>“ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula”</q>. <q class=''>“Attach great importance,”</q> is His admonition to the entire body of the believers in the United States and the Dominion of Canada, <q class=''>“to the indigenous population of America. For these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of Mu ammad, were like unto savages. When the light of Mu ammad shone forth in their midst, however, they became so radiant as to illumine the world. Likewise, these Indians, should they be educated and guided, there can be no doubt that they will become so illumined as to enlighten the whole world.”</q> The initial contact already established, in the concluding years of the first Bahá’í century, in obedience to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Mandate, with the Cherokee and Oneida Indians in North Carolina and Wisconsin, with the Patagonian, the Mexican and the Inca Indians, and the Mayans in Argentina, Mexico, Peru and Yucatán, respectively, should, as the Latin American Bahá’í communities gain in stature and strength, be consolidated and extended. A special effort should be exerted to secure the unqualified adherence of members of some of these tribes to the Faith, their subsequent election to its councils, and their unreserved support of the organized attempts that will have to be made in the future by the projected National Assemblies for the large-scale conversion of Indian races to the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. <span data-pg='168'/> </span>Nor should the peculiar position of the Republic of Panama be overlooked at the present stage in the development of the Faith in Latin America. <q class=''>“All the above countries,”</q> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, referring to the Central American Republics in one of the Tablets of His Divine Plan, has affirmed, <q class=''>“have importance, but especially the Republic of Panama, wherein the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans come together through the Panama Canal. It is a centre for travel and passage from America to other continents of the world, and in the future it will gain most great importance.”</q> <q class=''>“Likewise,”</q> He moreover has written, <q class=''>“ye must give great attention to the Republic of Panama, for in that point the Occident and the Orient find each other united through the Panama Canal, and it is also situated between the two great oceans. That place will become very important in the future. The teachings, once established there, will unite the East and the West, the North and the South.”</q>The manifold activities initiated since the launching of the first Seven Year Plan should, under no circumstances, be neglected or allowed to stagnate. The excellent publicity accorded the Faith, and the contact established with several leaders in that Republic should be followed up, systematically and with the greatest care, by the growing community within its confines. The initial contact with the Indians should be developed with assiduous care and unfailing patience. Furthermore, the strengthening of the bonds now being forged between the North American communities and their sister communities in Latin America must constitute, owing to the unique and central position occupied by that Republic, one of the chief objectives of the Panamanian believers, the progress of whose activities deserves to rank as one of the most notable chapters of recent Latin American Bahá’í history.Nor should the valuable and meritorious labours accomplished since the inception of the first Seven Year Plan in Punta Arenas de Magallanes, that far-off centre situated not only on the southern extremity of the Western Hemisphere, but constituting the southernmost outpost of the Faith in the whole world, be for a moment neglected in the course of the second stage in the development of the Divine Plan. The Assembly already constituted in that city, the remarkable radio publicity secured by the believers there, the assistance extended by them to the teaching work in other parts of Chile, should be regarded only as a prelude to the work of consolidation which must be indefatigably pursued. This work, if properly carried out, in conjunction with the activities associated with the Assemblies of Santiago, Valparaiso, and Viña del Mar, and the groups of Puerto Montt, Valdivia, Quilpué, Temuco, Sewell, Chorrillos, Mulchén and other smaller ones, as well as several isolated localities in that Republic, may well hasten the advent of the day when the Chilean followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh will have established the first independent National Spiritual Assembly to be formed by any single nation of Latin America.Whoever it may be among these Latin American communities who will eventually carry off the palm of victory, and win this immortal distinction, all without exception, and with equal zeal, must participate in this vast and collective enterprise which is engaging, in an ever-increasing measure, their attention and challenging their resources. Let them remember that the Author of their Faith has in His Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Mother-Book of His Revelation, singled out the company of the Presidents of their countries, together with those of the North American continent, and addressed them in terms that sharply contrast with the dire warnings and condemnatory words addressed directly and indirectly to the King of Prussia, the French and Austrian Emperors and the Sul án of Turkey, who, together with those Presidents, are the only sovereigns and rulers specifically mentioned by Him in that Book.<q class=''>“Hearken ye, O rulers of America and the Presidents of the Republics therein!”</q> is His summons sounded in that mighty Charter of the future world civilization, <q class=''>“unto that which the Dove is warbling on the Branch of Eternity: There is none other God but Me, the Ever-Abiding, the Forgiving, the All — Bountiful. Adorn ye the temple of dominion with the ornament of justice and of the fear of God, and its head with the crown of the remembrance of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Thus counselleth you He Who is the Dayspring of Names, as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Promised One hath appeared in this glorified Station, whereat all beings, both seen and unseen, have rejoiced. Take ye advantage of the Day of God. Verily, to meet Him is better for you than all that <span data-pg='169'/> </span>whereon the sun shineth, could ye but know it. O concourse of rulers! Give ear unto that which hath been raised from the Dayspring of Grandeur: Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Lord of Utterance, the All-Knowing. Bind ye the broken with the hands of justice, and crush the oppressor who flourisheth with the rod of the commandments of your Lord, the Ordainer, the All-Wise.”</q>Let them ponder the honour which the Author of the Revelation Himself has chosen to confer upon their countries, the obligations which that honour automatically brings in its wake, the opportunities it offers, the power it releases for the removal of all obstacles, however formidable, which may be encountered in their path, and the promise of guidance it implies for the attainment of the objectives alluded to in these memorable passages.To the eager, the warm-hearted, the spiritually-minded and staunch members of these Latin American Bahá’í communities who, among the followers of Bahá’u’lláh, already constitute the most considerable body of recruits from the ranks of the most deeply entrenched and powerful Church of Christendom; whose motherlands have been chosen as the scene of the earliest victories won by the prosecutors of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan; launched on their crusade for the spiritual conquest of the whole planet; the establishment of whose projected National Spiritual Assemblies must constitute a notable landmark in the second epoch of the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation; whose leading Spiritual Assemblies are now establishing direct contact with the World Centre of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the Holy Land; the photographs of whose elected representatives, at their chief centres, will soon adorn the walls of His Mansion at Bahjí; a few of whose members have already arisen to carry back the torch of Divine Guidance entrusted to their care to the peoples and races from which they have sprung-to this privileged, this youngest, this dynamic and highly promising member of the organic Bahá’í world community, I feel moved, before I dismiss this aspect of my theme, to direct this general appeal to rise to the heights of the glorious opportunity which destiny is unfolding before its members. Theirs is the opportunity, if they but seize it, to adorn the opening pages of the annals of the second Bahá’í century with a tale of deeds approaching in valour those with which their Persian brethren have illuminated the opening years of the first, and comparable with the exploits more recently achieved by their North American fellow-believers, and which have shed such lustre on the closing decade of that same century.(from Citadel of Faith) <!-- New Letter -->8 June 1947 [Josephine Kruka, Cuba] Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your letters (with snapshot clipping, and $ 2.00 enclosed) were received, dated May 5th (as well as that dated January 7th), and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.

So the sooner they become adept in managing the work in their own countries, sending out their own teachers, etc., the better for all concerned.He feels that the work in Central and South America is really reaching a point where, in the not too distant future, various numerically strong Latin American communities will be able to form independent National Spiritual Assemblies.

The work of the Cause is expanding so rapidly that he finds it increasingly difficult to keep up with his correspondence, and that is the only reason he has not answered you before.Regarding the various points you raised in your letters:He appreciates very much the painstaking efforts of Mr. Dufour in preparing such a manuscript as the one you sent him, and he hopes he will pass on this information to the National Spiritual Assembly.Regarding Lucha Padilla’s head of the Master: if she cares to send a copy of it to Haifa he would be very interested to see it.He feels that before any Assembly embarked on a project such as a school they should receive the advice and approval of the National Spiritual Assembly as such matters fall within its jurisdiction.The situation you outlined to him in one of your letters as existing at that time in San José he felt was regrettable, but due largely to the immaturity of the believers. Of course no Bahá’í should drink, and if he persists in it and refuses to make an effort to overcome it, the Assembly must take action. But in these newly established centres one must be very patient lest the whole group go to pieces because of too strong or sudden action.The book that you outlined to him he does not feel should be in any way associated with the Bahá’ís or our teachings, because we are advocating world federation, not local federations; if these come about as part of the process of world federation, well and good, but they are not our thesis.He will certainly pray for Emil Dufour and Cora Oliver, and especially for Gerardo Vega.In connection with the question you asked him about your marriage: he sees no objection to it, providing you will be able to go on serving the Cause-for this is the most important thing of all.He assures you of his loving prayers in the Holy Shrines for the success of your valuable labours and your happiness and welfare in every way.With warm Bahá’í love,R.

In the Latin American field, where the structural basis of a rising Administrative Order has already been established, through the formation of firmly grounded Assemblies in each of the Republics of Central and South America, the stage is being set for the erection of those institutions which are to be regarded as the harbingers of the secondary Houses of Justice which, in each of these Republics, must act as pillars, and assist in sustaining the weight, of the final unit designed to consummate the institutions of that Order.(from Citadel of Faith) <span data-pg='178'/> </span>Your letters to our beloved Guardian, dated October 3rd, have been received, and he is replying to you both at the same time as he is so very busy these days.He is very happy to see Mr. Hamaty is so active in supporting the work of our glorious Faith there in Cienfuegos, and he hopes that, through your united labours, and those of your fellow-believers there, you will soon have a strong Spiritual Assembly established in that city.To see believers from the East and West working for Bahá’u’lláh together way off in a city of the New World, both far from their own country, is truly inspiring, and must be an object lesson to the people of Cuba of Bahá’í love and solidarity.He assures you both of his ardent prayers for the success of your labours and the speedy fulfilment of your hopes.With warmest greetings,R.

Once one becomes a Bahá’í it seems indeed impossible that people can be so blind as not to see in this Cause the divine solution to the world’s problems and ills; and yet they are, alas, so blind and sleeping the sleep of the heedless!

He was also pleased to see the programme you sent him which covered so many important subjects and activities.He feels that certainly one of the prime duties of your committee is to train more of the Bahá’ís of Latin America to qualify as teachers of the Faith and lecturers. The contemplated trip of Mr. Canales should aid in this work, and also enable him to survey the field and discover ways and means of training Bahá’ís in local centres to teach efficiently. Another means of doing this is to hold special conferences and courses at summer schools to train and encourage teachers.Punta Arenas, as you know, is very dear to his heart, and he will ardently pray that the work there may go forward and the Cause be safeguarded in its development.No doubt the recent Bahá’í Congress held in Santiago has had a great effect in stimulating the work throughout South America, and he hopes that the summer school at Loncoche will carry this stimulus forward, and inspire enthusiasm and determination in all those who attend it.His ardent prayers for the success of your important work will be offered in the Holy Shrines and he thanks you all for your tireless and dedicated labours.Dear and valued co-workers:With Bahá’í greetings, R.

If you find that circumstances have reached a point where you cannot see a way of earning your living there, you should ask the National Spiritual Assembly’s advice and guidance before leaving, in the hope that a solution can be found.He will pray for the two sisters you mention, and for all the souls you are teaching and who are labouring for the Faith there.He will also particularly pray for you and Mr. Bode, and that Bahá’u’lláh may aid you to solve your problems and continue serving there where you have done so much good and are still needed.He hopes the work in Niteroy will go ahead well and produce results in the near future.

Now that more of the Latin believers are active and beginning to assume responsibilities, the work will go forward on a more permanent foundation, as pioneers from a foreign land can never take the place of native believers who must always constitute the bedrock of any future development of the Faith in their country.Please give his loving greetings to Madame de Cuéllar and all the friends there.He will pray in the Holy Shrines that your labours in Chile may be richly blessed, and that the friends in Lima will redouble their efforts and compensate for your departure.With loving greetings,R.

He feels, however, that the most important and, indeed, the primary objective of your Bahá’í Fund must be, at the present time, the support of the work of teaching the Faith. In a few short years you will have your own National Assembly, and it will have full responsibility for carrying on the work in that part of the world. What is needed is a very firm and far — flung basis to support this Assembly, and the only thing that can ensure this is the formation of many <span data-pg='182'/> </span>new Local Assemblies and groups. These in turn will augment your financial resources, and bring closer the day when your Temple can be built.He was greatly touched by the eagerness of the delegate from Colombia to have a Temple built there also! All this will come to pass, but first the foundation must be laid, and the foundation is the teaching work; the training of new souls to do this work and their circulation amidst the towns and villages of Latin America is of the utmost importance.The excellent teaching and publicity work which was carried on in conjunction with your congress pleased him very much. He feels sure it will assist the work in Chile greatly.His loving thoughts are very often with the Latin American believers, and he cherishes great hopes for their future. He feels they have a very distinguished career of service before them in the world-wide community of Bahá’u’lláh’s followers. Already they are winning the interest and admiration of their fellow-believers in distant lands!He assures you, one and all, of his loving prayers on your behalf and for the success of all your plans in the service of this glorious Faith.With loving Bahá’í greetings, R.

Although the work may seem to go ahead slowly, the friends must never lose heart. The foundation is essential, though it does not show above the ground; but once the building is erected the original dimensions become evident.

There you will be doing the Cause a much needed service, and, however much you accomplish in North America, it will be negligible compared to what you could do in South America, because of your long years of experience, your command of the language and your love for the people.He deeply appreciates the valuable work you have been doing in going over the translation of <q class=''>“God Passes By”</q>, as well as your constant and selfless labours for the Faith.Assure your dear mother of his loving prayers on both your and her behalf and that you may see your parents well and happy during any absence of yours from home.With warmest greetings,R.

He has been very busy, and very preoccupied (as you can well imagine) of late, and that has held up his correspondence.The success of the Santiago Congress greatly pleased him. It is wonderful to see the way the Cause goes ahead, and the believers succeed, when it appears as if the means for success was just not there! It clearly demonstrates the assistance of God, as promised to us.He was also very glad to hear of the wide publicity given the Faith in Punta Arenas, and that Miss Nicklin, a devoted soul, is going to establish herself there.He appreciates what you mean about Latins lacking, on the whole, the driving power and executive ability so needed, and such an outstanding trait of the North American. The same condition prevails throughout the East. Devotion and faith are there, but decisiveness and action are lacking. The only way to overcome this is to not only train, patiently and lovingly, the friends, but also try and get into the Faith people who do possess these qualities which are the exception, rather than the rule, in those parts.You should, he feels, not hold back about visiting centres where you see your efforts are rewarded by greater efficiency and co-ordination. He also feels that all three channels should be used to carry forward the work in Latin America: new pioneers, or visitors, should go there, whenever possible, the Latin believers must be intensively trained and encouraged to assume responsibility and the ones who are there, the North Americans, should by all means step out and set an example and pull the work forward!He hopes you and your dear wife will remain, at least for the time being, in Chile, and go on with the valuable work you have been doing-work he most deeply appreciates.His loving prayers are with you both,R. RabbáníP.S.

From the enclosed letter, to the National Teaching Committee for Central America, you will see what he feels about mentioning politics in the press. So I won’t go into the matter here again.The wonderful progress made in Costa Rica pleased him greatly, and the correspondence method of teaching is certainly proving itself of great use. He hopes it will be included as a teaching method everywhere.He feels that, although you could no doubt be of great help to the work in Italy, your services are much more needed in Latin America. Experience counts for a great deal, and just at this juncture the work there can ill spare any of the pioneers who have gained a knowledge of the conditions, the mentality of the people, and their <q class=''>“vulnerable points”</q> as exhaustively as you and some of the other early pioneers have gained.He feels that there is some truth in your thought of the bad influence of the New History Society. However, it is insignificant and should not have the origin of all the difficulties within the Bahá’í communities laid at its door! It is not that strong or that important! Much of the trouble within various Bahá’í communities in America is due to lack of maturity on the part of the individual believers and their joint function as a community. The vitality, however, of the faith and devotion of the American Bahá’ís is over and over again demonstrated by their victories-the one on their home teaching front being the latest. They need to deepen themselves more in the teachings, and to learn to be better examples to the world of what a Bahá’í is.The Guardian deeply values the spirit in which you serve, and is delighted over the results obtained. He will pray for your health and happiness.With Bahá’í love, R. Rabbání <span data-pg='188'/> </span>May the Almighty bless, protect, guide and reward you for your high endeavours and splendid services, aid you to proclaim continually the verities of His Faith, and contribute, in an ever-increasing measure, to the consolidation and multiplication of its institutions,Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->11 October 1948 [Brazil] Miss Dinah FrancaDear Bahá’í Sister:Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated May 17th, has taken a long time to reach him, as you can see; but he was very happy to receive it, and welcomes this opportunity of personally assuring you of his loving prayers for the success of your future services to our glorious Faith-a Faith which you have embraced with such joy and devotion.He was very pleased to hear you have been so active, have attended the Bahá’í congress for South America, and are constantly teaching the Cause to the people.He hopes that Bahia will become a strong centre of the Faith. Its beautiful name, so close to that of the Faith itself, must endear it to the hearts of the Brazilian believers, and encourage them to establish there a thriving Bahá’í Community.

The tragic thing is to have to witness mankind starving to death spiritually, but too blind, too perverse and misled, to take the Bread of Life offered by Bahá’u’lláh!

Gradually some strong souls arise who help the weak ones-as you and your dear husband are doing-and this consolidates the work and carries it forward to a more mature phase. He deeply appreciates the essential assistance you are giving La Paz and Sucre.He also is very pleased to hear your dear husband is translating <q class=''>“God Passes By”</q> and has finished the <q class=''>“Gleanings”</q>. This is a most valuable service to the Faith, and when these books are published they will greatly strengthen the faith, and deepen the understanding, of the Spanish-speaking believers.No one who has not reached the age of 21 can be elected to an Assembly or cast a vote. This may be one reason the Sucre Assembly was weak, was because it was improperly constituted.He will certainly pray in the Holy Shrines for the removal of your problems there in Bolivia, and for the success of your and your husband’s devoted and much-appreciated services.With Bahá’í love, R.

A college education, though advantageous, is not essential to success. Your own capacities are what must, in any case, carry you forward in life.

SALVADOR TORMO AWAITING REPORT LOVING APPRECIATION SERVICES ASSURE YOU PRAYERS REALIZATION HOPES.From a letter dated 18 August 1949 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States:No less attention, while this emergency period taxes, to an unprecendented degree, the combined resources of the envied trustees of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan, should be directed to the vast network of Bahá’í enterprises initiated throughout Latin America, where the work so nobly conceived, so diligently prosecuted, so conspicuously blessed, is rapidly nearing the first stage of its fruition. The flow of pioneers, so vital in all its aspects, and which has yielded such inestimable benefits at the early stages of this widely ramified enterprise, must, however urgent the other tasks already shouldered by an overburdened yet unfailingly protected community, be neither arrested nor slacken. The outpost of the newly born communities, established in the Straits of Magellan in the South, must be held with undiminished vigour and determination. The major task of ensuring the breadth and solidity of the foundations laid for the establishment of two national Bahá’í Assemblies, through the preservation of the present Assemblies, groups and isolated centres and the restoration of any of these vital centres now dissolved to their former status, must be scrupulously watched and constantly encouraged. The process of the dissemination of Bahá’í literature, of Bahá’í publication and translation must continue unabated, however much the sacrifice involved. The newly fledged institutions of teaching and regional committees, of summer schools and of Congresses, must be continually encouraged and increasingly supported by teachers as well as administrators, by pioneers from abroad as well as the native believers themselves. The highly salutary and spiritually beneficent experiment of encouraging a more active participation by these newly won supporters of the Faith in Latin America, and a greater assumption of administrative responsibility on their part, in the ever-expanding activities to be entrusted wholly to their care in the years to come, should be, in particular, developed, systematized and placed on a sure and unassailable foundation. Above all, the paramount duty of deepening the spiritual life of these newly fledged, these precious and highly esteemed co-workers, and of enlightening their minds regarding the essential verities enshrined in their Faith and its fundamental institutions, its history and genesis-the twin Covenants of Bahá’u’lláh and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the present Administrative Order, the Future World Order, the Laws of the Most Holy Book, the inseparable Institutions of the Guardianship and of the Universal House of Justice, the salient events of the Heroic and Formative Ages of the Faith, and its relationship with the Dispensations that have preceded it, its attitude towards the social and political organizations by which it is surrounded-must continue to constitute the most vital aspect of the great spiritual Crusade launched by the champions of the Faith from the shores of their native land among the peoples of their sister Republics in the South.(from Citadel of Faith) <!-- New Letter -->4 September 1949 [Bolivia] <span data-pg='201'/> </span>Madame Yvonne de Cuéllar Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your letter of July 24 has been received by our beloved Guardian and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf and to thank you for the photographs you enclosed of the Bahá’ís of Sucre.The establishment of an Assembly there, with new, and we hope firmer souls in it than those of last year, is a very concrete achievement on your part, and one he feels proud of.

To associate such things with the Cause directly would be only to ultimately injure its reputation and misrepresent it, as her powers-which are certainly very hard to find any logical explanation for-are not common to Bahá’ís, but rather a phenomenon seen among individuals (rarely) who are derived from all sorts of religious backgrounds.As to its being direct inspiration from Bahá’u’lláh, we certainly cannot say this. We can only be grateful that she has actually been able to help people who direly needed it. She herself being a devoted Bahá’í, there is no reason why she should not be known as one. But certainly it should in no way be connected with her healing powers.He appreciates the devoted, careful and loyal attitude of the Caracas Bahá’ís, who have certainly shown wisdom and understanding in meeting this situation, and he is glad you wrote to him about it.Please assure all the friends there of his loving prayers on their behalf.

The Bahá’ís, in spite of their self-sacrificing desire to give the last drop of their strength to serving the Cause, must guard against utterly depleting their forces and having breakdowns. For this can sometimes do more harm than good, because they are so bound up in the lives of others. It seems as if this is what happened to your friend. The Guardian hopes so, for of course Bahá’u’lláh has spoken very strongly against this shameful sexual aberration, as He has against adultery and immoral conduct in general. We must try and help the soul to overcome them, and your, the boy concerned, and his family’s attitude were truly fine in spirit and wise. The Guardian has prayed for all concerned and hopes the entire thing is past and over with for good.There is no doubt that there is vicarious atonement for others, and our sufferings sometimes can be in the nature of a sacrifice accepted for others. But where to draw the line is a mystery. If you take better care of your own health, and build up your reserves, it would certainly be better for you and for your work. Then your sensitive, yearning heart, although you may still often suffer for and with others, will be better able to withstand its trials, and you will not get so exhausted, which is certainly no asset to your work for the Cause.Your deep devotion touches him very much and he will pray that your heart’s desire, of always serving the Guardianship, may be granted.The great spiritual disease, which must be shunned utterly, is Covenant-breaking. But no doubt communities have their <q class=''>“ailments”</q>, so to speak, which are usually inharmony among the friends or the ever-active egos of some of the members. These conditions affect sensitive people like yourself, but the cure for them is to teach the friends to more deeply love and understand the Faith and to unitedly learn to apply the teachings to their individual and joint lives.With warmest love, R. RabbáníDear and valued co-worker:Your magnificent services to the Faith, rendered so devotedly, so energetically, under such difficult circumstances, and in such distant fields, deserve the highest praise, and will increasingly attract the blessings of Bahá’u’lláh, Who is well pleased with the quality of your achievements. I will continue to pray for your happiness, your success and the realization of every hope you cherish for the promotion of the Faith and the consolidation of its institutions in Latin America.

If only the friends could be made to realize that any administrative work is but one form of service, and a valuable experience, but not something to be clung to desperately at all costs, and certainly not something to feel hurt about when they are not re-elected or reappointed! The really greatest privilege the Cause can offer is the privilege of teaching, and this is open to every Bahá’í and a primary duty.He feels your committee is at last beginning to see the fruition of its long and truly remarkable labours in that the Latin friends are beginning to lift and carry their own load. This ensures the safety of the great work so soon to be entrusted to their hands.He was very pleased to see the economies effected by your committee, and he wishes to thank you personally for your services, and for continuing your important work as secretary.As he already cabled some time ago, he feels very strongly that there must be no falling off in the supply of teachers and pioneers, wherever needed in the Latin American field, at this important juncture when so soon these new communities will be launched on their own.

In this connection he has some advice to give you: You should stick carefully to facts and beware of putting any interpretations of facts into it. Your best sources are <q class=''>“Nabíl’s Narrative”</q> and Martha Root’s book on Ṭáhirih, as far as she is concerned, and, of course the general literature of our Faith. The Guardian advises you not to introduce into a series for public consumption anything obscure or mystical. By all means avoid the scene in the Presence of Bahá’u’lláh between Ṭáhirih and Quddús. Her separation from her husband and children, her teaching in Ba<u>gh</u>dád, her imprisonment and death, and her poems, make a beautiful and moving tale. He would not call her the first suffragette, for this certainly was strictly speaking no part of her concept.He does not feel it is necessary or desirable for him to make a recording for use in a broadcast. If you wish to use the Guardianship for one of your broadcasts, you should be very circumspect in your description of its function, explaining he is the authorized interpreter of the Bahá’í Scriptures, the life — head of the future International House of Justice, and the point of Unity to hold the believers together in one common purpose. Don’t go into the aspect of his being Divinely Guided by both Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb; this is too much for a public statement. To illustrate the importance of his function, cite what has been done during the last 27 years, in spreading the Cause, incorporating National and Local Assemblies, etc. Give no statistics, at any time, of Bahá’í membership locally or internationally. Names of countries and cities can be stressed.He regrets that the delay in receiving your letter should have made it impossible to send you any message in time for the printing of the Regional Bulletin.He will pray for the health of the members of your Committees and for your success in the noble work you are doing.With Bahá’í love,R.

This does not mean you should not make every effort to increase your numbers, to broadcast the Faith’s message to the people, and to keep the Cause before the eyes of the public. But to create love, unity and solidarity amongst the Bahá’ís of Chile should be considered one of your paramount tasks and your sacred privilege.He will be eagerly anticipating news of your achievements, and has confidence in your capacity to carry out a wonderful work for the Cause there during the coming months.Please thank dear Mrs. Steward for translating your letter. As no one here reads Spanish, or I should say, knows Spanish, it helps greatly when an English translation is given.Wishing you all every success and trusting your new Regional Bulletin will be of great help to your work, the Guardian sends you his loving greetings.Yours in His service,R.

It is a pity so many of the chapters of <q class=''>“Some Answered Questions”</q> are being left out of the Spanish edition. However, it is at present more important to get the book in the hands of Spanish — speaking people than to have it complete. Future editions can have added the other chapters.As regards your question:The Master uses this term <q class=''>“the Divine Reality is sanctified from singleness”</q> in order to forcibly impress us with the fact that the Godhead is unknowable and that to define It is impossible; we cannot contain It in such concepts as singleness and plurality which we apply to things we know and can experience.

It signifies the termination of the first Epoch in the rise and establishment of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in Central and South America-an Epoch that was ushered in on the morrow of the revelation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan through the pioneer services rendered by individual believers, among whom ranks as foremost that immortal and heroic soul, Martha Root, and which culminated with the successful prosecution of two successive historic campaigns initiated by the North American Bahá’í Community in pursuance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan.This second and momentous Epoch in the unfoldment of the Faith, now being entered upon, is signalized by the emergence of two newly established, independent, firmly-knit regional communities, embracing all the Republics of Central and South America, stretching from the borders of Mexico as far as the southern extremity of Chile, comprising no less than forty organized Local Assemblies, many of them already incorporated, every one of them animated by the spiritual verities of one common Faith, and all of them functioning in accordance with the principles of a vigorously operating, divinely appointed Administrative Order.This new phase in the development of an irresistibly advancing Faith presages, moreover, the formal association of these twin newly-emerged communities with their parent community in the North American continent in the prosecution of the Plan, conceived by the Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, among the Latin American races now awakening to the clarion call sounded by Him in His immortal Tablets. Though not enjoying the status and privileges conferred in that same Plan by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on the North American Bahá’í Community, yet, in view of the momentous and stirring summons issued by the Author of the Revelation in His Most Holy Book addressed to the Rulers of all the Republics of the Western Hemisphere, both of these communities may be said to have been invested with rights and duties which no community in any continent of the Eastern Hemisphere can claim to possess.This association, which will be formally inaugurated with the termination of the Second Seven Year Plan, and which is destined to reveal its potentialities in the course of the unfoldment of the Formative Age of the Faith, and particularly as a consequence of the formation of separate National Spiritual Assemblies in each of the Republics of Latin America, is a distinction which every adherent of the Faith, whether a native believer or a North American pioneer labouring in Central or South America, must constantly bear in mind. Its importance cannot be overestimated, nor can its full significance be assessed at the present hour.The consolidation of the existing Assemblies; the multiplication of groups; the steady development of the process of Bahá’í incorporation; the expansion of the all-important task of translating, publishing and disseminating Bahá’í literature in Spanish and Portuguese; the consolidation of the recently inaugurated national and local Funds; the strengthening of such institutions as Bahá’í National Committees, Summer Schools, Conventions and Regional Teaching Conferences; the acceleration of the highly meritorious work already commenced amongst the Indians <span data-pg='219'/> </span>in both Central and South America; the progressive proclamation of the verities of the Faith to all sections of the population of Latin America; above all the triple task of constantly deepening the spiritual life of the individual believer, of enriching his understanding of the spiritual and administrative principles of his Faith, and of cementing the unity of each local community-these stand out as the foremost responsibilities to be assumed during these two concluding years of the Second Seven Year Plan by the two newly formed National Spiritual Assemblies of Central and South America, in preparation for the launching of specially conceived, clearly defined plans, the initiation of which must mark the formal association of the Bahá’í Communities of Latin America with the National Bahá’í Communities in the United States and Canada, for the furtherance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s world-embracing, master Plan, now still in the embryonic stage of its development.Afire with the vision now unfolding itself before their eyes; conscious of the sacred responsibility which, as implied in the ringing words recorded in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, they must increasingly shoulder; fortified by the contemplation of the manner and rapidity with which their beloved Faith has struck its roots into the soil of their homelands; confident that the same mysterious and unconquerable Power that has watched over the operation, and ensured the consummation, of the specific Plans undertaken by various National Bahá’í Communities in recent years in both the East and the West will, as they prepare to launch their own collective enterprises in the years immediately ahead, vouchsafe to them Its sustaining grace and unfailing guidance, the members of these newly emerged Communities and, above all, their recently elected national representatives, must display, during this period of transition, a spirit of dedication, a tenacity of purpose, a willingness for self-sacrifice, that will surpass anything as yet exhibited in their past history, which will at once excite the envy and admiration of their older sister communities in all the continents of the globe, and enable them to acquire the spiritual potentialities that will assist them to take their honoured place in the ranks of those same Communities which, in various regions of the world, are collectively and energetically carrying out their own national campaigns in the service and for the glory of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh.That they may prove themselves worthy of the mission with which they will soon be formally invested; that they may never allow anything to interfere with the successful conclusion of this present preparatory phase of their historic task; that they may, through the quality of their devotion and the solidity of their achievements, rejoice the souls of the Concourse on high, and, above all, the Spirits of the Holy Báb, of Bahá’u’lláh, and of His beloved Son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; that they may contribute their share, as independent pillars, in sustaining the House, whose erection must mark the culmination of the establishment of the Administrative Order of their Faith, is the dearest wish of my heart, my constant hope and my ardent prayer.Your true brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->20 August 1950 [Rangvald Taetz, Brazil] Dear Bahá’í Brother:Your letter of June 28 reached our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He was most happy to learn you and your dear family are setting forth as pioneers for Montevideo, and he assures you his loving prayers will accompany you all the time. <span data-pg='220'/> </span>It is a great privilege and blessing to give one’s life to the service of this Holy Faith, especially at this hour when the need is so great and humanity so lost in spiritual darkness.

He would suggest prayers be offered on his behalf, and kindness be shown him as his conduct may change and may be due to an unbalanced nature rather than lack of faith in the Cause.The Guardian does not advise sending to the clergy copies of Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet to the Pope. It will not, he feels, convince them or awaken them, and might, on the contrary, stir up a great deal of antagonism.The Spiritual Assembly needs a quorum to function, and he urges the active members to try and persuade, lovingly and gently, the inactive ones to at least try to be present once a month at Assembly meetings. These are more essential than the Nineteen Day Feast.He sees no objection to Dr. Reid’s trying to continue his medical education abroad as long as it does not involve his leaving Punta Arenas for some time. By the time he leaves no doubt the Assembly will be better safeguarded.He will pray that the young lady Dr. Reid is interested in may accept the Faith. With Bahá’í love,R. RabbáníP.S.

The less we tie people down with such things the better.The American National Spiritual Assembly is the one to tell you after how long a period of inactivity a person’s name can be removed from the voting list.

Although they will still work in close collaboration and co-operation with their North American brethren, they will nevertheless find their burden of responsibility heavy and inescapable. It is their privilege, and a challenge to their characters and their devotion, to bear this new burden for the Faith with dignity and ability.He assures you all, and through you, your fellow-believers, that his ardent prayers are surrounding the Latin friends at this time; and his hopes for their future services are very high.With warm Bahá’í love, 231 <!-- New Letter -->22 March 1951 [LSA Tegucigalpa, Honduras] LOVING REMEMBRANCE SHRINES.16 April 1951To the Believers who were gathered together on March 25th in Kingston, JamaicaDear Bahá’í Friends:R.

This is the dawn of a new period in the unfoldment of the Cause of God in those lands, and although, no doubt, great tests will have to be met and overcome, great bounties will flow from on high also.He urges you all to work together for the spread of the Faith in the greatest love and unity.

Never has the outlook in this physical world been darker-with the shadow of perhaps another devastating conflict lengthening on the horizon-never the spiritual promise greater, for we see the Message of Bahá’u’lláh at last spreading all over the globe and planting its banner in the most distant countries.The opportunities for this new National Assembly to distinguish itself are therefore unique and its privilege priceless. He feels sure that the Latin American believers are going to demonstrate their readiness and capacity in such a way as to rejoice their fellow-Bahá’ís and the heart of the beloved Master.Like the United States and Canada, Latin America is the New World; it has the freshness of youth, the vigour and hope that youth possesses, and far from such ancient civilizations as those of Europe and Asia, with their interminable problems and grievances, it can undertake service to Bahá’u’lláh under more auspicious circumstances.He feels that your Assembly must, now at the very beginning of its work, devote its energy primarily to laying a sound and abiding foundation for the future. What does this imply? First and foremost establishing harmony, love and understanding amongst the Bahá’ís under its jurisdiction. When the friends are united in the love of God all problems can be solved and all work carried out with success. Personal problems, differences of race, nationality, origin, are dissolved in the crucible of Bahá’í brotherhood.Second, the teaching work: the Local Assemblies must be maintained and strengthened and the groups encouraged and protected, so that they may attain Assembly status as soon as possible; extension teaching work must also be undertaken and news of the existence of this Faith broadcast as much as possible.Third, the National Fund must be supported. The friends are, for the most part, not well-to-do, but they must realize that to give to the Fund, even in a small way, is the important thing, for it is a visible sign of their unity, their devotion, their desire to support the institutions which now represent them and belong to them.Fourth, your Assembly, in conjunction with that of South America, should devote particular attention to Bahá’í literature, as in the past the publication of really adequate translations and their dissemination has been often delayed and the books inferior in style. The Spanish-speaking Bahá’ís, becoming more numerous all the time, have a right to possess the literature of the Faith, so infinitely rich and inspiring, in their own tongue and well translated.The Guardian feels that during the coming few years your Assembly should not hesitate to lean on and consult the American Assembly. This in no way implies any weakness or inadequacy on your part, but is logical and organic. The American National Spiritual Assembly is one of the oldest in the Bahá’í world, it has gone through a lot, and consequently acquired an experience which cannot be obtained overnight. It also looks upon with pride, affection, and concern this beautiful daughter, so to speak, that it has brought into being. So your tie is a deep and natural one.   236Shoghi Effendi is also most anxious for the Message to reach the aboriginal inhabitants of the Americas. These people, for the most part downtrodden and ignorant, should receive from the Bahá’ís a special measure of love, and every effort be made to teach them. Their enrolment in the Faith will enrich them and us, and demonstrate our principle of the Oneness of Man far better than words or the wide conversion of the ruling races ever can.You may be sure that the Guardian will watch your work with the keenest interest, and surround you all with his loving prayers. <!-- New Letter -->11 July 1951 [Peru]National Spiritual Assemblyof the Bahá’ís of South AmericaDear Bahá’í Friends:With warm Bahá’í love, R. RabbáníYour letter of May 7, as well as the report of your first Convention and the minutes of your Assembly meeting, was received, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.His heart was filled with joy upon hearing of the success of the first Convention, and the sentiments expressed by your Assembly touched him deeply.He feels sure these two new National Bahá’í Bodies will greatly enrich the Bahá’í World Community, and accomplish noble feats in the service of Bahá’u’lláh.It is truly significant and inspiring to think that there are now four National Assemblies in the New World. It shows what vitality and promise these young nations have, and these characteristics will aid them in their Bahá’í service.Your Assembly is called upon to direct and safeguard the activities of our Faith in a truly vast and impressive area. But the very newness of the work, the room for spiritual conquest, the great need of the people, both aboriginal and European in origin, to hear of Bahá’u’lláh, is stimulating and challenging, and must call forth the best in every believer.Now that you have the privilege of building from the very beginning a new National Institution he feels special attention should be devoted to laying a deep and permanent foundation. The basis of all successful work in this Faith is that true brotherhood and unity should prevail amongst the believers. To promote unity and love amongst the friends is your first duty.Your second is undoubtedly the teaching work: to maintain and increase the existing Assemblies, develop the groups into new Assemblies, carry on extension teaching work, and bring the Cause before the public.Next to this comes support of the National Fund: all the believers must be encouraged to give financial help to the work; the Guardian realizes the friends are for the most part not well-to-do, but <span data-pg='237'/> </span>they must realize that the act of giving, however modest the sum, is a sign of unity and brings blessings to the united work all are undertaking for Bahá’u’lláh.Another important matter is to provide, in conjunction with the Central American National Assembly, adequate literature in good translations. Your Assembly will, naturally, have the added responsibility of Portuguese literature.The Guardian feels that special efforts must be made to enrol the primitive peoples of South America in the Cause. These souls, often so exploited and despised, deserve to hear of the Faith, and will become a great asset to it once their hearts are enlightened.Shoghi Effendi, as you know, attaches particular importance to Magallanes and to maintain the Assembly there is one of your responsibilities. It constitutes one of the distant outposts of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and represents a hard won trophy; it must be maintained at all costs.Your Assembly has not entered upon its stewardship empty-handed; on the contrary, unlike most National Bodies that have begun with nothing, so to speak, you are already enriched by having two Summer School properties under your jurisdiction: Loncoche and Ezeiza. He hopes these budding institutions will grow and flourish, and rejoice the hearts of the dear friends who so generously, in the beginning of the work in Latin America, established them for the glory of Bahá’u’lláh.It is truly inspiring to think that in relatively so short a time the Bahá’í Community of the United States should have given birth to these two beautiful daughter-Assemblies in the southern part of the New World. He, therefore, considers it wise and proper that for a few years your Assembly should keep in close touch with its <q class=''>“parent”</q>, who, like all parents, has had the benefit of long years of experience, and passed through many trials, and is therefore in a position to help you with advice and other support.For the first time in Bahá’í history we see constellations of National Bodies, so to speak, co — operating for the good of the Faith: in Africa, England is working closely with the National Spiritual Assemblies of Persia, Egypt, India and the United States. Upon the success of the close co-operation between your Assembly, that of Meso-America, and the United States during the coming years will depend, to a great extent, not only the speed of achievement in the future, but also plans to be undertaken by the National Bodies of the New World.All your work will be watched by the Guardian with the keenest interest, and his loving prayers be offered for your success and guidance.With warm Bahá’í love,R. RabbáníP.S. In answer to the question raised in your letter of June 5 as regards divorce: The Guardian says that if within a country divorce, because of affiliation of Church and State in this matter, is considered illegal, the Bahá’ís must be bound by this law. At the present time they must under no circumstances raise such matters with any Government in question. This means that it is not right for a believer to get a divorce outside of, say Colombia, and then remarry outside and return there, where his divorce would be illegal. <!-- New Letter -->15 July 1951 [NSA South America, Peru] Dear Bahá’í Brother: <span data-pg='238'/> </span>Enclosed please find a receipt for the loving and generous contribution forwarded by you (in your letter of May 2nd) for work on the Shrine of the Báb.The Guardian was much touched by this sum gathered on the historic occasion of the first South American Bahá’í Convention.

These people, finding the Bahá’ís sincerely lacking in either prejudice or that even worse attitude, condescension, might not only take interest in our Teachings, but also help us to reach their people in the proper way.It is a great mistake to believe that because people are illiterate or live primitive lives, they are lacking in either intelligence or sensibility. On the contrary, they may well look on us, with the evils of our civilization, with its moral corruption, its ruinous wars, its hypocrisy and conceit, as people who merit watching with both suspicion and contempt.

A receipt is enclosed herewith.The work on the glorious Shrine is proceeding. The stonework on the drum is being put in place. The Guardian is very hopeful that this work may continue uninterruptedly until the entire building is completed. <!-- New Letter -->30 June 1952 [Panama]Miss Elena Maria Marsella, Secretary National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ísof Central America Dear Bahá’í Sister:With loving Bahá’í greetings,Leroy Ioas Assistant SecretaryYour letters of July 10 and 20, September 3, 6 and 26, signed by the treasurer, Mr. J. V. Facey, October 6 (2), November 2, December 4, 27 and 31, 1951, and January 17, March 12 and 21 andMay 13, 1952 with their enclosures have been received, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. I am also enclosing a receipt for the sum sent by the friends for the work on the Shrine of the Báb.He was particularly pleased to see that members of your Assembly have been out travelling and contacting the friends in an effort to deepen their understanding of the workings of the administration and also their knowledge of the Faith in general. He feels that particularly at present in Latin America this intimate, loving and friendly approach will do more to further the work than anything else. Indeed, he would go so far as to advise your Assembly to avoid deluging the friends with circulars and unnecessary bulletins. You must always bear in mind the genuine difference between the peoples of the south and the peoples of the north; to use the same techniques as those adopted in the United States would be disastrous because the mentality and background of life are quite different. Much as the friends need administration, it must be brought to them in a palatable form, otherwise they will not be able to assimilate it and instead of consolidating the work you will find some of the believers become estranged from it.Whenever you feel at all discouraged you should remember how many years it took for the administration to get as well established as it is at present in North America. Problems repeat themselves and in the earlier stages in the U.S.A. the body of the believers was very loosely knit together, many of the friends were, as they now are in Latin America, affiliated with various more or less progressive cults from which they had come to the Faith and from which they could not be suddenly cut off; they had to be weaned and educated; the same thing you must now do. He urges you therefore to be very patient with the believers, and, through loving consultation and education, gradually insist that the old allegiances must give way to the great and all-satisfying bond they have now found with Bahá’u’lláh and His Faith. <span data-pg='263'/> </span>Mature teachers are the greatest need of the Faith everywhere, and no doubt in your area too. One wise and dedicated soul can so often give life to an inactive community, bring in new people and inspire to greater sacrifice. He hopes that whatever else you are able to do during the coming months, you will be able to keep in circulation a few really good Bahá’í teachers.He was delighted to receive the documents concerning your incorporation and feels this is a great step forward. He also appreciated having the minutes sent him in English.The various enclosures you forwarded were also appreciated.The recent Convention, though poorly attended, will no doubt have constructive repercussions in the lives of the believers and stimulate the growth of the communities. Your task is great, but the Bahá’ís are devoted and loyal and will, he feels sure, rise to ever greater heights as time goes by and they see the first-fruits of their labours being garnered. <span data-pg='264'/> </span>He assures you all, and through you the body of the friends, of his loving prayers on your behalf. With warm Bahá’í love,R. RabbáníP.S. Regarding the status of the Antilles: this is a matter which has to do with the plan to be undertaken in the next ten years and nothing to do at present with your Assembly’s plan.Dear and valued co-workers:Despite my intense occupation with the complex and numerous problems and grave issues that have confronted me, and absorbed my energies during recent months at the World Centre of the Faith— cares and anxieties that have unfortunately been responsible for the unavoidable delay in acknowledging your Assembly’s communications, I have nevertheless been following with unqualified admiration the progress of your activities, and have been deeply impressed by the perseverance, the fidelity, the devotion and single-mindedness which have characterized the services you have performed for the spread and consolidation of the Faith in Central America.The Two Year Plan you have spontaneously initiated, the vigour with which you are prosecuting it, the noble aim that has animated you ever since its adoption, the vigilance and thoroughness with which you endeavour to safeguard the interests of the nascent institutions of the Faith, and promote their welfare and consolidate their foundations, merit the highest praise. I feel truly grateful for the manner in which you face your manifold responsibilities and discharge your sacred and pressing duties. Though the issues confronting you are complex, numerous and urgent, the spirit of consecration you have consistently displayed since the assumption of your high office augurs well for the future expansion of your activities and the consummation of your allotted task.The year we have just entered, marking the closing stage of the Plan you have undertaken and the termination of the initial chapter in the life of your newly-emerged Assembly, must witness as it speeds to its end, a dedication to your collective task more compelling than any you have already demonstrated and a vigorous prosecution of the work on which you have embarked more splendid than any that has thus far distinguished your stewardship of His Faith. As the interval separating the birth of your Assembly from the assignment of a new mission that will enable you to participate in the World Crusade, destined to be launched by the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in both the East and the West, rapidly diminishes, your efforts must be correspondingly redoubled to arouse the entire community of the steadfast and devoted believers in every Republic of Central America and throughout the Greater Antilles, and enable them to appreciate the nature of their future task and the urgency of their present responsibilities, and to more completely dedicate themselves to the work in which they are now engaged-a work which should be regarded as a prelude to the enterprises they will be called upon to launch on the morrow of the world-wide celebrations of a steadily approaching Holy Year.For not only in the Western Hemisphere and its neighbouring Islands, but farther afield, amidst the numerous Islands and Dependencies of the South Pacific Ocean, must the community of the Most Great Name, now firmly rooted in Central America and the West Indies, demonstrate its capacity to establish, on solid foundations, the administrative structure of a world-embracing divinely conceived Order, and win its greatest victories. Nothing short of a rapid consolidation and a steady multiplication of the administrative centres so laboriously brought into being, and a fuller understanding, on the part of those who are summoned to participate in the great undertakings of the future, of the essential truths underlying their Faith, of the provisions of the Covenant that acts as its shield, and of the distinguishing features of the Order which is to be regarded as its stronghold, can empower them to launch, efficiently and confidently, the enterprises that must signalize the inauguration of their Mission beyond the confines of their native lands. <span data-pg='265'/> </span>That they may become increasingly aware of the requirements of the present hour; that they may lend increasing support to your Assembly in the discharge of your multitudinous duties; that your own Assembly may set a sublime example to the rank and file of the believers within your jurisdiction; and may, through its able conduct of its affairs, win the admiration of its sister communities throughout the Bahá’í world; and, through its inspiring leadership, attract a bountiful measure of the blessings of the One Who in His immortal Tablets anticipated the birth and rise of your community, is the dearest wish of my heart and the object of my ardent prayers. <!-- New Letter -->30 June 1952 [Peru]Mr. Manuel Vera, SecretaryNational Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ísof South America Dear Bahá’í Brother:Your true brother, ShoghiThe beloved Guardian has received your letters of May 17, August 3, September 3, October 29 and December 28, 1951, and January 5, January 11, February 16 and April 7, 1952, with enclosures, and has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.With the rapid growth of the Cause everywhere the Guardian finds it increasingly difficult to write frequently to various National Assemblies, hence the delay in answering your letters. However, he follows with keen interest the progress of the work, and feels that notable growth is evident in your region.He was particularly pleased to see the Plan you have formulated for the coming year; it seems a well-balanced one and possible of achievement-a most important point, as otherwise the friends become discouraged if they fail.Your recent Convention was also an obvious success and very well attended, all things considered.He was very happy to note the offer of dear Mr. and Mrs. Juan Casavelos to pioneer. They, and the dear Tormos, can no doubt add a great deal to the teaching work in their region during the coming months.The news of the incorporation of so many Local Assemblies was also very welcome; he hopes the Argentina ones will soon be added, and thus complete the circle for South America.The loving sympathy conveyed by your Assembly on the occasion of Mr. Maxwell’s passing was much appreciated, and he was glad to see the friends had held a meeting at the grave of dearMrs. Maxwell.He fully appreciates the fact that the believers are still somewhat attached to the different cults from which they have come; this is a problem which always faces the Faith in a new region; it existed a long time in America, and seems part of the growth of the Cause. He feels your Assembly can afford to be patient with the friends, while at the same time educating them into a deeper understanding of the <span data-pg='266'/> </span>Cause. As their awareness of the true significance of Bahá’u’lláh grows, they will become weaned from the old ideas and give full allegiance to His teachings.The Latin American communities are still on the threshold of their international Bahá’í life; he feels sure that they will rapidly grow into it. Compared with the length of time it took the North American, the British, and the French communities to grow up and spread, their growth is like lightning. As the Cause spreads all over the world its rate of acceleration increases, too, and new centres in Africa, in some mysterious way, have spiritual repercussions which aid in forming new centres everywhere.Please assure all the friends of his admiration for the progress they are making and of his loving prayers for the achievement of their new Plan.P.S.He assures you, and all the members of your Assembly, of his loving prayers. With Bahá’í love,R. RabbáníAs regards the question you asked: Now is not the time to present the Words of Bahá’u’lláh to the Rulers of America; when the Cause becomes stronger in Latin America you can reconsider the advisability of doing so.Dear and valued co-workers:The multitudinous activities and enterprises which have, in recent months, required my close and immediate attention, have, to my great regret, interfered with the prompt acknowledgement of the letters which various National Assemblies have addressed me in the course of this year so crowded with developments at once historic and far reaching in their significance. I have, however, followed with keen interest and ever deepening admiration the steady growth and consolidation of the nascent institutions of the Faith now rising so hopefully under your guidance throughout the South American Republics. The reports you have enclosed in your communications, the minutes of your Assembly, the copies of the Spanish Bulletins and other publications, the description of your annual Convention, above all the One Year Plan you have so splendidly formulated-all attest the vigour, the fidelity, the constancy and the devotion that have characterized your conduct of Bahá’í affairs since the emergence of your Assembly as an independent future pillar of the Universal House of Justice destined to crown the Administrative Edifice of a world-embracing Faith.The year that has just opened will be regarded by posterity as a prelude to the initiation of the large-scale enterprises destined to be launched by the Bahá’í communities throughout Latin America in foreign fields, as the rightful associates of the chief executors of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan, and on the morrow of the inauguration of a fate-laden fast approaching Holy Year.Whilst these budding, highly promising, swiftly consolidating communities brace themselves, individually as well as collectively, for active participation in the World Crusade, the launching of which will constitute the chief feature of the celebrations which are to signalize the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission, their members must, as the present year unfolds, display an extraordinary degree of consecration and intensify to an unprecedented extent, their activities, for the multiplication of Bahá’í centres, for the enrichment of their spiritual lives, for the consolidation of their newly-born institutions, for the dissemination of the literature of their Faith, for the incorporation of their newly formed Assemblies, for the forging of fresh links binding them to their spiritual brethren overseas, and for a fuller understanding of the aims and purposes of the Order within whose Orbit they function and of the Covenant under whose sheltering shadow they labour. <span data-pg='267'/> </span>The task awaiting them within as well as beyond the confines of the Western Hemisphere, as official participators in two of the four intercontinental conferences planned for the immediate future, is truly historic and too vast to be properly assessed at the present hour. Every day that passes must be prized and utilized to the fullest extent in preparation for the Mission which has to be undertaken, the responsibilities that are to be shouldered, and the collective contribution which is to be made towards the spread of the Cause of God by the Latin-American followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in various continents and islands of the globe.Time is running short. The hour is critical. The Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is entering upon a new, crucial and glorious stage in its unfoldment. Though young in years, though inexperienced as compared to its sister communities in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, though its material resources are strictly circumscribed, though the area in which it operates is vast and the obstacles standing in its way manifo1d, this community, now still standing on the threshold of its independent existence, must, in recognition of the bounties showered upon it from on high, and as a token of its gratitude for the privileges bestowed upon it, arise, and exhibit such a spirit of dedication as to astonish the entire Bahá’í world, and seek to repay, however inadequately, its debt to the spirit of an ever — vigilant Master, through the operation of Whose Will it was called into being and to Whose immortal Tablets, bequeathed in the evening of His life, it owes the impulse that has generated its very life.I will, in my hours of meditation and prayer, recall the spirit which has animated this community since its birth, will gratefully acknowledge the services it has already rendered, and will supplicate with added fervour for its further illumination, its continued expansion and the ultimate fruition of its destiny.Your true brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->5 July 1952 [LSA Punta Arenas, Chile] Dear Bahá’í Friends:The beloved Guardian thanks you for your loving expression of sympathy conveyed in your letter of June 3rd.It was, indeed, a great loss to have Mr. Maxwell pass on so far from his family, but he was greatly blessed by Bahá’u’lláh, and is no doubt happier now, in that other world, where he is freed from bodily illness and the cares of this life.He hopes your community will grow during the coming months and assures you of his prayers for your success.With Bahá’í love, R. Rabbání <span data-pg='268'/> </span>May the Almighty bless, guide and sustain you, and aid you to promote the best interests of His Faith,Your true brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->12 July 1952 [Honduras] Mrs. Louise Caswell Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your loving letter of June 25th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it in his behalf.The contribution which you have made to the Shrine of the Báb is deeply appreciated by him. Receipt is enclosed herewith.The Guardian values very highly indeed the wonderful work you have been doing these many years in Central America. Your perseverance in the pioneering field is an example which can well be followed by all those who aspire to the teaching service in the pioneer field.So far as service after the next convention is concerned, no doubt the All-America Teaching Conference to be held in Wilmette next Riḍván will open vast fields of service. You no doubt will be present at this conference, and take an active part in the discussions and plans, which will enable you to determine the best field for future services.The Guardian feels that these four Intercontinental Conferences will release great spiritual power and be of great assistance to everyone who participates.The work on the drum of the Shrine is proceeding rapidly now, and its beauty is more evident as the work progresses. The beloved Guardian is very hopeful that the work can continue on the Shrine uninterruptedly until both the drum and the dome have been finished. <!-- New Letter -->15 July 1952 [Argentina] The Bahá’ís of Buenos Aires Dear Bahá’í Friends:With warm Bahá’í greetings,Leroy Ioas Assistant SecretaryOur beloved Guardian has received your letter of May 11th a short time ago, and he deeply appreciates the sentiments you expressed in it. <span data-pg='269'/> </span>He has always taken a particular interest in the progress of the Cause of God in that city, as it was one of the first centres to be developed under the Second Seven Year Plan. He feels that, inevitably, it must play an important role in the unfoldment of the Faith in Latin America.Perhaps the single most necessary thing for the progress of the work of the Faith is unity and love amongst the friends; without these the group lacks the spiritual vitality to teach and confirm new souls. He hopes that the believers in that great city will labour as one soul in many bodies for the rapid spread of our beloved Faith. Great achievements lie before you, and his loving prayers will surround you, you may be sure.With Bahá’í love,R.

He is particularly pleased with your plans to strengthen the community in Caracas, with new Bahá’ís. He will pray for the success of your efforts; likewise he will pray that your goal of establishing the Faith in a new community will be achieved during the present year. Divine confirmations are descending in torrents upon those who arise to teach, and he sincerely hopes all of the friends will do their utmost to spread the Faith, so that they may become recipients of the blessings of the Holy Spirit. <span data-pg='270'/> </span>The work on the drum of the Shrine is going forward rapidly.

Punta Arenas is one of the most strategic and important areas in the world.

It should not be overlooked, however, that the most powerful and effective teaching medium that has been found so far is the fireside meeting, because in the fireside meeting, intimate personal questions can be answered, and the student find the spirit of the Faith more abundant there. <span data-pg='274'/> </span>The construction work on the drum of the Shrine is going forward quite rapidly.

The field of South America is so vast, and the workers so few, that he regrets when anyone finds it necessary to leave that most important area, in which the Cause is now beginning to develop.Now that the Ten Year Crusade has been so auspiciously launched, and the great responsibilities that have come to the Bahá’ís of South America have been revealed, it will be necessary for numerous pioneers to go into the South American field, and for those in South America to move to other areas to fulfil the high destiny to which the South American Bahá’ís are now called.The beloved Guardian greatly values the sacrificial service which you have rendered in Bolivia, and he certainly values your intention to continue your work in the translating field.If it becomes possible for you to return to the South American field, it will be a source of great happiness to the Guardian.He will pray that divine blessings may reach you in rich abundance, and enable you to carry forward your teaching work with great vigour.The Guardian appreciates very much the printed copy of the Constitution of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of South America, which you so kindly sent him.

It is like the path which the disciples of Christ had to follow. Through their sacrifices, they became severed from the things of the world, and achieved great spiritual insight, so that they forsook everything in order to serve at the feet of their Beloved. Now you are following in their footsteps. The Beloved of the hearts has opened your eyes and given you divine insight. You must be entirely freed from attachment to the things of the world and from concern over the persecutions which are heaped upon you by members of your family etc. In fact, these persecutions should be the means of deepening your faith.The Guardian values very highly your love and devotion to the Cause of God. He will pray for your spiritual development, and that divine confirmations may reach you at all times. He sincerely hopes you may be able to bring many others to the bourn of immortality. <span data-pg='281'/> </span>He sends his loving greetings to you.With warm Bahá’í love,Leroy IoasAssuring you of my loving prayers for your success and spiritual advancement, Your true brother,Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->3 June 1953 [Honduras] Mrs. Marcia Steward Atwater Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your letter of July 5, 1952, your postscript to that letter in the form of another letter, and one dated March 8, 1953 with pamphlet enclosed have all been received, and as the Guardian is extremely busy and worn out from the great deal of extra work he is doing in connection with the Conferences and the Ten Year Plan, I will make this answer very brief.He urges you to entirely forget all these small misunderstandings, to which he himself attaches no importance whatsoever, and to concentrate on consolidating the Faith in Honduras, and doing all you can in the teaching field.Now is the time for action and for confidence, and not for soul-searching and unnecessary suffering.The Guardian assures you that he will particularly pray for the Youth Group consisting of young people near college age whom you have been teaching in Guatemala, and he hopes some of these young people will decide to enter the path of service to Bahá’u’lláh.He assures you of his loving prayers, and he feels sure that the work in Central and South America is now going to go forward with a greater spiritual impetus than ever before.With Bahá’í greetings,R.

He is convinced that the friends will arise and translate their enthusiasm into action, because the keynote of the crusade must be action, action, action!The beloved Guardian has directed me to write your Assembly to amplify some of the aspects of his dynamic message.The settlement of these virgin areas is of such an emergency nature, that he feels pioneering in one of them takes precedence over every other type of Bahá’í service-whether it be in the teaching or administrative fields of the Faith.In the United States some 150 people have volunteered for pioneer service, and some of them already are preparing to leave for their posts. The Guardian has informed the United States National Assembly, that because of their being the chief executor of the Divine Plan of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for teaching throughout the world, their pioneers may be sent to any virgin area in the world, regardless of which National Spiritual Assembly it may be assigned to. If any of their pioneers wish to settle in any of the areas assigned to your Assembly, they will communicate with you.There are some general observations which the Guardian shares with you, and then some specific suggestions which are enumerated below:1. Every individual who offers to pioneer should be encouraged and assisted in every way possible by the National Assembly.2. Every application for pioneering must be expedited, and not allowed to drag in any way, either in the handling by the National Spiritual Assembly, or any committee working out the details for the National Spiritual Assembly.3. The National Assembly must make the settlement of their virgin areas the first order of their business. In other words, nothing is more important at this time, than settlement in the 131 virgin areas.4. More than two pioneers should not be sent to any one place, unless, of course, they are members of one family. In fact, what is wanted is to settle each area with Bahá’ís, and therefore, one Bahá’í will fulfil the initial task.The specific suggestions which the Guardian makes are:a. Areas close at hand and easy of settlement should be filled first. Then the areas more difficult, and finally, the difficult ones.b. Whenever a pioneer enters a new territory, a cable should be sent at once to the beloved Guardian, giving the name, place and any pertinent information. <span data-pg='283'/> </span>c. A report should be sent each month by your Assembly to the Secretary-General of the International Bahá’í Council, giving the progress of your teaching work in the virgin areas of the Plan, particularly the development of your plans for settling them. This does not mean your Assembly should correspond with the International Council concerning administrative matters, as all administrative matters should be handled in the usual manner, directly with the Guardian. It simply means that reports and data concerning the development of the Plan should be sent to the International Council for consolidation with other reports, for the Guardian.d. The Guardian feels the following areas should be easily settled; and he would appreciate your arranging to send pioneers there at the earliest possible date. <!-- New Letter -->19 June 1953 [Panama]Miss Elena Maria Marsella, Secretary National Spiritual Assembly of theBahá’ís of Central America Dear Bahá’í Sister:Chiloé Island Galápagos Islands Juan Fernández IslandsLeeward Islands Windward Islands Cook IslandsAs his dramatic cable indicates, the Guardian is preparing an illuminated <q class=''>“Roll of Honour”</q>, on which will be inscribed the names of the <q class=''>“Knights of Bahá’u’lláh”</q> who first enter these 131 virgin areas. This <q class=''>“Roll of Honour”</q> will be placed inside the entrance door of the inner sanctuary of the Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh.From time to time, the Guardian will announce to the Bahá’í world, the names of those holy souls who arise under the conditions outlined in his message, and settle these areas, and conquer them for God.Now is the time for the Bahá’ís of the world to demonstrate the spiritual vitality of the Faith, and to arise as one soul to spread the Glory of the Lord over the face of the earth. The Guardian is sure the spiritual power released with the launching of this great Ten Year Global Crusade will carry the consecrated and devoted friends to complete victory.He will pray for the members of your Assembly, whose sacrificial services he greatly values. Faithfully yours,Assistant SecretaryThe beloved Guardian has received your letters of May 24 and 30; July 5 and 18 (2); September 25; and October 29, 1952; and January 7 and 27 (2); February 5, and March 17, 1953, and has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. The enclosures have also been received.Regarding the matters you have raised in your letters:Such details as to whether the Local Spiritual Assemblies should ratify your Declaration of Trust or not are left to your Assembly to decide. He already, in any case, replied to you by cable. <span data-pg='284'/> </span>The Guardian encourages the various National Spiritual Assemblies to show initiative and originality in minor matters whilst adhering to uniformity in major matters; he therefore feels your Assembly is capable of developing its own News Letter along the lines best suited to the needs in the various countries under its jurisdiction. What you outlined as your present policy sounded quite all right to him.Please express to Dr. Lasso de la Vega his appreciation of the help he gave you in regard to your National Incorporation. A distinguished lawyer in Canada has for many years helped the friends in similar matters at no cost to them. Such good friends are very dear to our hearts.He was pleased to hear the Assembly members had been so active in travelling and stimulating the work.He received the material on Panfrish sent by Mr. Fitz-Henley, and is happy to see such an energetic thinker is now active in promoting the Faith; the Cause of God needs such enterprising promoters, and he hopes this dear friend will render great services in the teaching field.As regards the <q class=''>“Administrative Manual”</q>: he urges you to not add to the rules and regulations, but try to cut down on these and decide cases as they arise; there is a natural tendency to codify the teachings and produce handbooks of procedure: there are not enough Bahá’ís in the whole world to justify this, and he continuously urges the various National Spiritual Assemblies to beware of this tendency. He has no time, at all, to go over such things himself; indeed, your Assembly, and all the others, will have to assume increasing responsibility for your work in order to relieve him. He is worn out with all his work and added material to read.If ... continues to so flagrantly misrepresent the Faith and its Central Personages, and if it seems to really be misleading the public, a refutory letter can be written to any Editors that publish his articles. But, if he is not having much effect, it is better to ignore him.The Guardian feels confident that the believers of Central America, under the able leadership of your Assembly, will succeed in achieving all the objectives of their portion of the Ten Year Plan, and will thus add to their spiritual stature and to the glory of the Cause of God in Latin America. They must realize that their period of youth, so to speak, is now passed, and they have emerged into the responsibilities of maturity; ever increasingly upon their own efforts will depend the success of their labours. He will be following the course of their activities with eager interest, you may be sure.With warm Bahá’í love, R. RabbáníDear and valued co-workers:The splendid achievements which signalized the birth and early development of the National Spiritual Assembly representing the Central American Bahá’í community-achievements that merit the highest praise and have evoked profound admiration in the hearts of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in both East and West-have, no doubt, qualified its members to take their place, and play a distinct and notable part, in the newly launched and decade-long World Crusade destined to illumine the annals of the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation.The vigilance, fidelity, single-mindedness and perseverance displayed by them, as well as by their elected national representatives, in recent years; the series of projects they have successfully carried out, in both the teaching and administrative spheres of Bahá’í activity, which have, in no small measure, contributed to the multiplication of Bahá’í centres, the consolidation of Bahá’í institutions, and the <span data-pg='285'/> </span>dissemination of Bahá’í literature; the endeavours they have so devotedly exerted to give publicity to the Faith, to its aims, purposes and principles-these constitute a record of achievement which augurs well for their future contribution to the progress of the world-wide enterprise initiated by their fellow — believers embracing every continent of the globe, and which bids fair to eclipse any previous collective undertaking embarked upon by the adherents of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh since the inception of the Formative Age of His Dispensation.The task that now challenges their limited resources, that demands the undivided and close attention of each one of them, will, if worthily fulfilled, add imperishable lustre to the mighty and brilliant record of unforgettable achievements which will for ever be associated with the stalwart followers of His Faith dwelling in the Western Hemisphere.The first and foremost duty devolving upon them is the prosecution, with whatever resources they command and with all the enthusiasm, the resolution and consecration of which they are capable, of their Ten Year Plan that constitutes so vital a part of the global Crusade to which the entire Bahá’í world now stands committed.Of all the objectives which the members of this valiant community must assiduously strive to attain, ere the termination of the present decade, the dispatch of pioneers to the seven territories and islands-four of which are situated in the Western Hemisphere and the rest in the South Pacific Ocean-allocated to the members of this community must be considered of paramount importance, requiring the immediate and concentrated attention of its elected national representatives. Every effort should be exerted, every sacrifice should be made, to ensure the attainment of this primary objective ere the conclusion of this current year. This supreme, immediate objective, as well as the acquisition of the site of the First Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of Central America, should be regarded as the outstanding features of the initial phase of the Plan launched so auspiciously by the Bahá’ís of Central America on the morrow of the celebrations commemorating the centenary of the birth of the Mission of the Founder of their Faith.The prompt settlement of at least one pioneer in each of these virgin territories; the selection and purchase of the site of the future Temple, within the limits, or in the immediate outskirts, of the city of Panama, which need not exceed, for the present, an area of approximately one acre; the formation of an American as well as of an Asian Teaching Committee that will vigorously and speedily arise to discharge its duties-these constitute the first obligations to be assumed by the Central American National Assembly in the course of the opening year of the Plan.Already its sister National Assemblies have been urged to participate, through financial contributions, in an undertaking which, in the course of years, will culminate in the erection of a Bahá’í House of Worship in the heart of the Western Hemisphere, and in a country singled out for specific mention by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His immortal Tablets.While these preliminary measures are being carried out by the members of this Assembly, the process of the steady multiplication of Bahá’í centres and the formation of Bahá’í Spiritual Assemblies must, under no circumstances, be allowed to slacken. It should, indeed, be accelerated, by every means at the disposal of your Assembly, for upon it must depend the early formation of independent National Assemblies in both Central America and the Antilles-an objective which, though not immediate, is nevertheless worthy to rank as the most vital among the aims and purposes which the prosecutors of the Plan have set themselves to achieve.The field that stretches before them is so vast; the challenge that confronts them is at once severe and thrilling; the mission with which they have been entrusted is truly glorious and demands the utmost sacrifice; the reward that awaits them, if they worthily fulfil it in the allotted time, is immeasurably rich;  286the gratitude they will earn from their fellow Crusaders, should they attain their aim, will be profound and abiding.However strenuous the task, however prolonged the effort, however circumscribed their resources, let them remember that He Who guides, animates and watches over the operations of this momentous, world-embracing Crusade will, if they but play their part, abundantly reinforce, through the outpourings of His Celestial strength, all those battling for His Cause and will assure them a victory which He alone can bestow.That they may discharge nobly their task; that they may never allow, in the course of the coming years, anything to deflect them from their high purpose; that they may speedily and victoriously consummate the immediate requirements of their Plan; and befittingly terminate the first phase of their glorious Mission, in their capacity as associates in the execution of the Design conceived by ‘Abdu’l — Bahá, is the object of my constant prayers and one of the dearest wishes of my heart. <!-- New Letter -->27 June 1953 [Panama]Miss Elena Maria Marsella, Secretary National Spiritual Assembly of theBahá’ís of Central America Dear Bahá’í Sister:ShoghiThe beloved Guardian was very deeply appreciative of the kind gift made by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Central America to the Shrine of the Báb Fund, which was received through Rúḥíyyih K há num.

This is the most important goal for the opening phase of the World Crusade, and the sooner at least one pioneer is settled in each of these virgin areas, the better it will be. Perhaps from Chile will go forth one of these pioneers!The responsibilities placed upon the friends in your land are indeed great, but the Guardian does not give to any Community, or any individual, tasks greater than their strength to accomplish.

He likewise has felt that individual pioneers should follow the decisions of the committees.Thus it would seem to me that it would be desirable to secure a definite confirmation from the appropriate committee in connection with your proposed settlement of one of the virgin areas, as in that way the proper spirit of Bahá’í unity would be fulfilled. <span data-pg='294'/> </span>Assuring you of my prayers at the Shrines, and with loving Bahá’í greetings, I am, Faithfully yours,Leroy Ioas, Secretary-General <!-- New Letter -->10 October 1953 [Panama] Miss Cora OliverDear Bahá’í Sister:I am writing on behalf of our beloved Guardian to tell you that you will be most welcome to visit Haifa and ‘Akká during the first week in March 1954, in order to make the pilgrimage for which you asked his permission some time ago.If for any reason it is not possible for you to come at this time, will you please notify us so we can make other arrangements for other pilgrims intending to come, and if another date is more convenient to you, perhaps you will let us know what it will be, and the Guardian will advise you if you are permitted to come then.I send you my warm Bahá’í greetings.R. RabbáníP.S. I think, however, I might make it quite clear that any change of date might involve postponing your pilgrimage for some time, as our accommodations are limited and the Guardian has carefully planned a schedule of visitors for months ahead. <!-- New Letter -->10 October 1953 [Argentina] Mrs. Marie KevorkianDear Bahá’í Sister:Your loving letter of September 5th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his behalf.The contribution which you have made to the Shrine of the Báb fund is very deeply appreciated by him. Receipt is enclosed herewith.The Guardian is very happy to learn that your financial situation has worked out satisfactorily; and you will now be able to do many things for the Faith which previously were impossible.So far as investing your money is concerned, the Guardian feels you should secure the very best expert and professional advice in connection with this subject. There are of course very fine investment departments of the larger banks, and there are companies who are engaged in rendering service of this type. <span data-pg='295'/> </span>So far as your financial assistance to the Faith is concerned, the Guardian feels you have naturally, as a first responsibility, the assistance of the work in South America. The South American Bahá’ís have very great responsibilities in connection with the development of the Ten Year Crusade, and they will need heavy financial assistance, as well as the World Centre of the Faith.The Guardian greatly values your devoted services to the Cause of God. He wishes me to assure you of his prayers in your behalf; that the blessings of the Holy Spirit may be with you at all times, and that every obstacle may be removed from your path of service to the Cause. <!-- New Letter -->13 October 1953 [Panama] Mr. and Mrs. Roy Fernie Dear Bahá’í Friends:With loving Bahá’í greetings, I amLeroy Ioas Assistant SecretaryThe beloved Guardian has had in mind your request to visit the Holy Land as pilgrims. However, in view of your imminent departure for a pioneer post, he does not feel it is the time for you to make the pilgrimage now.After you have gotten settled in your new post, and are again living a normal life there, if you then feel you can come to Haifa, please, again ask the Guardian for permission at that time; he will notify you when you may come.The Guardian very deeply appreciates your pioneering service, and all of your wonderful labours for the Faith.With warm Bahá’í love, R. Rabbání <!-- New Letter -->20 October 1953 [Argentina] Dr. José MielnikDear Bahá’í Brother:Your letter of October 3rd has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.Regarding the questions you have raised: As there is nothing specific in the Bahá’í Writings on the subject of abortion, it will consequently have to be dealt with by the International House of Justice, when that Body is formed.The Guardian feels that your attitude towards the corrupt practice of accepting commissions from fellow physicians and pharmacists is most admirable. The more upright and noble the Bahá’ís are in <span data-pg='296'/> </span>their conduct, the more they will impress the public with the spiritual vitality of the Faith they believe in.The Guardian does not feel that he can advise you about whether you should or should not take out citizenship in Argentina. This is a matter you should consult the Assembly about. However, he sees no objection whatsoever to your doing so.He deeply appreciates and admires your great love for the Faith, and your devotion to it, and determination to serve it; and he assures you he will ardently pray that you may be guided in your efforts to promote it, and that you may be confirmed in your teaching work.With warm Bahá’í greetings,R.

He does not say give it up, he only wants you to be well advised by those in a position to know what they are talking about. He agrees with you it is better by all means to have some way of earning a living before you go out.Owing to the plans he has made he cannot receive you here as pilgrims this coming spring and feels the best thing is for you to make every effort to get off to your pioneer post and leave your pilgrimage for a future date when it can be made after you are well established.You may be sure he will pray for the removal of the obstacles in your path and he wishes you great success.So do I, and all the friends here, <!-- New Letter -->19 November 1953 [Brazil] Mrs. Leonora H. ArmstrongAffectionately, Rúḥíyyih <span data-pg='297'/> </span>Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your letter of October 28th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.The Guardian, although he feels that the establishment of new centres is of the utmost importance during the Ten Year Crusade, would not advise you to undertake any activities contrary to your husband’s wishes. If he has no objection to your teaching in some remote post, then this would certainly be a highly meritorious service; otherwise, you should continue with your important activities in connection with the teaching and publishing committees.You may be sure his loving prayers surround you.With warmest Bahá’í greetings,R.

It is this entire dedication of the friends which will be the cause of the creation of other groups and later Local Assemblies throughout that vast country, so that Brazil may eventually have its own National Assembly, in accordance with the goals set by the Guardian for the Ten Year Crusade.The Guardian will pray for the complete success of your labours in the Faith, rest assured. With warm Bahá’í love,R.

Perhaps if more resident Bahá’ís can be found there, you will be freed later on of the responsibility you now have in helping to maintain Assembly status there.The Guardian advises you to keep in close touch with the National Assembly; and assures you that he will pray that the way may open for you to fulfil your heart’s desire in the service of Bahá’u’lláh.With Bahá’í love,R. RabbáníMay the Almighty bless, guide and sustain you, and enable you to promote, at all times, the vital interests of His Faith,Your true brother, ShoghiThe beloved Guardian has received your letter of January 12th, and has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.The passing of the honoured and much-loved Hand of the Cause of God, Dorothy Baker, is indeed a great loss to the Faith, and she will be sadly missed in many lands, where she had laboured so <span data-pg='299'/> </span>tirelessly and so devotedly. She was an example and a great pillar of strength for the friends wherever she travelled.We can feel sure that her pure spirit will be assisting the believers from the unseen worlds of God, and that now her reward is great.With warm Bahá’í love,R.

He suggests you consult regarding this matter with the National Assembly.The Guardian is very happy indeed to hear that some of your children are now active believers, and will pray for them all. He will particularly pray for the soul of your dear mother, who is no doubt much happier and freer than when she was confined to this world.He wishes me to thank you for the pictures and the newspaper article which you enclosed. <span data-pg='300'/> </span>He sends his loving greetings to all the believers in Havana.

We do hope they will flourish in the Holy Land, but the climate here is very hot and dry, with very little shade.

The contribution which you have made to the international interests of the Bahá’í Faith is greatly appreciated by him. Receipt is enclosed herewith.The Guardian is very happy with the development of the teaching work in the virgin areas of the Ten Year Crusade. Over 81 of the countries have now been settled, bringing the number of countries within the pale of the Faith to over 213. <span data-pg='301'/> </span>The Guardian is hopeful that the friends at home will arise with the same spirit of sacrifice and determination as the pioneers abroad, and teach and spread the Faith.More Bahá’ís, more Groups, more Assemblies are the immediate goals before the friends at home. He feels sure the friends will arise as never before, and, filled with the Holy Spirit, quicken the seeking souls, leading many to the bourn of immortality.Dedication to the heavenly task, complete consecration to the noble mission, and living the life are the requirements for success in the teaching field.The beloved Guardian was greatly delighted to learn of the success of the institute for teaching the Indian children. He feels this is a very fine method of implanting the teachings of the Faith in the hearts and the minds of the young children, so that they may grow and develop into strong and virile men and women who will serve the Cause. Likewise through this effort, he hopes you will be able to attract some of the parents.The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf. He sends you his loving greetings. Faithfully yours,Leroy Ioas25 February 1954 [Peru] Miss Elisabeth Cheney Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your loving letter of February 11th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf. Your contribution to the international activities of the Faith, made in memory of Dorothy Baker, is greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed herewith.It is very appropriate that this contribution be made in Dorothy’s memory. It is a source of happiness to her in the realms beyond, and certainly will be the means of the progress of her soul.The Guardian was very much interested in your reciting of the dream which Dorothy had. It would seem that coming events have cast their shadows before.Her death was a loss to the entire Bahá’í world, as her teaching work was very effective; and the Guardian had hoped to use her in various parts of the world, in connection with the development of the Ten Year Crusade. Perhaps her death will be the inspiration for hundreds of others to arise in her place, so that the work will be carried on with even greater volume than if she were still alive.The Guardian appreciates your own devoted services to the Faith. He hopes the classes you are conducting in Lima will be very effective, and produce excellent results. <span data-pg='302'/> </span>He assures you of his prayers in your behalf, and sends you his loving greetings.

It is entirely fitting that you make this contribution in her memory. She rendered outstanding service in the teaching field, and certainly set an example for the friends in every country. She was particularly active and effective in her teaching work in Central and South America. She will be very happy in the realms beyond from this gift made in her memory.It is noted you have contributed this fund to the Shrine of the Báb. The Shrine of the Báb has been completed; therefore with your permission this money will be used to advance the international interests of the Faith here at the World Centre.The Guardian is very hopeful that you will be confirmed in your teaching work in Costa Rica, and become the means of the guidance of many seeking souls. He greatly values your own devoted services to the Faith.

He is likewise watching closely the development of the teaching work on the home front.The Guardian wishes to participate in these tremendous activities of the friends, and particularly of the friends in South America; and he is therefore sending a contribution to you for $1,500.

At the same time, the children of any such union must be properly taken care of.It is the responsibility of the National Assembly to consult concerning each instance, and be just and fair in their decisions to all parties concerned. The father cannot very well abandon the children of such a relationship; and, on the other hand, he must give up his immoral relations with the common-law wife.The Guardian would suggest that you confer with the National Assembly concerning this matter.

FriedlandDear Bahá’í Brother:Your loving letter of April 11th has just come to hand, telling of the success of your teaching work in Cayenne, and asking concerning the statement of the Master in America, concerning the great proclamation of liberty and emancipation from slavery being made on the American continent.One cannot well take a sentence from the context of an address, and endeavour to build historic fact on it. In the sentence which you quote <q class=''>“influenced and impelled ... the European powers proclaimed universal liberty ...”</q> the Master, it seems clear to me, is referring to two things, the war fought in America for the freeing of the slaves, and the <q class=''>“great proclamation”</q> made by the President with regard to it. Surely there were efforts made before this, not only in Europe, but in America also, looking to the ending of slavery-but the Great Proclamation, and the war fought for liberty occurred in America, and after that the real freeing of the slaves took place. England, to which the article refers, which you enclosed, was praised by Bahá’u’lláh for freeing the slaves, but surely they have nothing to be proud of anywhere in the world where they are related to coloured peoples, nor have any of the present European powers. What could be worse than the situation in South Africa, in Kenya, in Uganda-in fact in any part of Africa? Had they followed to the full the example of America, think of how different things would be in Africa, and in Cayenne. Let us hope, before too long, Europe will carry out the Master’s injunction, and follow the Great Proclamation of America, and let the whites of Europe arise to fight a war for the freedom of the coloured peoples.Now, you may wish to look up historic data, bearing out the Master’s statements. This is a service the friends should render, and it will relieve the beloved Guardian, who has not the opportunity to read incoming mail, let alone look up historic facts. <span data-pg='309'/> </span>In most parts of Africa, the Guardian is encouraging the friends to teach the native Africans. I note you do not mention them in your letter. He feels little will be accomplished in Africa, with the religious or political leaders, nor with those who come from other countries. The campaign in Africa is to teach the Africans, not Europeans, etc. Thus the great results have been achieved where the friends concentrated on the native population. In Uganda, there are, in less than two years, over 600 native African Bahá’ís, in some 160 centres, with about 25 Assemblies. The natives have gone pioneering in other territories, and have opened four virgin areas of the Ten Year Crusade. Perhaps you should study the possibility of teaching of the Faith among the natives?The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf. He sends you his loving greetings.

It is fitting that the friends in Buenos Aires send a contribution to the international activities of the Faith, as it strengthens the bond which exists between the World Centre of the Faith, and the Faith in Argentina.It is noted you indicate these contributions are for the Shrine of the Báb; but inasmuch as the Shrine has been completed, the money has been placed in the International Fund, where it will be used for the expansion of the international work.The Guardian is looking with eager eyes to South America. He feels the time is ripe for the development of the Faith there on a very rapid scale, and therefore hopes the friends will arise with renewed effort, in order to give the glad tidings, and confirm the people in the Cause of God.He assures you of his prayers in your behalf.Faithfully yours, <!-- New Letter -->21 May 1954 [Alexander Reid, Chile] ASSURE FERVENT PRAYERS. <!-- New Letter -->2 June 1954 [Panama]Mr. and Mrs. Frank Keith and Eddie KeithDear Bahá’í Friends:Leroy Ioas Assistant SecretaryYour letter of May 23rd has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He was very happy to learn that you have gotten so well settled down, and that you have the promise of a Spiritual Assembly in the Canal Zone by next April.He thinks it premature at present to make any plans for an independent National Assembly there; but as all Regional or National Assemblies are based on the principle of having a sufficient number of Local Assemblies, the Bahá’ís should redouble their efforts to bring into existence new Assemblies and new groups; and, when the time is ripe for the establishment of a National Assembly, he will tell you to do so. <span data-pg='312'/> </span>He assures you of his prayers in your behalf.With warm Bahá’í greetings,R.

Bahá’u’lláh said its purpose is to promote unity. If the friends neglect, for the sake of the Cause, this institution, they place the Faith in a poor light before the public. In these days the people of the world are so immoral, and treat the marriage institution so lightly; and we, as Bahá’ís, in contrast to the people of the world, are trying to create a high moral standard, and reinstate the sanctity of marriage.If your husband will allow you to do a certain amount of teaching work, and occasionally to travel in the interests of the Faith, all the better; but he does not think the Faith should be made the thing which destroys your family life.He feels sure that, if you will talk this over with Mr. Nichols, and share this letter with him, you will find him understanding and co-operative.

I have held your letter this long, trying to find some time, but have not been able to do so. I would suggest, therefore, you turn this over to someone else. Mrs. Mariam Haney, of Washington (mother of Paul Haney), does a lot of this type of research work, and perhaps she can be helpful to you.There are one or two comments I might make.Ḥuqúq: This of course was established by Bahá’u’lláh, and you will find references to it in some of His Writings. The most direct teachings regarding the Ḥuqúq are in the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and it would seem to me that that should form the main basis of your advice to the friends at this time. Perhaps one reference from one of Bahá’u’lláh’s statements would be sufficient to lay a spiritual foundation with the Prophet Himself.Ḥa íratu’l-Quds: is the official designation of the Bahá’í Administrative Office. It is one of the developments of the Bahá’í Administrative Order. Its name was given by the Guardian himself. Someone reviewing the Guardian’s cables and letters will be able to find the references. The word <q class=''>“Ḥa íra”</q> is a contraction of <q class=''>“Ḥa íratu’l-Quds”</q>, and of course should not be used in the formal reference to the Bahá’í Administrative Office. <!-- New Letter -->11 June 1954 [Peru]National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of South Americac/o Miss Dorothy Campbell, Secretary Dear Bahá’í Friends:With loving Bahá’í greetings, I am, LeroyOne of the goals of the Ten Year Crusade is the purchase of national Ḥa íratu’l-Quds for the 49 places where National Assemblies are ultimately to be located. Four of these goals have already been achieved. The Guardian has instructed that 17 additional Ḥa íratu’l-Quds are to be purchased during the second year of the Crusade. <span data-pg='314'/> </span>One of these properties to be purchased during the current year will be in Lima. The beloved Guardian has written to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States on the importance of this project, asking them to see that it is carried to fruition, if at all possible during this year.The Guardian calls attention to the fact that the Ḥa íratu’l-Quds cannot be a rented place. It must be a property owned by the Bahá’í community. It should not be an elaborate structure, but simply a modest house which can serve as a Ḥa íratu’l-Quds for the Local Assembly until such time as the National Assembly is formed, and which will be able to take care of the national administrative activities on a modest basis.Until such time as the National Assembly is formed and incorporated, the building can be held in the name of the Local Assembly, if it is incorporated, but if not, in the name of individuals.The Guardian suggests that you look for a suitable structure to serve as a Ḥa íratu’l-Quds. It must be within the city limits of Lima. Then, when you have received word from the National Assembly in the United States, you may have something to submit to them for consideration. <!-- New Letter -->11 June 1954 [Peru]National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of South AmericaMiss Dorothy Campbell, Secretary Dear Bahá’í Friends:Faithfully yours,Leroy Ioas Assistant SecretaryYour loving letter of June 1st has been received, giving the record of Assemblies, groups and isolated believers in South America as of April 21st, 1954.The Guardian was gratified to learn that there has been an increase of four centres where the Faith is established. He was rather distressed, however, to note that four Assemblies lost their Assembly status during the past year. He sincerely hopes every effort will be made to bring them back to Assembly status during the coming year. He likewise noted that four groups reverted to isolated status.The keynote of our teaching work during the coming year must be more Assemblies, more groups and more isolated believers. When you consider that there are over 150 Bahá’í centres in the State of Uganda in Africa, all of which were established in a period of a little over two years, you will realize the manner in which this Faith can spread if the teaching work is carried on in the true spirit of consecration and devotion.The Guardian feels that victories can be won in South America the same as they have been won in Africa; and he hopes the friends will redouble their efforts during the coming year, and will show a deeper spirit of consecration and devotion, and that the zealous activity of the friends will bring about the quickening of many souls in the Cause of God.He sends you his loving greetings. <span data-pg='315'/> </span> <!-- New Letter -->14 June 1954 [Peru]Miss Dorothy Campbell, Secretary National Spiritual Assembly of theBahá’ís of South America Dear Bahá’í Sister:Faithfully yours,Leroy Ioas Assistant SecretaryYour Assembly’s letters dated June 8, 11, 16 (2), 25 and 27, August 15, September 7, October 1 and November 17 (3), 1953, and March 30 and May 10, 1954, with their enclosures, also packages sent separately, have all been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He is very pleased to see the remarkable progress your Assembly has made in settling its pioneer territories during the first year of the Ten Year Crusade.When one realizes that the organized work in Latin America is not even two decades old, and that there are now two National Bodies in that area; twenty National Bodies in prospect of formation ere the expiry of another decade; that you have already acquired your Temple site (he regrets the error in stating this situation was Santiago); that so many members of your Community were able to visit the Intercontinental Conference; that two of the dear Hands of the Cause made an extended tour of the countries under your jurisdiction-when one contemplates all these facts, one sees indeed the vitality of these newly-enrolled believers in the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, and the great promise for the future that the work there holds.It was a great pleasure to have one of the members of your Assembly, Mrs. Fabienne Guillon, here as a pilgrim. Indeed the visit of the first Chilean Bahá’í to Haifa was another landmark in the unfoldment of the Faith throughout that region.He does not consider it necessary for you to ask his permission before enrolling any Oriental people as voting members. You should write your Assemblies, and urge them to concentrate on teaching native Latin Americans and Indians, and to ignore, as far as possible, Orientals, without antagonizing them unduly.In view of the situation prevailing in Dutch Guiana, he thinks that more latitude could be allowed, but the pioneers there should be very careful with Muslims, and be absolutely sure of the purity of their motive before proceeding to teach them or to accept them.He sees no objection to your pioneer teaching work for all your goals, including one Asian territory, being carried out under the supervision of the New Territories Committee. He does not think a separate committee necessary for just one Asiatic country.As regards your question of languages, the Guardian made out a general list of languages for different parts of the globe, into which Bahá’í literature was to be translated during the Ten Year Plan. He does not, however, insist that every single one of these languages be used. If the friends find out, through investigations on the subject, that one of these languages is relatively insignificant, and another <span data-pg='316'/> </span>language much more commonly spoken in that area, he does not object to a substitution being made, though he would like, as a general principle, to have as few substitutions made as possible.He therefore approves of your translating literature into Quechua, Aymará, Guaraní, and Auracano. A pamphlet is sufficient for the purpose, but he advises you to use a substantial pamphlet, similar to the one that the British National Assembly has been using throughout Africa for African languages, and not something wholly insignificant.He was very touched to hear of the manner in which Mr. José Ollino embraced the Faith, assisted the Tormos in their pioneering, and passed away under tragic circumstances. Surely such a soul is richly rewarded in the world beyond. It seemed as if it was his destiny to be given this great blessing of not only hearing of Bahá’u’lláh, but rendering Him a service, before his life came to an end. The Guardian has prayed for him in the holy Shrines.He feels sure that, with the staunch and enthusiastic spirit of the body of the believers throughout the Community under your jurisdiction, you will go forward and accomplish great things during the present Bahá’í year. The Bahá’ís must never be discouraged. They must look to their blessings, and, confident of the unfailing support of Bahá’u’lláh, persevere in the work of the Ten Year Crusade.He will remember all the members of your Assembly in his prayers in the holy Shrines, and will supplicate that the pioneers, the teachers and the rank and file of the believers, may render ever greater services to the Cause of God.With warmest Bahá’í greetings, R. RabbáníDear and valued co-workers:The South American Bahá’í Community, firmly established and steadily consolidating itself, throughout so vast an area in the Western Hemisphere, is now entering, at this crucial hour in the unfoldment of the Ten Year Plan on which it has embarked, a period which bids fair to eclipse all preceding periods since its inception more than fifteen years ago. Its responsibilities have greatly multiplied, the scope of its operations has considerably widened, and its share in the prosecution of the world-wide tasks confronting the followers of the Faith has notably increased.The moment is appropriate for the members of this Community to pause and call to mind the successive stages which have marked its inception and development, and which constitute a shining episode in the evolution of the Bahá’í Faith in the western world. The opening phase of this mighty process may be said to have been ushered in by the response made by the Heralds of the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, during the closing years of the Heroic Age of His Faith, and particularly by His exemplary and consecrated handmaiden, Martha Root, to the call raised by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and the settlement of the first Bahá’í pioneer in the city of Bahia. This initial stage in the introduction of the Faith in the South American continent was greatly accelerated, in the years following the rise and establishment of the Administrative Order of the Faith in the North American continent, through the operations of the First Seven Year Plan, set in motion by the members of the North American Bahá’í Community, for the purpose of establishing the basis of that same Order throughout the Republics of Latin America. This far-reaching and highly blessed enterprise was greatly reinforced by the initiation of yet another Plan, which culminated in the emergence of the South American Bahá’í National Assembly, an achievement that was worthily commemorated in the course of the festivities celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Bahá’u’lláh’s Prophetic Mission. The formation of this National Assembly was signalized by the adoption of various measures elected by the representatives of the South American Bahá’í Community and which yielded their fruit on the eve of those same festivities. This period of internal <span data-pg='317'/> </span>consolidation was soon followed, on the morrow of these world-wide celebrations, by the launching of a Ten Year Plan, designed to lend a fresh impetus to the development of this Community, and constituting its share of the spiritual Crusade launched by the followers of the Faith in all continents of the globe.The opening phase of this decade-long Plan inaugurated the Mission of this newly consolidated Community beyond its homelands, and was brought to a successful conclusion through the opening of every single virgin territory assigned, in accordance with that same Plan, to this Community.This notable success, achieved by the South American believers-a success which posterity will regard as a milestone of great significance in the history of the Faith in those regions-must, at this hour when the second phase of this historic Plan is opening, be followed up by still greater victories within the confines of the South American Republics, enhancing thereby the prestige of this Community and hastening the formation of an independent National Spiritual Assembly in each of these Republics.Whilst careful attention is being paid to the preservation of the prizes won in the newly opened nine territories in the American and Asiatic continents, a special effort must be exerted for the multiplication of Bahá’í centres and for the formation of Local Assemblies in each of the South American Republics, for the sole purpose of broadening and reinforcing the foundations on which future independent National Spiritual Assemblies must be raised. A swift increase in the number of the avowed supporters of the Faith, particularly of those belonging to the Indian race, is yet another responsibility which the prosecutors of the Plan must courageously face and nobly discharge. Prompt measures should moreover be taken for the purchase, in the city of Lima, of a building which need not be pretentious, that will serve as the a íratu’l-Quds of the present South American National Assembly, and will be regarded as the national administrative headquarters of the future National Spiritual Assembly of the Republic of Peru; and will herald the establishment of similar institutions for the remaining South American Republics. The establishment of Bahá’í endowments in that same city should likewise be speedily inaugurated. Every assistance must moreover be extended to the United States National Spiritual Assembly in hastening the translation and publication of Bahá’í Literature in the Indian languages assigned to that Assembly. The translation, publication and dissemination of Bahá’í Literature must be carried on, uninterruptedly and with ever-increasing vigour, in both the Spanish and Portuguese languages. The process of incorporating Local Spiritual Assemblies must be continually reinforced, as one of the most effective means for the consolidation of the entire Community. The establishment of a Bahá’í Publishing Trust must be undertaken in the city of Rio de Janeiro in conformity with the principles laid down by the British National Assembly for their Publishing Trust. Nor must the elected representatives of this Community neglect their supreme responsibility to safeguard the spiritual life of its members, to continually enrich that life by every means in their power, to deepen their grasp of the distinguishing features and the fundamental verities of the Bahá’í Faith, and to encourage and inspire them to reflect its spirit and precepts in their personal lives and conduct.May this Community, which, ever since its inception, has shown such promise, and which, in recent years, has achieved so notable a success both at home and abroad, continue, with undiminished consecration, the task which it has so resolutely shouldered, and enhance, in the days to come, the enviable record which will ever remain associated with the opening years of its existence, <!-- New Letter -->24 June 1954 [Panama]Mr. Esteban Canales, Secretary National Spiritual Assembly ofYour true brother, Shoghi <span data-pg='318'/> </span>the Bahá’ís of Central America Dear Bahá’í Brother:The letters of your National Body dated June 17, July 3 (2), 7, 8 and 19, and October 10, 1953, January 25 and May 1, 1954, with enclosures, have been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He was extremely pleased that your Assembly was able to purchase the site for the Bahá’í Temple in Panama before the expiration of the first year of the Ten Year Crusade. He advises your Assembly, while safeguarding and maintaining the property, and living up to the terms of the contract which you signed, to spend as little money on the site as possible. Your resources are too limited, and the needs in the teaching field are too urgent, for money other than for the purpose of the purchase and bare maintenance of the property to be spent on the Temple site, at the present time. The important thing was to buy it, and this has been satisfactorily accomplished.He is also very proud of the fact that Central America has filled all her pioneer goals with the exception of the Marshall Islands, to which Mrs. Steward is now en route.He has read with attention the consolidation plan prepared by the National Teaching Executive Committee, a copy of which you forwarded to him in your most recent letter; and, although he thinks that the general outline of activities is excellent, there are two points to which he would like to call your attention.The first is that he has not decided that there will be definitely no Regional National Assemblies prior to the establishment of independent National Assemblies for each Latin American country. As the work unfolds and the centres multiply, this matter will have to be carefully considered. At present it is premature to reach any conclusions.He also believes that, before any abolition of the present basis of electing delegates to the National Convention (in other words, the delegates represent Assemblies, and not Groups and isolated believers as well) is made, the Cause must grow much stronger in each of the Central American republics.Perhaps your Assembly is not aware of the fact that, with the exception of the United States and Persia, the two countries where the mass of the believers is the greatest in the Bahá’í world, all other National Assemblies are elected by delegates who are elected in their turn by Local Assemblies, and not by the body of the believers residing in any particular country.He considers the introduction of the latter system premature in Latin America. You must first have many more active Groups and isolated centres, before there is any point in calling a National Convention, and directly electing the national delegates for the Central American Convention by the method used in the United States at present.This is one of the reasons why he is urging the Bahá’ís everywhere to, above all, concentrate on increasing the number of Spiritual Assemblies and Groups, as well as isolated believers, educating them more deeply in the administrative and spiritual fundamentals and doctrines of the Faith, and increasing their awareness of their great responsibility as Bahá’ís in both the teaching and administrative work of the Faith. He always considers that, until the foundation is securely laid, there should be no attempt at elaborating the superstructure. <span data-pg='319'/> </span>This principle applies everywhere, and he does not yet think that the administrative foundation is secure enough in Latin America (and indeed in many other countries) to permit of any elaboration of the present methods which he has outlined for the friends to follow.He hopes that the Auxiliary Board, working in conjunction with the Hands of the Cause, will be able to carry a new impetus to the teaching work, and, in collaboration with the National Assemblies, help to strengthen and revitalize weak centres.He urges you in this connection to bear in mind the need of Mexico City, which, he notices from your reports, is divided against itself. When we remember that it is one of the first centres established in Latin America, at the very outset of the teaching work there almost two decades ago, we realize that it deserves special attention to get it back on its feet, spiritually.Another matter to which he attaches the greatest importance is that of keeping the pioneers at their posts, and urging upon them the necessity of persevering at all costs, lest one of the so hardly-won goals of the Ten Year Crusade suffer even a momentary eclipse.Your Assembly must feel very proud of the fact that a number of its members have gone into the pioneer field. The National Assembly must always show forth signs of true spiritual leadership; and he is very happy that your Body is so active, so devoted and so united.He hopes that, in the unfoldment of your work throughout that region, you will pay special attention to teaching the Indians and minority groups, and converting them to the Faith. He attaches the greatest importance to this work, and is always glad to receive news of the names of any new Indian tribes represented in the Cause of God, or contacted.It was a great pleasure to have the Chairman of your Assembly here as a pilgrim, after the New Delhi Conference. Indeed, who would have believed, a few years ago, that representatives from both Central and South America would attend an Intercontinental Teaching Conference in New Delhi, the other side of the world, and then come, bearing the love and devotion of their co-workers in distant parts of the New World, to the World Centre, as pilgrims? He is sure that this direct contact will link your Assembly even closer to the World Centre here.You may be sure that, in his visits to the holy Shrines, he remembers you all most lovingly in his prayers, and supplicates that the dear Bahá’ís of Central America will become ever more active, more courageous, more self-sacrificing and more spiritually aware of their great calling.With warmest Bahá’í greetings,R. RabbáníP.S. The Guardian considers that the National Ḥa íratu’l-Quds in each of the Latin American countries, which must be established in conformity with the provisions of the Ten Year Plan, should be a building owned by the Bahá’ís. It does not have to be erected by them especially for this purpose. It can be a piece of property either bought by them, or donated by some believer to the Faith for this purpose.The same applies to a local Ḥa íratu’l-Quds. If it is a rented room or hall, it is to be designated as the Bahá’í Centre. When it is owned by the friends, it must be called the Ḥa íratu’l-Quds.Dear and valued co-workers:   320The Central American Bahá’í Community, occupying so pivotal a position in the heart of the Western Hemisphere, stands, at this hour, marking at once the termination of the opening phase of the Bahá’í World Spiritual Crusade and the commencement of the second period in its unfoldment, on the threshold of an epoch of glorious expansion, both within its homeland as well as in foreign fields.Its members can do no better than to recall, at this juncture, with joyous gratitude, the series of historic events which have led, in the course of almost four decades, to its gradual emergence, its rapid rise and steady consolidation. The epoch-making travels of some of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s disciples, headed by the incomparable Martha Root, during the concluding years of the Heroic, and the opening decade of the Formative, Age of the Faith, in response to the Call raised by the Centre of the Covenant in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, may be regarded as the prelude to the formal and definite introduction of the Faith in that vast and prominent region. These preliminary years of widespread and strenuous seed sowing paved the way, on the morrow of the establishment of the framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith in the Western Hemisphere, for the launching of the First Seven Year Plan formulated by the American Bahá’í Community, which culminated in the laying of the Administrative foundations of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the Republics of Central America and the Antilles. This initial stage in the rise and establishment of the embryonic World Order of Bahá’u’lláh in the Heart of the Western Hemisphere was immediately followed by the initiation of yet another Plan which attained its climax, on the morrow of the centenary of the Báb’s Martyrdom, through the formation of the Central American Bahá’í National Spiritual Assembly-an auspicious event that was befittingly celebrated in the course of the festivities commemorating the centenary of the birth of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission. This notable and unforgettable event in the annals of the Faith in the New World was destined to be succeeded by the launching of a small Plan albeit carefully devised by the newly launched National Spiritual Assembly and which culminated in those same never to be forgotten festivities.The launching of this Plan was in itself a prelude to the initiation of a Ten Year Plan, formulated to meet the immediate needs of the Central American Bahá’í Community, in conjunction with a spiritual Crusade embarked upon by national Bahá’í communities throughout the entire globe.The opening phase of this Ten Year Plan, which may be said to have inaugurated the Mission of this same Community beyond its homelands, has now drawn to a close, a year that has witnessed the opening, with a single exception, of all the virgin territories assigned, in accordance with that same Plan, to this Community.This great victory, in which the followers of the Faith in Central America have themselves played a notable part, and which has virtually set the seal of triumph on the initial stage of this glorious Crusade, must, at this hour of the unfoldment of the second phase of this historic enterprise, prove in turn a forerunner of a period of unprecedented, rapid and systematic expansion and consolidation of the Faith in each of the Republics of Central America and of the Antilles.Whilst every effort must be strenuously exerted to safeguard at any cost the prizes won in the six newly opened territories in the American and Asiatic continents, attention must, in the course of the present year, be focused on the multiplication of Bahá’í centres, and on the formation of Local Assemblies, in order to broaden the foundations on which future independent National Spiritual Assemblies must ultimately rest. A no less assiduous effort should be exerted to increase rapidly the number of the avowed supporters of the Faith, particularly among the Indians, whose spiritual potentialities ‘Abdu’l-Bahá repeatedly emphasized. Steps should moreover be taken to ensure the prompt purchase in the city of Panama of a modest property that will serve as the a íratu’l-Quds of the present Central American National Assembly and the national administrative headquarters of the future National Spiritual Assembly of the Republic of Panama, and which will set in motion the process of the purchase of similar properties designed to serve as administrative headquarters for the future independent National Assemblies in that area. A beginning must also be made in the establishment of Bahá’í endowments in that city. Simultaneously measures should be speedily undertaken to assist the <span data-pg='321'/> </span>United States National Assembly in expediting the translation and publication of Bahá’í Literature in the Indian languages specifically mentioned in the provisions of the Ten Year Plan. No effort should moreover be spared in assisting the South American National Spiritual Assembly in the all-important work of translating, printing and disseminating Bahá’í Literature in both the Spanish and Portuguese languages. Particular attention should likewise be devoted to the acceleration of the process of local Bahá’í Incorporation, so vital to the further consolidation of the newly emerged administrative institutions of the Faith in Central America and the Antilles.As the process of internal expansion and consolidation gains momentum, the elected national representatives of this Community must not fail to consecrate themselves to the no less fundamental task of enriching continually the spiritual life of its members, of deepening their understanding of the essential verities, tenets and principles underlying their Faith, of demanding a strict adherence to its laws and statutes, and of setting an example to their fellow-believers through a fuller reflection, in their personal lives and conduct, of the ennobling truths animating the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.May this Community which, in the course of over a decade, has demonstrated so conspicuously its devotion to the ideals of the Faith it has risen to champion, furnish, as the years roll by, further proofs of its staunchness, its courage, its fidelity, its watchfulness, its single-mindedness and unswerving determination to fulfil its high destiny through the attainment of every single objective of the Plan to which it stands committed.Your true brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->11 July 1954 [Peru]National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of South AmericaMiss Dorothy Campbell, Secretary Dear Bahá’í Friends:Your loving letter of June 25th has been received, and its contents have been presented to the beloved Guardian.He appreciates very much indeed the devotion of the friends in South America to the great tasks they have ahead of them. He is praying that each and every one of you may be guided and confirmed in your work, so that the Cause may spread very rapidly throughout the South American continent.The peoples of the world are being prepared for the message of world unity and spiritual regeneration. He hopes, therefore, the Bahá’ís will become the channels through which the Holy Spirit may spread throughout your country.In connection with the purchase of the land in Lima for the Ḥa íratu’l-Quds in that city, the Guardian feels you should consult closely with the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States. It is noticed you speak of a long-term loan. Generally the Guardian does not favor long-term mortgages of any type, but feels that the believers should, whenever possible, carry forward the activities without going into debt. Of course there are times when this cannot be avoided, and in such instances, the debt should be as small as possible, and for as short a time as possible. <span data-pg='322'/> </span>Now that the second phase of the Ten Year Crusade has opened, and this second phase stresses particularly the expansion of the Faith into consolidation areas, the Guardian sincerely hopes you will be able to bring many groups into Assemblies and many isolated centres into groups, and establish many new centres of the Faith.With loving Bahá’í greetings, I am, Faithfully yours,Leroy IoasAssistant Secretary <!-- New Letter -->30 August 1954 [Peru]Miss Dorothy Campbell, SecretaryNational Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of South AmericaDear Bahá’í Sister:Your loving letter of August 21st has just come to hand, telling of your activities in connection with the purchase of the Ḥa íratu’l-Quds in Lima.There is just one comment which I have to offer; and that is that it is not necessary from the standpoint of the Ḥa íratu’l-Quds for it to be in the centre of the city. Of course it should be suitably located, but in many instances, the purchases have been made within the city, but not in the heart of the city. This might ease your problem a little, and enable you to find a suitable location.Your advice of the acceptance of two new Bahá’ís in British Guiana is very encouraging indeed. I sincerely hope these new Bahá’ís will grow into strong and active supporters of the Faith, and will win many victories for it.It is interesting to know that Mrs. Groger has arrived in the island of Chiloe, and that Mrs. Sims has just arrived in Asunción. They will be able to render excellent services, I am sure.With loving Bahá’í greetings to you and all the members of the Assembly, I am Faithfully yours, <!-- New Letter -->12 September 1954 [Peru]Mr. Eduardo Maa Gamarra, Secretary Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of CallaoDear Bahá’í Co-workers:Assistant Secretary.Your loving letter of July 25th has just come to hand, telling of the plans of the friends in Callao to establish a local Ḥa íratu’l-Quds, offering the suggestion that it might be used as a National Ḥa íra for Peru. <span data-pg='323'/> </span>The beloved Guardian will be very happy indeed to learn of the spirit which has animated the friends in Callao in their endeavours to spread the Faith and to build up its institutions, particularly in the promising country of Peru and the city of Callao.The beloved Guardian has recently written to the National Assemblies and the Hands of the Cause throughout the world, calling attention to the fact that the responsibilities of the Ten Year Crusade are very heavy indeed, and that all Bahá’í thought and activity should be centred around the goals to be accomplished. He has particularly indicated that nothing should be undertaken which is not a part of the specific goals of the Ten Year Crusade, particularly in the way of establishing new funds, etc.The questions therefore which you raise in your letter it would seem are those which should locally be determined by your own National Spiritual Assembly.The work at the International Centre is so voluminous at the present time that the Guardian does not enter into questions of local administrative matters, and enters in, as little as possible, to national administrative matters. These are left in the hands of the National Assemblies in each country.Thus the suggestion is that you submit your proposals to the National Assembly; and when they have rendered their decision, abide by that. The National Assembly is familiar with all problems of the Ten Year Crusade, and the goals to be achieved within the South American continent, and they can tell just what should be done, particularly as they bear in mind the recent instructions of the Guardian with regard to the need of concentrating on the goals of the Crusade itself, and not establishing any new activities or funds.With loving Bahá’í greetings, I am,Faithfully yours,Leroy Ioas Assistant Secretary <!-- New Letter -->13 September 1954 [Cora H.

There are copies all over the Bahá’í world. It is therefore not necessary for you to send it to the International Library or any National Library.There is no need to make any translation of this book. If Mr. Wagner has time to translate, he should translate some of the current Bahá’í literature which is most important, such as the Íqán, <q class=''>“Some Answered Questions”</q>, <q class=''>“Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh”</q>, etc. You may find some of these books have been translated, and if they have been, then other books should be translated. Certainly a book, dealing with the early history of the Faith, which may not be entirely authentic, should not be translated, when there is such a book as <q class=''>“Nabíl’s Narrative”</q>.With regard to the question of prayer: The beloved Guardian indicates that prayers may be addressed directly to God, or directly to Bahá’u’lláh. Prayers should not be addressed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on the basis of addressing Him as the Messenger of God, such as when you address a prayer to Bahá’u’lláh. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá may be prayed to on the basis of intercession.The true basis of prayer is for the individual to hold himself as a reed, through which the Holy Spirit may flow. His will should be completely submissive to the Will of God. When this is done, then the Hosts of the Unseen Kingdom have an opportunity to assist and direct the individual. Thus it may be seen that sometimes the answer is not what is expected by the individual, but what is best for the Cause of God.The Guardian has so often pointed out that there are three elements of prayer-meditation, supplication and action. It is most important that an individual act, because it is only while the individual is acting that a prayer can be answered.The beloved Guardian assures you and all the friends of his prayers in your behalf.

Perseverance, love, tact and patience will work wonders.He feels the Caracas friends should deepen their own knowledge of the Teachings, make every effort to attract new souls, and by all means try and carry on extension work in the rest of Venezuela.You may be sure he will pray for you and all the friends there, in the holy Shrines; and he urges you to persevere with a happy and confident heart.With Bahá’í love,R.

It should be used only when there seems no other way to solve the problem.Answering specifically the question you raise, if a person is deprived of his voting rights, he many not contribute to the Local or National Funds; he may not attend Nineteen Day Feasts. Of course, not attending the Nineteen Day Feasts, he can take no part in consultation. While it is not forbidden for the friends to associate with the individual, yet their association should be on a formal basis.So far as the individual who has been deprived of his voting rights teaching the Cause, he is of course free to do this, as every individual has been encouraged by Bahá’u’lláh to teach the Cause.The Guardian feels you should not include in the new Prayer Book the so-called Prayer for the Guardian.The beloved Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf. He sends you his loving greetings.The Guardian is very hopeful that your Assembly will be able to encourage the friends to engage in intensive teaching activity. It is astonishing the manner in which the goals of the Ten Year Crusade are being achieved; but there is one point in which the work is lagging, and that is teaching on the home front. There must be more Bahá’ís, more groups and more Assemblies. In fact, with the goals of the Ten Year Crusade for the establishment of individual National Assemblies throughout South America, every effort should be made in every one of the countries to increase the number of Assemblies.The Guardian is hopeful he will receive encouraging word from you of the progress of the Faith in the South American countries along all of these lines. <!-- New Letter -->16 March 1955 [Gayle Woolson, Peru] POSTPONE PILGRIMAGE. <!-- New Letter -->23 March 1955 [Chile] Dr. Alejandro Reid <span data-pg='336'/> </span>Faithfully yours,Leroy Ioas Secretary-General.Dear Bahá’í Brother:Your letter of March 6th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.As regards your question about leaving Punta Arenas, the Guardian hopes that you will not feel discouraged over the situation there. Sometimes personalities conflict, entirely aside from the purity of the teacher and his devotion to the Faith.As you know, the Guardian’s chief concern is that a Spiritual Assembly should be maintained in Punta Arenas; and he thinks that you should decide, with the South America National Assembly, the matter of your departure. As far as he is concerned, if someone goes to take your place, or the Assembly can be maintained without your presence, you are free to proceed elsewhere and serve the Faith, as he knows you always will, wherever you are.In connection with your question about <q class=''>“The Dawn-Breakers”</q>, the footnotes in French might well be left in the original language if the Latin Americans are more or less acquainted with this language, as much as the average well-educated North American. If they are not, however, there is no objection to translating them and the English footnotes into Spanish.You may be sure that he will pray for the removal of your difficulties and for the advancement of the Faith in Punta Arenas.With warm Bahá’í greetings,R.

The situation is really very serious, and calls for the united spiritual appeals of the Bahá’ís that God may change the course of events, and change the persecutions into possible victories for the Faith.At this time there are two things essential for the believers outside of Persia. The first is to arise with renewed vigour in the teaching work, so that the curtailments in the teaching work we are now suffering in Persia will be more than offset by new victories in other parts of the world. The second is the hope that the widespread publicity which the Faith is receiving in both Persia and outside of Persia, will create still more interest in the Cause.The beloved Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf.

He feels sure that ultimately these persecutions will redound favourably to the Cause, and be the means of not only spreading but assisting the Faith in the establishment of the institutions of the Cause in Írán.At this particular hour when our Persian brothers are suffering, it is for the rest of the world to arise and carry the torch of the Cause higher, winning new victories on all fronts.The Guardian has the highest hopes for the development of the Faith in Mexico. He hopes you and the friends in Puebla will redouble your efforts and the Faith grow there, and from there to surrounding areas. It is the spirit of the time that our beloved Faith spread rapidly now. Its spiritual force is being felt everywhere and it remains for the Bahá’ís to be true instruments through which the Holy Spirit may be assured all peoples.

He feels sure that their activities will greatly reinforce the work, and strengthen the Faith in that area.He hopes your Assembly is doing all in its power to encourage the pioneers who have left their homes and gone out to neighbouring territories and islands under your jurisdiction. At all costs, these precious goals must be kept open and the work strengthened. This is the primary duty of your Assembly. In preparation for a greater degree of administrative responsibility in the near future, the Assemblies in the far-flung area over which you have jurisdiction should exert their utmost to strengthen their own foundations, to carry on extension teaching work in nearby centres, and to encourage any surplus members they may have-by <q class=''>“surplus”</q>, the Guardian means any number over fifteen—(providing the Assembly is firmly established) to go out and pioneer in new centres, or reinforce existing groups and assist in the creation of the greatly-needed future Spiritual Assemblies.The literature in Portuguese, he trusts, is being speedily expanded, as well as that in Spanish; and he urges your Assembly to bear in mind that shortly National Ḥa íratu’l-Quds will be needed in each country, and that the friends should begin to look about for suitable Centres that will under no circumstances be too expensive, nor too far out from the centre of the city.The Central and South American National Assemblies, in conjunction with their parent Body, the American National Spiritual Assembly, must ever-increasingly assume a greater degree of responsibility for the conduct of the Bahá’í affairs in the Western Hemisphere. The Guardian’s own work is steadily increasing, due to the wonderful expansion of the Faith all over the world; and National Assemblies must shoulder their full portion of work and responsibility, and thus assist him in lifting the heavy load of the Faith, a treasured and precious load!He will remember you all in his prayers in the holy Shrines, and supplicate that you may be guided and blessed in your endeavours. He deeply appreciates your services for the Faith and the spirit that animates you.With warm Bahá’í greetings, 343R. RabbáníP.S. Both groups and Assemblies in virgin areas should be very careful regarding publicity lest they arouse opposition and risk losing the hard-won goals so recently and painstakingly achieved.Dear and valued co-workers:The activities which the South American believers, under the guidance and through the impetus given by your Assembly to the forward march of the Faith in the South American Republics, have achieved in recent years constitutes a notable chapter in the history of the marvellous unfoldment of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh in Latin America. These successive historic achievements, in both the teaching and administrative spheres of Bahá’í service, may well be regarded as a befitting prelude to the opening of yet another chapter in the annals of the Faith in the South American continent-a chapter that will commemorate the emergence of Regional as well as independent National Assemblies which are destined, first indirectly and later directly, to play their part in the ultimate formation of the Supreme Legislative Body in the Bahá’í world-the International House of Justice.The work initiated throughout the virgin territories assigned, under the Ten Year Plan, to your Assembly has been successfully accomplished and is indeed highly meritorious in the sight of God. The first national a íratu’l-Quds of South America has been purchased. The land on which the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár in that continent is destined to be erected has already been acquired through the spontaneous and generous action of one of the South American believers long before the initiation of the Ten Year Plan. The translation and publication of Bahá’í literature in both the Spanish and Portuguese tongues has been vigorously undertaken and merits the highest praise.Though much has been accomplished in these spheres of Bahá’í activity, the work that still remains to be undertaken, prior to the emergence of the Regional National Assemblies of South America, is enormous and highly challenging. Time indeed is very short. A brief span of less than two years separates the South American Bahá’í Communities from the historic and shining goals they have set themselves to attain.A systematic effort of unexampled intensity, at once sustained and consecrated, must needs be exerted on the part of individuals, groups and Local and National Assemblies, in order to befittingly pave the way for the convocation of the forthcoming memorable Bahá’í Conventions and the subsequent election of the pivotal institutions that are to presage the definite establishment of the pillars of the Universal House of Justice in the South American continent.A rapid increase in the number of the avowed supporters of the Faith in every Republic of South America; a marked multiplication of groups, and particularly of Local Assemblies, in each of these Republics; the maintenance, at any cost, of those already functioning; a notable acceleration in the process of the incorporation of definitely established Local Spiritual Assemblies; the speedy purchase of the nine remaining National a íratu’l-Quds throughout the South American continent; the establishment of national endowments in each of the South American Republics; a notable advancement in the process of translating and publishing Bahá’í literature into American Indian languages, particularly those specified in the Ten Year Plan; the preservation and enhancement of the rich prizes so swiftly won in distant and virgin areas of the globe; the establishment of the Bahá’í Publishing Trust in the city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil-these must be accounted as the most pressing and challenging tasks confronting the valiant South American Bahá’í Communities in these crucial years-tasks which demand, on the part of individuals, groups and Assemblies, the utmost vigilance, unrelaxing resolution, constant and utter consecration, steady co-operation and exemplary self-sacrifice.The ordeal which our loved, long-suffering, steadfast brethren in the cradle of our Faith are now experiencing should spur on every would-be Bahá’í Crusader to rise to still nobler heights of heroism,  344to evince a still higher degree of courage, a greater self-abnegation, and a more whole-hearted dedication to the ideals, principles and purposes of our precious Faith, to the objectives of the stupendous global Crusade its adherents have launched, to the institutions its Founder has ordained, and to the Plan which the authorized Interpreter of its teachings has conceived.The eyes of the world are now upon those who bear the Bahá’í name. Its redoubtable foes fondly cherish the foolish hope of a decline in its fortunes and of its ultimate extinction. Our oppressed brethren cry out in their distress to the more privileged among their co-workers to arise and compensate for the loss they have sustained.Now is the time to display, in a never-to-be-forgotten way, those sterling qualities that will unmistakably proclaim, to foes and sceptics alike, the incorruptible grandeur of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh, and demonstrate the enduring verities on which it has been founded, and the creative, the regenerating and irresistible power which has brought it into being, which has sustained it to the present day, and which will, no doubt, continue to impel it forward until its destiny has been fully consummated.Your true brother, Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->17 August 1955 [Peru]Mr. and Mrs. Gaylord B.

If the Bahá’ís will arise with purity of purpose, dedication and consecration, the Faith will spread rapidly, and many will find immortality. Will the friends who are free arise and win new victories for the Cause of God, to offset the difficulties now being suffered by the Persian Bahá’ís?

RabbáníP.S. When the Faith receives a great blow or set-back in one country, such as has been the case in Persia, the friends in other parts of the world where there is freedom to teach, should hold aloft still higher the banner of this great Message, and thus prove to a waiting humanity that there is in this Cause a power which cannot be kept down nor defeated.

HowardDear Bahá’í Brother:Faithfully yours, Leroy IoasYour loving letter of November 2nd was received and presented to the beloved Guardian.It is the Guardian’s considered view that the time has come when Bahá’ís should establish the Bahá’í way of life, independent of any of the former attachments which individuals may have had, particularly if those attachments contain teachings or methods of operation which are contrary to the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.The Guardian feels therefore that membership in Masonic Lodges is not consistent with the pure teachings of the Faith, and that the time has now come when the believers should separate themselves from such membership.The instructions therefore contained in the message to the British National Spiritual Assembly and the United States National Spiritual Assembly apply universally.The Guardian hopes you and the other members of the Community in Mexico City will study this subject very carefully, realizing the unique opportunity, and at the same time the unique responsibility which you have in building up the Bahá’í way of life in that country, and firmly establishing one of the most important institutions of the Faith, namely, the Local Spiritual Assembly.The teachings of Bahá’u’lláh will establish a new way of life for humanity. Those who are Bahá’ís must endeavour to establish this way of life just as rapidly as possible. Now that the hour has arrived when the Bahá’í Faith is gaining prominence, and is being reviewed by so many peoples, it is <span data-pg='354'/> </span>necessary that the adherents of the Faith should live up to the high ideals of the Faith in every way. In this way they can demonstrate that the Bahá’í Faith does create a new way of life, which brings to the individual a complete association with the Will of God, and thus the establishment of a peaceful and universal society. Divisional attachments are of men, while universal service is of God.The Guardian is now anxious that all the friends achieve a universal consciousness and universal way of life.The Guardian hopes that you will be able to understand this matter in the proper light, and be helpful and instrumental in properly explaining it to the others of your Community who come from a Masonic background.The Guardian assures you and all of the friends of his prayers in their behalf. He sends them loving greetings.Faithfully yours,Leroy IoasThe adjustment should be wisely and cautiously made, not arbitrarily and drastically.

The thing we need at present is not only a wider knowledge of the Faith, but particularly a larger membership; and this only comes through consecrated individual effort to create friends, to attract the hearts of these friends to ourselves as Bahá’ís, to create in them an admiration for our character and our way of life, and then to confirm them in the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.He will pray in the holy Shrines that your efforts may be richly blessed, and that the Cause there may make rapid progress.With warm Bahá’í love,R.

Your contributions are greatly appreciated. Receipts are enclosed herewith.The Guardian greatly values your ceaseless service to the Cause of God. He is sure the Beloved Master will richly reward you for your sacrifice. Your consecration is the source of divine confirmations.The Guardian was happy to learn of the many Indian contacts. He hopes this is a prelude to some of them becoming Bahá’ís. He was likewise pleased to learn of the successful operation of the Institute, and of the fine services rendered by Miss Jennie Taylor. The Guardian asks that you express to her his appreciation, and assure her of his prayers in her behalf.The Guardian hopes your work in Guatemala will become the means of confirming new souls, who will arise to serve the Faith with diligence and vigour.He hopes the people you met in America who became enthused with the work in Latin America will now follow your footsteps and soon pioneer in one of the goal areas, or work with the Indians, as the case may be.The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf. He sends you his loving greetings. Faithfully yours,Leroy IoasYour loving letter of December 5th reached me on my return from a visit in Europe.It would appear you have in mind a very ambitious series of documents to be prepared, to give visual aid to the teaching work.I presume you had in mind making use of the booklet which has been issued, giving the growth of the Bahá’í Faith from 1844 to 1952 and outlining the plans of the Ten Year Crusade. This will give a world-wide picture in a statistical way, which may or may not be better than photographs. <span data-pg='360'/> </span>In other words, it would seem to me that some photographs of the Holy Places in various parts would be quite effective; but to go further than this for local teaching work in Chile might create a very ambitious programme. After all, the way to teach and get results is to teach, and direct teaching is most important.The other evening in discussing teaching work, the Guardian outlined four important steps, which I am taking the liberty of passing on to you. The steps which are required are prayer, meditation, study of the Holy Utterances and then action; and of great importance is that in action, the teacher should persevere under all circumstances. Self-sacrifice is a magnet for the confirmations of the Holy Spirit; and therefore if the action is in the realm of self-sacrifice, it is sure to produce results. The friends should be prepared to sacrifice freely for the success of the Faith. When this is done, it will produce results.I am enclosing herewith one or two pamphlets and clippings from magazines etc., indicating the manner in which the Faith has been publicized in Israel. I hope these may be helpful to you.With every good wish, I am,9 February 1956 [Argentina]Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Buenos AiresCare of Miss Maria K. de Corradi, Secretary Dear Bahá’í Friends:Faithfully yours, Leroy IoasYour letter of January 30th has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.Your contribution to the <q class=''>“Save the Persecuted Fund”</q> is deeply appreciated. The beloved Guardian was deeply touched by this contribution of the friends to the Fund for the relief of the suffering of the Persian Bahá’ís. Many of them have suffered quite seriously; but they are reassured by the material help which has come to them from the friends throughout the world.Of even greater importance than the material help is the manner in which the Bahá’ís all over the world arise to retrieve the set-back which the Faith has suffered in Persia, due to these persecutions. If the friends everywhere will arise with renewed effort to gain new victories, that will compensate for the set-back in Persia and the suffering of the Persian Bahá’ís. The Guardian therefore hopes that all of the friends of Argentina and South America will arise with renewed effort to spread the message far and wide, and to confirm many souls in the Faith.He assures you of his prayers in your behalf, and sends you his loving greetings. Faithfully yours,Leroy IoasP.S.

The work of Dr. Malcom King has indeed been exemplary to the highest degree! He hopes that the different racial groups will be well represented in the Community.He is urging the Bahá’ís everywhere to try and have the Bahá’í Community representative of the population of the country insofar as possible; in other words, where the majority of the people are Hindus, to try and have a majority of Hindu Bahá’ís; where the majority are Christian, Christian; where the majority are Negroes, Negroes, etc. In this way the Cause is more deeply identified with the life of the people of the country.He was also pleased to hear that your Community is now strong enough to offer assistance to neighbouring territories.

Although publicity is very important, he advises your committee to encourage the Bahá’ís to teach individuals in their homes through friendship and kindness, and confirm them in the Faith. In spite of the fact that it is important for more and more people to know of the existence of our Faith, the most important thing of all, especially now in preparation for the future National Assemblies throughout South America, is to confirm more Bahá’ís and establish more Spiritual Assemblies.

There certainly is no objection to the contributions being made directly to the Guardian.

It marks indeed an important step forward in the history of the Cause in that country, one of the few Latin American countries whose Bahá’í history began already in the days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Himself.He attaches great importance to the spread of the Faith in Brazil, which is a country not only vast in size, but in potentialities, and which has proved itself to be a melting-pot for people of different nationalities. It has certainly a great future in the Faith and in the world.He was happy to know that so many of the Persian Bahá’ís have been able to migrate to Brazil; and hopes that they will make a special point of settling in centres where they can easily, because of their numerical strength, help form new Spiritual Assemblies, and thus broaden the foundation upon which the future Regional Assembly for that area will be formed, and eventually the National Assembly.He assures you all of his loving prayers for your success in the teaching work.

No doubt one of the friends there will be kind enough to translate it into Portuguese for you, as there is nobody here who could do so.It is with the greatest joy that our Guardian welcomes you into the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. As you have no doubt heard, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá attached great importance to teaching the Faith to the original inhabitants of America, in other words, the Indians; and said that when they became Bahá’ís, their people would have a very great destiny, similar to the role which was played by the original population of Arabia after accepting the Prophet Muḥammad. Unfortunately there are not enough Indian Bahá’ís; and he hopes that you will be a means of attracting others, not only of your own tribe, but of other tribes, to the Cause of God. There is no service you could render to your people, or at the present time to the Bahá’í Faith, which would be greater than this.He assures you of his loving prayers for your success, and sends you his warmest greetings.With Bahá’í love, 369R.

Receipt is attached hereto.The Guardian was happy to receive your outline of the situation surrounding the teaching work in Puebla, and of the efforts being made by the friends to spread the Glad Tidings of the coming of the Kingdom of God. The Guardian strongly urges the friends in Puebla to rededicate themselves to the great task ahead of them, so that the Faith may become firmly established in your promising city, and in turn may spread its influence to the surrounding areas.So far as the use of the land which constitutes the endowment for Mexico, the Guardian feels this is a matter which can be determined by the National Assembly for Central America, in consultation of course with the friends in Puebla. He has no instructions, whatsoever, to give, feeling that this is an internal matter, subject to the direction of the National Assembly. He feels strongly, however, that nothing should be done that will interfere in any way with the teaching work, as that is the supreme goal of the present time. <span data-pg='370'/> </span>The Guardian assures you and the friends in Puebla of his deep appreciation of their sacrificial services, and of his prayers in your behalf, and sends each and every one his loving greetings.Faithfully yours,Leroy Ioas cc: National Spiritual Assembly Central America <!-- New Letter -->3 May 1956 [Peru] Mrs. Gayle Woolson Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your letter of April 11th, as well as the photograph you kindly sent, has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He has just received the very welcome news conveyed in the cable from the South American Convention of the increase of Assemblies and Centres.

The spirit which has now been released among the friends must flood over the entire country, and thus establish more Assemblies, more groups and more isolated centres during the coming year.

When they co-operate with each other to achieve their objectives, they receive divine inspiration and assistance, which otherwise would be denied them. Unity is like a mirror, which attracts the rays of the sun of God’s bounty.The very generous gift which Mrs. Guillon has made of some land constituting the national endowment for Chile was deeply appreciated, as well as the correspondingly generous and loving gift of Mrs. Armstrong, made for the same purpose in Brazil. He would like your Assembly to please thank these dear friends on his behalf for their constant devotion to the Faith and their generosity in helping to create its institutions.The news of the arrival of so many Persian immigrants in Brazil augurs well for the development of new centres in that country. He feels that your Assembly should urge these Bahá’ís to settle as families or groups in new cities, where they form a nucleus of new Spiritual Assemblies, and not to congregate in the centres where there are already Assemblies. <span data-pg='376'/> </span>It was a great pleasure to him to receive a member of the South American National Assembly as his guest here in Haifa, and to feel this renewed contact through the pilgrims with the believers of Latin America.The remarkable progress which has been made in the purchase of the Ḥa íratu’l-Quds for the different South American Republics, as well as the commencement in obtaining the endowments for each of these Republics, has encouraged him greatly; and he feels sure that these buildings will be a rallying-point for the Bahá’ís, and inspire them and help them in their teaching work, as well as attracting the attention of the public to the Faith.As regards the question you asked him about whether Nengre, which has already been translated, may be substituted for Arawak, he approves of this in view of the fact that there is no written language for Arawak. If the believers find that there are any other languages in common use amongst the indigenous population in South America, they could choose one of these as a substitute for Arawak, and thereby add an additional language to those chosen under the Ten Year Plan. He leaves this matter to the discretion of your Assembly.He hopes that, during the coming year, the Bahá’ís labouring in South America will, encouraged by the sight of the feats they have accomplished already, forge ahead on the teaching front and establish many new centres and Assemblies.His loving prayers and thoughts will be offered on their behalf and for all of you on the National Body who are so arduously and conscientiously toiling to lay the foundations of Bahá’u’lláh’s World Order in that important continent of the globe.As regards the question about spiritualism, the Guardian does not feel that this is the time for him to make any special statement on this subject. Visiting teachers and the National Body must make every effort to wean the friends away from these practices, but we must not make too much of an issue of it at the moment. There are more important things for the friends to concentrate their attention upon, namely, the establishment of new Assemblies and groups.Your letter of June 5th has also been received and the Guardian wishes me to acknowledge it on his behalf.He assures you all of his most loving prayers for your success. With warm Bahá’í greetings,R. RabbáníDear and valued co-workers:The remarkable expansion of the activities of the South American Bahá’í Community, both at home, and in the territories assigned to it, in accordance with the provisions of the Ten Year Plan, particularly during the last twelve months, has been highly encouraging, and has served to deepen my admiration for the devotion of its members to the Faith and my confidence in their ultimate success. The Community now stands on the threshold of a new era in the evolution of the Faith in Latin America. The rapidity with which the nascent institutions of a divinely appointed Order have developed, first under the direct supervision of the United States National Assembly, and, in later years, under the guidance of your Assembly, has paved the way for the opening of such a glorious Chapter in the history of the Faith in Latin America. The loyalty of the members of this Community, their high and persistent endeavours, their inflexible resolve, their vigilance, perseverance, and self-sacrifice have, no doubt, <span data-pg='377'/> </span>hastened the attainment of such a landmark in the evolution of the Cause of God in that continent. I truly marvel at the vastness of the work accomplished, the multiplicity of the activities which have been initiated, the steady consolidation of the institutions that have been created, the increasing maturity of the rank and file of the believers, their unity and solidarity, and the growing evidences of their ability to conduct, independently and efficiently, the affairs of the Faith, and to carry it a stage further along the road leading to its eventual triumph and the fulfilment of its high destiny.Particularly gratifying has been the success that has attended, in the course of the past year, the exertions of your Assembly to multiply the institutions of the Faith, to establish its administrative centres, to purchase its endowments, to swell the number of its supporters, to enlarge both the local and national Funds designed to support its institutions, to expand its literature, and consolidate the foundations laid by its pioneers. The Concourse on high cannot but applaud such vigorous action, such concerted effort, such selfless devotion, such dogged perseverance, such fidelity to the wishes of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and such unwavering determination to achieve their part of the global task entrusted to His loved ones under the Ten Year Plan.Though much has been achieved, in divers fields of Bahá’í activity, the year destined to usher in this highly promising era, which is to witness the erection of the pillars of the Universal House of Justice in that vast continent, must needs witness a still greater consecration on the part of the South American believers, young and old of both sexes, whether veterans or newly enrolled, at home as well as in the newly opened territories, in both the teaching and administrative fields, and in spite of any obstacles, however formidable, that may stand in their way.As the day approaches when the long-awaited provisional Regional Assemblies will have emerged, an effort, on the part of each and all members of this valiant, this firmly established, great — hearted, high-minded Community, more determined and consecrated than ever before; a spirit of heroism nobler than any that has thus far been displayed; a courage more inspiring than that which has animated them thus far; and a self-abnegation unsurpassed since the inception of the Faith in Latin America, must needs be displayed, in order to adequately meet the challenge of the mountainous tasks that are to be faced in the future, and to discharge befittingly the responsibilities which are soon to confront them.The multiplication of isolated centres, groups and Assemblies must, meanwhile, continue unabated. The process of the incorporation of Local Assemblies must not be allowed to lag. The establishment of Bahá’í endowments must be speeded up. The efforts exerted to enrol a great number of American Indians under the banner of the Faith must be redoubled. The translation of Bahá’í literature into the Spanish, the Portuguese and the Indian languages must be given a tremendous impetus. The newly opened territories, won over at the cost of so much sacrifice, must, under no circumstances, be jeopardized, but rather should be closely watched and consolidated. The number of the adherents of the Faith must be considerably increased and given first priority by your Assembly. Above all, the spirit animating its avowed supporters must, through every possible means, be fortified, and enriched.The South American Bahá’í Community, through the qualities it exhibits, the acts it has performed, the strides it has made, the fame it has won, ranks high amongst its sister communities both in the Western Hemisphere and throughout the Bahá’í world.The Author of the Cause it serves so diligently and devotedly is well pleased with the range of the exertions of this Community, the victories it has successively won, the bright prospects now opening before it. His manifold blessings will, no doubt, be fully and unreservedly vouchsafed to its members, without exception, if they but persevere along the path they have chosen to tread.I will, in my admiration for their high endeavours, for their extraordinary progress, and their enduring achievements, continue to pray for them all, with redoubled ardour, that they may, in the days <span data-pg='378'/> </span>to come, march to victory, and enrich immeasurably the annals of God’s Cause in that highly promising continent. <!-- New Letter -->30 June 1956 [Panama]National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Central AmericaCare of Mr. Esteban Canales L., Secretary Dear Bahá’í Friends:ShoghiYour letters of October 28, 1955 and January 5, 1956, with enclosures, have been received by the beloved Guardian; and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He has been made very happy over the news of the progress of the Faith throughout Latin America during the past year. Especially the purchase of all of the Ḥa íratu’l-Quds and the commencement in obtaining the national endowments have been very encouraging, and show that the believers are full of vitality and determination. He feels sure that these buildings will be a rallying — point for the local communities, and a marked asset in teaching the Faith to the public. He hopes that, during the coming year, every Central American Republic will have its Ḥa íratu’l-Quds and its national endowment; and that there will be a tremendous increase in the number of Bahá’ís, groups and Assemblies, throughout the area under the jurisdiction of your Assembly.The friends must be made to realize that the increase of Assemblies, in other words, teaching work, is the most important of their activities, because on the achievements in this field must rest the foundations of the future independent National Assemblies throughout that area-National Assemblies which will supersede in not very many years’ time the Regional Assemblies to be elected next April. Therefore, too much attention cannot be given to the teaching work.Far from feeling discouraged, the Bahá’ís must look upon the tremendous advantages they possess. They not only have the vision of the future, but Bahá’u’lláh has placed in their hands the means of attaining it; namely, His Administrative Order and its institutions.To the degree to which the friends learn to function lovingly and harmoniously, in full consultation and co-operation, will be the degree of their success in attracting new souls, and creating new Assemblies.It was a great pleasure to him to receive here one of the Central American Community members as a pilgrim. The news which the pilgrims can bring of the activities in their region is always most welcome; and the fact that they have been able to visit the holy Shrines, and can carry back to their Community fresh inspiration, is indeed a great privilege and bounty. He hopes the day will come when many of the friends from Latin America can make the pilgrimage.The pioneers which the Central American friends have been able to send out to different parts of the globe should indeed be a great source of comfort and inspiration to them. When they realize what the young couple, Mr. and Mrs. Fernie, have achieved in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, they must feel truly awestruck and proud, as well as challenged to follow in their footsteps. <span data-pg='379'/> </span>He hopes that, during the coming year, many more of the Latin friends will arise to reinforce the weak points, go out into the virgin territories, and become more active in every way they can in the teaching work on the home front.He assures you all and, through you, the believers whom you represent, that he will remember you all in the holy Shrines, and pray for your success in every field of Bahá’í activity.With warm Bahá’í love, R. RabbáníDear and valued co-workers:I have, in recent years, and particularly during the year just concluded, noted, with increasing admiration and hope, the remarkable progress achieved by the Central American Bahá’í community in the discharge of their manifold responsibilities under the Ten Year Plan. The task entrusted to them is admittedly vast, complex and highly challenging. Thus far, though their resources are still inadequate, their numbers small, and their experience limited, they have through their response to the call that has been sounded, and the demonstration of the quality of their devotion and the character of their faith, as well as through the range of their accomplishments, amply justified the hopes which I, as well as their parent community, have cherished for them. No less is the admiration felt by their sister communities the world over for their notable share in the prosecution of the world spiritual Crusade, now engaging the attention of the entire Bahá’í world.The purchase of the administrative headquarters of the elected representatives of all the national communities in Central America; the establishment of Bahá’í endowments; the opening of the virgin territories assigned to them; the consolidation of the home front through the multiplication of isolated centres, and groups and Assemblies; the steady increase in the number of the newly enrolled believers; the splendid work initiated among the Central American Indians; the incorporation of Local Assemblies, the purchase of the Temple site in Panama-these stand out as the most significant among the collective achievements of this valiant, forward-marching, steadily consolidating, much loved community.The work, so auspiciously inaugurated, and now so vigorously pursued, is, however, still in the early stages of its development. The forthcoming formation of two Regional Assemblies, marking yet another milestone along the road leading that community towards the achievement of its high destiny, must lend an unprecedented impetus to the advancement of the Faith, in all spheres of activity, both at home and abroad, thus paving the way for, and hastening the fulfilment of, the final and most glorious objective of the Plan-the emergence of an independent National Spiritual Assembly in each of the Republics of Central America and the Antilles.Particular emphasis should be placed upon the twin immediate objectives, calling for the sustained and undivided attention of the Central American Bahá’í community, namely the further consolidation of the home front through a still more rapid multiplication of the avowed supporters of the Faith, of isolated centres, groups, and Assemblies, as well as through the preservation of the newly opened territories.A more universal participation on the part of the rank and file of the believers in these meritorious and urgent tasks, a greater degree of heroic self-sacrifice, a fuller measure of consecration, and a more dogged perseverance, are the pressing needs of the present hour.Every obstacle barring the way must be speedily surmounted. Every other consideration must be subordinated to the inescapable demands of this world-encompassing, majestically advancing Crusade. <span data-pg='380'/> </span>The confidence of those brave warriors crusading for Bahá’u’lláh must, above all, remain unshaken. Set-backs, if any, should, far from dampening their zeal, spur them on to more strenuous efforts, and impel them to achieve still nobler victories.The Author of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, as recorded by His own infallible Pen, watches over their historic labours, and will unfailingly sustain, bless and crown their high endeavours. The Author of the Faith Himself has unmistakably promised to vouchsafe His aid to whomsoever will arise to aid His Cause.Nothing short of active and continued participation in the manifold activities of this mighty and divinely propelled Plan can ensure the flow of that divine grace that can alone bring about its final consummation.May this community, so youthful, so virile, that can well boast, among its exploits, so stirring a victory as that recently achieved by two of its former members in a distant island of the South Pacific, add fresh laurels to the crown it has already won, and contribute still more notably, through still more brilliant achievements, in its homeland as well as in distant fields, to the enrichment of the annals of the Faith in Latin America.Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->30 June 1956 [Panama] Mr. Esteban Canales Dear Bahá’í Brother:The beloved Guardian is anxious to complete his roster of the cities throughout the world where there are Bahá’ís.He is very anxious therefore to receive from you the record of the Assemblies, groups and isolated centres in Central America, as of May 1st, 1956.Can you hurry the compilation of this record and send it on to me, for him, at an early day.

Receipt is enclosed herewith.The Guardian is very hopeful that the friends will arise with renewed effort and complete consecration, so the light of divine guidance may be spread over all of South America. In the hands of the believers is the greatest power for the elevation of the peoples, if they only become purified reeds through which this Holy Spirit may bring its healing to the seekers. If the believers will arise in this manner, proclaiming the Glad Tidings, many will gain eternal life. <span data-pg='382'/> </span>The Guardian will pray for your Assembly, for the success of your work, and for the winning of many spiritual victories by the friends generally.He sends you his loving greetings. <!-- New Letter -->30 July 1956 [Panama]Mr. Esteban Canales, SecretaryCentral American National Spiritual AssemblyDear Bahá’í Brother:Faithfully yours, Leroy IoasPlease consider this as a postscript added to the letter of the beloved Guardian recently mailed you; since writing it he has received your letter of June 15th.As regards questions raised in this letter: Local Assemblies established in the virgin American areas cannot participate in the election of the Regional National Spiritual Assemblies. As Jamaica has already participated in the establishment of the Central American National Spiritual Assembly it may participate in the elections for the Regional National Spiritual Assembly. Bermuda likewise, as it is not a virgin area.The islands around Nassau should be on the isolated list, and, as the number of believers increases, form their own Local Assemblies.The Guardian has instructed the Bahá’ís everywhere that they should withdraw from Masonic lodges. What Mr. Ioas wrote applies to Central America.Another pioneer should by all means be sent to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands as the situation there has improved. The Guardian attaches the greatest importance to this.It is quite correct to appoint National Teaching Committees for the virgin areas to promote the work there.The Guardian sends you all his loving greetings,With Bahá’í love,R. RabbáníP.S. He will specially pray for the success of the activities of the two National Teaching Committees. <!-- New Letter -->31 July 1956 [Guatemala] Mrs. Louise CaswellDear Bahá’í Sister: <span data-pg='383'/> </span>Your loving letter of July 20th has come duly to hand, and the Guardian has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf. The contribution which you have made to the International Fund is greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed herewith.The beloved Guardian was very happy to review the map, with your notations thereon, showing the number of Indian Bahá’ís. He feels this is a real victory for the Faith, as the Master has spoken so often of the strength of character and latent capacity of the original peoples of the American continent. Thus, the quickening of some of them is a historic turning-point in the activity of the Faith, as well as the life of these people.The Guardian greatly values your devoted service in this field of activity. You were the first to respond to the call for pioneers in Latin America, and helped establish the Assembly in the city mentioned by the Master in the Tablets of the Divine Plan. Thus you have ever widened the sphere of your activities, which are a source of happiness to the Beloved Master, and to the Guardian.The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf. He sends you his loving greetings.Faithfully yours, Leroy Ioas <!-- New Letter -->1 August 1956 [Panama] Mr. Esteban Canales Dear Bahá’í Friends:Your loving letter of July 19th has just come to hand, enclosing a list of the Local Assemblies, Groups, and Isolated Centres in the territories under your jurisdiction.The Guardian is very pleased with the showing made, and the accomplishments of the past year. He wishes the friends generally to know of how much he values their devoted services, and the remarkable manner in which they have arisen to spread the Faith. He hopes they will arise with renewed vigour, as the time is ripe for many seeking souls to find eternal life through the life-giving breezes of the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. What is required is consecration, devotion, and perseverance in teaching, on the part of each and every Bahá’í. May your and their efforts be confirmed by the Holy Spirit.The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf.

This will necessitate an increase in the number of Local Assemblies, as well as groups and isolated centres in each country.The Guardian has received word of the status of the teaching work in Mexico, that vast country immediately adjoining the United States on the south, and which should have a strong dynamic Bahá’í community, with many Local Assemblies and centres. From these reports, which I have received and presented to the Guardian, it would seem the present Assemblies, only three in number, are quite weak, and need strengthening at once. Likewise, the groups are few in number. Furthermore, literature for teaching purposes is not available, particularly <q class=''>“Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era”</q>.Now that your secretary, as a board member, is travelling in Mexico, no doubt he can give you first hand information as to the situation, and what can and should be done to help out in the teaching work in Mexico.The Guardian calls attention to the great importance of Mexico, the largest of all the countries under your jurisdiction. He hopes your Assembly will be able to give special attention to its needs, and that the United States Assembly will be of assistance, because of its proximity, and unity of interests. If copies of <q class=''>“Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era”</q> are not available, no doubt the United States National Assembly can aid in providing them.With loving Bahá’í greetings, I am, <span data-pg='385'/> </span>Copy toU.S. National Spiritual Assembly Mexico Teaching Committee <!-- New Letter -->12 August 1956 [Chile] Dr. Alexander Reid Dear Bahá’í Brother:Faithfully yours, Leroy IoasThe beloved Guardian has received your letter of July 5th, and has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He was distressed to hear of the difficult conditions which exist in Santiago.This is a problem which the Local Spiritual Assembly should endeavour to resolve. If it is not possible for that body to clear it up, then the National Spiritual Assembly must certainly do so. It is important that such matters be settled, for the protection of the Faith.The Guardian assures you he deeply appreciates your watchful vigilance in the interests of the Cause. He trusts that, through the wisdom, firmness and loving unity of the believers on the administrative bodies, this condition may soon be straightened out.With warm Bahá’í greetings,R.

He has directed me to respond to your queries as follows:1. The Báb wrote a Tablet to Himself, which makes the twenty facsimiles shown in <q class=''>“The Dawn — Breakers”</q>. The original issues all had tissue sheets between the facsimiles, showing to whom they were addressed.2. All of the dates should have been shown as A.D. Apparently, the printer used A.H. (after the Hegira), but did not change from A.D. time to A.H. time. Thus you should use A.D. for all the dates.3. This is correct. The answer given did not refer to Quddús, but to Mullá Ḥusayn, as indicated on page 407; whereas on page 409, the reference is to Quddús, whose name was Muḥammad-‘Alí. In other words, on page 407, the respondent did not reply to the question asked, but talked about Mullá Ḥusayn instead.The question which you ask, concerning membership in the Mason Lodges, is one which the National Assembly should answer. The Guardian has clearly outlined the Bahá’í attitude toward membership in this organization-and its application is left to the National Assemblies, as to when and how it is to be applied. He would suggest if there are differences of opinion, the matter should be referred to your National Assembly.The Guardian sends you his loving greetings.

As you know, he is immensely proud of your pioneering work in that distant and inaccessible island, and attaches great importance to your presence there.If the American government should command you to return, as a citizen you would have no alternative but to obey. However, if they merely advise you to leave, he does not think you would have to follow this advice unless you wanted to. During the present crisis in this part of the world, the American Bahá’ís serving here have been advised to leave; but they have explained that they did not wish to, because of their Bahá’í services; and that has been quite acceptable to the American representatives in this country.Wherever the friends are, they must obey the government in all matters that do not affect the doctrines of their Faith.Please give his loving greetings to Mrs. McKinnon, and assure her that he remembers her in his prayers, and admires very much her devoted spirit.He will pray for you in the holy Shrines, that God may richly reward and bless you.With warmest Bahá’í greetings,R.

He advises this because in that way it gives the trustees of the Faith freedom to do the right thing, whereas if you make out a legal document that forces them to use your land just for this one purpose, it might cause complications in the future.In any case the present piece of land or the one ultimately chosen will forever be associated with your generosity and love.He deeply appreciates the devotion you both have for the Faith, and hopes you will be instrumental in confirming many souls. <span data-pg='392'/> </span>He will pray for you both in the holy Shrines.With loving greetings,R.

There is no greater service anyone can render today, than to pioneer, and establish a new Assembly. The more difficult the post, the more meritorious the deeds, and the greater spiritual rewards which will come to one.

Please express to her his appreciation, and assure her of his prayers on her behalf.He hopes you will be able to confirm some native Indians, as they are the original inhabitants of that important land-and the spirit of the Faith will cause them to shine as brilliant stars in service to their fellows, and in the progress of the country.The Guardian will pray for your daughter, that her operation may be entirely successful.

Also we must remember that every religion springs from some root, and just as Christianity sprang from Judaism, our own religion sprang from Islám, and that is why so many of the teachings deduce their proofs from Islám.The Guardian is happy to see that you have found a devoted partner with whom to serve in life, and he will pray for you, your wife, and your child.With warmest Bahá’í greetings,R.

The first Seven Year Plan, launched by the American Bahá’í Community, during the turbulent years preceding the Second World War, had, as its prime objective, the systematic introduction of the Faith and the diffusion of its light throughout each of those Republics. The Plan which immediately succeeded it, and whose inception synchronized with the world-wide celebrations commemorating the centenary of the birth of the Mission of the Báb, led, as it unfolded, to the emergence of the two Regional Spiritual Assemblies representing the newly-fledged Communities of South and Central America, whilst the third stage in the development of this mighty process-a stage initiated on the <span data-pg='405'/> </span>occasion of the centenary of the Mission of the Founder of our Faith-was marked by a steady consolidation of the local as well as the national institutions established in the course of the two previous Plans.So auspicious an event, heralding the formation, as the present Ten Year Plan approaches its culmination, of twenty National Spiritual Assemblies, within an area extending from the southern confines of the Great Republic of the West to the extremity of Chile, should be signalized by the initiation, on the part of these interim Regional Spiritual Assemblies, of four subsidiary Six Year Plans, designed to swell, to an unprecedented degree, the number of the avowed adherents of the Faith in each of these twenty Republics, to multiply the groups and isolated centres, as well as the Local Spiritual Assemblies constituting the bedrock of the newly established Administrative Order; to incorporate all firmly grounded Local Spiritual Assemblies; to obtain recognition from the civil authorities of the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate and of the Bahá’í Holy Days; to consolidate the work already commenced in the newly opened virgin territories within their jurisdiction; to initiate four regional Bahá’í Funds; to lend an impetus to the translation, the publication and dissemination of Bahá’í Literature; to add to the number of the existing Summer Schools; to stimulate the process of the conversion of both the Negroes and the American Indians, and ensure their active participation in the administration of the affairs of Bahá’í communities; to expedite the establishment of the Bahá’í Publishing Trust in the capital city of Brazil; and to select and purchase in each of the Republics, as yet deprived of a site for its future Mother Temple, a plot suitable for this highly meritorious purpose.I call upon the American Bahá’í Community, which, in pursuance of the Mandate issued in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, has, as far back as two decades ago, set in motion so momentous a process, and succeeded, in the course of three successive Plans, in extending and consolidating it, and particularly on the national elected representatives of this Community, and the Committee serving as the chief agency for the promotion of this historic task, to extend, through both material and moral support, as well as through a steady flow of Bahá’í pioneers and visiting teachers, the necessary assistance that will ensure the uninterrupted prosecution and ultimate fruition of one of the weightiest enterprises launched in the course of the execution of this Community’s glorious Mission in foreign fields.May these Communities, now standing on the threshold of unprecedented achievements, which have already, through their collective endeavours, ennobled the record of Bahá’í accomplishments during the last twenty years of the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation, who are so notably contributing, through their divers national characteristics, to the enrichment of the life of the International Bahá’í Community, be vouchsafed a still fuller measure of celestial strength, that will enable them to fulfil their high destiny in the years to come, and play their part in hastening the world — wide triumph of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh and the firm establishment of its embryonic World Order.April 1957 <!-- New Letter -->7 April 1957 [NSA South America, Peru]ShoghiHAS BAHÁ́’Í PUBLISHING TRUST BRAZIL BEEN FORMED, AND WHEN.

He seemed to be in Israel in connection with some fellowship having to do with fish culture.He visited with some of the members of the International Council here at the offices of the International Bahá’í Council. He stated at one time he was a Bahá’í, having come into the Faith at the time of the early teaching efforts in Mexico City when Pedro Espinoza was active. He said he did not know much about the Faith at that time and subsequently when the problems arose over Espinoza he discontinued attendance and has not been attending any Bahá’í meetings since.However since seeing the beautiful Shrine and gardens here, his interest has been renewed.

He has been so enveloped in work, it was impossible for him to review all of the papers carefully before this time. He now directs me to write you that he feels that it would be unwise at this time for you to carry on any further correspondence with President Eisenhower. The President is certainly a most remarkable man; anxious to assist and to serve the downtrodden in all parts of the world, and his service to mankind has been most effective.He is so busy that the Guardian feels it would be unwise to take up his time unless there is some real emergency at stake. Now that conditions are improving in Persia, he thinks it would be unwise to carry on correspondence with the President. However as the door seems to be opened a little, he thinks that later on if any serious problems arise in any part of the world, it might be well for you to again take the matter up with the Guardian, so that he could advise you at that time.The beloved Guardian deeply values your devoted and sacrificial services to the Cause. He will pray for you and for the success of your work. He hopes that many seeking souls will find eternal life through your devoted and sacrificial efforts. He sends you his loving greetings.Faithfully yours, [Leroy Ioas]July 1, 1957Mrs. Dee Worth, SecretaryNational Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the Greater AntillesDear Bahá’í’ Sister:Your communications, together with enclosures, have arrived safely, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf, and to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated May 5 and 17.He was very happy to see the photographs of your convention and the new Assembly, and has placed the latter in the mansion, where the visiting friends can enjoy seeing the members of this new national body.It was a great disappointment, he knows, to the Haitian believers to be deprived at the last moment of acting as host to this historic convention, also of not being able to send their delegates to Jamaica. However, whenever the situation improves in that part of the world and circumstances permit, they have the assurance of knowing that the seat of the national body will be in Port-au-Prince, so they can afford to be patient.Your Assembly was certainly born in a very auspicious atmosphere, and he hopes that the love, unity and enthusiasm which pervaded the convention will animate you all during the coming year, and, through you, stream out to the communities it is your privilege to serve and guide. More important than any material consideration is the spirit which animates the believers and their administrative bodies. When the spirit is right, the blessings will be far greater, because they can flow unhindered through a pure channel. The degree to which all over the world the Bahá’í community is becoming representative of the vast majority of the human race, in other words, non-whites, is very salutary. As the majority of the people in at least three countries under your Assembly’s jurisdiction are negro, they will, he hopes, become the predominating element in the communities. However, the minorities, Spanish, Americans etc. should receive attention also, in order to demonstrate the representative character of our Faith and <span data-pg='415'/> </span>the extreme kindness we always show to those who are minorities, in order to compensate them for what is a disability in political circles, but not in our Faith.The most important work of all is the teaching work, and he hopes you will encourage the friends all the time to go forth and teach. You must help the believers to realize that ultimately it is upon each individual that the progress of the Faith depends. The Bahá’ís are prone to attaching too much emphasis to their being on Assemblies and committees. This kind of work is essential, because somebody has to do it, but it is not the most important. The individual responsibility to teach the Faith is the most important thing of all, and this has been clearly pointed out by Bahá’u’lláh, Himself.There is a tendency, a very natural one, of administrative bodies to want to administer, and consequently to build up rules and regulations, and deluge the friends with admonitions. The Guardian has seen this take place so many times in his own experience in watching over the interests of our Faith, that he feels it wise to warn you against allowing this tendency to creep upon you unawares, so to speak. There must be a free flow of strength, stimulation and energy going out to all the centres, and not a flow of detailed instructions. To the degree to which your Assembly is able to accomplish this, will it demonstrate its maturity. To complicate matters is invariably a sign of immaturity; true wisdom is to simplify them.He feels sure this is going to be a wonderful year of achievement in that area. The fact that what were previously the Central American and South American National Spiritual Assemblies have split up into four new regional bodies cannot but of itself strengthen the work, and stimulate and challenge the friends. It also, through making it more wieldy, by compromising a smaller unit, enables your Assembly to carry on its affairs in a much more efficient manner. Naturally this applies equally to your three sister Latin American Assemblies.You may be sure that, as you carry forward your activities, formulate the details of your Six Year Plan, aid the friends to spread the Faith, increase your Assemblies, groups and isolated centres — in short, in all that you do — you will be surrounded by his most loving prayers, and he will be eagerly anticipating a row of sizeable and concrete victories presented to your second convention next Riḍván.With warm Bahá’í greetings, R. RabbáníDear and valued co-workers:The emergence of an independent Bahá’í community in the Greater Antilles, attested by the formation of a separate Regional Spiritual Assembly for that area, situated between the North and South American continents, is a clear and convincing indication of the remarkable progress achieved, in recent years, by the followers of the Faith both in Central America and the neighbouring islands. The work already achieved by the members of this valiant community, both in its quality and range, and despite formidable obstacles, is indeed worthy of the highest praise, and augurs well for the eventual formation of a separate National Assembly in each of the islands and republics included in that area.A task of unprecedented significance and highly challenging in its nature now confronts the members of this steadfast, consecrated and virile community. The obstacles standing in their path are varied and numerous. The field in which their elected representatives are called upon to operate is admittedly vast, and its pitfalls are many and far from negligible. Nothing short of a continuous and systematic effort, and an unyielding determination to tear down every barrier obstructing their path, and a whole-hearted consecration to the collective enterprise they have embarked upon, can ensure, during the fast fleeting years which lie immediately ahead, the attainment of their goals and the opening of a still more glorious chapter in the annals of their Faith in that highly-promising region. <span data-pg='416'/> </span>The Six Year Plan, launched on the morrow of their first historic convention, should be regarded as the primary and effectual instrument for the achievement of the goals they are now summoned to attain. Its most vital objective-the rapid and unprecedented increase of the number of the avowed supporters of the Faith throughout that area-must receive the earnest and immediate consideration of all those who share in the prosecution of this Plan. Simultaneously, a concerted effort on the part of the members of this community and their elected representatives must be made to ensure the multiplication of isolated centres, of groups and of Local Assemblies, for the purpose of broadening and reinforcing the foundations of a steadily rising Administrative Order. All firmly grounded Assemblies must, moreover, be incorporated in order to strengthen still further the basis of these newly fledged administrative institutions. Equally important is the obligation to secure from the authorities concerned recognition of the Bahá’í marriage certificates as well as of the Bahá’í holy days. Particular attention should be directed to the work initiated in the newly opened territories allocated to the former National Assembly of Central America and of the Greater Antilles, for the purpose of enlarging the scope, and of contributing to the stability, of the institutions so laboriously erected in those regions. The establishment of Bahá’í summer schools and the dissemination of Bahá’í literature, are, furthermore, objectives of vital importance which should, under no circumstances, be either forgotten or neglected. And, last but not least, the selection and purchase of a site in each of the republics and islands included in that area for the future construction of a Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, is a task which should be carefully considered and energetically carried out.A collective enterprise, at once so vast and so arduous, to be accomplished during so brief a period, by a community so limited in the number of its members, and so restricted in its material resources, and whose field embraces so wide an area, merits, from the very hour of its inception, the highest degree of consecration, and calls for the utmost vigilance and self-sacrifice, as well as an inflexible resolve on the part of its participants to crown it with speedy and unqualified success.Now is the time for the followers of the Most Great Name throughout the Greater Antilles to display these very qualities so essential for the consummation of their epoch-making task. Now is the time for them to rise to such heights as to astonish their brethren, not only in Latin America and throughout the Western Hemisphere, but in every continent of the globe.That they may discharge their weighty responsibilities in a manner that befits their high calling, and to a degree that will draw forth from the Source on High a still fuller measure of celestial grace and divine assistance that will enable them to advance still more rapidly on the high road of their destiny, is a hope that I greatly cherish-and the object of my ardent prayers.Shoghi3 July 1957Miss Dorothy Campbell, SecretaryNational Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Brazil, Peru,Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela Dear Bahá’í Sister:Your communications with their enclosures and material sent under separate cover have all arrived safely, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf, and to acknowledge receipt of your letters dated: May 5, 6 (two), 8 (two), 12, 29 and June 10.Before the division of the South American National Assembly into two new Regional Bodies, the Guardian received many letters from the old Assembly, which he is not acknowledging according to  417date, but they arrived safely. As many matters in the correspondence with the old Assembly were attended to by separate letter to the Secretary, I will not go into them again here.As regards the question you asked him about purchasing Temple sites, these should be in the neighbourhood of the capital city of the country in question, and within reasonable driving distance, so that they can be reached by bus or by train without too much difficulty. Naturally if it were closer to the city, it would be preferable, but often land close to capital cities is very expensive.No publicity should be given to the purchase of this land, nor reference made to it to government authorities. The more quietly it is done, the better. It need not be a large area, to begin with three or four acres being sufficient. If the land is very cheap, the friends can naturally purchase a larger plot.He was happy to see the progress made during the past year in establishing new Spiritual Assemblies. He feels sure that the division of the Spiritual Assembly into two areas will make it much easier for the new National Bodies to function-even though the distances encompassed under their jurisdiction are so vast, it is nevertheless an improvement over the past.He hopes there will be a great deal more teaching activity during the present year, and that the Latin American Bahá’ís will increasingly feel that this is their Faith, and consequently their obligation, primarily, to spread it amongst their own people. Great as are the services rendered by pioneers, and unforgettable as are the deeds they accomplish, they cannot take the place of the indigenous element, which must constitute the bedrock of the Community, carry on its own affairs, build its own institutions, support its own funds, publish its own literature, etc. A mother gives birth to a child, but the child then has to grow for itself. The older it gets, the more responsible it is for its own acts. The Latin American friends are rapidly coming of age, and they are showing this by the manner in which they are arising to serve the Faith, to demonstrate it, to sacrifice for it, to protect it and consolidate it.He hopes there will be a marked increase in centres throughout the area under your jurisdiction during the coming months, and that, by next Riḍván, your Assembly will rest on a much wider foundation of Local Assemblies than at the time of its election.Your Assembly should devote particular attention to getting the Bahá’í Publishing Trust established in Brazil, as per the requirements of the Ten Year Plan. You cannot very well have a Branch under your jurisdiction in Buenos Aires, which is located in a territory under the jurisdiction of your sister Assembly.You should keep in close touch with your sister National Assemblies as regards all publications in Spanish. The responsible committees should concentrate on having literature available in good readable Spanish, and accurate as to subject matter-particularly the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá should be translated from the books already available in English, and these should be published as soon as feasible.He was surprised to hear, in a recent letter from one of the friends in Venezuela, that the Ḥa íratu’l-Quds has not yet been purchased there, and feels that your Assembly, in collaboration with the American National Spiritual Assembly, should make a concerted effort to resolve this problem, as it is the last remaining National Headquarters which, according to the Ten Year Plan’s provisions, needs to be acquired in Latin America.With warm Bahá’í greetings, R. RabbáníDear and valued co-workers: <span data-pg='418'/> </span>I welcome, with feelings of exultation and pride, the formation of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís residing in the Northern Republics of the South American continent-an event of enduring and far-reaching significance in the annals of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in Latin America. The emergence of this interim Regional Spiritual Assembly should be hailed as the forerunner of the independent National Spiritual Assemblies which, in the course of the evolution of the Ten Year Plan, are to be firmly established in these Republics, and which will signalize the triumphant termination of yet another epoch in the history of the evolution of the Administrative Order of that Faith in the South American continent.That the Bahá’í communities, labouring so devotedly and so assiduously in these five Republics, should have, as a result of their steadfast exertions and whole-hearted response to the Message of the New Day, reached so swiftly so important a milestone on the high road of their glorious destiny proclaims, in no uncertain terms, the high quality of the faith which animates their members, and evokes in the hearts of all those who have, in recent years, watched the development of the institutions committed to their charge, feelings of unqualified admiration, and reinforces their confidence in the capacity of these rapidly advancing, steadily consolidating communities to achieve their ultimate objectives.The selfsame diligence, fidelity and perseverance which have so markedly characterized their stewardship of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh in the past, must henceforth distinguish their collective endeavours. Nothing short of the highest degree of dedication, of complete unity and harmony, and of an inflexible resolve to attain their goals, can guarantee such a consummation and set the seal of triumph on the historic undertaking upon which they have embarked.The Six Year Plan, on which the attention of the members of these communities must be focused, should be regarded by them as the chief and unfailing instrument for the execution of their high purpose. All, both young and old, veterans as well as newly-enrolled, must participate with unflagging energy, with complete consecration and undeviating loyalty.A supreme effort must be made to swell, as rapidly as possible, the number of the avowed supporters of the Faith in each of these Republics, and to multiply the isolated centres, groups and Local Assemblies constituting the foundations of the rising Bahá’í Administrative Order in these extensive territories. All firmly established Assemblies must, moreover, be incorporated in order to consolidate the foundations of this Administrative Structure. Recognition must, likewise, be secured from the authorities concerned for the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate as well as the Bahá’í Holy Days. The historic work initiated, so laboriously and so auspiciously, in the newly opened territories, allocated to the Bahá’í communities of South America, must be zealously pursued, extended and reinforced. The translation, publication and dissemination of Bahá’í literature in the Spanish, Portuguese and American Indian languages is yet another task which must be carried out with the utmost care, efficiency, vigour and vigilance. The increase in the number of summer schools, and the lending of a fresh impetus to the conversion of the American Indians and of other Minorities must henceforth receive the close and uninterrupted attention of all those who are primarily responsible for the prosecution of this Plan. The Publishing Trust to be established in the capital city of Brazil, and constituting one of the foremost objectives of the Ten Year Plan, should be speedily and firmly established. And, last but not least, a site should be selected and purchased, in each of the four remaining Republics, for the purpose of the construction, at a future date, of a Mother Temple in each of these countries.Upon the complete and befitting discharge of the admittedly weighty responsibilities now resting upon the privileged, elected representatives of these five communities, in this crucial, transitional period of their evolution within the orbit of the embryonic World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, must, to a marked degree, depend their entering a new and still more significant stage in the unfoldment of the <span data-pg='419'/> </span>potentialities of the Mission which, as decreed by the Almighty, they are called upon to bring to a successful conclusion.The opportunities now given them by the Supreme Author of their destiny must be seized with eagerness, confidence and promptitude. Theirs is the golden chance to approach and discharge their tasks, which are at once sacred and inescapable, in a spirit and in a manner that will win the unqualified esteem and unbounded admiration of their sister as well as parent communities throughout the Western Hemisphere.My fervent and constant prayer for the members of this newly emerged Assembly, as well as for all those whom they represent within the confines of these Republics, is that they may never falter, fail or flinch in the task they shoulder, that they may rather go on from strength to strength until they hold the palm of total victory in their hands, and merit thereby the applause of the Concourse on high and a still fuller measure of the blessings promised by the Divine Author of their Faith to all who will arise to glorify His Name and contribute to the ultimate triumph of His divinely appointed Order. <!-- New Letter -->14 July 1957 [Paraguay]Miss Alice Bacon Dear Bahá’í Sister:ShoghiYour loving letter of June 29th was duly received and its contents presented to the beloved Guardian. He has directed me to acknowledge it on his behalf.The contribution which you have made to the International Fund for the use of the three mother Temples in three continents is very greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed herewith.The Guardian likewise greatly appreciated the contribution from Miss Ellen Sims for the same purpose. Receipt for her is likewise enclosed.The beloved Guardian feels it is entirely appropriate that you have made your contribution in the name of your husband, Wendel Bacon, who rendered such outstanding and distinguished services to the Cause over a number of years. He rejoices in the Abhá Kingdom because his name is now linked with the work now going forward at the World Centre of the Faith.The Guardian will pray for your husband and for the progress of his soul.The victories won by the friends throughout the world during the past year are truly astonishing. Everywhere the spirit of life is descending and even though the seeds which are being sown in some areas are not reaping an immediate harvest, yet in due course they will all come into fruition and produce new flowers in the Kingdom of God. For this reason you and Miss Sims should not in any way become discouraged, but should continue your services with zeal and enthusiasm, resting assured that Bahá’u’lláh will water the seeds which you sow.Dedication, consecration and zealous teaching are the qualification for success at this time. The Guardian feels sure that you will redouble your efforts so that many seeking souls may find eternal life through your sacrificial efforts.The beloved Guardian will pray for you and Miss Sims and for the success of your work. <span data-pg='420'/> </span>He sends you both his loving greetings.Faithfully yours,[Leroy Ioas] <!-- New Letter -->22 July 1957 [El Salvador] Mr. Quentin H.

He feels sure that the spirit he imparted to the friends, as well as the stirring events of the Convention and the election of your Assembly, will all mark a turning point in the work in that area and give the forward march of the Faith a new impetus.Now that the new Regional Assemblies in Latin America have been formed, and that each one embraces a more limited area than the previous Central and South American Assemblies, the work should be much easier to handle, and therefore go ahead much faster. He anticipates great things from your Assembly and is eagerly awaiting news of fresh victories.The paramount task is, of course, the teaching work; at every session your Assembly should give it close attention, considering everything else of secondary importance. Not only must many new Assemblies be developed, as well as groups and isolated centres, but special attention must be focused on the work of converting the Indians to the Faith. The goal should be all-Indian Assemblies, so that these much exploited and suppressed original inhabitants of the land may realize that they are equals, and partners in the affairs of the Cause of God, and that Bahá’u’lláh is the Manifestation of God for them.Another of the important tasks facing your body is that of purchasing sites for future Temples in the outskirts of the capital cities of all the Republics under your jurisdiction, with the exception of Panama, which has its Temple site already. The land need not be large, two or three acres being quite sufficient for our purposes at this time; it need not be in the city but anywhere within a radius of fifteen kilometres; and economy should be borne in mind. If, when the time comes to build a House of Worship, the site is not suitable, it can be exchanged or sold and another one acquired. <span data-pg='422'/> </span>Wherever the laws permit, firmly established Local Assemblies should be incorporated, thus laying a foundation on which the future independent National Spiritual Assemblies can build when they come into being.Every step forward in the expansion of our glorious Faith releases new spiritual energies. The believers, as well as your Assembly, must seize upon this opportunity they now have with both hands, and arise to new levels of self-sacrifice, service and dedication, confident that Bahá’u’lláh is only waiting for the instruments to be put in His hands in order to fulfil His Divine purpose.The Guardian assures you he will support you, one and all, with his prayers, and supplicate that you may be guided in carrying out your great work, strengthened and protected.With warm Bahá’í greetings, R. RabbáníDear and valued co-workers:The formation of a Regional Spiritual Assembly representing the Bahá’í Communities of Central America and Mexico, with its seat fixed in the capital city of a Republic the future of which the pen of the Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant has extolled, is, indeed, an auspicious event of far-reaching significance, to be acclaimed as the forerunner of no less than seven National Spiritual Assemblies, designed to support, each as a separate pillar, the noble and divinely-conceived structure of the Universal House of Justice.There can be no doubt that the remarkable progress achieved, singly and collectively, in both the teaching and administrative fields, by the followers of the Most Great Name, labouring, in the course of two decades, so diligently, for the propagation of His Faith, throughout the length and breadth of an area linking the northern and southern continents of the Western Hemisphere, has been responsible for this great step forward that has been taken towards the consummation of so historic a task.The various and urgent enterprises, now challenging both their spirit and resources, demand a consecration as complete, a resolve as firm, and a zeal as ardent as any they have hitherto evinced.The Six Year Plan formulated to enable them to meet the immediate requirements of their Mission should be prosecuted with the utmost diligence. Attention, on the part of all the members of the seven Bahá’í communities participating in this World Crusade, as well as their elected representatives, should be continually focused on its objectives.A systematic effort must be made by the rank and file of these communities to increase rapidly the number of the avowed supporters of the Faith, of isolated centres, of groups and of Local Spiritual Assemblies. Every firmly grounded Assembly should, at the earliest opportunity, be incorporated for the purpose of reinforcing the foundations of the rising structure of a divinely conceived Administrative Order. Every avenue should, moreover, be explored in order to obtain recognition from the civil authorities concerned of the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate and of the Bahá’í Holy Days. Nor must the meritorious work, so zealously undertaken in the newly opened virgin territories, be, under any circumstances, neglected. The translation of Bahá’í literature into the Spanish and Indian American languages, its publication and dissemination, should, likewise, be carried out with efficiency and vigour. The all-important enterprise, aimed at winning the whole-hearted allegiance of the members of various tribes of American Indians to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh, and at ensuring their active and sustained participation in the conduct of its administrative affairs, must likewise be seriously considered and strenuously pursued. And, last but not least, a site of modest dimensions should, in the neighbourhood of the capital cities of each of these seven Republics, with the exemption of Panama, be chosen and <span data-pg='423'/> </span>promptly purchased, designed to pave the way for the ultimate erection of a Mother Temple in each of these Republics.Marvellous opportunities, which if not seized at once may not recur, have been vouchsafed, at this auspicious hour, to the prosecutors of this historic and momentous Plan, on which the immediate destinies of these communities, now gathered under the shadow of Bahá’u’lláh, depend. Theirs is the privilege and sacred duty to exploit them to the full, ere it is too late, and to play their part, befittingly as the co-executors of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan and members of that band of Crusaders now battling for the triumph of His Father’s Cause, in building up the institutions, and in broadening and reinforcing the foundations, of the embryonic World Order of His Faith in the heart of the Western Hemisphere.No matter how severe the tests and trials they may encounter, however arduous the task that confronts them, they must, one and all, pursue steadily the path they now tread, with undimmed vision, undeviating loyalty, unstinted devotion and unyielding determination, until the Plan they are pledged to execute will have been carried out in its entirety, and the fondest expectations entertained for their success by their watchful brethren throughout the Western Hemisphere, and, indeed, in every continent of the globe, are triumphantly fulfilled.May the Spirit of Bahá’u’lláh bountifully sustain them while discharging their manifold and pressing responsibilities, and may the Author of the Divine Plan, Whose design they are painstakingly labouring to create, and Whose mandate they have willingly arisen to obey, guide every step they take, remove every obstacle obstructing their path, fulfil every hope they cherish, and enable them, through a still greater measure of His abounding grace, promised unequivocally to all those who will respond to His call, to write an unforgettable chapter in Latin American Bahá’í history, and contribute a share to its enrichment which posterity will never cease to extol.29 July 1957Mr. Athos Costas, SecretaryNational Spiritual Assembly of Argentina,Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay Dear Bahá’í Brother:ShoghiYour letters dated May 25 and June 1, with enclosures and photographs, have been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.The formation of four Regional Spiritual Assemblies in Latin America marks a great step forward in the progress of the work being carried out in the Western hemisphere. He feels sure that all those responsible for the administrative work will find that, through this division into smaller units, the teaching work will now go forward much faster and the problems that inevitably arise can be dealt with more efficiently and with greater firsthand knowledge of the reasons that caused them.He was sorry that he felt it necessary to insist that the secretary of your Assembly must be located in Buenos Aires, so that the Secretariat can be located in the Headquarters of this region; this is a general principle which he has insisted the friends adhere to everywhere. A situation similar to yours arose in Scandinavia, where the secretary was in Oslo instead of Stockholm, and a change was necessary there also. As the Ten Year Crusade unfolds it is increasingly important for the work to go forward in a uniform manner and according to general principles applicable to all. <span data-pg='424'/> </span>The reports he has received of your first Convention were most encouraging, and he has great hopes for the future of your work in that area of South America under your jurisdiction. The Hand of the Cause, Mr. Varqá, was deeply impressed by the spirit of devotion he found amongst the friends there, and submitted a most enthusiastic report to the Guardian.As you formulate the goals which must receive your undivided attention during the coming years he urges you to bear in mind the most important one of all, namely the multiplication of the Spiritual Assemblies, the Groups and the isolated centres; this will ensure both breadth and depth in the foundations you are laying for the future independent National Bodies. The believers should be urged to consider individually the needs in their immediate region, and to go forth to pioneer in near and distant cities and towns. They must be encouraged by your Assembly to remember that small people, often poor and obscure people, have changed the course of human destiny more than people who started out with wealth, fame and security. It was the Sifter of Wheat who, in the early days of our Faith, arose and became a hero and martyr, not the learned priests of his city!The news that one of the objectives of the next six years had already been achieved before the Guardian had announced it-namely the acquisition of a Temple site in Buenos Aires-pleased him greatly. This donation, coupled with that of the land so generously given many years ago by a member of your Assembly in Chile, means that you have only three Temple sites to acquire, one in Bolivia, one in Uruguay and one in Paraguay. The area need not exceed three acres, and should be anywhere within fifteen kilometres of the capital cities of these countries. Economy should be carefully considered, and you should remember that, if at this time an ideal site is not within your reach, the plot you buy may, when the time comes to actually build the Temple, be exchanged or sold, and a more desirable site acquired.Now that your Assembly has been formed and its seat is in Buenos Aires, he wishes you to consider the grave of the first martyr to be laid to rest in the southern part of the Western hemisphere as your special trust; it should be properly kept up, so that Bahá’ís, and the ever-watchful non-Bahá’ís, may see that it is befittingly maintained. The only comparable spot, within thousands of miles, is the resting place of the unique and glorious teacher, Martha Root, who is buried in Hawaii.He was particularly happy to see that some of the Indian believers were present at the Convention. He attaches the greatest importance to teaching the original inhabitants of the Americas the Faith. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself has stated how great are their potentialities, and it is their right, and the duty of the non-Indian Bahá’ís, to see that they receive the Message of God for this day. One of the most worthy objectives of your Assembly must be the establishment of all-Indian Spiritual Assemblies. Other minorities should likewise be especially sought out and taught. The friends should bear in mind that in our Faith, unlike every other society, the minority, to compensate for what might be treated as an inferior status, receives special attention, love and consideration.He urges your Assembly, as it embarks upon its great work, to refrain from introducing rules and regulations which serve no useful purpose at this time when the communities are small and undeveloped, and will only stifle the spirit of the friends and confuse them. Like a wise and loving parent the Assembly should conduct the affairs of the Bahá’ís, constantly and patiently, encouraging them and instilling enthusiasm for the work to be done.He looks forward to receiving the news of many victories from your Assembly, and assures you, one and all, of his most loving prayers for your success, and that you may be strengthened and guided to carry out your manifold tasks with distinction.With warm Bahá’í greetings,R. Rabbání 425Dear and valued co-workers:The formation of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís residing in the southern part of the vast South American continent may well be regarded by them, as well as by posterity, as an event of major importance, constituting a significant landmark in the history of the Faith in Latin America, which, by its very nature, must pave the way for the emergence, in the years immediately ahead, of no less than five independent National Spiritual Assemblies, each of which will act as a pillar of the mighty and divinely appointed institution of the Universal House of Justice.The emergence of this transitional vitally important Assembly, whose seat has been fixed in the capital city of the largest and most outstanding of these Republics, in the neighbourhood of which reposes the dust of one of the star-servants of Bahá’u’lláh and dearly-loved handmaid of the Centre of His Covenant, for ever distinguished as the mother of two of the oldest communities in Europe and in the North American continent-the emergence of such an Assembly owes much to the ability, the devotion, the single-mindedness and perseverance with which the promoters of the Faith of God have laboured so unitedly in that far-away section of the globe.The opportunity which this momentous development in the progress and consolidation of Bahá’í institutions offers them, at this auspicious hour, is immense and infinitely precious. The responsibilities which such a progress confronts them with are manifold, sacred, pressing and inescapable. The reward which will undoubtedly crown their combined and consecrated efforts will be inestimable and enduring.The most effective and speediest method, which can guarantee at once the befitting discharge of such weighty responsibilities, and the winning of so rich a reward is, no doubt, the whole-hearted and systematic prosecution, on the part of all concerned, of the newly formulated Six Year Plan, on which the immediate destinies of each of these five communities now depend.An effort, unsurpassed in its range and intensity in Latin American Bahá’í history, must be exerted by the members of these communities to increase the number of the avowed adherents of the Faith, to multiply the groups, and the isolated centres, as well as the Local Spiritual Assemblies. Whilst this strenuous and challenging task is being carried out every avenue should be explored in order to obtain the necessary recognition, from the civil authorities concerned, of the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate as well as of the Bahá’í Holy Days. Each and every firmly established Assembly throughout these Republics must, moreover, be incorporated for the purpose of reinforcing the legal basis of the rising Administrative Order now being so laboriously erected. The no less essential task of establishing the foundations of this Order in the newly opened virgin territories should simultaneously receive the close attention of the members of all Bahá’í communities, and particularly of their elected representatives. The translation, publication and dissemination of Bahá’í literature in both the Spanish and American Indian languages; the multiplication of summer schools; the acceleration of the process of converting the Negroes as well as the American Indians, and of encouraging them to take an active part in teaching the Faith to the members of their respective races, and to participate effectively in the administration of its affairs-these constitute additional and vital obligations which should, under no circumstances, be lost sight of nor be, for a moment, underrated. And, last but not least, a site of modest dimensions, in the neighbourhood of the capital cities of the Republics of Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia, should be carefully selected and expeditiously purchased, as a prelude to the eventual erection of a Mother Temple in each of these Republics.The field stretching before the members of these newly fledged communities, occupying so important a position in the South American continent, is extremely extensive, and the objectives to be attained, throughout its length and breadth, varied and highly challenging. The resources at the disposal of these communities are admittedly meagre. The period of time assigned for the consummation of so tremendous and arduous a task is short and swiftly passing. The potentialities of <span data-pg='426'/> </span>that mysterious and propelling force which the Faith, with which these communities stand identified, inherently possesses are, however, such as to carry forward irresistibly their members towards the attainment of their goals, if they but arise to diligently accomplish, and persevere in the carrying out of, their sacred Mission.That these communities, which have, since their inception, contributed so markedly to the rise and establishment of the embryonic World Order of Bahá’u’lláh throughout Latin America, may in the years immediately ahead, through the exertion of a concerted, a systematic and prodigious effort, unsurpassed in the annals of the Faith in the South American continent, promote, in both the teaching and administrative fields, its vital interests, and, whilst ensuring its protection, proclaim far and wide its fundamental verities, and noise abroad its fame, is a prayer that I will never cease to offer to the throne of Bahá’u’lláh in the course of my ardent supplications at the threshold of His Holy Shrine.Shoghi <!-- New Letter -->6 August 1957 [NSA Greater Antilles]...WORTH ROSA DUARTE 5 CIUDAD TRUJILLO DELIGHTED PRAYING NOTABLE VICTORIES LOVE. <!-- New Letter -->15 August 1957 [Brazil] Miss Jeanne Hazel Worley Dear Bahá’í Sister:The beloved Guardian has received your letter of June 13th, and has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.He is happy to know that you are now a declared believer.

If the Publishing Trust gets a straight order for a book, say in an Indian language, there is no reason to consult, except with the one Regional Assembly which is ordering it.The Guardian has already said that questions arising from the apportioning of the virgin territories among the four National Spiritual Assemblies are matters for them to decide, and not for him.He would be delighted if they added new territories, as this would increase the rapidly swelling number of countries and territories opened to our beloved Faith.The devoted services of your Assembly are deeply appreciated, you may be sure.

The Guardian would like to know to what tribes these Indians <span data-pg='430'/> </span>belong. He understands they do not live in tribes, but nevertheless they must come from some original tribe. Can you advise this information; similarly he would like to know of the two other Indians in Arequipa who are near to the Faith and will probably become Bahá’ís, to what tribe they belong.The beloved Guardian was very much interested in the teaching trip taken by Mr. Ubirata Kupira Ere, the Indian Bahá’í who lives in Bahia, Brazil. He would like to know what tribes were contacted by Mr. Ere on the 20-day trip which he took visiting so many centres.Can you also advise what tribes are represented in the contacts which have been made with some 30 young Indians in Otavalo, Ecuador. If you could send this information by return airmail, it would be very greatly appreciated.With loving Bahá’í greetings, <!-- New Letter -->18 September 1957 [Ecuador] Mrs. Gayle WoolsonDear Bahá’í Sister:Faithfully yours, Leroy IoasYour loving letter of September 4th was duly received.We are very happy indeed to learn of the victories being won by you and by your community in your teaching work. Let us hope that the Protestant minister becomes a firm believer and arises to spread the Faith vigorously. There is no doubt he would be able to win many victories for the Cause.The Archives building is practically finished. In fact the exterior is completed. There is still a little work to be done in the interior. Then the Archives will be moved in and of course it will then be set to the proper usage for the Bahá’í World Community.I will send a piece of tiling from the Shrine of the Báb to your friend in Tel Aviv so that she may carry it to you. This will not be a complete tile as the Guardian has instructed that we should not send tiles anywhere. Furthermore I think the Guardian would not approve of your putting this on display. It would be satisfactory to retain it in the Ḥa íratu’l-Quds, but to hang it on the wall under a display would be something I think he would not approve.The beloved Guardian is feeling very well and is very active at the present time.He remembers your visit to the Holy Land with love and hopes the inspiration which you received while here is increasing so that your teaching work will be more effective.
