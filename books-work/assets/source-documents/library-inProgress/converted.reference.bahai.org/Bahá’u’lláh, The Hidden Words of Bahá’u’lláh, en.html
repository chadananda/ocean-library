The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice; turn not away therefrom if thou desirest <span data-pg='4' id='pg4'></span> Me, and neglect it not that I may confide in thee.

Ponder this in thy heart; how it behooveth thee to be. Verily justice is My gift to thee and the sign of My loving-kindness. Set it then before thine eyes.</p>
