    <p id='7'>As early as 1903 and for years thereafter, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá urged Bahá’ís to travel to Japan to spread the Message of Bahá’u’lláh. On occasion He said He Himself would like to go to Japan, and also to some other countries.</p>
  
    <p id='8'>In 1908 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote to an American believer, Mr. Howard McNutt <a data-fnid='1'></a> , “A trip of the believers of God to the Orient is of the utmost importance and it will become the cause of great connection between the two regions… Perchance, God willing, in Japan, you may lay the foundation for the Kingdom!”</p>
    <aside data-fnid='1'>Mr. McNutt, Mr. Wilhelm and Mr. Randall were staunch and devoted American Bahá’ís who tried to help the Faith in Japan as it was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wish.</aside>
  
    <p id='9'>In 1910 He said to the first two Bahá’ís to visit Japan, “Blessed results will appear from the Holy Cause established in that land. I have sent your letter regarding the work in Japan to Mr. McNutt in New York, that he may spread the word for some of the American Bahá’ís to go to Japan, and there serve and teach the Cause. It is very good for teachers to travel, and, through the love of God, give life to the people. American Bahá’ís should go to Oriental countries as teachers.”</p>
  
    <p id='10'>The first Bahá’ís to make the long voyage, Mr. Howard Struven <a data-fnid='2'></a> and Mr. C.M. Remey, 1909; Mme. Aurelia Bethlen, 1911; Mr. and Mrs. Dreyfus-Barney, 1914, stayed for brief periods of time and continued around the world. Dr. George Augur and Miss Agnes Alexander both arrived in 1914—Miss Alexander shortly after Dr. Augur. They sailed to Japan with the intention of residing there for some time. All these believers traveled in response to the wishes of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Besides Japan, He also encouraged travel in those early days to China, India, Persia and other Asian countries.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='2'>Mr. Struven was designated as Herald of the Kingdom by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.</aside>
  
    <p id='11'>In the Tablet of the Divine Plan written to the Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada, Japan is mentioned six times and the Japanese language itself once. In those Tablets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá again urged travel. “How good would it be were there any possibility of a commission composed of men and women, to travel together through China and Japan…”</p>
  
    <p id='12'>In 1919 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote to Mr. Roy Wilhelm <a data-fnid='3'></a> , “Attach great importance to the Japanese people. Mrs. Magee should continually communicate with them.” And again, later in the year to the same believer, “Convey to Mr. Nasu <a data-fnid='4'></a> , the Japanese, my greeting and say:</p>
    <aside data-fnid='3'>Mr. McNutt, Mr. Wilhelm and Mr. Randall were staunch and devoted American Bahá’ís who tried to help the Faith in Japan as it was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wish.</aside>
    <aside data-fnid='4'>Mr. Shiroshi Nasu, a professor of Tokyo Imperial University, was a friend of Mr. Wilhelm.</aside>
  
    <p id='13'>The world of nature is darkness but the heavenly Sun dissipates by its light this darkness that prevails over the world. Likewise the world of mind and of souls is a dark one and nothing will illuminate it save <span data-pg='6' id='pg6'></span> the rays of the Sun of Truth. My hope therefore is that thou mayest be the cause of the shining of the Divine Teachings in Japan, that thou mayest vivify the dead. The people of Japan are intelligent but they are in need of a leader that he may awaken them. I hope that thou mayest be the cause of their awakening and may vivify them.”</p>
  
    <p id='14'>To Mr. William Randall <a data-fnid='5'></a> , in 1920, He wrote, “The association which has been formed for promoting the relationship and love between America and Japan, will, God willing, be confirmed and assisted. This association is important. It will unquestionably, bring forth great results.”</p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='1: Miss Agnes B. Alexander1875–1971'></h3>
  
    <p id='22'>The year was 1913, and Miss Alexander recalls: “My only desire was to serve His Cause. The words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá rang in my ears: ‘I have a lamp in My Hand searching through the lands and seas to find souls who can become heralds of the Cause. Day and night I am engaged in this work.’</p>
  
    <p id='23'>“I prayed that His lamp might find me. For nearly twelve years I had been privileged to assist in establishing His Cause in Hawaii. Now the time had come when I was free to go forth to serve in other parts of His lands… I received a Tablet from the Master which contained the first intimation that He wished me to travel to Japan. He wrote in part: ‘Therefore if thou travelest toward Japan unquestionably Divine confirmations shall descend upon thee.’</p>
  
    <p id='24'>“Through the Divine favors all difficulties were overcome and I sailed … reaching Japan November 1, 1914.”</p>
  
    <p id='25'>Between the time of her arrival and 1967 when she left for the last time, Miss Alexander spent a total of about 31 years in Japan. The rest of her time was spent in Hawaii or other parts of the world teaching the Faith.</p>
  
    <p id='26'>Shoghi Effendi referred to Miss Alexander as a “distinguished pioneer” and wrote the following to her regarding her role in the development of the Faith.</p>
  
    <p id='27'>“Your glorious services in those remote regions of the earth (China and Japan) are never to be forgotten. I ever pray on your behalf and wish you to remember the sacred interests of the Cause in far-away Japan as you are that radiant herald who has raised the Call of Salvation in its very heart and to whom it owes a great debt of gratitude… I never, never forget you.” (January 27, 1924)</p>
  
    <p id='28'>“I feel that your destiny lies in that far-off and promising country (Japan) where your noble and pioneer services future generations will befittingly glorify and thankfully remember.” (January 10, 1928)</p>
  
    <p id='29'>Miss Alexander received thirteen Tablets from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They are quoted below.</p>

    <p id='31'>O thou maid-servant of God!</p>
  
    <p id='32'>The tongues have spoken of thy attraction to God, and the pens have testified of thy burning by the Fire of the Love of God. Indeed the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá approves of this because it feels its heat from this distant and Blessed Spot.</p>
  
    <p id='33'>O maid-servant of God! By God, the Truth, the Spirit of Christ from the Supreme Concourse doth in every time and aspect announce to thee this great good-news.</p>

I prayed that his heart might be prepared to receive the truth. Although it was a little difficult to give him the Message because of his imperfect knowledge of English, yet God helped me so that he understands perfectly and is rejoicing in the Knowledge of His Truth. I have just <span data-pg='21' id='pg21'></span> had a little talk with him and he told me how happy he was and that he expects to write his letter to the Master this evening.”</p>

    <p id='140'>O thou youth of God!</p>
  
    <p id='141'>Thank God that thou hast found thy way to the Radiant Kingdom, torn asunder the veil of superstition and learned the reality of the mysteries.</p>
  
    <p id='142'>All the people have formed a god in the world of thought, and that form of their own imagination they worship; when the fact is that the imagined form is finite and the human mind is infinite <a data-fnid='11'></a> . Surely the infinite is greater than the finite, for imagination is accidental (or non-essential) while the mind is essential; surely the essential is greater than the accidental.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='11'>Infinite in regard to imagination, for without the mind there would be no imagination.</aside>
  
    <p id='143'>Therefore consider: All the sects and peoples worship their own thought; they create a god in their own minds and acknowledge him to be the creator of all things, when that form is a superstition—thus people adore and worship imagination (or illusion). <span data-pg='23' id='pg23'></span></p>
  
    <p id='144'>The Essence of the Divine Entity and the Unseen of the unseen is holy above imagination and is beyond thought. Consciousness doth not reach It. Within the capacity of comprehension of a produced (or created) reality that Ancient Reality cannot be contained. It is a different world; from it there is no information; arrival thereat is impossible; attainment thereto is prohibited and inaccessible. This much is known: It exists and Its existence is certain and proven—but the condition is unknown.</p>
  
    <p id='145'>All the philosophers and the doctors know that It is, but they were perplexed in the comprehension of Its existence and were at last discouraged, and in great despair they left this world. For the comprehension of the condition and mysteries of that Reality of realities and Mystery of mysteries there is need for another power and another sense. That power and sense is not possessed by mankind, therefore they have not found any information. For example: If a man possess the power of hearing, the power of tasting, the power of smelling and the power of feeling but no power of seeing, he cannot see. Hence, through the powers and senses present in man the realization of the Unseen Reality, which is pure and holy above the reach of doubts, is impossible. Other powers are needed and other senses required. If those powers and senses are obtained, then information can be had; otherwise, not.</p>
  
    <p id='146'>As to the question of marriage, according to the law of God; First you must select one, and then it depends upon the consent of the father and mother. Before your selection they have no right of interference.</p>

If thou art confirmed as thou oughtest to be, thou wilt certainly establish an eternal Kingdom. This Kingdom is greater than that of Mikado, for the <span data-pg='27' id='pg27'></span> sovereignty of the Emperor of Japan is for numbered days, but this sovereignty is lasting and will stand unto the Eternity of Eternities.</p>
  
    <p id='181'>That sovereignty can be hidden under one handful of dust, that is when Mikado goes beneath the handful of dust, he is entirely effaced and erased, but this Kingdom withstands the greatest revolution of the worlds, and will stand with perfect stability unto eternity.

Consider how much difference there is between them.</p>

    <p id='183'>O thou spiritual Youth!</p>
  
    <p id='184'>Japan has made wonderful progress in material civilization, but she will become perfect when she will also make spiritual developments and the Power of the Kingdom become manifest in her.</p>
  
    <p id='185'>One will encounter a little difficulty in the beginning of the establishment of the Cause of God in that country, but later it will become very easy. For the inhabitants of Japan are intelligent, sagacious, and have the power of rapid assimilation. For the present a perfect youth like thee is favored by the Bounty of the Kingdom, and attained to the knowledge of the Lord of the Kingdom. Show thou forth an effort that thou mayest finish that which is necessary in the acquisition and study of science and art; then travel thou toward the countries of Japan; so that thou mayest hoist the Ensign of Truth, waving upon the Apex of the Supreme Concourse. Look thou not upon thine own capability, the Invisible Divine Confirmations are great, and the Protection and Providence of the Beauty of Abhá is the helper and assistant. When a drop draws help from the ocean, it is an ocean itself, and a little seed through the outpouring of rain, the favor of the sun, and the soul-refreshing breeze will become a tree with the utmost freshness, full of leaves, blossoms and fruits. Therefore do not consider thy capacity and merit, but rely upon the infinite Bounty and trust to His Highness the Almighty. Do not delay. Undertake soon that which thou art intending.</p>
  
    <p id='186'>There are prophecies concerning the Manifestation in the Buddhist books, but they are in symbols and metaphors, and some spiritual conditions are mentioned therein, but the leaders of religion do not understand. They think these prophecies are material things, yet those signs are foreshadowing spiritual occurrence.</p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='5: Tablets to Japan'></h3>
  
    <p id='196'>Miss Alexander wrote in her account of the early days of the Faith in Japan, “After ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension every word He had written became a sacred treasure. When I began collecting the Tablets He had revealed to Japanese living in Japan, and one to Koreans, I found there were nineteen in all.” These Tablets were published in 1928, thus preserved for all time. In the foreword to the book Miss Alexander wrote: “The following are the Tablets which were revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to friends residing in Japan and Korea. There are nineteen Tablets revealed between the years 1916 and His passing in 1921. Eighteen of these Tablets were addressed to Japanese and one to Korean friends. Seven of those to Japanese were to school girls in Tokyo, the others, with two exceptions, were to young men, and five of these were addressed to blind young men, three having found the true Light of this Day.</p>
  
    <p id='197'>“The first supplication by a Japanese in Japan to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, was sent July, 1915 from a young student <a data-fnid='12'></a> in Tokyo who wrote his supplication in Japanese on a scroll. The following is the translation: ‘O my Master ‘Abdu’l-Bahá!… Although I am a base and poor youth in this world, I have been awakened and bathed in the ocean of Thy mercy and am so happy that I pity the king and the prince who are wandering about in the dream of temporal variance. Accept, O Master, my deep thankfulness from the bottom of the heart. I am very sorry though, when I think of our fellow men who take no thought of real happiness and do not rely upon the warm hand of Thy love. O my Lord, water me forever from the fountain of Thy mercy; I will never refuse Thy command whatsoever it may be. Forgive my sins and allow me to awaken my fellow men.’</p>
    <aside data-fnid='12'>Mr. Kikutaro Fukuta</aside>
  
    <p id='198'>“In February 1917 a reply to this supplication was received in Japan from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. It had come in the contents of a letter from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s secretary and had been passed by the censor. This was the first Tablet received addressed to a Japanese resident in Japan and is the first herein published.</p>
  
    <p id='199'>“The second supplication to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was sent September, 1916 by a blind young Japanese <a data-fnid='13'></a> who wrote in Esperanto. After <span data-pg='30' id='pg30'></span> receiving a reply from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the second Tablet herein published, he wrote again supplicating in English. The following words are a portion of his supplication: ‘O my ‘Abdu’l-Bahá whose image so calm and peaceful I dreamed of and it cannot be effaced from my heart; whose Name makes my withered heart fresh and strong and who makes the fountain of love and light spring up in the bottom of my heart whenever I think of Thee. Make my heart to be always thirsty for the Fountain of Life. Make me strong enough to be able steadily to hold Thy torch of love firm and high. I confess to Thee that my heart sometimes withers like a flower in the day of summer, and loses its whole strength, nevertheless, my beloved Lord, give to me power that I can throw away every kind of prejudice and ignorance from my heart. Make my heart as pure and fresh as green grass of the spring pastures and let my soul grow more and more by Thy shower of Mercy!’ In answer to this blind young man’s supplication, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá revealed a Tablet which is the third published herein.”</p>
    <aside data-fnid='13'>Mr. Tokujiro Torii</aside>
  
    <p id='200'>Most of the original Tablets were translated in Haifa and sent to the recipients in care of Miss Alexander. One, to a group of students, was sent in care of Mr. Torii. A search in later years located only those Tablets addressed to Mr. Torii himself.</p>

    <p id='228'>O thou who art a new grown tree on the meadow of Truth! <a data-fnid='17'></a> (Miss Yuri Mochizuki)</p>
    <aside data-fnid='17'>Accompanying this Tablet was a Japanese translation made by Mr. Saichiro Fujita at the command of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.</aside>
  
    <p id='229'>Thy letter dated October 14, 1920 has been received. As it was indicative of the susceptibilities of thy conscience it became the cause of joy.</p>
  
    <p id='230'>Japan is like unto a farm whose soil is untouched. Such a soil <span data-pg='34' id='pg34'></span> as this has great capacity. One seed produces a hundred-fold. Now, praise be unto God, ye have found such a farm. Ye must develop the lands; ye must free them from thorns and weeds; ye should scatter the seeds of the love of God thereupon, and irrigate them with the rain of the knowledge of God. Rest ye assured that heavenly blessing will be bestowed!</p>
  
    <p id='231'>It is my hope that in that farm ye will become divine farmers. The enlightened people of Japan are tired and disgusted with the superannuated and putrefied blind imitations. They are assured that these blind imitations are pure superstitions without any truth. Therefore they have capacity to hear the Call of God. The land is untouched. We will have to see what the divine farmers will do!</p>
  
    <p id='232'>At present thou hast started a journal. It is my hope that this journal will shine as the Star of the East. In the journal write thus:</p>
  
    <p id='233'>When the horizon of the East was covered with immense darkness; when dark clouds were predominant, and when all the heavenly stars were concealed to the eye, His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh, like unto <span data-pg='35' id='pg35'></span> the sun shone forth from the horizon of the East and with radiating splendor He illumined the Orient.</p>
  
    <p class='Sitalcent' id='234'>[Photograph with the following caption:]</p>
  
    <p class='Sitalcent' id='235'>Mr. and Mrs. Tokujiro Torii with Miss Alexander in 1916.</p>
  
    <p id='236'>The light of the Sun of Reality consisted of heavenly teachings which were spread in the Orient, because there the obscurities of blind imitations of religions, sectarian, racial, political, economic and home prejudices were in ascendancy. The darkness of these prejudices had dominated the Oriental world to such a degree that it had blinded all the eyes and deafened all the ears. There prevailed quarrel and strife, warfare and bloodshed.</p>
  
    <p id='237'>In short, it has a long description, but I mention it briefly. When the Sun of Truth shone forth with all might and energy, these obscure and dark clouds dispersed and the splendid Day presented to the eye an aspect with such freshness and beauty that the wise became astonished; the sick were cured; the blind received sight; the deaf obtained hearing; the dumb proved eloquent, and the dead quickened. A heavenly table was spread in the Orient. The divine teachings like unto an unshakable edifice were instituted.</p>
  
    <p id='238'>The first principle of Bahá’u’lláh is independent investigation of truth, that is, all the nations of the world have to investigate after truth independently and turn their eyes from the moribund blind imitations of the past ages entirely. Truth is one when it is independently investigated, it does not accept division. Therefore the independent investigation of truth will lead to the oneness of the world of humanity.</p>
  
    <p id='239'>Another one of these teachings is the oneness of the world of humanity. All mankind are the trees of the divine garden and the Gardener of this orchard is the Most High, the All-Sustainer. The hand of His favor hath planted these trees, irrigated them from the cloud of Mercy and reared them with the energy of the Sun of Truth.</p>
  
    <p id='240'>Then there remains no doubt that this heavenly Farmer (Gardener) is kind to all these plants. This truth cannot be denied. It is shining like unto the sun. This is the divine policy and unquestionably it is greater than the human policy. We must follow the divine policy.</p>
  
    <p id='241'>The point is this that some people are sick; some are immature and ignorant, and some without any knowledge of their beginning and of their end. The sick should be cured; the immature should be brought to maturity, and the ignorant should be taught to become wise and not that enmity should be exercised toward them.</p>
  
    <p id='242'>Similarly describe fully in that journal the other teachings which thou art acquainted with, one by one, a detailed description. For example, that religion must be the cause of concord; that it should agree with science and reason; that it must be a factor of progress to the <span data-pg='36' id='pg36'></span> world of humanity, that it should be free from blind imitations. Another example is that all prejudices are destructive to the foundation of the world of humanity.</p>
  
    <p id='243'>Other examples are: The equality of men and women; the universalization of knowledge (education); the creation of one universal language; justice and righteousness; economic facilities among mankind; the need of the world of humanity of the breaths of the Holy Spirit; the establishment of universal peace; the institution of the Supreme Court of Arbitration; the freedom and equality of all mankind; the brotherhood of the world of humanity, and other teachings like these which are mentioned in the Tablets of God. Describe all these teachings fully in the most eloquent and sweetest terms expressive of the most charming realities and insert them in the journal.</p>
  
    <p id='244'>It is my hope that thou together with Miss Alexander will be confirmed to accomplish this service. Miss Alexander is the herald of Truth in Japan. Rest assured that she will be confirmed and assisted.</p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='Talk by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the Japanese Independent Church, Oakland, California, October 1912'></h3>
  
    <p id='303'>It is a great happiness to be here this evening, especially for the reason that the members of this Association have come from the region of the Orient. For a long time I have entertained a desire to meet some of the Japanese friends. That nation has achieved extraordinary progress in a short space of time; a progress and development which have astonished the world. Inasmuch as they have advanced in material civilization they must assuredly possess the capacity for spiritual development. For this reason I have an excessive longing to meet them. Praise be to God! this pleasure is now afforded me, for here in this city I am face to face with a revered group of the Japanese. According to report the people of the Japanese nation are not prejudiced. They investigate reality. Wherever they find truth they prove to be its lovers. They are not attached tenaciously to blind imitations of ancient beliefs and dogmas. Therefore it is my great desire to discourse with them upon a subject in order that the unity and blending together of the nations of the east and the nations of the west may be furthered and accomplished. In this way religious, racial and political prejudice, particularly bias and sectarianism will be dispelled amongst men. Any kind of prejudice is destructive to the body-politic.</p>
  
    <p id='304'>When we review history from the beginning of human existence to the present age in which we live, it is evident all war and conflict, bloodshed and battle, every form of sedition has been due to some form of prejudice, whether religious, racial or national, to partisan bias and selfish prejudice of some sort. Even today we witness an upheaval <span data-pg='43' id='pg43'></span> in the Balkans, a war of religious prejudice. Some years ago when I was living in Roumelia, war broke out among the religious peoples. There was no attitude of justice or equity whatever amongst them. They pillaged the properties of each other, burning each other’s homes and houses, slaughtering men, women and children, imagining that such warfare and bloodshed was the means of drawing near to God. This clearly proved that prejudice is a destroyer of the foundations of the world of humanity whereas religion was meant to be the cause of fellowship and agreement.</p>
  
    <p id='305'>Religion must be the cause of love. Religion must be the cause of justice, for the wisdom of the Manifestations of God is directed toward the establishing of the bond of a love which is indissoluble. The bonds which hold together the body-politic are not sufficient. These bonds may be mentioned; for instance the bond of patriotism. This is evidently not a sufficient bond, for how often it happens that people of the same nation wage civil war amongst themselves. The bond of fellowship may be racial but history proves this is not sufficiently strong, for tremendous wars have broken out between peoples of the same racial lineage. Again the bond holding men together may be political. How often it happens that the diplomacy of nations makes a treaty of peace one day and on the morrow a declaration of war! It is historically evident and manifest that these bonds are not self-sufficient.</p>
  
    <p id='306'>The real bond of integrity is religious in character, for religion indicates the oneness of the world of humanity. Religion serves the world of morality. Religion purifies the hearts. Religion impels men to achieve praiseworthy deeds. Religion becomes the cause of love in human hearts, for religion is a divine foundation, the foundation ever conducive to life. The teachings of God are the source of illumination to the people of the world. Religion is ever constructive not destructive.</p>
  
    <p id='307'>The foundation of all the divine religions is one. All are based upon reality. Reality does not admit plurality, yet amongst mankind there have arisen differences concerning the Manifestations of God. Some have been Zoroastrians, some are Buddhists, some Jews, Christians, Muhammadans and so on. This has become a source of divergence whereas the teachings of the holy souls who founded the divine religions are one in essence and reality. All these have served the world of humanity. All have summoned souls to peace and accord. All have proclaimed the virtues of humanity. All have guided souls to the attainment of perfections but among the nations certain <span data-pg='44' id='pg44'></span> imitations of ancestral forms of worship have arisen. These imitations are not the foundation and essence of the divine religions. Inasmuch as they differ from the reality and the essential teachings of the Manifestations of God dissensions have arisen and prejudice has developed. Religious prejudice thus becomes the cause of warfare and battle.</p>
  
    <p id='308'>If we abandon these time-worn blind imitations and investigate reality all of us will be unified. No discord will remain; antagonism will disappear. All will associate in fellowship. All will enjoy the cordial bonds of friendship. The world of creation will then attain composure. The dark and gloomy clouds of blind imitations and dogmatic variances will be scattered and dispelled; the Sun of Reality will shine most gloriously.</p>
  
    <p id='309'>Verily we should consider the divine prophets as the intermediaries, but mankind has made use of them as causes of dissension and pretexts for warfare and strife. In reality they were the intermediaries of love and reconciliation. If they were not sources of love and fellowship amongst men, then undoubtedly they were not true, for the divine wisdom and purpose in sending the prophets was the manifestation of love in human hearts. Therefore we must investigate reality. First of all let us determine whether these prophets were valid or not by using rational proofs and shining arguments, not simply quoting traditionary evidences, because traditions are divergent and the source of dissension.</p>
  
    <p id='310'>Among the holy, divine Manifestations of God was His Holiness Moses. The sending of prophets has ever been for the training of humanity. They are the first educators and trainers. If Moses has developed the body-politic, there is no doubt that he was a true teacher and educator. This will be proof and evidence that he was a prophet. We shall consider how His Holiness was sent to despair, in the lowest degree of ignorance, and heedlessness, degraded and under conditions of bondage. His Holiness Moses rescued these degraded people of Israel from that state of bondage. He raised them from that condition of ignorance, saved them from barbarism and led them into the Holy Land. He educated them, endowed them with sagacious instincts, made them worthy and honorable. He civilized them, raised them to a higher plane of existence until they were enabled to establish a national sovereignty, the great kingdom of Solomon. This proves that His Holiness Moses was a teacher and an educator. He had neither army nor dominion, neither did he possess wealth. It was only through an idealistic power that he cemented them together proving that he <span data-pg='45' id='pg45'></span> was a prophet of God, an educator and trainer.</p>
  
    <p id='311'>Likewise must we set aside prejudice in considering other divine educators, by investigating reality. For instance, let us take His Holiness Christ. He achieved results greater than Moses. He educated the body-politic, trained mighty nations. There is no doubt whatever that such souls were prophets, for the mission of prophethood is education, and these wondrous souls trained and educated mankind.</p>
  
    <p id='312'>His Holiness Christ was a unique personage without helper or assistant. Single and solitary he arose to train great and mighty nations; the Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Syrians, Chaldeans and Assyrians came under his influence. He was able to bind together many nations, melting them together as it were and pouring them into one mould, changing their enmity into love, war into peace. Under his influence satanic souls became veritable angels, tyrannical rulers became just, the human moral standard was raised. This proves that His Holiness Christ was an educator, a teacher and trainer of nations. If we deny this it is nought but injustice.</p>
  
    <p id='313'>Blessed souls whether Moses, Jesus, Zoroaster, Krishna, Buddha, Confucius, or Muhammad were the cause of the illumination of the world of humanity. How can we deny such irrefutable proof? How can we be blind to such light? How can we dispute the validity of His Holiness Christ? This is injustice. This is a denial of reality. Man must be just. We must set aside bias and prejudice. We must abandon the imitations of ancestors and forefathers. We ourselves must investigate reality and be fair in judgment.</p>
  
    <p id='314'>The old nation of Persia denied all these facts, harboring the utmost hatred and enmity toward other religious beliefs besides their own. We have investigated reality and found that these holy souls were all sent of God. All of them have sacrificed life, endured ordeals and tribulations in order that they might educate us. How can such love be forgotten? The light of Christ is evident. The candle of Buddha is shining. The star of Moses is sparkling. The flame ignited by Zoroaster is still burning. How can we deny them? It is injustice. It is a denial of complete evidence. If we forsake imitations all will become united and no differences will remain to separate us.</p>
  
    <p id='315'>We entertain no prejudice against Muhammed. Outwardly the Arabian nation was instrumental in overthrowing the Parsee dominion, the sovereignty of Persia. Therefore the old Parsee nation manifested the utmost contempt toward the Arabs. But we deal justly and will never abandon the standard of fairness. The Arabians were in the utmost state of degradation. They were blood-thirsty and barbarous, <span data-pg='46' id='pg46'></span> so savage and degraded that the Arabian father often buried his own daughter alive. Consider, could any barbarian be lower than this? The nation consisted of warring, hostile tribal peoples inhabiting the vast Arabian peninsula, and their business consisted in fighting and pillaging each other, making captive women and children, killing each other. Muhammad appeared among such a people. He educated and unified these barbarous tribes, put an end to their shedding of blood. Through his education they reached such a degree of civilization that they subdued and governed continents and nations. What a great civilization was established in Spain by the Muhammadans! What a marvelous civilization was founded in Morocco by the Moors! What a powerful caliphate or successorship was set up in Baghdad! How much Islam served and furthered the cause of science! Why then should we deny Muhammad? If we deny him we awaken enmity and hatred. By our prejudice we become the cause of war and bloodshed; for prejudice was the cause of the tremendous storm which swept through human history for thirteen hundred years and still continues. Even now in the Balkans a commotion is apparent, reflecting it.</p>
  
    <p id='316'>The Christian people number nearly three hundred millions and the Muhammadans about the same. It is no small task to do away with such numbers. And furthermore why should they be obliterated? For these are all servants of the one God. Let us strive to establish peace between Christians and Muhammadans. Is it not better? What is the benefit of war? What is its fruitage? For thirteen hundred years there has been warfare and hostility. What good result has been forthcoming? Is it not folly? Is God pleased with it? Is His Holiness Christ pleased? Is Muhammad? It is evident that they are not. The prophets have extolled each other to the utmost. His Holiness Muhammad declares Christ to be the Spirit of God. This is an explicit text of the Qur’an. He declares Christ to be the Word of God. He has eulogized the disciples of Christ to the utmost. He has bestowed upon Her Grace Mary, the Mother of Christ, the highest praise. Likewise His Holiness Christ has extolled Moses. He spread broadcast the old testament, the Torah, and caused the name of Moses to reach unto the east and the west. The purpose is this:—that the prophets themselves have manifested the utmost love toward each other but the nations who believe and follow them are hostile and antagonistic among themselves.</p>
  
    <p id='317'>The world was in this condition of darkness when His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh appeared upon the Persian horizon. He hoisted the banner of the oneness of the world of humanity. He proclaimed international <span data-pg='47' id='pg47'></span> peace. He admonished the Persian nation to investigate reality, announced that religion must be the cause of unity and love, that it must be the means of binding hearts together, the cause of life and illumination. If religion becomes the cause of enmity and bloodshed, then irreligion is to be preferred, for religion is the remedy for every ailment, and if a remedy should become the cause of ailment and difficulty, it is better to abandon it. Today in Persia you will see Muhammadans, Christians, Zoroastrians, Buddhists assembled together in the same meeting, living in accordance with the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, manifesting utmost love and accord. Rancor, hatred, antagonism and violence have disappeared; they live as one family.</p>
  
    <p id='318'>And ye, who are the people of the Orient—the Orient which has ever been the dawning-point of lights—from whence the Sun of Reality has ever shone forth casting its effulgence upon the West—ye therefore must become the manifestations of lights. Ye must become brilliant lamps. Ye must shine as stars radiating the light of love toward all mankind. May you be the cause of love amongst the nations. Thus may the world become witness that the Orient has ever been the dawning-point of illumination, the source of love and reconciliation. Make peace with all the world. Love everybody; serve everybody. All are the servants of God. God has created all. He provideth for all. He is kind to all. Therefore must we be kind to all.</p>
  
    <p id='319'>I am greatly pleased with this meeting. I am joyous and happy, for here in these western regions I find Orientals seeking education, and who are free from prejudice. May God assist you! <span data-pg='48' id='pg48'></span></p>

    <p id='322'>O thou who art firm in the Covenant! <a data-fnid='21'></a></p>
    <aside data-fnid='21'>Addressed to Ahmad Sohrab.</aside>
  
    <p id='323'>The International Congress of Religions was organized this year (1906) in the capital of Japan. Many souls hastened to that empire from different parts of the world, in order that they might talk of and discuss the principles of their own religions, each one longing to convert that assembly to his own religion and establish the validity of his own particular belief. This congress had under discussion the politics of the religions. In truth, it is a political affair and not the attraction of the heart, faith, advancement toward God nor enkindlement with the fire of the love of God. This congress will not produce a lasting effect, for it is essentially politico-religious. What is effective and conducive to the penetration of the Word of God and the attraction of hearts is the fragrances of holiness and the divine glad-tidings, which the members of the congress do not in the least comprehend.</p>
  
    <p id='324'>Consequently, if the believers of God go to that country—not to the congress—and through the power of the Word of God, the breath of the Holy Spirit, the reading of the verses of Oneness and associating with the individual inhabitants of that kingdom, undoubtedly untold and tremendous results will be realized and the sweet fragrance of the rose-garden of mysteries will perfume the nostrils of the people of those regions. It is significantly useful if some of the friends of God put forth an effort and hasten from America to those parts (Japan)…</p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='8: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Meets President Naruse of Japan Women’s CollegeBy Miss Agnes B. Alexander'></h3>
  
    <p id='326'>In the spring of 1912, in Tokyo, Viscount Shibusawa, an honored banker and financier, together with President Jinzo Naruse, the founder of the first Women’s College in Japan, and Dr. Masaharu Anesaki of the Imperial University formed a nucleus of a movement called “Concordia”. Its object was to try to find a common ground on which all nations could harmonize. President Naruse then undertook a journey around the world in the interest of the movement. He carried with him an autograph book in which he collected expressions of good-will from prominent people in the different countries he visited. On his return to Japan these were translated into Japanese and published.</p>
  
    <p id='327'>In London in 1912, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s secretary recorded the following: “A distinguished Japanese, the president of the Women’s University in Tokyo, who has been in the United States for many months, came to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and showed Him an article on the Concordia movement in Japan which appeared in the Oriental Review. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke to him about the principles of the Bahá’í Cause and how we are in need of Divine Power to put these principles into practice. He said, ‘Just as the sun is the source of all light in the solar system, so today Bahá’u’lláh is the Center of unity of the human race and of the peace of the world.’ ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote a beautiful prayer in the autograph book and earnestly pleaded with him to go back to Japan and spread these lofty ideals.”</p>
  
    <p id='328'>The prayer follows: “O God! The darkness of contention, strife and warfare between the religions, the nations and peoples has beclouded the horizon of Reality and hidden the heaven of Truth.

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='9: Excerpt from The Chosen Highway by Lady Blomfield, Concerning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Japanese Diplomat (1912]'></h3>
  
    <p id='330'>The Japanese Ambassador to a European capital (Viscount Arakawa—Madrid <a data-fnid='22'></a> ) was staying at the Hotel d’Jéna. This gentleman and his wife had been told of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence in Paris, and the latter was anxious to have the privilege of meeting Him.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='22'>Japanese Foreign Office records list Viscount Minoji Arakawa as being Ambassador of Spain at that time. Spelling of the last name differs in the original text.</aside>
  
    <p id='331'>“I am very sad,” said Her Excellency. “I must not go out this evening as my cold is severe, and I leave early in the morning for Spain. If only there were a possibility of seeing Him.”</p>
  
    <p id='332'>This was told to the Master, Who had just returned after a long, tiring day.</p>
  
    <p id='333'>“Tell the lady and her husband that, as she is unable to come to me, I will call upon her.”</p>
  
    <p id='334'>Accordingly, though the hour was late, through the cold and rain He came, with His smiling courtesy, bringing joy to us all, as we awaited Him in the Tapestry Room of the Hotel d’Jéna.</p>
  
    <p id='335'>‘Abdu’l-Bahá talked with the Ambassador and his wife of conditions in Japan, of the great international importance of that country, of the vast service to mankind, of the work for the abolition of war, of the need for improving conditions of life for the worker, of the necessity of educating girls and boys equally.</p>
  
    <p id='336'>“The religious ideal is the soul of all plans for the good of mankind. Religion must never be used as a tool by party politicians. God’s politics are mighty, man’s politics are feeble.”</p>
  
    <p id='337'>Speaking of religion and science, the two great wings with which the bird of human kind is able to soar, He said: “Scientific discoveries have increased material civilization. There is in existence a stupendous force, as yet, happily undiscovered by man. Let us supplicate God, the Beloved, that this force be not discovered by science until spiritual civilization shall dominate the human mind. In the hands of men of lower nature, this power would be able to destroy the whole earth.” <span data-pg='52' id='pg52'></span> <span data-pg='53' id='pg53'></span></p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='10: Letters and Cables to Miss Agnes B. Alexander, 1923–1957'></h3>
  
    <p id='338'>“The beloved Guardian continually sent reinforcements to me in his precious letters which were the joy and strength of my heart,” Miss Alexander wrote.</p>
  
    <p id='339'>Aside from her own inner conviction, the main source of positive guidance and direction, during her early years in the Orient were Shoghi Effendi’s letters.</p>
  
    <p id='340'>Of the first personal letter she received from the Guardian (December 2, 1923) she wrote, “The words penned by his hand at the end of the letter so affected me that for several days my heart was filled with joy and inspiration, and a realization came to me of the power with which God had endowed him.”</p>
  
    <p id='341'>Following are excerpts from some of the many letters written to Miss Alexander by the Guardian, or on his behalf, which give insights, not only into her role as a “distinguished pioneer”, but also into her relationship with the Japanese, among whom she lived for so many years and whom she loved so dearly.</p>
  
    <p id='342'>My dear sister in God,</p>
  
    <p id='343'>Your letter to our very dear Shoghi Effendi was most encouraging and created in him new hopes for the spread of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s great and noble Message after the painful calamity in Japan <a data-fnid='23'></a> . It was indeed a miracle that amid a city all shaken to pieces and burned to ashes by the wild flames, the Lord should have kept you so safe and unscathed. We can never doubt that this is a direct proof of the mighty task which the Lord has wanted you to take up and fulfill in that far away East. Shoghi Effendi has always looked forward with great expectations at the progress of the Cause in Japan to which he attaches very great importance.</p>
    <aside data-fnid='23'>The Great Kanto Earthquake of September 1923.</aside>
  
    <p id='344'>The Japanese are really progressive people and such vital teachings which comprise the principles of the Bahá’í religion are sure to seize their attention and arouse a deep interest in them. Your presence in Japan was always a means of comfort to Shoghi Effendi’s heart because he fully realized the zeal and ardour with which you <span data-pg='55' id='pg55'></span> had taken up your work there and although Japan might now miss you, he is sure that wherever you are you will strive to your utmost in spreading far and near this Message of Peace to humanity. Furthermore he hopes that you will not give up altogether your interest in that promising country, but as long as you are away you will keep your tender plants all fresh and green with stimulating messages to them. These are Shoghi Effendi’s earnest hopes…</p>

    <p id='350'>In October 1923 Miss Alexander and her sister went to Beijing, stopping on their way in Seoul, Korea. In China they joined Miss Martha Root and had an exceedingly fruitful time. After about a three month visit Miss Alexander left to go to her home in Hawaii. After she reached Hawaii she received a letter from the Guardian.</p>
  
    <p id='351'>My dear Bahá’í sister,</p>
  
    <p id='352'>Your letter to Shoghi Effendi was very gladly received and he was most delighted to hear of your activities in the wonderful country of China… It is very unfortunate that you are forced to leave for the time being your work in (Japan) but Shoghi Effendi earnestly hopes that you will soon return and take up your blessed task.</p>

I ever pray on your behalf and wish you to remember the sacred interests of the Cause in far-away Japan as you are that radiant herald who has raised the Call of Salvation in its very heart and to whom it owes a great debt of gratitude. Fujita is with us happy, active, and extremely helpful. His presence is such a help and support to me in my work. I never, never forget you.</p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='[Letter of January 26, 1922]'></h3>
  
    <p id='593'>My well-beloved brethren and sisters in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:—</p>
  
    <p id='594'>Despondent and sorrowful, though I be in these darksome days, yet whenever I call to mind the hopes our departed Master so confidently reposed in the friends in that Far-Eastern land, hope revives within me and drives away the gloom of His bereavement. As His attendant and secretary for well-nigh two years after the termination of the Great War, I recall so vividly the radiant joy that transfigured His Face wherever I opened before Him your supplications as well as those of Miss Agnes Alexander. What promises He gave us all regarding the future of the Cause in that land at the close of almost every supplication I read to Him! Let me state, straightway, the most emphatic, the most inspiring of them all. These are His very words, that still keep ringing in my ears;—“Japan will turn ablaze! Japan is endowed with a most remarkable capacity for the spread of the Cause of God! Japan, with (another country whose name He stated but bade us conceal it for the present) will take the lead in the spiritual reawakening of the peoples and nations that the world shall soon witness!” On another occasion,—how vividly I recall it!—as He reclined on His chair, with eyes closed with bodily fatigue, He waved His hand and uttered vigorously and cheerfully these words in the presence of His friends:—“Here we are seated calm, quiet and inactive, but the Hand of the Unseen is ever active and triumphant in lands, even as distant as Japan.”</p>
  
    <p id='595'>My dear and steadfast friends! Now if ever is the time for you and for us to show, by our unity, service, steadfastness and courage, the spirit that the Master has throughout His lifetime so laboriously, so persistently kindled in our hearts. Now is the time for us to prove ourselves worthy of His love for us, His trust in us and His hopes for us. Japan, He said, will turn ablaze. Let us not, in any way, whatsoever, retard the realization of His promise. Nay, let us hasten, through our service, cooperation and efforts the advent of this glorious day.</p>
  
    <p id='596'>The bereaved Ladies of the Holy Household, receive with comfort and refreshing gladness any news that may come to them from that wonderful and distant land. They all know what the Master has <span data-pg='74' id='pg74'></span> graciously spoken about the future of the Cause in that land. They all expect from it a rapid transformation, a spiritual transformation even more sudden and startling than its material progress and advancement, for the Power of God can achieve wonders still greater than those the brilliant minds of the Japanese can achieve. This they firmly believe, for more than once, the Master has spoken of the spiritual potentialities hidden in the nature of these capable people. They all await with eagerness the joyful-tidings that your letters to them shall bear in future.</p>
  
    <p id='597'>We all wish so much to know more about you, about your little rising Bahá’í community, your number, your meetings, your activities, your difficulties, your plans, your distribution all over Japan and the neighbouring islands. We shall all pray for you most fervently and in a special manner at all the three Hallowed Shrines and beseech the Master, under whose wings we are all, to guide you, to sustain you in your work for Him.</p>
  
    <p id='598'>I shall never fail to send you all the news I receive from different parts of the Bahá’í world that you may know of the efforts and triumphs our brethren, the loved ones of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, are achieving and will achieve after Him.</p>
  
    <p id='599'>Persia, the leading nation in the Bahá’í world, today will, I am confident, through its centre, Tihran, communicate with you all, that the East and West, even as our Beloved One has so much wished it, may become even as one.</p>
  
    <p id='600'>The letter our dear sister, Miss Agnes Alexander, had written to Mr. Fujita, gave us such a joy and was read at the sorrowful gathering of His friends, in the very room He used to receive His friends and meet them every night.</p>
  
    <p class='Ssignature' id='601'>Ever awaiting your joyful news, <br> I am, your devoted brother in His love and service, <br> Shoghi</p>

    <p id='609'>Dear friends, the chosen ones of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in that Far Eastern land!</p>
  
    <p id='610'>Having brought to an end my long hours of retirement and meditation, one of my first thoughts upon my return to these hallowed surroundings has been to inquire after the well-being and spiritual happiness of my far-away fellow-workers who toil and labour in those remote regions of the earth for the blessed Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. How great was my joy when I learned that you were well safe and happy, content and determined, untiring in your labours and hopeful of the future!</p>
  
    <p id='611'>That my sudden withdrawal from the field of active service would leave you undeterred in your activities, would never damp your tender hopes nor shake your resolution to stand firmly for the Cause, I never doubted as I knew well the indelible marks of loyalty and steadfastness which the words of our beloved Master have wrought in your lives. I am equally certain that now when we join hands again in carrying the Cause of God a stage yet further, your assistance wholehearted as ever before will give it a fresh impetus that will lead to the establishment of throbbing centres of spiritual activity in those outlying regions of the world.</p>
  
    <p id='612'>Japan, a land so richly endowed, so alert and progressive, so quick in its grasp of realities of life, is now the recipient of a Divine Bestowal, greater, richer and more enduring than any material gift she has ever enjoyed in modern times. What blissful thought to remember that you are the chosen ones that shall establish the Kingdom of God in that land; that you are the pioneers of a Work that will endure and supersede all the other achievements, however meritorious and brilliant, of your fellow-countrymen for Japan.</p>
  
    <p id='613'>I pray that your vision of the vast opportunities that are yours may never be dimmed; that your efforts to realize that vision may never slacken and that the gracious aid of Bahá’u’lláh may never be withheld from you all through your sacred mission in this world.</p>
  
    <p id='614'>And now in conclusion, let us not forget those ringing words of the Beloved, uttered with such force and emphasis:—“The Fire of the Love of God shall assuredly set Japan afire!” and let us arise, now at this moment, with increased and renewed confidence in His Sayings that we may assure and hasten the advent of so glorious an era in the history of that ancient land.</p>
  
    <p class='Ssignature' id='615'>With my best wishes to every one of you <br> I am your brother and fellow-worker, <br> Shoghi</p>

    <p id='619'>The most welcome letter of our dearly beloved Bahá’í sister, Miss Agnes Alexander, imparting the glad news of the progress of her glorious services in Japan has rejoiced my heart, and has served to strengthen my hope and confidence in the future glories of that far eastern land.</p>
  
    <p id='620'>The Ladies of the Holy Household are highly gratified and comforted to learn of your untiring labours in His Vineyard, of the success that has attended your efforts, of the perseverance and ardour with which you conduct your teaching work in those distant regions of the earth. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is with you always and your success is assured!</p>
  
    <p id='621'>May the visit of our beloved sister, Miss Martha Root, to your shores stimulate widespread interest in the Cause throughout Japan, China and the Pacific Islands, and consolidate the foundation of the Edifice of the Cause in those far-eastern regions. I shall ever pray at the Three Holy Thresholds that the seeds now scattered bear abundant fruit and the promise of our beloved Master be speedily fulfilled.</p>
  
    <p id='622'>I shall remember in my prayers Mr. and Mrs. Sam Baldwin and their children, as well as Mrs. and Miss Cramer, and wish them from all my heart signal success in their noble endeavours to promote far and wide the Heavenly Teachings.</p>
  
    <p id='623'>It is my earnest hope that the friends in Japan will from now on write me frequent and detailed letters, setting forth the account of their various spiritual activities and giving me the plans for their future services to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
  
    <p id='624'>Our devoted brother, Mr. Fujita, is well and happy in the Holy Land, and together with the Ladies of the Household and myself is engaged in the service of the various pilgrims that visit in these days this sacred Spot. He is faithfully and actively carrying on the work which he has started so whole-heartedly during the Master’s last years on earth.</p>
  
    <p id='625'>I trust that the letters addressed to you by the newly-constituted Spiritual Assembly in Haifa have contributed their share in informing you more fully of the onward and irresistible march of the Movement throughout the world.</p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='[Letter of April 1957]'></h3>
  
    <p id='669'>To the First National Convention of the Bahá’ís of North East Asia—1957</p>
  
    <p id='670'>To the Delegates and Visitors assembled at the Convention of the Bahá’ís of North-East Asia.</p>
  
    <p id='671'>With feelings of exultation, joy, and pride I hail the convocation of this history-making Convention of the Bahá’ís of North-East Asia, paving the way for the emergence of a Regional Spiritual Assembly with an area of jurisdiction embracing Japan, Korea, Formosa, Macao, Hong Kong, Hainan Island and Sakhalin Island.</p>
  
    <p id='672'>This auspicious event, which posterity will regard as the culmination of a process initiated, half a century ago, in the capital city of Japan, under the watchful care and through the direct inspiration of the Centre of the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, marks the opening of the second chapter in the history of the evolution of His Faith in the North Pacific area. Such a consummation cannot fail to lend a tremendous impetus to its onward march in the entire Pacific Ocean, a march which will now, no doubt, be greatly accelerated by the simultaneous emergence of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of South-East Asia and of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of New Zealand.</p>
  
    <p id='673'>I particularly welcome the establishment of this highly important institution in the capital city of Japan, as it affords a splendid opportunity for the diffusion of the Lights of the Faith, and the erection of the structure of its Administrative Order, among a people representing the overwhelming majority of the yellow race, living in the islands of the Pacific Ocean, and in a country regarded as one of the strongholds of the Buddhist Faith.</p>
  
    <p id='674'>I feel a warm tribute should be paid, on this historic occasion, to the members of the American Bahá’í Community, as well as to their elected national representatives, who have, for so long and so devotedly, promoted the interests of the Faith in that country, and, in recent years in its neighbouring islands.</p>
  
    <p id='675'>I call upon the Regional Spiritual Assembly now being formed to signalize its birth through the initiation of a subsidiary Six-Year <span data-pg='81' id='pg81'></span> Plan, designed to swell the number of the adherents of the Faith throughout the area of its jurisdiction; to multiply the groups, the isolated centers and the local spiritual assemblies; to incorporate all firmly grounded local spiritual assemblies; to obtain recognition from the civil authorities for the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate, as well as the Bahá’í Holy Days; to inaugurate a national Bahá’í Fund; to consolidate the work initiated in the newly opened territories; to lend an impetus to the translation, the publication, and dissemination of Bahá’í Literature in divers languages; to establish Summer Schools, and Bahá’í burial grounds; to propagate the Faith throughout the smaller islands of Japan; and to acquire a plot to serve as the site of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of North-East Asia.</p>
  
    <p id='676'>May the blessings of Bahá’u’lláh be showered, in an ever-increasing measure, on those newly emerged Communities now holding aloft, so steadfastly and so valiantly, the banner of His Faith, and may the outcome of their collective efforts illuminate its annals, and contribute to a notable degree to the consolidation of the institutions <span data-pg='82' id='pg82'></span> of the Bahá’í embryonic World Order now being erected throughout the length and breadth of so vast, so turbulent, and yet so promising, an area of the globe.</p>

    <p id='688'>Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you on his behalf and inform you that the Hand of the Cause Mr. Varqá, will shortly be forwarding to your assembly the equivalent of five hundred English Pounds, as the Guardian’s contribution to your newly established National Fund.</p>
  
    <p id='689'>He hopes that, in the formulation of your plans, particular attention will be given to the all-important teaching work, the foundation of all the activities of the Faith and the most urgent task facing the friends in this critical period the world is passing through.</p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='[Letter of July 15, 1957]'></h3>
  
    <p id='692'>He (the Guardian) has read with much interest the reports of the Convention recently held in Tokyo. <span data-pg='83' id='pg83'></span></p>
  
    <p id='693'>The formation of this new Regional Assembly, whose area of operation is so vast and situated in such an important part of the globe, has been a source of great joy to the Guardian. He was also very happy to see that your Assembly has represented on it members of the three great races of mankind, a living demonstration of the fundamental teaching of our Holy Faith, and one which cannot but attract the interest of the public. The fact that so many believers attended the first historic convention, from practically all the territories your Assembly represents, was also most encouraging, and augurs well for your future work.</p>
  
    <p id='694'>The work, so faithfully carried on, by both the American and Persian pioneers, has borne its first fruit. The long and loyal service of dear Agnes Alexander, who so faithfully carried out the beloved Master’s wishes and served the spiritual interests of Japan for decades, has been richly crowned. Even the death of the devoted pioneer, Mr. Anthony Seto, has added a blessing to the work in that region, for he served in spite of failing health and remained at his post to be laid at rest in a distant land, his very dust testifying to the greatness of the love and the nature of the ideals Bahá’u’lláh inspires in His servants <a data-fnid='31'></a> .</p>
    <aside data-fnid='31'>Mr. Seto, the first Chinese-American Bahá’í, died while he was in Japan attending the first Convention. He is buried in the Yamate-machi Foreign Cemetery in Yokohama.</aside>
  
    <p id='695'>It has been a great source of joy to the Guardian to see the marked increase of native Bahá’ís throughout that area, particularly in Japan, Korea and Formosa. However devoted the pioneers may be to these distant countries of their adoption, their relation to them cannot but be a transient one, especially in view of the disturbed state of the world and gloomy clouds that hang over its political horizons. They may suddenly be forced to go home; therefore, the native Bahá’ís, in particular, must seize this opportunity and arise too, themselves, in their own countries, pioneer to new cities and towns, new islands and as yet unopened territories, so that they may, with the help of their Bahá’í brethren from overseas, lay a firm and enduring foundation, and commence the great task of building up the Administrative Order, which is itself the foundation of the future World Order.</p>
  
    <p id='696'>Special attention must be given during this crucial year to consolidating the precious goals already won, to creating new Spiritual Assemblies, to increasing the groups and the isolated centers.</p>
  
    <p id='697'>Your Assembly must be very careful not to overload the Bahá’ís with rules and regulations, circulars and directions. The purpose of the administration at this time is to blow on the fire newly kindled in the hearts of these people who have accepted the Faith, to create in <span data-pg='84' id='pg84'></span> them the desire and capacity to teach, to facilitate the pioneer and teaching work, and help deepen the knowledge and understanding of the friends. The beloved Guardian issues this word of warning, as long experience has shown that it is a tendency on the part of all N.S.A.s to over-administer. In their enthusiasm they forget that they only have a handful of inexperienced souls to guide, and attempt to deal with their work as if they had a large population to regulate! This then stifles the spirit of the friends and the teaching work suffers.</p>
  
    <p id='698'>He hopes that special attention will be given to the translation of more literature into the languages in use throughout that area and its publication. Likewise, Summer Schools should be multiplied as they enable the friends to gain in knowledge, and, through taking part in the course, increase their ability as Bahá’í teachers.</p>
  
    <p id='699'>He was most happy to receive news of the spread of the Faith to some of the other islands in Japan, and hopes that this initial effort will be carefully followed up, and that the Message of Bahá’u’lláh will be carried to all the Japanese islands—and those in their neighbourhood—including Sakhalin, which is one of the few remaining virgin territories to be opened under the Ten-Year Plan.</p>
  
    <p id='700'>The extraordinary progress made in the Far East and the Pacific area has been a constant source of pride and joy to the Guardian, and he feels confident that the door has opened on a new era in the advancement of our beloved Faith in these promising regions, and, indeed, all over the world. To the degree to which the friends consecrate themselves to the teaching work will directly depend the results they achieve during this year and coming years.</p>
  
    <p id='701'>The beloved Guardian assures you all of his loving and continued prayers for the success of your work, for your strength, guidance and protection.</p>
  
    <p class='Ssignature' id='702'>(signed by R. Rabbani)</p>
  
    <p id='703'>(in the Guardian’s handwriting)</p>
  
    <p id='704'>Dear and valued co-workers:</p>
  
    <p id='705'>The formation of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of North East Asia is to be acclaimed as an event of far-reaching historic significance, whose repercussions cannot be confined to the Pacific area, but are bound to affect the immediate fortunes of the entire Bahá’í world. The emergence of this epochal institution, however transitional its character, represents the culmination of a fifty-year old process that has had its inception in the days of the Centre of the Covenant, during the last decades of the Heroic Age of the <span data-pg='85' id='pg85'></span> Bahá’í Dispensation. The rise and expansion of the Administrative Order of the Faith in the northern regions of the vast Pacific Ocean fills a great gap, and constitutes a notable parallel to the rise of similar institutions in the Antipodes, establishing thereby a spiritual equilibrium destined to affect, to a marked degree, the destinies of the Faith throughout the islands of the Pacific Ocean, in the years immediately ahead. It should be hailed, moreover, as a momentous development paving the way for the eventual introduction of the Faith into the far-flung Chinese mainland and, beyond it, to the extensive territories of Soviet Russia.</p>
  
    <p id='706'>A milestone of such tremendous significance in the progress of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, in so strategic and important an area of the globe, should be acclaimed by the members of your assembly, as well as by the rank and file of the believers throughout that area, as a demonstration of the creative energies released by its Author and the Centre of His Covenant, in territories and amidst peoples and races destined to play a role of immense significance in the future development of the human race.</p>
  
    <p id='707'>This God-given opportunity, now presenting itself to the prosecutors of the Bahá’í world Spiritual Crusade, at so critical a stage in the history of the peoples and nations established in those far-off islands and territories, should be seized with eagerness and enthusiasm, and exploited to the full in the years lying immediately ahead.</p>
  
    <p id='708'>The Six-Year Plan, designed to lend a tremendous impetus to the awakening of the peoples and races in those regions, should be prosecuted with the utmost diligence, unrelaxing vigilance and whole-hearted consecration. All must participate, young and old alike, both men and women, however limited their circumstances or circumscribed their resources.</p>
  
    <p id='709'>An effort, unprecedented in its scope and intensity, must be exerted to attain, speedily and completely the specific objectives of this Plan. The number of the avowed supporters of the Faith must rapidly increase. The isolated centers, groups and local assemblies, constituting the bedrock of a rising Administrative Order, must steadily and continually multiply. All firmly grounded local spiritual assemblies must be speedily incorporated, in order to reinforce the foundations of the institution of this divinely conceived Order. The Bahá’í marriage certificate, as well as the Bahá’í Holy Days must, at the earliest possible opportunity, receive recognition from the civil authorities concerned. The work now being initiated in the Northern and smaller islands of Japan, with such zeal and devotion should be <span data-pg='86' id='pg86'></span> constantly reinforced and its scope continually widened. The literature of the Faith must be translated into as many languages as possible, published and widely disseminated. The holding of the summer-schools is yet another objective that should receive the earnest and immediate attention of the members of your assembly. The purchase of Bahá’í burial-grounds, should, moreover, be, in due course considered and effectively carried out. The newly-opened territories, that have been so painstakingly brought within the pale of the Faith, must at whatever cost, be safeguarded, and the enterprises initiated within their confines carefully expanded and consolidated. The acquisition of a plot, in the outskirts of Tokyo, to serve as the site of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of North East Asia, must, likewise, be seriously considered and brought to a successful conclusion.</p>
  
    <p id='710'>The task challenging the spirit and resources of your assembly, as well as those whom you represent, is admittedly arduous, pressing and sacred. The field in which you operate is exceptionally vast, and the barriers standing in your way are varied and formidable. Nothing short of complete dedication to the objectives of the Six-Year Plan you are called upon to fulfill, and of the utmost self-sacrifice on your part, as well as on the part of those who are to participate in its prosecution, can ensure the success to which I confidently look forward, to which your sister, as well as parent, communities throughout the Bahá’í world, are likewise, eagerly anticipating.</p>
  
    <p id='711'>May those who are privileged, at this auspicious hour, to render so noble a service to the Cause of God, and fulfill so glorious a destiny, in the course of the evolution of so sacred and precious a Faith, arise to perform befittingly their task, and achieve such feats in the days to come as shall draw forth from the Source on high a still greater measure of divine blessings that will enable them to write a still more brilliant chapter in the annals of God’s infant Faith, and to contribute an outstanding share to the world-wide establishment and ultimate recognition of its newly-born administrative institutions.</p>

    <p id='722'>He (the Guardian) feels there is no definite action that can be taken by the Tokyo Spiritual Assembly against … any society which uses our Bahá’í ideas and principles. The best thing is for the Japanese believers, through strengthening their community, enlarging it, obtaining publicity in the press, and holding, whenever possible, dignified public meetings, to gradually assert themselves as the real body of the Faith, and make everything else appear to be mere plagiarism, a shadow of the Faith. Your Assembly should give them (the Japanese believers) as much moral support and encouragement as possible.</p>

    <p id='729'>It was a very historic gathering, because it marked the first time a general conference regarding teaching matters had been held in Japan, and furthermore was participated in by representatives of the other countries in the area. It released a new power of the Spirit in that part of the world which will certainly elevate the minds and hearts of the people and attract many to the Cause.</p>
  
    <p id='730'>The Guardian appreciates the sacrificial efforts made by all those who undertook the development of the Conference, so that it might produce such beneficial results.</p>
  
    <p id='731'>The Guardian is hopeful that the conditions in Japan may not force many of the pioneers to leave that territory. As you know, he attaches the utmost importance to the teaching work in Japan; he anticipates that the Faith will spread rapidly in that country. The help of the American Bahá’ís is very essential; and he hopes therefore it will not be necessary for any of them to leave.</p>

He was particularly glad to hear teaching will be done in Hiroshima, where the people suffered so mercilessly during the war; they have a special right—the people of that city—to hear of Bahá’u’lláh’s Message of peace and brotherhood.</p>
  
    <p id='773'>The Assembly of Tokyo, until such time as other local assemblies are formed, can receive the applications for enrollment from people living elsewhere. Anyone living outside the civic limits of Tokyo, however, cannot be a voting member of that community, but of course, may attend meetings and Feasts until a local nucleus is established.</p>
  
    <p id='774'>The Guardian was particularly happy to note that there are so many Japanese Bahá’ís; although the American friends have rendered <span data-pg='93' id='pg93'></span> a great service in Japan, the object of all teachings is to establish firmly the Faith of God in the hearts and lives of the people of the country. He hopes that special efforts will be made to teach the Japanese, and to provide them with Bahá’í literature in their own language, and to conduct meetings in Japanese, and also to encourage them to understand the Administration and take an active, constructive part in its workings. Without a proper understanding of the Administrative Order, extensive plans cannot be undertaken and harmony will not prevail within the community.</p>
  
    <p id='775'>He (the Guardian) will remember you in all his prayers, and is most pleased with your progress and your devoted spirit.</p>

    <p id='781'>The beloved Guardian has said that the future of Japan from every standpoint is very bright indeed. The Faith will spread rapidly in Japan, once the public become acquainted with its universal principles, and its dynamic spirit.</p>
  
    <p id='782'>What is necessary at this time is for the Bahá’ís to adhere firmly to the teachings of the Faith, and to become a clear channel through which the power of the Holy Spirit might disseminate itself throughout the country.</p>
  
    <p id='783'>So far as the Ananai-kyo Movement is concerned, and their desire for affiliation:</p>
  
    <p id='784'>The Bahá’ís may associate with Movements such as this, without becoming supporters and active workers therein; the object being to make friendly contacts which can be developed into firm Bahá’ís.</p>
  
    <p id='785'>So far as non-Bahá’ís affiliating with the Bahá’í Faith is concerned, either a person becomes a Bahá’í and accepts Bahá’u’lláh as the divine Manifestation for this day or he does not. The tenets of the Bahá’í Faith are simple as outlined by the Guardian, but they do not permit any variations. In other words, if any members of the Ananai-kyo Movement wish to become Bahá’ís; they will be most welcome; but they can only become Bahá’ís on the basis of accepting <span data-pg='94' id='pg94'></span> Bahá’u’lláh as a divine Manifestation, and of course, with this goes the acceptance of the Báb as the Fore-runner, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the Center of the Covenant, and the present Administrative Order.</p>
  
    <p id='786'>When a person has reached the sea of immortality, it is idle to keep seeking elsewhere; and when the members of the Ananai-kyo Movement reach Bahá’u’lláh in their search for a world teacher, they have reached the goal, and not another step along the path.</p>
  
    <p id='787'>I presume you have received by this time full details concerning the Ten Year Crusade, and the Plan which the Guardian has enunciated for the American National Assembly to assist in the development of the Faith in Japan, so that ultimately there may be a National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís in Japan itself.</p>
  
    <p id='788'>The American National Spiritual Assembly has appointed a special committee for the Asian countries, and I am quite sure you will find the very closest possible cooperation from them in the development of the work.</p>
  
    <p id='789'>You will find, as the Extension Teaching work in Japan moves forward, there will have to be constant and continuous consultation with this important committee.</p>
  
    <p id='790'>You can appreciate it will be entirely impossible for the International Council or the staff of the Guardian himself, to undertake the supervision of the teaching work in any one part of the world; furthermore it would be contrary to the general principle of Bahá’í administration. Under Bahá’í administration, Local Assemblies, and the development of teaching work are placed in the hands of National Assemblies. The National Assemblies themselves report directly to Haifa—to the Universal House of Justice, when it is established; and until that time, to the Guardian himself.</p>
  
    <p id='791'>At the instruction of the Guardian, I am communicating with the American National Spiritual Assembly, to ask them to set up a program, whereby there will be the closest possible collaboration between their Asia Teaching Committee and your own Assembly. I hope this will be the means of all data reaching you very promptly.</p>
  
    <p id='792'>The beloved Guardian asked me to convey to you his deep love. He appreciates and values very highly your devoted services to the Faith. He will pray at the Holy Shrines, for your guidance and confirmation. It is his hope that heavenly blessings may be with you at all times, and every obstacle in the path of your efforts to continually spread the Message in Japan may be removed, so that you may ultimately gain complete victory.</p>

    <p id='796'>Shoghi Effendi feels that the time has now come when the Faith will spread rapidly in Japan. The Japanese people have great vision and spirituality, and the difficulties of the last war have prepared many of them for the Divine Guidance.

    <p id='800'>The beloved Guardian sends his loving greetings to each and every one of the friends in Japan. He greatly values their devotion and sacrifice for the Faith, and the noble manner in which they are arising to spread the Teachings in that land.</p>
  
    <p id='801'>He feels the future of Japan is very great. The hearts and minds of the Japanese people are awakened; and if the teaching work is carried on very actively and audaciously, many souls will be attracted by the Divine Fragrances.</p>
  
    <p id='802'>The beloved Guardian is so confident that the Faith will spread rapidly in Japan, and the believers will firmly establish the institutions of the Cause, that he has chosen to send to them for ultimate display in their National Haziratu’l-Quds in Tokyo one of the very precious relics from the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. He has entrusted with our dear brother, Hiroyasu Takano, a very precious brocade, which has rested immediately over the remains of Bahá’u’lláh in His glorious Shrine. It is very precious and very sacred.</p>
  
    <p id='803'>The Guardian is sending this to the Spiritual Assembly of Tokyo as a gift. The friends may wish to have it carefully and beautifully framed for display in the Hazira, when it is acquired. Ultimately of course it is to be hung in the Hazira of the National Assembly, when that great goal has been achieved by the Japanese believers.</p>

    <p id='807'>The beloved Guardian was pleased to see the manner in which the Assembly has undertaken its responsibility of enthusing the believers to carry on teaching work throughout Japan in an aggressive manner.</p>
  
    <p id='808'>The keynote of activity during the second year of the Ten-Year Crusade is the multiplication of Assemblies, groups and isolated centers. The Guardian feels the time is ripe for the active spread of the Faith throughout Japan; and if pioneers and settlers will go to additional cities and very actively teach the Faith, they will find that the Cause will grow and develop in each of these new areas.</p>
  
    <p id='809'>You should not overlook the fact that one of the goals of the Ten-Year Crusade is the establishment of a National Assembly in Japan. This can be brought about more quickly if the friends set aside all other considerations and actively teach the Faith.</p>
  
    <p id='810'>The sacred gift which the Guardian sent to the Japanese Bahá’ís through Mr. Takano is of course for the Hazira as soon as it is procured. It is one of the very sacred relics, and the Guardian hopes it will be a source of inspiration to the friends to redouble their efforts in the teaching field.</p>

The Guardian would see no objection to this <span data-pg='97' id='pg97'></span> Haziratu’l-Quds being sold, and the fund received thereby being used to defray the cost of the Haziratu’l-Quds in Tokyo.

The corrosion of ungodliness is eating into the vitals of human society; what else but the Elixir of His potent Revelation can cleanse and revive it?”</p>
  
    <p id='886'>This is the ebb of the tide. The Bahá’ís know that the tide will turn and come in, after mankind has suffered, with mighty waves of faith and devotion. The people will enter the Cause of God in troops, and the whole condition will change. The Bahá’ís see this new condition which will take place, as one on the mountain-top sees the first glimpse of the dawn, before others are aware of it; and it is toward that that the Bahá’ís must work.</p>

    <p id='892'>Although the American and Persian friends are helping greatly the spread of the Faith in Japan, the main object of their presence in <span data-pg='103' id='pg103'></span> that country is to attract Japanese people to the Cause of God.

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='The following excerpts are from letters to pioneers to Japan and Korea, 1948–1957'></h3> 
    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='[Letter of January 21, 1948]'></h3>
  
    <p id='899'>To Mr. Robert Imagire</p>
  
    <p id='900'>He (the Guardian) notices in your last letter that you sound discouraged. But he feels you should look on the bright side of the work in Japan, and realize that, after so many, many years of complete inertia, the old Bahá’ís have been found—at least some of them—and contacts reestablished. You are able to serve there, new people are hearing of the Faith, and the prospects for the future work there are promising. It is a great pity that a pioneer effort, organized and financed, cannot be carried out there. But the present Seven Year Plan takes all the American Bahá’í resources, and at present Japan must depend on volunteer teachers like your dear self, who of course are not as free as a full time pioneer would be.</p>
  
    <p id='901'>In regard to the various questions in your last letter; because of the difficult conditions under which you are serving there and the state of the country and immaturity of the believers you should not be too rigid. You should try and meet on the proper Feast day, but if it is not possible meet as close to the date as you can. Likewise, it would be desirable to observe the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh and the Master, etc., at the correct times, but it is not essential to do so. With such a small group of Bahá’ís who have no proper literature except the Esslemont <span data-pg='104' id='pg104'></span> book, and need to deepen in the Teachings, you should be very patient and not ask them to do things before they see the wisdom of it.</p>
  
    <p id='902'>Membership for Bahá’ís should be based on their understanding the station of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Guardian and the function of the Administrative Order. To do this it is not necessary for people to first read the Will and Testament and the Dispensation. The essentials can be explained to them, and the rest is a question of faith; if they believe, they can be accepted as Bahá’ís. It is premature now to say any “laws” of the Aqdas must be followed. But the Bahá’ís should be encouraged to keep the Fast, use an obligatory prayer, obtain the consent of parents for marriage, and live up to the Teachings in general.</p>
  
    <p id='903'>He certainly feels one of your first duties is to deepen the understanding of the Faith in the minds of the believers there.</p>
  
    <p id='904'>You should certainly try to make new contacts but until you have a nucleus of active believers there he feels a lot of publicity is premature.</p>
  
    <p id='905'>As to translations, this is certainly very important, but he would not suggest that at present with the limited facilities at your disposal, that you translate whole books. Make selections of subjects that will interest the Japanese; some prayers, some of the chapters from “Some Answered Questions” on things of general interest rather than the purely Christian topics; some of the excerpts from “Gleanings”. In other words try and get together a selection from our Teachings that covers a wide range of subjects and is representative of our beliefs, and translate these at first. Whole books can be undertaken in the future.</p>
  
    <p id='906'>He feels the teaching and translating work can go hand in hand as you teach with new material translated.</p>
  
    <p id='907'>Your services are very deeply valued by our beloved Guardian, and he assures you he will pray for you and all the Japanese Bahá’ís in the Holy Shrines.</p>

Your mission is indeed historic, and your pioneer achievements an example to the rising generation. Persevere in your high endeavors, and rest assured that the Beloved will bless your exertions and will aid you to fulfil your heart’s desire.</p>

    <p id='945'>He (the Guardian) was deeply touched by the two letters by the two new believers of Korea, and the spirit of loving devotion which they portray. He wishes you to assure them of his prayers in their behalf. He hopes they will be inspired to intensify their teaching efforts, so others may be quickened by the spirit of Bahá’u’lláh, and an Assembly be formed in Korea. <span data-pg='107' id='pg107'></span></p>
  
    <p id='946'>He wishes you and the friends in Tokyo to keep in close touch with the friends in Korea. In fact, he wishes the Tokyo Assembly to undertake, as one of their direct responsibilities, the assistance of the work in Korea, sending if possible one or two pioneers to Korea. This will keep the Center in Korea, (and even enable it to develop into an Assembly), until such time as more American pioneers are sent to Korea.</p>
  
    <p id='947'>The Guardian greatly values the services of the friends in Japan. He hopes they will now treble their efforts in the teaching field. Now that the Ten Year Crusade has been so auspiciously launched, the divine confirmations are descending; and the friends should seize this opportunity to spread the Faith to all corners of the globe. Especial opportunity devolves on the Japanese Bahá’ís and pioneers, as one of the goals of the Crusade is the establishment of a National Assembly for Japan.</p>

    <p id='981'>Emperor Showa (Hirohito) of Japan had the longest reign (December 25, 1926 to January 7, 1989) of any reigning sovereign in Japan. He was respected as a scholar; being an eminent marine biologist, and he was beloved by his people.</p>
  
    <p id='982'>Following the custom in Japan, the reign of a new emperor is given a specially selected name. After that emperor dies he takes on the name of the reign. Consequently, Emperor Hirohito, as he was known during his reign, is now known as Emperor Showa.</p>
  
    <p id='983'>At the time of his coronation in the fall of 1928 seven specially bound Bahá’í books were presented to His Majesty. The books which were sent in the name of two American Bahá’ís were presented by Dr. Rokuichiro Masujima, who was a friend of Miss Alexander and who was close to the Faith. He had access to the Imperial Household.</p>
  
    <p id='984'>Shoghi Effendi was asked to write something to be sent with the books. The message sent to accompany the books was “May the perusal of Bahá’í literature enable Your Imperial Majesty to appreciate the sublimity and penetrative power of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation and inspire you on this auspicious occasion to arise for its worldwide recognition and triumph.”</p>
  
    <p id='985'>The books arrived after the coronation ceremonies so the presentation was delayed. On May 22 of the following year Dr. Masujima received a letter from the Minister of the Imperial Household that the seven books had been presented to the Emperor that day.</p>
  
    <p id='986'>During World War II the palace did not suffer destruction so undoubtedly the books and message are still there with the other coronation gifts.</p>
  
    <p id='987'>In 1930 the great Bahá’í teacher Miss Martha Root visited Japan. She sent two gifts to the Emperor; a small Persian rug and a sheet of Holy Writings written in Persian script in the form of a beautiful bird. Accompanying the gifts was a cable from Shoghi Effendi: “Martha Root care American Embassy Tokyo. Kindly transmit His Imperial Majesty, Tokyo, Japan on behalf of myself and Bahá’ís world over, expression of our deepest love as well as assurance of heartfelt prayers for his well-being and prosperity of his ancient realm.”</p>
  
    <p id='988'>Japan, after recovery from the devastation of World War II, shows the prosperity that the Guardian prayed for, and the Emperor, active and healthy until the end had a very long and fruitful reign. <span data-pg='111' id='pg111'></span></p>

    <h3 class='subhead' data-title='15: Message from the Universal House of Justice to the North Pacific Oceanic Conference, Sapporo, Japan, September, 1971'></h3>
  
    <p id='989'>To the Friends of God Assembled in the Conference of the North Pacific Ocean.</p>
  
    <p id='990'>Dearly-loved Friends,</p>
  
    <p id='991'>On the eve of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the opening of the Formative Age of our Faith we call to mind the high hopes often expressed by the beloved Master for the spread of the Cause in this region. His mention in the Tablets of the Divine Plan of many of the territories represented in this Conference, and the faithful and devoted services of that maid-servant of Bahá’u’lláh, the Hand of the Cause Agnes Alexander, who brought the Teachings to these shores in the early years of this century.</p>
  
    <p id='992'>In these days we are witnessing an unprecedented acceleration of the teaching work in almost every part of the globe. In the North Pacific Ocean area great strides have been made in the advancement of the Cause since that historic Asia Regional Teaching Conference in Nikko just sixteen years ago. The next two years witnessed the formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska and of the Regional National Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia. To the Convention in Tokyo at Riḍván 1957 the Guardian addressed these prophetic words:</p>
  
    <p id='993'>“This auspicious event, which posterity will regard as the culmination of a process initiated, half a century ago, in the capital city of Japan … marks the opening of the second chapter in the history of the evolution of His Faith in the North Pacific area. Such a consummation cannot fail to lend a tremendous impetus to its onward march in the entire Pacific Ocean…”</p>
  
    <p id='994'>Since that time National Spiritual Assemblies have also been firmly established in Korea and Taiwan.</p>
  
    <p id='995'>Hokkaido, the site of this Conference, first heard of the Teachings less than fifteen years ago, and the first aboriginal peoples of this land accepted Bahá’u’lláh just over a decade ago. Now you are the witnesses to the beginnings of a rapid increase in the number of believers. <span data-pg='112' id='pg112'></span> Peoples in other islands and lands of the North Pacific, including the Ryukyus, Guam, the Trust Territories, the western shores of Canada and Alaska and the Aleutians are also enrolling under the banner of the Most Great Name, and next Riḍván yet another pillar of the Universal House of Justice is to be raised in Micronesia. We are heartened at the prospect that from indigenous peoples of this vast oceanic area, the Ainu, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Koreans, the Okinawans, the Micronesians, the American Indians, the Eskimos, and the Aleuts vast numbers will soon enter the Faith.</p>
  
    <p id='996'>The final hours of the Nine Year Plan are fast fleeting. Praised be to God that you have gathered to consult on ways and means of assuring complete victory so that from these outposts the Teachings may spread to those nearby lands where teeming millions have not as yet heard of the advent of this Most Great Dispensation.</p>
  
    <p id='997'>The sweet perfume of victory is in the air, and we must hasten to achieve it while there is yet time. Vital goals, particularly on the homefronts of Taiwan and Japan, remain to be won, and everywhere the roots of the faith of the believers must sink deeper and deeper into the firm earth of the Teachings lest tempests and trials as yet unforeseen shake or uproot the tender plants so lovingly raised in the islands of this great Ocean and the land surrounding it.</p>
  
    <p id='998'>As you and the friends in the sister Conference in Reykjavik bring this series of eight Oceanic and Continental Conferences to a triumphant close, our prayers for the success of your deliberations ascend at the Holy Threshold. May God grant you the resources, the strength, and the determination to attain your highest hopes and enable you to open a new and glorious chapter in the evolution of His Faith in the North Pacific area.</p>

As it contained new material, that is, Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and letters of the Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, many of which had never been published, and because its theme was Japan, it proved to be a successful addition to the Bahá’í literature throughout the Bahá’í world. It was translated into Japanese and has been one of the standard books in that language.</p>
  
    <p id='1001'>The Bahá’í Publishing Trust of Japan regularly has requests for the English edition although it has been out of print since the late 1970s.</p>
  
    <p id='1002'>When the compiler considered a second edition she decided to refer back to the original material for possible changes, to add new material, and also add more details such as the names of translators (when available), thereby hoping to increase the historical value. Very little of the original has been eliminated.</p>
  
    <p id='1003'>All of the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Miss Alexander and to Bahá’ís in Japan have been included. Only some of the Tablets written to Japanese, who, at the time, were living in the United States have been included. It was difficult to choose which of Shoghi Effendi’s letters to Miss Aexander should be included.</p>
  
    <p id='1004'>The Guardian had requested that she write to him often so their correspondence was extensive. She actually received many more letters than are printed here.</p>
  
    <p id='1005'>Most of Shoghi Effendi’s letters (which, of course, also means those written on his behalf) to the early Bahá’ís of Japan and to the institutions of the Faith in Japan are printed here.</p>
  
    <p id='1006'>It was felt that certain communications from the Universal House of Justice would add to this important subject, hence the expansion to later years.</p>
