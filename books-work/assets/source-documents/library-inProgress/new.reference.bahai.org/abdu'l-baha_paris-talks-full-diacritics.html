<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p1"></a>
When a man turns his face to God he finds sunshine everywhere. All
men are his brothers. Let not conventionality cause you to seem cold
and unsympathetic when you meet strange people from other countries.
Do not look at them as though you suspected them of being evildoers,
thieves and boors. You think it necessary to be very careful, not to
expose yourselves to the risk of making acquaintance with such,
possibly, undesirable people.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p2"></a>
I ask you not to think only of yourselves. Be kind to the strangers,
whether come they from Turkey, Japan, Persia, Russia, China or any
other country in the world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p3"></a>
Help to make them feel at home; find out where they are staying, ask
if you may render them any service; try to make their lives a little
happier.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p4"></a>
In this way, even if, sometimes, what you at first suspected should
be true, still go out of your way to be kind to them—this kindness
will help them to become better.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p5"></a>
After all, why should any foreign people be treated as strangers?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p6"></a>
Let those who meet you know, without your proclaiming the fact, that
you are indeed a Bahá’í. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p7"></a>
Put into practice the Teaching of Bahá’u’lláh, that of kindness
to all nations. Do not be content with showing friendship in words
alone, let your heart burn with loving kindness for all who may cross
your path.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p8"></a>
Oh, you of the Western nations, be kind to those who come from the
Eastern world to sojourn among you. Forget your conventionality when
you speak with them; they are not accustomed to it. To Eastern
peoples this demeanor seems cold, unfriendly. Rather let your manner
be sympathetic. Let it be seen that you are filled with universal
love. When you meet a Persian or any other stranger, speak to him as
to a friend; if he seems to be lonely try to help him, give him of
your willing service; if he be sad console him, if poor succor him,
if oppressed rescue him, if in misery comfort him. In so doing you
will manifest that not in words only, but in deed and in truth, you
think of all men as your brothers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p9"></a>
What profit is there in agreeing that universal friendship is good,
and talking of the solidarity of the human race as a grand ideal?
Unless these thoughts are translated into the world of action, they
are useless.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p10"></a>
The wrong in the world continues to exist just because people talk
only of their ideals, and do not strive to put them into practice. If
actions took the place of words, the world’s misery would very soon
be changed into comfort.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p11"></a>
A man who does great good, and talks not of it, is on the way to
perfection.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p12"></a>
The man who has accomplished a small good and magnifies it in his
speech is worth very little. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p13"></a>
If I love you, I need not continually speak of my love—you will
know without any words. On the other hand if I love you not, that
also will you know—and you would not believe me, were I to tell you
in a thousand words, that I loved you.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p14"></a>
People make much profession of goodness, multiplying fine words
because they wish to be thought greater and better than their
fellows, seeking fame in the eyes of the world. Those who do most
good use fewest words concerning their actions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p15"></a>
The children of God do the works without boasting, obeying His laws.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p16"></a>
My hope for you is that you will ever avoid tyranny and oppression;
that you will work without ceasing till justice reigns in every land,
that you will keep your hearts pure and your hands free from
unrighteousness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-1-p17"></a>
This is what the near approach to God requires from you, and this is
what I expect of you.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-2-p1"></a>
The reality of man is his thought, not his material body. The thought
force and the animal force are partners. Although man is part of the
animal creation, he possesses a power of thought superior to all
other created beings.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-2-p2"></a>
If a man’s thought is constantly aspiring towards heavenly subjects
then does he become saintly; if on the other hand his thought does
not soar, but is directed downwards to center itself upon the things
of this world, he grows more and more material until he arrives at a
state little better than that of a mere animal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-2-p3"></a>
Thoughts may be divided into two classes: <br>(1st) Thought that
belongs to the world of thought alone. <br>(2nd) Thought that
expresses itself in action.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-2-p4"></a>
Some men and women glory in their exalted thoughts, but if these
thoughts never reach the plane of action they remain useless: the
power of thought is dependent on its manifestation in deeds. A
philosopher’s thought may, however, in the world of progress and
evolution, translate itself into the actions of other people, even
when they themselves are unable or unwilling to show forth their
grand ideals in their own lives. To this class the majority of
philosophers belong, their teachings being high above their actions.
This is the difference between philosophers who are Spiritual
Teachers, and those who are mere philosophers: the Spiritual Teacher
is the first to follow His own teaching; He brings down into the
world of action His spiritual conceptions and ideals. His Divine
thoughts are made manifest to the world. His thought is Himself, from
which He is inseparable. When we find a philosopher emphasizing the
importance and grandeur of justice, and then encouraging a rapacious
monarch in his oppression and tyranny, we quickly realize that he
belongs to the first class: for he thinks heavenly thoughts and does
not practice the corresponding heavenly virtues. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-2-p5"></a>
This state is impossible with Spiritual Philosophers, for they ever
express their high and noble thoughts in actions.

All true healing comes from God! There are two causes for sickness,
one is material, the other spiritual. If the sickness is of the body,
a material remedy is needed, if of the soul, a spiritual remedy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-3-p2"></a>
If the heavenly benediction be upon us while we are being healed then
only can we be made whole, for medicine is but the outward and
visible means through which we obtain the heavenly healing. Unless
the spirit be healed, the cure of the body is worth nothing. All is
in the hands of God, and without Him there can be no health in us!</p>

There have been many men who have died at last of the very disease of
which they have made a special study. Aristotle, for instance, who
made a special study of the digestion, died of a gastric malady.
Avicenna was a specialist of the heart, but he died of heart disease.
God is the great compassionate Physician who alone has the power to
give true healing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-3-p4"></a>
All creatures are dependent upon God, however great may seem their
knowledge, power and independence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-3-p5"></a>
Behold the mighty kings upon earth, for they have all the power in
the world that man can give them, and yet when death calls they must
obey, even as the peasants at their gates.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-3-p6"></a>
Look also at the animals, how helpless they are in their apparent
strength! For the elephant, the largest of all animals, is troubled
by the fly, and the lion cannot escape the irritation of the worm.
Even man, the highest form of created beings, needs many things for
his very life; first of all he needs air, and if he is deprived of it
for a few minutes, he dies. He is also dependent on water, food,
clothing, warmth, and many other things. On all sides he is
surrounded by dangers and difficulties, against which his physical
body alone cannot cope. If a man looks at the world around him, he
will see how all created things are dependent and are captive to the
laws of Nature.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-3-p7"></a>
Man alone, by his spiritual power, has been able to free himself, to
soar above the world of matter and to make it his servant.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-3-p8"></a>
Without the help of God man is even as the beasts that perish, but
God has bestowed such wonderful power upon him that he might ever
look upward, and receive, among other gifts, healing from His divine
Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-3-p9"></a>
But alas! man is not grateful for this supreme good, but sleeps the
sleep of negligence, being careless of the great mercy which God has
shown towards him, turning his face away from the light and going on
his way in darkness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-3-p10"></a>
It is my earnest prayer, that ye be not like unto this, but rather
that ye keep your faces steadfastly turned to the light, so that ye
may be as lighted torches in the dark places of life.

said: 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-4-p1"></a>
In the past, as in the present, the Spiritual Sun of Truth has always
shone from the horizon of the East.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-4-p2"></a>
Abraham appeared in the East. In the East Moses arose to lead and
teach the people. On the Eastern horizon arose the Lord Christ.
Muḥammad was sent to an Eastern nation. The Báb arose in the
Eastern land of Persia. Bahá’u’lláh lived and taught in the
East. All the great Spiritual Teachers arose in the Eastern world.
But although the Sun of Christ dawned in the East the radiance
thereof was apparent in the West, where the effulgence of its glory
was more clearly seen. The divine light of His Teaching shone with a
greater force in the Western world, where it has made a more rapid
headway than in the land of its birth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-4-p3"></a>
In these days the East is in need of material progress and the West
is in want of a spiritual idea. It would be well for the West to turn
to the East for illumination, and to give in exchange its scientific
knowledge. There must be this interchange of gifts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-4-p4"></a>
The East and the West must unite to give to each other what is
lacking. This union will bring about a true civilization, where the
spiritual is expressed and carried out in the material.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-4-p5"></a>
Receiving thus the one from the other the greatest harmony will
prevail, all people will be united, a state of great perfection will
be attained, there will be a firm cementing, and this world will
become a shining mirror for the reflection of the attributes of God.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-4-p6"></a>
We all, the Eastern with the Western nations, must strive day and
night with heart and soul to achieve this high ideal, to cement the
unity between all the nations of the earth. Every heart will then be
refreshed, all eyes will be opened, the most wonderful power will be
given, the happiness of humanity will be assured.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-4-p7"></a>
We must pray that by the Bounty of God, Persia will be enabled to
receive the material and mental civilization of the West, and by
Divine Grace to give in return her spiritual light. The devoted
energetic work of the united peoples, occidentals and orientals, will
succeed in establishing this result, for the force of the Holy Spirit
will aid them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-4-p8"></a>
The principles of the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh should be
carefully studied, one by one, until they are realized and understood
by mind and heart—so will you become strong followers of the light,
truly spiritual, heavenly soldiers of God, acquiring and spreading
the true civilization in Persia, in Europe, and in the whole world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-4-p9"></a>
This will be the paradise which is to come on earth, when all mankind
will be gathered together under the tent of unity in the Kingdom of
Glory.

Numerous meetings are held in Paris every day for different purposes,
to discuss politics, commerce, education, art, science and many other
subjects.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p2"></a>
All these meetings are good: but <i>this</i> assembly has met
together to turn their faces towards God, to learn how best to work
for the good of humanity, to seek how prejudices may be abolished,
and the seed of love and universal brotherhood sown in the heart of
man.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p3"></a>
God approves of the motive of our gathering together and gives us His
blessing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p4"></a>
In the Old Testament we read that God said, “Let us make man in Our
own image.” In the Gospel, Christ said, “I am in the Father, and
the Father in Me.”<a href="#footnote-pt_en-5-1"><sup>1</sup></a> In
the Qur’án, God says, “Man is my Mystery and I am his.”
Bahá’u’lláh writes that God says, “Thy heart is My home;
purify it for My descent. Thy spirit is My place of revelation;
cleanse it for My manifestation.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p5"></a>
All these sacred words show us that man is made in God’s image: yet
the Essence of God is incomprehensible to the human mind, for the
finite understanding cannot be applied to this infinite Mystery. God
contains all: He cannot be contained. That which contains is superior
to that which is contained. The whole is greater than its parts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p6"></a>
Things which are understood by men cannot be outside their capacity
for understanding, so that it is impossible for the heart of man to
comprehend the nature of the Majesty of God. Our imagination can only
picture that which it is able to create.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p7"></a>
The power of the understanding differs in degree in the various
kingdoms of creation. The mineral, vegetable, and animal realms are
each incapable of understanding any creation beyond their own. The
mineral cannot imagine the growing power of the plant. The tree
cannot understand the power of movement in the animal, neither can it
comprehend what it would mean to possess sight, hearing or the sense
of smell. These all belong to the physical creation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p8"></a>
Man also shares in this creation; but it is not possible for either
of the lower kingdoms to understand that which takes place in the
mind of man. The animal cannot realize the intelligence of a human
being, he only knows that which is perceived by his animal senses, he
cannot imagine anything in the abstract. An animal could not learn
that the world is round, that the earth revolves round the sun, or
the construction of the electric telegraph. These things are only
possible to man. Man is the highest work of creation, the nearest to
God of all creatures.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p9"></a>
All superior kingdoms are incomprehensible to the inferior; how
therefore could it be possible that the creature, man, should
understand the almighty Creator of all? 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p10"></a>
That which we imagine, is not the Reality of God; He, the Unknowable,
the Unthinkable, is far beyond the highest conception of man.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p11"></a>
All creatures that exist are dependent upon the Divine Bounty. Divine
Mercy gives life itself. As the light of the sun shines on the whole
world, so the Mercy of the infinite God is shed on all creatures. As
the sun ripens the fruits of the earth, and gives life and warmth to
all living beings, so shines the Sun of Truth on all souls, filling
them with the fire of Divine love and understanding.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p12"></a>
The superiority of man over the rest of the created world is seen
again in this, that man has a soul in which dwells the divine spirit;
the souls of the lower creatures are inferior in their essence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p13"></a>
There is no doubt then, that of all created beings man is the nearest
to the nature of God, and therefore receives a greater gift of the
Divine Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p14"></a>
The mineral kingdom possesses the power of existing. The plant has
the power of existing and growing. The animal, in addition to
existence and growth, has the capacity of moving about, and the use
of the faculties of the senses. In the human kingdom we find all the
attributes of the lower worlds, with much more added thereto. Man is
the sum of every previous creation, for he contains them all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p15"></a>
To man is given the special gift of the intellect by which he is able
to receive a larger share of the light Divine. The Perfect Man is as
a polished mirror reflecting the Sun of Truth, manifesting the
attributes of God. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p16"></a>
The Lord Christ said, “He that hath seen Me hath seen the
Father”—God manifested in man.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p17"></a>
The sun does not leave his place in the heavens and descend into the
mirror, for the actions of ascent and descent, coming and going, do
not belong to the Infinite, they are the methods of finite beings. In
the Manifestation of God, the perfectly polished mirror, appear the
qualities of the Divine in a form that man is capable of
comprehending.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p18"></a>
This is so simple that all can understand it, and that which we are
able to understand we must perforce accept.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p19"></a>
Our Father will not hold us responsible for the rejection of dogmas
which we are unable either to believe or comprehend, for He is ever
infinitely just to His children.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p20"></a>
This example is, however, so logical that it can easily be grasped by
all minds willing to give it their consideration.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p21"></a>
May each one of you become a shining lamp, of which the flame is the
Love of God. May your hearts burn with the radiance of unity. May
your eyes be illumined with the effulgence of the Sun of Truth!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p22"></a>
The city of Paris is very beautiful, a more civilized and
well-appointed town in all material development it would be
impossible to find in the present world. But the spiritual light has
not shone upon her for a long time: her spiritual progress is far
behind that of her material civilization. A supreme power is needed
to awaken her to the reality of spiritual truth, to breathe the
breath of life into her dormant soul. You must all unite in this work
of arousing her, in reanimating her people by the help of that
Superior Force.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p23"></a>
When an illness is slight a small remedy will suffice to heal it, but
when the slight illness becomes a terrible disease, then a very
strong remedy must be used by the Divine Healer. There are some trees
that blossom and bear fruit in a cool climate, others there are which
need the hottest rays of the sun to bring them to perfect maturity.
Paris is one of those trees for whose spiritual unfoldment a great
flaming Sun of the Divine Power of God is needed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p24"></a>
I ask you all, each one of you, to follow well the light of truth, in
the Holy Teachings, and God will strengthen you by His Holy Spirit so
that you will be enabled to overcome the difficulties, and to destroy
the prejudices which cause separation and hatred amongst the people.
Let your hearts be filled with the great love of God, let it be felt
by all; for every man is a servant of God, and all are entitled to a
share of the Divine Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p25"></a>
Especially to those whose thoughts are material and retrograde show
the utmost love and patience, thereby winning them into the unity of
fellowship by the radiance of your kindness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-5-p26"></a>
If you are faithful to your great work, following the Holy Sun of
Truth without swerving, then will the blessed day of universal
brotherhood dawn on this beautiful city.

I hope you are all happy and well. I am not happy, but very sad. The
news of the Battle of Benghazi grieves my heart. I wonder at the
human savagery that still exists in the world! How is it possible for
men to fight from morning until evening, killing each other, shedding
the blood of their fellowmen: And for what object? To gain possession
of a part of the earth! Even the animals, when they fight, have an
immediate and more reasonable cause for their attacks! How terrible
it is that men, who are of the higher kingdom, can descend to slaying
and bringing misery to their fellow-beings, for the possession of a
tract of land!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-6-p2"></a>
The highest of created beings fighting to obtain the lowest form of
matter, earth! Land belongs not to one people, but to all people.
This earth is not man’s home, but his tomb. It is for their tombs
these men are fighting. There is nothing so horrible in this world as
the tomb, the abode of the decaying bodies of men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-6-p3"></a>
However great the conqueror, however many countries he may reduce to
slavery, he is unable to retain any part of these devastated lands
but one tiny portion—his tomb! If more land is required for the
improvement of the condition of the people, for the spread of
civilization (for the substitution of just laws for brutal
customs)—surely it would be possible to acquire peaceably the
necessary extension of territory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-6-p4"></a>
But war is made for the satisfaction of men’s ambition; for the
sake of worldly gain to the few, terrible misery is brought to
numberless homes, breaking the hearts of hundreds of men and women!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-6-p5"></a>
How many widows mourn their husbands, how many stories of savage
cruelty do we hear! How many little orphaned children are crying for
their dead fathers, how many women are weeping for their slain sons!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-6-p6"></a>
There is nothing so heartbreaking and terrible as an outburst of
human savagery!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-6-p7"></a>
I charge you all that each one of you concentrate all the thoughts of
your heart on love and unity. When a thought of war comes, oppose it
by a stronger thought of peace. A thought of hatred must be destroyed
by a more powerful thought of love. Thoughts of war bring destruction
to all harmony, well-being, restfulness and content.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-6-p8"></a>
Thoughts of love are constructive of brotherhood, peace, friendship,
and happiness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-6-p9"></a>
When soldiers of the world draw their swords to kill, soldiers of God
clasp each other’s hands! So may all the savagery of man disappear
by the Mercy of God, working through the pure in heart and the
sincere of soul. Do not think the peace of the world an ideal
impossible to attain!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-6-p10"></a>
Nothing is impossible to the Divine Benevolence of God.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-6-p11"></a>
If you desire with all your heart, friendship with every race on
earth, your thought, spiritual and positive, will spread; it will
become the desire of others, growing stronger and stronger, until it
reaches the minds of all men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-6-p12"></a>
Do not despair! Work steadily. Sincerity and love will conquer hate.
How many seemingly impossible events are coming to pass in these
days! Set your faces steadily towards the Light of the World. Show
love to all; “Love is the breath of the Holy Spirit in the heart of
Man.” Take courage! God never forsakes His children who strive and
work and pray! Let your hearts be filled with the strenuous desire
that tranquillity and harmony may encircle all this warring world. So
will success crown your efforts, and with the universal brotherhood
will come the Kingdom of God in peace and goodwill.</p>

In this room today are members of many races, French, American,
English, German, Italian, brothers and sisters meeting in friendship
and harmony! Let this gathering be a foreshadowing of what will, in
very truth, take place in this world, when every child of God
realizes that they are leaves of one tree, flowers in one garden,
drops in one ocean, and sons and daughters of one Father, whose name
is love!

It is a lovely day, the sun shines brightly upon the earth, giving
light and warmth to all creatures. The Sun of Truth is also shining,
giving light and warmth to the souls of men. The sun is the
life-giver to the physical bodies of all creatures upon earth;
without its warmth their growth would be stunted, their development
would be arrested, they would decay and die. Even so do the souls of
men need the Sun of Truth to shed its rays upon their souls, to
develop them, to educate and encourage them. As the sun is to the
body of a man so is the Sun of Truth to his soul.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-7-p2"></a>
A man may have attained to a high degree of material progress, but
without the light of truth his soul is stunted and starved. Another
man may have no material gifts, may be at the bottom of the social
ladder, but, having received the warmth of the Sun of Truth his soul
is great and his spiritual understanding is enlightened.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-7-p3"></a>
A Greek philosopher living in the days of the youth of Christianity,
being full of the Christian element, though not a professing
Christian, wrote thus: “It is my belief that religion is the very
foundation of true civilization.” For, unless the moral character
of a nation is educated, as well as its brain and its talents,
civilization has no sure basis.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-7-p4"></a>
As religion inculcates morality, it is therefore the truest
philosophy, and on it is built the only lasting civilization. As an
example of this, he points out the Christians of the time whose
morality was on a very high level. The belief of this philosopher
conforms to the truth, for the civilization of Christianity was the
best and most enlightened in the world. The Christian Teaching was
illumined by the Divine Sun of Truth, therefore its followers were
taught to love all men as brothers to fear nothing, not even death!
To love their neighbors as themselves, and to forget their own
selfish interests in striving for the greater good of humanity. The
grand aim of the religion of Christ was to draw the hearts of all men
nearer to God’s effulgent Truth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-7-p5"></a>
If the followers of the Lord Christ had continued to follow out these
principles with steadfast faithfulness, there would have been no need
for a renewal of the Christian Message, no necessity for a
reawakening of His people, for a great and glorious civilization
would now be ruling the world and the Kingdom of Heaven would have
come on earth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-7-p6"></a>
But instead of this, what has taken place! Men turned away their
faces from following the divinely illuminated precepts of their
Master, and winter fell upon the hearts of men. For, as the body of
man depends for life upon the rays of the sun, so cannot the
celestial virtues grow in the soul without the radiance of the Sun of
Truth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-7-p7"></a>
God leaves not His children comfortless, but, when the darkness of
winter overshadows them, then again He sends His Messengers, the
Prophets, with a renewal of the blessed spring. The Sun of Truth
appears again on the horizon of the world shining into the eyes of
those who sleep, awaking them to behold the glory of a new dawn. Then
again will the tree of humanity blossom and bring forth the fruit of
righteousness for the healing of the nations. Because man has stopped
his ears to the Voice of Truth and shut his eyes to the Sacred Light,
neglecting the Law of God, for this reason has the darkness of war
and tumult, unrest and misery, desolated the earth. I pray that you
will all strive to bring each child of God into the radiance of the
Sun of Truth, that the darkness may be dissipated by the penetrating
rays of its glory, and the winter’s hardness and cold may be melted
away by the merciful warmth of its shining.

When a man has found the joy of life in one place, he returns to that
same spot to find more joy. When a man has found gold in a mine, he
returns again to that mine to dig for more gold.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-8-p2"></a>
This shows the internal force and natural instinct which God has
given to man, and the power of vital energy which is born in him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-8-p3"></a>
The West has always received spiritual enlightenment from the East.
The Song of the Kingdom is first heard in the East, but in the West
the greater volume of sound bursts upon the listening ears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-8-p4"></a>
The Lord Christ arose as a bright Star in the Eastern sky, but the
light of His Teaching shone more perfectly in the West, where His
influence has taken root more firmly and His Cause has spread to a
greater degree than in the land of His birth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-8-p5"></a>
The sound of the Song of Christ has echoed over all the lands of the
Western World and entered the hearts of its people.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-8-p6"></a>
The people of the West are firm, and the foundations on which they
build are of rock; they are steadfast, and do not easily forget.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-8-p7"></a>
The West is like a strong sturdy plant; when the rain falls gently
upon it to give it nourishment and the sun shines upon it, then does
it blossom in due time and bring forth good fruit. It is a long time
since the Sun of Truth mirrored forth by the Lord Christ has shed its
radiance upon the West, for the Face of God has been veiled by the
sin and forgetfulness of man. But now again, praise be to God, the
Holy Spirit speaks anew to the world! The constellation of love and
wisdom and power is once more shining from the Divine Horizon to give
joy to all who turn their faces to the Light of God. Bahá’u’lláh
has rent the veil of prejudice and superstition which was stifling
the souls of men. Let us pray to God that the breath of the Holy
Spirit may again give hope and refreshment to the people, awakening
in them a desire to do the Will of God. May heart and soul be
vivified in every man: so will they all rejoice in a new birth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-8-p8"></a>
Then shall humanity put on a new garment in the radiance of the love
of God, and it shall be the dawn of a new creation! Then will the
Mercy of the Most Merciful be showered upon all mankind and they will
arise to a new life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-8-p9"></a>
My earnest desire is that you will all strive and work for this
glorious end; that you will be faithful and loving workers in the
building of the new spiritual civilization; the elect of God, in
willing joyful obedience carrying out His supreme design! Success is
truly near at hand, for the Flag of Divinity has been raised aloft,
and the Sun of the Righteousness of God appeareth upon the horizon in
the sight of all men!

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">An Indian said to
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
“My aim in life is to transmit as far as in me lies the message of
Krishna to the world.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p1"></a>
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá said: The Message of Krishna is the message
of love. All God’s prophets have brought the message of love. None
has ever thought that war and hate are good. Everyone agrees in
saying that love and kindness are best.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p2"></a>
Love manifests its reality in deeds, not only in words—these alone
are without effect. In order that love may manifest its power there
must be an object, an instrument, a motive.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p3"></a>
There are many ways of expressing the love principle; there is love
for the family, for the country, for the race, there is political
enthusiasm, there is also the love of community of interest in
service. These are all ways and means of showing the power of love.
Without any such means, love would be unseen, unheard,
unfelt—altogether unexpressed, unmanifested! Water shows its power
in various ways, in quenching thirst, causing seed to grow, etc. Coal
expresses one of its principles in gaslight, while one of the powers
of electricity is shown in the electric light. If there were neither
gas nor electricity, the nights of the world would be darkness! So,
it is necessary to have an instrument, a motive for love’s
manifestation, an object, a mode of expression.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p4"></a>
We must find a way of spreading love among the sons of humanity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p5"></a>
Love is unlimited, boundless, infinite! Material things are limited,
circumscribed, finite. You cannot adequately express infinite love by
limited means.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p6"></a>
The perfect love needs an unselfish instrument, absolutely freed from
fetters of every kind. The love of family is limited; the tie of
blood relationship is not the strongest bond. Frequently members of
the same family disagree, and even hate each other.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p7"></a>
Patriotic love is finite; the love of one’s country causing hatred
of all others, is not perfect love! Compatriots also are not free
from quarrels amongst themselves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p8"></a>
The love of race is limited; there is some union here, but that is
insufficient. Love must be free from boundaries!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p9"></a>
To love our own race may mean hatred of all others, and even people
of the same race often dislike each other.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p10"></a>
Political love also is much bound up with hatred of one party for
another; this love is very limited and uncertain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p11"></a>
The love of community of interest in service is likewise fluctuating;
frequently competitions arise, which lead to jealousy, and at length
hatred replaces love.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p12"></a>
A few years ago, Turkey and Italy had a friendly political
understanding; now they are at war!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p13"></a>
All these ties of love are imperfect. It is clear that limited
material ties are insufficient to adequately express the universal
love.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p14"></a>
The great unselfish love for humanity is bounded by none of these
imperfect, semi-selfish bonds; this is the one perfect love, possible
to all mankind, and can only be achieved by the power of the Divine
Spirit. No worldly power can accomplish the universal love.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p15"></a>
Let all be united in this Divine power of love! Let all strive to
grow in the light of the Sun of Truth, and reflecting this luminous
love on all men, may their hearts become so united that they may
dwell evermore in the radiance of the limitless love.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p16"></a>
Remember these words which I speak unto you during the short time I
am amongst you in Paris. I earnestly exhort you: let not your hearts
be fettered by the material things of this world; I charge you not to
lie contentedly on the beds of negligence, prisoners of matter, but
to arise and free yourselves from its chains!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p17"></a>
The animal creation is captive to matter, God has given freedom to
man. The animal cannot escape the law of nature, whereas man may
control it, for he, containing nature, can rise above it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p18"></a>
The power of the Holy Spirit, enlightening man’s intelligence, has
enabled him to discover means of bending many natural laws to his
will. He flies through the air, floats on the sea, and even moves
under the waters. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p19"></a>
All this proves how man’s intelligence has been enabled to free him
from the limitations of nature, and to solve many of her mysteries.
Man, to a certain extent, has broken the chains of matter.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p20"></a>
The Holy Spirit will give to man greater powers than these, if only
he will strive after the things of the spirit and endeavor to attune
his heart to the Divine infinite love.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p21"></a>
When you love a member of your family or a compatriot, let it be with
a ray of the Infinite Love! Let it be in God, and for God! Wherever
you find the attributes of God love that person, whether he be of
your family or of another. Shed the light of a boundless love on
every human being whom you meet, whether of your country, your race,
your political party, or of any other nation, color or shade of
political opinion. Heaven will support you while you work in this
ingathering of the scattered peoples of the world beneath the shadow
of the almighty tent of unity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p22"></a>
You will be servants of God, who are dwelling near to Him, His divine
helpers in the service, ministering to all Humanity. <i>All</i>
Humanity! Every human being! <i>Never forget this!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p23"></a>
Do not say, he is an Italian, or a Frenchman, or an American, or an
Englishman, remember only that he is a son of God, a servant of the
Most High, a man! All are <i>men</i>! Forget nationalities; <i>all
are equal in the sight of God!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p24"></a>
Remember not your own limitations; the help of God will come to you.
Forget yourself. God’s help will surely come!

strength will be tenfold.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-9-p26"></a>
Look at me: I am so feeble, yet I have had the strength given me to
come amongst you: a poor servant of God, who has been enabled to give
you this message! I shall not be with you long! One must never
consider one’s own feebleness, it is the strength of the Holy
Spirit of Love, which gives the power to teach. The thought of our
own weakness could only bring despair. We must look higher than all
earthly thoughts; detach ourselves from every material idea, crave
for the things of the spirit; fix our eyes on the everlasting
bountiful Mercy of the Almighty, who will fill our souls with the
gladness of joyful service to His command “Love One Another.”

Possessing this gift, he is, in himself, the sum of earlier
creations—he is able to get into touch with those kingdoms; and by
this gift, he can frequently, through his scientific knowledge, reach
out with prophetic vision.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-11-p4"></a>
Intellect is, in truth, the most precious gift bestowed upon man by
the Divine Bounty. Man alone, among created beings, has this
wonderful power.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-11-p5"></a>
All creation, preceding Man, is bound by the stern law of nature. The
great sun, the multitudes of stars, the oceans and seas, the
mountains, the rivers, the trees, and all animals, great or
small—none is able to evade obedience to nature’s law. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-11-p6"></a>
Man alone has freedom, and, by his understanding or intellect, has
been able to gain control of and adapt some of those natural laws to
his own needs. By the power of his intellect he has discovered means
by which he not only traverses great continents in express trains and
crosses vast oceans in ships, but, like the fish he travels under
water in submarines, and, imitating the birds, he flies through the
air in airships.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-11-p7"></a>
Man has succeeded in using electricity in several ways—for light,
for motive power, for sending messages from one end of the earth to
the other—and by electricity he can even hear a voice many miles
away!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-11-p8"></a>
By this gift of understanding or intellect he has also been able to
use the rays of the sun to picture people and things, and even to
capture the form of distant heavenly bodies.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-11-p9"></a>
We perceive in what numerous ways man has been able to bend the
powers of nature to his will.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-11-p10"></a>
How grievous it is to see how man has used his God-given gift to
frame instruments of war, for breaking the Commandment of God “Thou
shalt not kill,” and for defying Christ’s injunction to “Love
one another.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-11-p11"></a>
God gave this power to man that it might be used for the advancement
of civilization, for the good of humanity, to increase love and
concord and peace. But man prefers to use this gift to destroy
instead of to build, for injustice and oppression, for hatred and
discord and devastation, for the destruction of his fellow-creatures,
whom Christ has commanded that he should love as himself! 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-11-p12"></a>
I hope that you will use <i>your</i> understanding to promote the
unity and tranquillity of mankind, to give enlightenment and
civilization to the people, to produce love in all around you, and to
bring about the universal peace.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-11-p13"></a>
Study the sciences, acquire more and more knowledge. Assuredly one
may learn to the end of one’s life! Use your knowledge always for
the benefit of others; so may war cease on the face of this beautiful
earth, and a glorious edifice of peace and concord be raised. Strive
that your high ideals may be realized in the Kingdom of God on earth,
as they will be in Heaven.

Christ said, “They shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of
Heaven.”<a href="#footnote-pt_en-12-1"><sup>1</sup></a> Bahá’u’lláh
said, “When Christ came for the first time He came upon the
clouds.”<a href="#footnote-pt_en-12-2"><sup>2</sup></a> Christ said
that He had come from the sky, from Heaven—that He came forth from
God—while He was born of Mary, His Mother. But when He declared
that He had come from Heaven, it is clear that He did not mean the
blue firmament but that He spoke of the Heaven of the Kingdom of God,
and that from this Heaven He descended upon the clouds. As clouds are
obstacles to the shining of the sun, so the clouds of the world of
humanity hid from the eyes of men the radiance of the Divinity of
Christ.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-12-p4"></a>
Men said, “He is of Nazareth, born of Mary, we know Him and we know
His brethren. What can He mean? What is He saying? That He came forth
from God?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-12-p5"></a>
The Body of Christ was born of Mary of Nazareth, but the Spirit was
of God. The capacities of His human body were limited but the
strength of His spirit was vast, infinite, immeasurable.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-12-p6"></a>
Men asked, “Why does He say He is of God?” If they had understood
the reality of Christ, they would have known that the body of His
humanity was a cloud that hid His Divinity. The world only saw His
human form, and therefore wondered how He could have “come down
from Heaven.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-12-p7"></a>
Bahá’u’lláh said, “Even as the clouds hide the sun and the
sky from our gaze, even so did the humanity of Christ hide from men
His real Divine character.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-12-p8"></a>
I hope that you will turn with unclouded eyes towards the Sun of
Truth, beholding not the things of earth, lest your hearts be
attracted to the worthless and passing pleasures of the world; let
that Sun give you of His strength, then will not the clouds of
prejudice veil His illumination from your eyes! Then will the Sun be
without clouds for you. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-12-p9"></a>
Breathe the air of purity. May you each and all share in the Divine
Bounties of the Kingdom of Heaven. May the world be for you no
obstacle hiding the truth from your sight, as the human body of
Christ hid His Divinity from the people of His day. May you receive
the clear vision of the Holy Spirit, so that your hearts may be
illumined and able to recognize the Sun of Truth shining through all
material clouds, His splendor flooding the universe.</p>

The basis of the teaching of Bahá’u’lláh is the <i>Unity of
Mankind</i>, and His greatest desire was that love and goodwill
should live in the heart of men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p2"></a>
As He exhorted the people to do away with strife and discord, so I
wish to explain to you the principal reason of the unrest among
nations. The chief cause is the misrepresentation of religion by the
religious leaders and teachers. They teach their followers to believe
that their own form of religion is the only one pleasing to God, and
that followers of any other persuasion are condemned by the
All-Loving Father and deprived of His Mercy and Grace. Hence arise
among the peoples, disapproval, contempt, disputes and hatred. If
these religious prejudices could be swept away, the nations would
soon enjoy peace and concord.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p3"></a>
I was once at Tiberias where the Jews have a Temple. I was staying in
a house just opposite the Temple, and there I saw and heard a Rabbi
speaking to his congregation of Jews, and he spoke thus:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p4"></a>
“O Jews, you are in truth the people of God! All other races and
religions are of the devil. God has created you the descendants of
Abraham, and He has showered His blessings upon you. Unto you God
sent Moses, Jacob and Joseph, and many other great prophets. These
prophets, one and all, were of your race.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p5"></a>
“It was for you that God broke the power of Pharaoh and caused the
Red Sea to dry up; to you also He sent manna from above to be your
food, and out of the stony rock did He give you water to quench your
thirst. You are indeed the chosen people of God, you are above all
the races of the earth! Therefore, all other races are abhorrent to
God, and condemned by Him. In truth you will govern and subdue the
world, and all men shall become your slaves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p6"></a>
“Do not profane yourselves by consorting with people who are not of
your own religion, make not friends of such men.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p7"></a>
When the Rabbi had finished his eloquent discourse, his hearers were
filled with joy and satisfaction. It is impossible to describe to you
their happiness!</p>

Alas! It is misguided ones like these who are the cause of division
and hatred upon earth. Today there are millions of people who still
worship idols, and the great religions of the world are at war among
themselves. For 1,300 years, Christians and Muslims have been
quarreling, when with very little effort their differences and
disputes could be overcome and peace and harmony could exist between
them and the world could be at rest!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p9"></a>
In the Qur’án we read that Muḥammad spoke to His followers,
saying:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p10"></a>
“Why do you not believe in Christ, and in the Gospel? Why will you
not accept Moses and the Prophets, for surely the Bible is the Book
of God? In truth, Moses was a sublime Prophet, and Jesus was filled
with the Holy Spirit. He came to the world through the Power of God,
born of the Holy Spirit and of the blessed Virgin Mary. Mary, His
mother, was a saint from Heaven. She passed her days in the Temple at
prayer and food was sent to her from above. Her father, Zacharias,
came to her and asked her from whence the food came, and Mary made
answer, ‘From on high.’ Surely God made Mary to be exalted above
all other women.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p11"></a>
This is what Muḥammad taught His people concerning Jesus and Moses,
and He reproached them for their lack of faith in these great
Teachers, and taught them the lessons of truth and tolerance.
Muḥammad was sent from God to work among a people as savage and
uncivilized as the wild beasts. They were quite devoid of
understanding, nor had they any feelings of love, sympathy and pity.
Women were so degraded and despised that a man could bury his
daughter alive, and he had as many wives to be his slaves as he
chose. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p12"></a>
Among these half animal people Muḥammad was sent with His divine
Message. He taught the people that idol worship was wrong, and that
they should reverence Christ, Moses and the Prophets. Under His
influence they became a more enlightened and civilized people and
arose from the degraded state in which He found them. Was not this a
good work, and worthy of all praise, respect and love?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p13"></a>
Look at the Gospel of the Lord Christ and see how glorious it is! Yet
even today men fail to understand its priceless beauty, and
misinterpret its words of wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p14"></a>
Christ forbade war! When the disciple Peter, thinking to defend his
Lord, cut off the ear of the servant of the High Priest, Christ said
to him: “Put up thy sword into the sheath.”<a href="#footnote-pt_en-13-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Yet, in spite of the direct command of the Lord they profess to
serve—men still dispute, make war, and kill one another, and His
counsels and teaching seem quite forgotten.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p15"></a>
But do not therefore attribute to the Masters and Prophets the evil
deeds of their followers. If the priests, teachers and people, lead
lives which are contrary to the religion they profess to follow, is
that the fault of Christ or the other Teachers?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p16"></a>
The people of Islám were taught to realize how Jesus came from God
and was born of the Spirit, and that He must be glorified of all men.
Moses was a prophet of God, and revealed in His day and for the
people to whom He was sent, the Book of God.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p17"></a>
Muḥammad recognized the sublime grandeur of Christ and the
greatness of Moses and the prophets. If only the whole world would
acknowledge the greatness of Muḥammad and all the Heaven-sent
Teachers, strife and discord would soon vanish from the face of the
earth, and God’s Kingdom would come among men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p18"></a>
The people of Islám who glorify Christ are not humiliated by so
doing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p19"></a>
Christ was the Prophet of the Christians, Moses of the Jews—why
should not the followers of each prophet recognize and honor the
other prophets also? If men could only learn the lesson of mutual
tolerance, understanding, and brotherly love, the unity of the world
would soon be an established fact.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-13-p20"></a>
Bahá’u’lláh spent His life teaching this lesson of Love and
Unity. Let us then put away from us all prejudice and intolerance,
and strive with all our hearts and souls to bring about understanding
and unity between Christians and Muslims.

God alone ordereth all things and is all-powerful. Why then does He
send trials to His servants?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-14-p2"></a>
The trials of man are of two kinds. (a) The consequences of his own
actions. If a man eats too much, he ruins his digestion; if he takes
poison he becomes ill or dies. If a person gambles he will lose his
money; if he drinks too much he will lose his equilibrium. All these
sufferings are caused by the man himself, it is quite clear therefore
that certain sorrows are the result of our own deeds.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-14-p3"></a>
(b) Other sufferings there are, which come upon the Faithful of God.
Consider the great sorrows endured by Christ and by His apostles!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-14-p4"></a>
Those who suffer most, attain to the greatest perfection.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-14-p5"></a>
Those who declare a wish to suffer much for Christ’s sake must
prove their sincerity; those who proclaim their longing to make great
sacrifices can only prove their truth by their deeds. Job proved the
fidelity of his love for God by being faithful through his great
adversity, as well as during the prosperity of his life. The apostles
of Christ who steadfastly bore all their trials and sufferings—did
they not prove their faithfulness? Was not their endurance the best
proof?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-14-p6"></a>
These griefs are now ended.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-14-p7"></a>
Caiaphas lived a comfortable and happy life while Peter’s life was
full of sorrow and trial; which of these two is the more enviable?
Assuredly we should choose the present state of Peter, for he
possesses immortal life whilst Caiaphas has won eternal shame. The
trials of Peter tested his fidelity. Tests are benefits from God, for
which we should thank Him. Grief and sorrow do not come to us by
chance, they are sent to us by the Divine Mercy for our own
perfecting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-14-p8"></a>
While a man is happy he may forget his God; but when grief comes and
sorrows overwhelm him, then will he remember his Father who is in
Heaven, and who is able to deliver him from his humiliations.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-14-p9"></a>
Men who suffer not, attain no perfection. The plant most pruned by
the gardeners is that one which, when the summer comes, will have the

The laborer cuts up the earth with his plough, and from that earth
comes the rich and plentiful harvest. The more a man is chastened,
the greater is the harvest of spiritual virtues shown forth by him. A
soldier is no good General until he has been in the front of the
fiercest battle and has received the deepest wounds.</p>

From this same God all creation sprang into existence, and He is the

Yet all these flowers, shrubs and trees spring from the self-same
earth, the same sun shines upon them and the same clouds give them
rain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-15-p5"></a>
So it is with humanity. It is made up of many races, and its peoples
are of different color, white, black, yellow, brown and red—but
they all come from the same God, and all are servants to Him. This
diversity among the children of men has unhappily not the same effect
as it has among the vegetable creation, where the spirit shown is
more harmonious. Among men exists the diversity of animosity, and it
is this that causes war and hatred among the different nations of the
world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-15-p6"></a>
Differences which are only those of blood also cause them to destroy
and kill one another. Alas! that this should still be so. Let us look
rather at the beauty in diversity, the beauty of harmony, and learn a
lesson from the vegetable creation. If you beheld a garden in which
all the plants were the same as to form, color and perfume, it would
not seem beautiful to you at all, but, rather, monotonous and dull.
The garden which is pleasing to the eye and which makes the heart
glad, is the garden in which are growing side by side flowers of
every hue, form and perfume, and the joyous contrast of color is what
makes for charm and beauty. So is it with trees. An orchard full of
fruit trees is a delight; so is a plantation planted with many
species of shrubs. It is just the diversity and variety that
constitutes its charm; each flower, each tree, each fruit, beside
being beautiful in itself, brings out by contrast the qualities of
the others, and shows to advantage the special loveliness of each and
all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-15-p7"></a>
Thus should it be among the children of men! The diversity in the
human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in
music where many different notes blend together in the making of a
perfect chord. If you meet those of different race and color from
yourself, do not mistrust them and withdraw yourself into your shell
of conventionality, but rather be glad and show them kindness. Think
of them as different colored roses growing in the beautiful garden of
humanity, and rejoice to be among them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-15-p8"></a>
Likewise, when you meet those whose opinions differ from your own, do
not turn away your face from them. All are seeking truth, and there
are many roads leading thereto. Truth has many aspects, but it
remains always and forever one.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-15-p9"></a>
Do not allow difference of opinion, or diversity of thought to
separate you from your fellowmen, or to be the cause of dispute,
hatred and strife in your hearts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-15-p10"></a>
Rather, search diligently for the truth and make all men your
friends. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-15-p11"></a>
Every edifice is made of many different stones, yet each depends on
the other to such an extent that if one were displaced the whole
building would suffer; if one is faulty the structure is imperfect.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-15-p12"></a>
Bahá’u’lláh has drawn the circle of unity, He has made a design
for the uniting of all the peoples, and for the gathering of them all
under the shelter of the tent of universal unity. This is the work of
the Divine Bounty, and we must all strive with heart and soul until
we have the reality of unity in our midst, and as we work, so will
strength be given unto us. Leave all thought of self, and strive only
to be obedient and submissive to the Will of God. In this way only
shall we become citizens of the Kingdom of God, and attain unto life
everlasting.

True Meaning of the Prophecies Concerning the Coming of Christ</b></font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-16-p1"></a>
In the Bible there are prophecies of the coming of Christ. The Jews
still await the coming of the Messiah, and pray to God day and night
to hasten His advent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-16-p2"></a>
When Christ came they denounced and slew Him, saying: “This is not
the One for whom we wait. Behold when the Messiah shall come, signs
and wonders shall testify that He is in truth the Christ. We know the
signs and conditions, and they have not appeared. The Messiah will
arise out of an unknown city. He shall sit upon the throne of David,
and behold, He shall come with a sword of steel, and with a scepter
of iron shall He rule! He shall fulfill the law of the Prophets, He
shall conquer the East and the West, and shall glorify His chosen
people the Jews. He shall bring with Him a reign of peace, during
which even the animals shall cease to be at enmity with man. For
behold the wolf and the lamb shall drink from the same spring, and
the lion and the doe shall lie down in the same pasture, the serpent
and the mouse shall share the same nest, and all God’s creatures
shall be at rest.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-16-p3"></a>
According to the Jews, Jesus the Christ fulfilled none of these
conditions, for their eyes were holden and they could not see.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-16-p4"></a>
He came from Nazareth, no unknown place. He carried no sword in His
hand, nor even a stick. He did not sit upon the Throne of David, He
was a poor man. He reformed the Law of Moses, and broke the Sabbath
Day. He did not conquer the East and the West, but was Himself
subject to the Roman Law. He did not exalt the Jews, but taught
equality and brotherhood, and rebuked the Scribes and Pharisees. He
brought in no reign of peace, for during His lifetime injustice and
cruelty reached such a height that even He Himself fell a victim to
it, and died a shameful death upon the cross.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-16-p5"></a>
Thus the Jews thought and spoke, for they did not understand the
Scriptures nor the glorious truths that were contained in them. The
letter they knew by heart, but of the life-giving spirit they
understood not a word. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-16-p6"></a>
Hearken, and I will show you the meaning thereof. Although He came
from Nazareth, which was a known place, He also came from Heaven. His
body was born of Mary, but His Spirit came from Heaven. The sword He
carried was the sword of His tongue, with which He divided the good
from the evil, the true from the false, the faithful from the
unfaithful, and the light from the darkness. His Word was indeed a
sharp sword! The Throne upon which He sat is the Eternal Throne from
which Christ reigns forever, a heavenly throne, not an earthly one,
for the things of earth pass away but heavenly things pass not away.
He reinterpreted and completed the Law of Moses and fulfilled the Law
of the Prophets. His word conquered the East and the West. His
Kingdom is everlasting. He exalted those Jews who recognized Him.
They were men and women of humble birth, but contact with Him made
them great and gave them everlasting dignity. The animals who were to
live with one another signified the different sects and races, who,
once having been at war, were now to dwell in love and charity,
drinking together the water of life from Christ the Eternal Spring.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-16-p7"></a>
Thus, all the spiritual prophecies concerning the coming of Christ
were fulfilled, but the Jews shut their eyes that they should not
see, and their ears that they should not hear, and the Divine Reality
of Christ passed through their midst unheard, unloved and
unrecognized.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-16-p8"></a>
It is easy to read the Holy Scriptures, but it is only with a clean
heart and a pure mind that one may understand their true meaning. Let
us ask God’s help to enable us to understand the Holy Books. Let us
pray for eyes to see and ears to hear, and for hearts that long for
peace.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-16-p9"></a>
God’s eternal Mercy is immeasurable. He has always chosen certain
souls upon whom He has shed the Divine Bounty of His heart, whose
minds He has illumined with celestial light, to whom He has revealed
the sacred mysteries, and kept clear before their sight the Mirror of
Truth. These are the disciples of God, and His goodness has no
bounds. You who are servants of the Most High may be disciples also.
The treasuries of God are limitless.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-16-p10"></a>
The Spirit breathing through the Holy Scriptures is food for all who
hunger. God Who has given the revelation to His Prophets will surely
give of His abundance daily bread to all those who ask Him
faithfully.

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p1"></a>
The Divine Reality is Unthinkable, Limitless, Eternal, Immortal and
Invisible.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p2"></a>
The world of creation is bound by natural law, finite and mortal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p3"></a>
The Infinite Reality cannot be said to ascend or descend. It is
beyond the understanding of man, and cannot be described in terms
which apply to the phenomenal sphere of the created world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p4"></a>
Man, then, is in extreme need of the only Power by which he is able
to receive help from the Divine Reality, that Power alone bringing
him into contact with the Source of all life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p5"></a>
An intermediary is needed to bring two extremes into relation with
each other. Riches and poverty, plenty and need: without an
intermediary power there could be no relation between these pairs of
opposites.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p6"></a>
So we can say there must be a Mediator between God and Man, and this
is none other than the Holy Spirit, which brings the created earth
into relation with the “Unthinkable One,” the Divine Reality.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p7"></a>
The Divine Reality may be likened to the sun and the Holy Spirit to
the rays of the sun. As the rays of the sun bring the light and
warmth of the sun to the earth, giving life to all created beings, so
do the “Manifestations”<a href="#footnote-pt_en-17-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
bring the power of the Holy Spirit from the Divine Sun of Reality to
give light and life to the souls of men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p8"></a>
Behold, there is an intermediary necessary between the sun and the
earth; the sun does not descend to the earth, neither does the earth
ascend to the sun. This contact is made by the rays of the sun which
bring light and warmth and heat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p9"></a>
The Holy Spirit is the Light from the Sun of Truth bringing, by its
infinite power, life and illumination to all mankind, flooding all
souls with Divine Radiance, conveying the blessings of God’s Mercy
to the whole world. The earth, without the medium of the warmth and
light of the rays of the sun, could receive no benefits from the sun.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p10"></a>
Likewise the Holy Spirit is the very cause of the life of man;
without the Holy Spirit he would have no intellect, he would be
unable to acquire his scientific knowledge by which his great
influence over the rest of creation is gained. The illumination of
the Holy Spirit gives to man the power of thought, and enables him to
make discoveries by which he bends the laws of nature to his will.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p11"></a>
The Holy Spirit it is which, through the mediation of the Prophets of
God, teaches spiritual virtues to man and enables him to attain
Eternal Life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p12"></a>
All these blessings are brought to man by the Holy Spirit; therefore
we can understand that the Holy Spirit is the Intermediary between
the Creator and the created. The light and heat of the sun cause the
earth to be fruitful, and create life in all things that grow; and
the Holy Spirit quickens the souls of men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-17-p13"></a>
The two great apostles, St. Peter and St. John the Evangelist, were
once simple, humble workmen, toiling for their daily bread. By the
Power of the Holy Spirit their souls were illumined, and they
received the eternal blessings of the Lord Christ.

Today is a day of rejoicing in Paris! They are celebrating the
Festival of “All Saints.” Why do you think that these people were
called “Saints?” The word has a very real meaning. A saint is one
who leads a life of purity, one who has freed himself from all human
weaknesses and imperfections.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-18-p2"></a>
In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature and his
material or lower nature. In one he approaches God, in the other he
lives for the world alone. Signs of both these natures are to be
found in men. In his material aspect he expresses untruth, cruelty
and injustice; all these are the outcome of his lower nature. The
attributes of his Divine nature are shown forth in love, mercy,
kindness, truth and justice, one and all being expressions of his
higher nature. Every good habit, every noble quality belongs to man’s
spiritual nature, whereas all his imperfections and sinful actions
are born of his material nature. If a man’s Divine nature dominates
his human nature, we have a saint.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-18-p3"></a>
Man has the power both to do good and to do evil; if his power for
good predominates and his inclinations to do wrong are conquered,
then man in truth may be called a saint. But if, on the contrary, he
rejects the things of God and allows his evil passions to conquer
him, then he is no better than a mere animal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-18-p4"></a>
Saints are men who have freed themselves from the world of matter and
who have overcome sin. They live in the world but are not of it,
their thoughts being continually in the world of the spirit. Their
lives are spent in holiness, and their deeds show forth love, justice
and godliness. They are illumined from on high; they are as bright
and shining lamps in the dark places of the earth. These are the
saints of God. The apostles, who were the disciples of Jesus Christ,
were just as other men are; they, like their fellows, were attracted
by the things of the world, and each thought only of his own
advantage. They knew little of justice, nor were the Divine
perfections found in their midst. But when they followed Christ and
believed in Him, their ignorance gave place to understanding, cruelty
was changed to justice, falsehood to truth, darkness into light. They
had been worldly, they became spiritual and divine. They had been
children of darkness, they became sons of God, they became saints!
Strive therefore to follow in their steps, leaving all worldly things
behind, and striving to attain to the Spiritual Kingdom.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-18-p5"></a>
Pray to God that He may strengthen you in divine virtue, so that you
may be as angels in the world, and beacons of light to disclose the
mysteries of the Kingdom to those with understanding hearts.</p>

God sent His Prophets into the world to teach and enlighten man, to
explain to him the mystery of the Power of the Holy Spirit, to enable
him to reflect the light, and so in his turn, to be the source of
guidance to others. The Heavenly Books, the Bible, the Qur’án, and
the other Holy Writings have been given by God as guides into the
paths of Divine virtue, love, justice and peace.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-18-p7"></a>

How beautiful the weather is today, the sky is clear, the sun shines,
and the heart of man is made glad thereby!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-19-p2"></a>
Such bright and beautiful weather gives new life and strength to man,
and if he has been sick, he feels once more in his heart the joyous
hope of health renewed. All these gifts of nature concern the
physical side of man, for it is only his body that can receive
material benefits.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-19-p3"></a>
If a man is successful in his business, art, or profession he is
thereby enabled to increase his physical wellbeing and to give his
body the amount of ease and comfort in which it delights. All around
us today we see how man surrounds himself with every modern
convenience and luxury, and denies nothing to the physical and
material side of his nature. But, take heed, lest in thinking too
earnestly of the things of the body you forget the things of the
soul: for material advantages do not elevate the spirit of a man.
Perfection in worldly things is a joy to the body of a man but in no
wise does it glorify his soul.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-19-p4"></a>
It may be that a man who has every material benefit, and who lives
surrounded by all the greatest comfort modern civilization can give
him, is denied the all important gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-19-p5"></a>
It is indeed a good and praiseworthy thing to progress materially,
but in so doing, let us not neglect the more important spiritual

Only by improving spiritually as well as materially can we make any
real progress, and become perfect beings. It was in order to bring
this spiritual life and light into the world that all the great
Teachers have appeared. They came so that the Sun of Truth might be
manifested, and shine in the hearts of men, and that through its
wondrous power men might attain unto Everlasting Light.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-19-p7"></a>
When the Lord Christ came He spread the light of the Holy Spirit on

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-19-p8"></a>
It was to manifest this light that Bahá’u’lláh was born, and
came into the world. He taught Eternal Truth to men, and shed the
rays of Divine Light in all lands.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-19-p9"></a>

rife.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-19-p10"></a>

destructive implements and appliances to destroy his brother man.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-19-p11"></a>
But let us rather exert ourselves for the attainment of spiritual
advantages, for this is the only way of true progress, that which
cometh from God and is alone Godly.</p>

I pray for you one and all that you may receive the Bounties of the

be prepared to receive the glad tidings, your eyes shall be opened

Paris is becoming very cold, so cold that I shall soon be obliged to
go away, but the warmth of your love still keeps me here. God
willing, I hope to stay among you yet a little while; bodily cold and
heat cannot affect the spirit, for it is warmed by the fire of the
Love of God. When we understand this, we begin to understand
something of our life in the world to come. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p2"></a>
God, in His Bounty, has given us a foretaste here, has given us
certain proofs of the difference that exists between body, soul and
spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p3"></a>
We see that cold, heat, suffering, etc., only concern the <i>body</i>,
they do not touch the spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p4"></a>
How often do we see a man, poor, sick, miserably clad, and with no
means of support, yet spiritually strong. Whatever his body has to
suffer, his spirit is free and well! Again, how often do we see a
rich man, physically strong and healthy, but with a soul sick unto
death.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p5"></a>
It is quite apparent to the seeing mind that a man’s spirit is
something very different from his physical body.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p6"></a>
The spirit is changeless, indestructible. The progress and
development of the soul, the joy and sorrow of the soul, are
independent of the physical body.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p7"></a>
If we are caused joy or pain by a friend, if a love prove true or
false, it is the soul that is affected. If our dear ones are far from
us—it is the soul that grieves, and the grief or trouble of the
soul may react on the body.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p8"></a>
Thus, when the spirit is fed with holy virtues, then is the body
joyous; if the soul falls into sin, the body is in torment!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p9"></a>
When we find truth, constancy, fidelity, and love, we are happy; but
if we meet with lying, faithlessness, and deceit, we are miserable.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p10"></a>
These are all things pertaining to the soul, and are not <i>bodily</i>
ills. Thus, it is apparent that the soul, even as the body, has its
own individuality. But if the body undergoes a change, the spirit
need not be touched. When you break a glass on which the sun shines,
the glass is broken, but the sun still shines! If a cage containing a
bird is destroyed, the bird is unharmed! If a lamp is broken, the
flame can still burn bright!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p11"></a>
The same thing applies to the spirit of man. Though death destroy his
body, it has no power over his spirit—this is eternal, everlasting,
both birthless and deathless.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p12"></a>
As to the soul of man after death, it remains in the degree of purity
to which it has evolved during life in the physical body, and after
it is freed from the body it remains plunged in the ocean of God’s
Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p13"></a>
From the moment the soul leaves the body and arrives in the Heavenly
World, its evolution is spiritual, and that evolution is: <i>The
approaching unto God.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p14"></a>
In the physical creation, evolution is from one degree of perfection
to another. The mineral passes with its mineral perfections to the
vegetable; the vegetable, with its perfections, passes to the animal
world, and so on to that of humanity. This world is full of seeming
contradictions; in each of these kingdoms (mineral, vegetable and
animal) life exists in its degree; though when compared to the life
in a man, the earth appears to be dead, yet she, too, lives and has a
life of her own. In this world things live and die, and live again in
other forms of life, but in the world of the spirit it is quite
otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p15"></a>
The soul does not evolve from degree to degree as a law—it only
evolves nearer to God, by the Mercy and Bounty of God. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-20-p16"></a>
It is my earnest prayer that we may all be in the Kingdom of God, and
near Him.

All over Europe today one hears of meetings and assemblies, and
societies of all kinds are formed. There are those interested in
commerce, science, and politics, and many others. All these are for
<i>material</i> service, their desire being for the progress and
enlightenment of the world of matter. But rarely does a breath from
the spirit world breathe upon them. They seem unconscious of the
Divine Voice, careless concerning the things of God. But this meeting
in Paris is a truly spiritual one. The Divine Breath is poured forth
in your midst, the light of the Kingdom is shining in all hearts. The
Divine love of God is a power among you, and with souls athirst, ye
receive the glad tidings of great joy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-21-p2"></a>
You are all met here with one accord, heart drawn to heart, souls
overflowing with Divine love, working and longing for the unity of
the world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-21-p3"></a>
Verily this assembly is a spiritual one! It is like unto a beautiful
perfumed garden! On it the Heavenly Sun sheds the golden rays, and
the warmth thereof penetrates and gladdens each waiting heart. The
love of Christ, which passeth all knowledge, is among you, the Holy
Spirit is your help.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-21-p4"></a>
Day by day this meeting will grow and become more powerful until
gradually its spirit will conquer the whole world!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-21-p5"></a>
Try with all your hearts to be willing channels for God’s Bounty.
For I say unto you that He has chosen you to be His messengers of
love throughout the world, to be His bearers of spiritual gifts to
man, to be the means of spreading unity and concord on the earth.
Thank God with all your hearts that such a privilege has been given
unto you. For a life devoted to praise is not too long in which to
thank God for such a favor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-21-p6"></a>
Lift up your hearts above the present and look with eyes of faith
into the future! Today the seed is sown, the grain falls upon the
earth, but behold the day will come when it shall rise a glorious
tree and the branches thereof shall be laden with fruit. Rejoice and
be glad that this day has dawned, try to realize its power, for it is
indeed wonderful! God has crowned you with honor and in your hearts
has He set a radiant star; verily the light thereof shall brighten
the whole world!

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-22-p1"></a>
Today the weather is gloomy and dull! In the East there is continual
sunshine, the stars are never veiled, and there are very few clouds.
Light always rises in the East and sends forth its radiance into the
West.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-22-p2"></a>
There are two kinds of light. There is the visible light of the sun,
by whose aid we can discern the beauties of the world around
us—without this we could see nothing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-22-p3"></a>
Nevertheless, though it is the function of this light to make things
visible to us, it cannot give us the <i>power</i> to see them or to
understand what their various charms may be, for this light has no
intelligence, no consciousness. It is the light of the <i>intellect</i>
which gives us knowledge and understanding, and without this light
the physical eyes would be useless.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-22-p4"></a>
This light of the intellect is the highest light that exists, for it
is born of the <i>Light Divine</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-22-p5"></a>
The light of the intellect enables us to understand and realize all
that exists, but it is only the Divine Light that can give us sight
for the invisible things, and which enables us to see truths that
will only be visible to the world thousands of years hence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-22-p6"></a>
It was the Divine Light which enabled the prophets to see two
thousand years in advance what was going to take place and today we
see the realization of their vision. Thus it is this Light which we
must strive to seek, for it is greater than any other.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-22-p7"></a>
It was by this Light that Moses was enabled to see and comprehend the
Divine Appearance, and to hear the Heavenly Voice which spoke to Him
from the Burning Bush.<a href="#footnote-pt_en-22-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-22-p8"></a>
It is of this Light Muḥammad is speaking when He says, “Alláh is
the light of the Heavens, and of the Earth.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-22-p9"></a>
Seek with all your hearts this Heavenly Light, so that you may be
enabled to understand the realities, that you may know the secret
things of God, that the hidden ways may be made plain before your
eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-22-p10"></a>
This light may be likened unto a mirror, and as a mirror reflects all
that is before it, so this Light shows to the eyes of our spirits all
that exists in God’s Kingdom and causes the realities of things to
be made visible. By the help of this effulgent Light all the
spiritual interpretation of the Holy Writings has been made plain,
the hidden things of God’s Universe have become manifest, and we
have been enabled to comprehend the Divine purposes for man.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-22-p11"></a>
I pray that God in His mercy may illumine your hearts and souls with
His glorious Light, then shall each one of you shine as a radiant
star in the dark places of the world.

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-23-p1"></a>
You are very welcome! From Eastern lands I have come to the West to
sojourn awhile among you. In the East it is often said that the
people of the West are without spirituality, but I have not found it
thus. Thank God, I see and feel that there is much spiritual
aspiration among the Western peoples, and that in some cases their
spiritual perception is even keener than among their Eastern
brothers. If the teaching given in the East had been conscientiously
spread in the West the world today would be a more enlightened place.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-23-p2"></a>
Although in the past all the great Spiritual Teachers have arisen in
the East, there are still many men there who are quite devoid of
spirituality. With regard to the things of the spirit they are as
lifeless as a stone; nor do they wish to be otherwise, for they
consider that man is only a higher form of animal and that the things
of God concern him not.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-23-p3"></a>
But man’s ambition should soar above this—he should ever look
higher than himself, ever upward and onward, until through the Mercy
of God he may come to the Kingdom of Heaven. Again, there are men
whose eyes are only open to physical progress and to the evolution in
the world of matter. These men prefer to study the resemblance
between their own physical body and that of the ape, rather than to
contemplate the glorious affiliation between their spirit and that of
God. This is indeed strange, for it is only physically that man
resembles the lower creation, with regard to his intellect he is
totally unlike it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-23-p4"></a>
Man is always progressing. His circle of knowledge is ever widening,
and his mental activity flows through many and varied channels. Look
what man has accomplished in the field of science, consider his many
discoveries and countless inventions and his profound understanding
of natural law.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-23-p5"></a>
In the world of art it is just the same, and this wonderful
development of man’s faculties becomes more and more rapid as time
goes on. If the discoveries, inventions and material accomplishments
of the last fifteen hundred years could be put together, you would
see that there has been greater advancement during the last hundred
years than in the previous fourteen centuries. For the rapidity with
which man is progressing increases century by century.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-23-p6"></a>
The power of the intellect is one of God’s greatest gifts to men,
it is the power that makes him a higher creature than the animal. For
whereas, century by century and age by age man’s intelligence grows
and becomes keener, that of the animal remains the same. They are no
more intelligent today then they were a thousand years ago! Is there
a greater proof than this needed to show man’s dissimilarity to the
animal creation? It is surely as clear as day.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-23-p7"></a>
As for the spiritual perfections they are man’s birthright and
belong to him alone of all creation. Man is, in reality, a spiritual
being, and only when he lives in the spirit is he truly happy. This
spiritual longing and perception belongs to all men alike, and it is
my firm conviction that the Western people possess great spiritual
aspiration.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-23-p8"></a>
It is my fervent prayer that the star of the East will shed its
brilliant rays on the Western world, and that the people of the West
may arise in strength, earnestness, and courage, to help their
brethren in the East.

This is in truth a Bahá’í house. Every time such a house or
meeting place is founded it becomes one of the greatest aids to the
general development of the town and country to which it belongs. It
encourages the growth of learning and science and is known for its
intense spirituality and for the love it spreads among the peoples.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-24-p2"></a>
The foundation of such a meeting-place is always followed by the
greatest prosperity. The first Bahá’í Assembly that existed in
Ṭihrán was singularly blessed! In one year it had grown so rapidly
that its members had increased to nine times their original number.
Today, in far-away Persia, there are many such assemblies where the
friends of God meet together in the fullness of joy, love and unity.
They teach the Cause of God, educate the ignorant, and draw heart to
heart in brotherly kindness. It is they who help the poor and needy
and give to them their daily bread. They love and care for the sick
and are messengers of hope and consolation to the desolate and
oppressed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-24-p3"></a>

Oh, friends of God! If ye will trust in the Word of God and be
strong; if ye will follow the precepts of Bahá’u’lláh to tend
the sick, raise the fallen, care for the poor and needy, give shelter
to the destitute, protect the oppressed, comfort the sorrowful and
love the world of humanity with all your hearts, then I say unto you
that erelong this meeting-place will see a wonderful harvest. Day by
day each member will advance and become more and more spiritual. But
ye must have a firm foundation and your aims and ambitions must be
clearly understood by each member. They shall be as follows:</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-24-p5"></a>

soul.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-24-p9"></a>

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-24-p10"></a>
6. To be so faithful and sincere in all your actions that every
member may be known as embodying the qualities of honesty, love,
faith, kindness, generosity, and courage. To be detached from all
that is not God, attracted by the Heavenly Breath—a divine soul; so
that the world may know that a Bahá’í is a perfect being.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p1"></a>
I will speak to you today of Bahá’u’lláh. In the third year
after the Báb had declared His Mission, Bahá’u’lláh, being
accused by fanatical Mullás of believing in the new doctrine, was
arrested and thrown into prison. The next day, however, several
ministers of the Government and other influential men caused Him to
be set free. Later on He was again arrested, and the priests
condemned Him to death! The Governor hesitated to have this sentence
carried out for fear of a revolution. The priests met together in the
Mosque, before which was the place of execution. All the people of
the town gathered in crowds outside the Mosque. The carpenters
brought their saws and hammers, the butchers came with their knives,
the bricklayers and builders shouldered their spades, all these men,
incited by the frenzied Mullás, were eager to share in the honor of
killing Him. Inside the Mosque were assembled the doctors of
religion. Bahá’u’lláh stood before them, and answered all their
questions with great wisdom. The chief sage in particular, was
completely silenced by Bahá’u’lláh, who refuted all his
arguments.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p2"></a>
A discussion arose between two of these priests as to the meaning of
some words in the writings of the Báb; accusing Him of inaccuracy,
they challenged Bahá’u’lláh to defend Him if He were able.
These priests were entirely humiliated, for Bahá’u’lláh proved
before the whole assembly that the Báb was absolutely right, and
that the accusation was made in ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p3"></a>
The defeated ones now put Him to the torture of the bastinado, and
more infuriated than before brought Him out before the walls of the
Mosque unto the place of execution, where the misguided people were
awaiting His coming.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p4"></a>
Still the Governor feared to comply with the demand of the priests
for His execution. Realizing the danger in which the dignified
prisoner was placed, some men were sent to rescue Him. In this they
succeeded by breaking through the wall of the Mosque and leading
Bahá’u’lláh through the opening into a place of safety, but not
of freedom; for the Governor shifted the responsibility from off his
own shoulders by sending Him to Ṭihrán. Here He was imprisoned in
an underground dungeon, where the light of day was never seen. A
heavy chain was placed about His neck by which He was chained to five
other Bábís; these fetters were locked together by strong, very
heavy bolts, and screws. His clothes were torn to pieces, also His
fez. In this terrible condition He was kept for four months.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p5"></a>
During this time none of His friends were able to get access to Him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p6"></a>
A prison official made an attempt to poison Him but, beyond causing
Him great suffering, this poison had no effect.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p7"></a>
After a time the Government liberated Him and exiled Him and His
family to Ba<u>gh</u>dád, where He remained for eleven years. During
this time He underwent severe persecutions, being surrounded by the
watchful hatred of His enemies.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p8"></a>
He bore all evils and torments with the greatest courage and
fortitude. Often when He arose in the morning, He knew not whether He
would live until the sun should set. Meanwhile, each day, the priests
came and questioned Him on religion and metaphysics.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p9"></a>
At length the Turkish Governor exiled Him to Constantinople, whence
He was sent to Adrianople; here He stayed for five years. Eventually,
He was sent to the far off prison fortress of St. Jean d’Acre. Here
He was imprisoned in the military portion of the fortress and kept
under the strictest surveillance. Words would fail me to tell you of
the many trials He had to suffer, and all the misery He endured in
that prison. Notwithstanding, it was from this prison that
Bahá’u’lláh wrote to all the Monarchs of Europe, and these
letters with one exception were sent through the post.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p10"></a>
The Epistle of Náṣiri’d-Dín <u>Sh</u>áh was confided to a
Persian Bahá’í, Mírzá Badí‘ <u>Kh</u>urásání, who
undertook to deliver it into the <u>Sh</u>áh’s own hands. This
brave man waited in the neighborhood of Ṭihrán for the passing of
the <u>Sh</u>áh, who had the intention to journey by that way to his
Summer Palace. The courageous messenger followed the <u>Sh</u>áh to
his Palace, and waited on the road near the entrance for several
days. Always in the same place was he seen waiting on the road, until
the people began to wonder why he should be there. At last the <u>Sh</u>áh
heard of him, and commanded his servants that the man should be
brought before him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p11"></a>
“Oh! servants of the <u>Sh</u>áh, I bring a letter, which I must
deliver into his own hands,” Badí‘ said, and then Badí‘ said
to the <u>Sh</u>áh, “I bring you a letter from Bahá’u’lláh!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p12"></a>
He was immediately seized and questioned by those who wished to
elicit information which would help them in the further persecutions
of Bahá’u’lláh. Badí‘ would not answer a word; then they
tortured him, still he held his peace! After three days they killed
him, having failed to force him to speak! These cruel men
photographed him whilst he was under torture.<a href="#footnote-pt_en-25-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p13"></a>
The <u>Sh</u>áh gave the letter from Bahá’u’lláh to the
priests that they might explain it to him. After some days these
priests told the <u>Sh</u>áh that the letter was from a political
enemy. The <u>Sh</u>áh grew angry and said, “This is no
explanation. I pay you to read and answer my letters, therefore
obey!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p14"></a>
The spirit and meaning of the Tablet to Náṣiri’d-Dín <u>Sh</u>áh
was, in short, this: “Now that the time has come, when the Cause of
the Glory of God has appeared, I ask that I may be allowed to come to
Ṭihrán and answer any questions the priests may put to Me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p15"></a>
“I exhort you to detach yourself from the worldly magnificence of
your Empire. Remember all those great kings who have lived before
you—their glories have passed away!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p16"></a>
The letter was written in a most beautiful manner, and continued
warning the King and telling him of the future triumph of the Kingdom
of Bahá’u’lláh, both in the Eastern and in the Western World. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p17"></a>
The <u>Sh</u>áh paid no attention to the warning of this letter and
continued to live in the same fashion until the end.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p18"></a>
Although Bahá’u’lláh was in prison the great Power of the Holy
Spirit was with Him!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p19"></a>
None other in prison could have been like unto Him. In spite of all
the hardships He suffered, He never complained.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p20"></a>
In the dignity of His Majesty, He always refused to see the Governor,
or the influential people of the town.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-25-p21"></a>
Although the surveillance was unremittingly strict He came and went
as He wished! He died in a house situated about three kilometers from
St. Jean d’Acre.

All over the world one hears beautiful sayings extolled and noble
precepts admired. All men say they love what is good, and hate
everything that is evil! Sincerity is to be admired, whilst lying is
despicable. Faith is a virtue, and treachery is a disgrace to
humanity. It is a blessed thing to gladden the hearts of men, and
wrong to be the cause of pain. To be kind and merciful is right,
while to hate is sinful. Justice is a noble quality and injustice an
iniquity. That it is one’s duty to be pitiful and harm no one, and
to avoid jealousy and malice at all costs. Wisdom is the glory of
man, not ignorance; light, not darkness! It is a good thing to turn
one’s face toward God, and foolishness to ignore Him. That it is
our duty to guide man upward, and not to mislead him and be the cause
of his downfall. There are many more examples like unto these.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-26-p2"></a>
But all these sayings are but words and we see very few of them
carried into the world of action. On the contrary, we perceive that
men are carried away by passion and selfishness, each man thinking
only of what will benefit himself even if it means the ruin of his
brother. They are all anxious to make their fortune and care little
or nothing for the welfare of others. They are concerned about their
<i>own</i> peace and comfort, while the condition of their fellows
troubles them not at all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-26-p3"></a>
Unhappily this is the road most men tread.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-26-p4"></a>
But Bahá’ís must not be thus; they must rise above this
condition. Actions must be more to them than words. By their actions
they must be merciful and not merely by their words. They must on all
occasions confirm by their actions what they proclaim in words. Their
deeds must prove their fidelity, and their actions must show forth
Divine light.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-26-p5"></a>
Let your actions cry aloud to the world that you are indeed Bahá’ís,
for it is <i>actions</i> that speak to the world and are the cause of
the progress of humanity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-26-p6"></a>
If we are true Bahá’ís speech is not needed. Our actions will
help on the world, will spread civilization, will help the progress
of science, and cause the arts to develop. Without action nothing in
the material world can be accomplished, neither can words unaided
advance a man in the spiritual Kingdom. It is not through lip-service
only that the elect of God have attained to holiness, but by patient
lives of active service they have brought light into the world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-26-p7"></a>
Therefore strive that your actions day by day may be beautiful
prayers. Turn towards God, and seek always to do that which is right
and noble. Enrich the poor, raise the fallen, comfort the sorrowful,
bring healing to the sick, reassure the fearful, rescue the
oppressed, bring hope to the hopeless, shelter the destitute!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-26-p8"></a>
This is the work of a true Bahá’í, and this is what is expected
of him. If we strive to do all this, then are we true Bahá’ís,
but if we neglect it, we are not followers of the Light, and we have
no right to the name.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-26-p9"></a>
God, who sees all hearts, knows how far our lives are the fulfillment
of our words.

True Meaning of Baptism by Water and Fire</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">November 9th</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-27-p1"></a>
In the Gospel according to St. John, Christ has said: “Except a man
be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven.”<a href="#footnote-pt_en-27-1"><sup>1</sup></a> The priests
have interpreted this into meaning that baptism is necessary for
salvation. In another Gospel it is said: “He shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost and with fire.”<a href="#footnote-pt_en-27-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-27-p2"></a>
Thus the water of baptism and the fire are one! It cannot mean that
the “water” spoken of is <i>physical</i> water, for it is the
direct opposite of “fire,” and one destroys the other. When in
the Gospels, Christ speaks of “water,” He means <i>that which
causes life</i>, for without water no worldly creature can
live—mineral, vegetable, animal and man, one and all, depend upon
water for their very being. Yes, the latest scientific discoveries
prove to us that even mineral has some form of life, and that it also
needs water for its existence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-27-p3"></a>
Water is the cause of life, and when Christ speaks of water, He is
symbolizing that which is the cause of <i>Everlasting Life.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-27-p4"></a>
This life-giving water of which He speaks is like unto fire, for it
is none other than the Love of God, and this love means life to our
souls.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-27-p5"></a>
By the fire of the Love of God the veil is burnt which separates us
from the Heavenly Realities, and with clear vision we are enabled to
struggle onward and upward, ever progressing in the paths of virtue
and holiness, and becoming the means of light to the world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-27-p6"></a>
There is nothing greater or more blessed than the Love of God! It
gives healing to the sick, balm to the wounded, joy and consolation
to the whole world, and through it alone can man attain Life
Everlasting. The <i>essence</i> of all religions is the Love of God,
and it is the foundation of all the sacred teachings.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-27-p7"></a>
It was the Love of God that led Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that
strengthened Joseph in Egypt and gave to Moses courage and patience. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-27-p8"></a>
Through the Love of God, Christ was sent into the world with His
inspiring example of a perfect life of self-sacrifice and devotion,
bringing to men the message of Eternal Life. It was the Love of God
that gave Muḥammad power to bring the Arabs from a state of animal
degradation to a loftier state of existence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-27-p9"></a>
God’s Love it was that sustained the Báb and brought Him to His
supreme sacrifice, and made His bosom the willing target for a
thousand bullets.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-27-p10"></a>
Finally, it was the Love of God that gave to the East Bahá’u’lláh,
and is now sending the light of His teaching far into the West, and
from Pole to Pole.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-27-p11"></a>
Thus I exhort each of you, realizing its power and beauty, to
sacrifice all your thoughts, words and actions to bring the knowledge
of the Love of God into every heart.

I&nbsp;wish to express my gratitude for your hospitality, and my joy
that you are spiritually minded. I am happy to be present at a
gathering such as this, assembled together to listen to a Divine
Message. If you could see with the eye of truth, great waves of
spirituality would be visible to you in this place. The power of the
Holy Spirit is here for all. Praise be to God that your hearts are
inspired with Divine fervor! Your souls are as waves on the sea of
the spirit; although each individual is a distinct wave, the ocean is
one, all are united in God.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p2"></a>
Every heart should radiate unity, so that the Light of the one Divine
Source of all may shine forth bright and luminous. We must not
consider the separate waves alone, but the entire sea. We should rise
from the individual to the whole. The spirit is as one great ocean
and the waves thereof are the souls of men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p3"></a>
We are told in the Holy Scripture that the New Jerusalem shall appear
on earth. Now it is evident that this celestial city is not built of
material stones and mortar, but that it is a city not made with
hands, eternal in the Heavens.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p4"></a>
This is a prophetic symbol, meaning the coming again of the Divine
Teaching to enlighten the hearts of men. It is long since this Holy
Guidance has governed the lives of humanity. But now, at last, the
Holy City of the New Jerusalem has come again to the world, it has
appeared anew under an Eastern sky; from the horizon of Persia has
its effulgence arisen to be a light to lighten the whole world. We
see in these days the fulfillment of the Divine Prophecy. Jerusalem
had disappeared. The heavenly city was destroyed, now it is rebuilt;
it was razed to the ground, but now its walls and pinnacles have been
restored, and are towering aloft in their renewed and glorious
beauty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p5"></a>
In the Western world material prosperity has triumphed, whilst in the
East the spiritual sun has shone forth. I am very glad to see such an
assembly as this in Paris, where spiritual and material progress are
met together in unity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p6"></a>
Man—the true man—is soul, not body; though physically man belongs
to the animal kingdom, yet his soul lifts him above the rest of
creation. Behold how the light of the sun illuminates the world of
matter: even so doth the Divine Light shed its rays in the kingdom of
the soul. The soul it is which makes the human creature a celestial
entity!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p7"></a>
By the power of the Holy Spirit, working through his soul, man is
able to perceive the Divine reality of things. All great works of art
and science are witnesses to this power of the Spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p8"></a>
The same Spirit gives Eternal Life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p9"></a>
Those alone who are baptized by the Divine Spirit will be enabled to
bring all peoples into the bond of unity. It is by the power of the
Spirit that the Eastern World of spiritual thought can intermingle
with the Western realm of action, so that the world of matter may
become Divine.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p10"></a>
It follows that all who work for the Supreme Design are soldiers in
the army of the Spirit.</p>

The light of the celestial world makes war against the world of
shadow and illusion. The rays of the Sun of Truth dispel the darkness
of superstition and misunderstanding.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p12"></a>
You are of the Spirit! To you who seek the truth, the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh will come as a great joy! This teaching is of the
Spirit, in it is no precept which is not of the Divine Spirit.

Spirit cannot be perceived by the material senses of the physical
body, excepting as it is expressed in outward signs and works. The
human body is visible, the soul is invisible. It is the soul
nevertheless that directs a man’s faculties, that governs his
humanity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p14"></a>
The soul has two main faculties. (a) As outer circumstances are
communicated to the soul by the eyes, ears, and brain of a man, so
does the soul communicate its desires and purposes through the brain
to the hands and tongue of the physical body, thereby expressing
itself. The spirit in the soul is the very essence of life. (b) The
second faculty of the soul expresses itself in the world of vision,
where the soul inhabited by the spirit has its being, and functions
without the help of the material bodily senses. There, in the realm
of vision, the soul sees without the help of the physical eye, hears
without the aid of the physical ear, and travels without dependence
upon physical motion. It is, therefore, clear that the spirit in the
soul of man can function through the physical body by using the
organs of the ordinary senses, and that it is able also to live and
act without their aid in the world of vision. This proves without a
doubt the superiority of the soul of man over his body, the
superiority of spirit over matter.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p15"></a>
For example, look at this lamp: is not the light within it superior
to the lamp which holds it? However beautiful the form of the lamp
may be, if the light is not there its purpose is unfulfilled, it is
without life—a dead thing. The lamp needs the light, but the light
does not need the lamp.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p16"></a>
The spirit does not need a body, but the body needs spirit, or it
cannot live. The soul can live without a body, but the body without a
soul dies.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p17"></a>
If a man lose his sight, his hearing, his hand or his foot, should
his soul still inhabit the body he lives, and is able to manifest
divine virtues. On the other hand, without the spirit it would be
impossible for a perfect body to exist.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p18"></a>
The greatest power of the Holy Spirit exists in the Divine
Manifestations of the Truth. Through the power of the Spirit the
Heavenly Teaching has been brought into the World of Humanity.
Through the power of the Spirit life everlasting has come to the
children of men. Through the power of the Spirit the Divine Glory has
shone from East to West, and through the power of the same Spirit
will the divine virtues of humanity become manifest.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p19"></a>
Our greatest efforts must be directed towards detachment from the
things of the world; we must strive to become more spiritual, more
luminous, to follow the counsel of the Divine Teaching, to serve the
cause of unity and true equality, to be merciful, to reflect the love
of the Highest on all men, so that the light of the Spirit shall be
apparent in all our deeds, to the end that all humanity shall be
united, the stormy sea thereof calmed, and all rough waves disappear
from off the surface of life’s ocean henceforth unruffled and
peaceful. Then will the New Jerusalem be seen by mankind, who will
enter through its gates and receive the Divine Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p20"></a>
I thank God that I have been present amongst you this afternoon, and
I thank you for your spiritual feeling.

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-28-p21"></a>
I pray that you may grow in Divine fervor, and that the power of
unity in the Spirit will augment, so that the prophecies may be
fulfilled, and that in this great century of the Light of God all the
glad tidings written in the Sacred Books may come to pass. This is
the glorious time of which the Lord Jesus Christ spoke when He told
us to pray “Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done on earth as it is in
Heaven.” I hope that this is also your expectation and great
desire.</p>

said: 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p1"></a>
Tonight I will speak of the evolution or progress of the spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p2"></a>
Absolute repose does not exist in nature. All things either make
progress or lose ground. Everything moves forward or backward,
nothing is without motion. From his birth, a man progresses
physically until he reaches maturity, then, having arrived at the
prime of his life, he begins to decline, the strength and powers of
his body decrease, and he gradually arrives at the hour of death.
Likewise a plant progresses from the seed to maturity, then its life
begins to lessen until it fades and dies. A bird soars to a certain
height and having reached the highest possible point in its flight,
begins its descent to earth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p3"></a>
Thus it is evident that movement is essential to all existence. All
material things progress to a certain point, then begin to decline.
This is the law which governs the whole physical creation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p4"></a>
Now let us consider the soul. We have seen that movement is essential
to existence; nothing that has life is without motion. All creation,
whether of the mineral, vegetable or animal kingdom, is compelled to
obey the law of motion; it must either ascend or descend. But with
the human soul, there is no decline. Its only movement is towards
perfection; growth and progress alone constitute the motion of the
soul.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p5"></a>
Divine perfection is infinite, therefore the progress of the soul is
also infinite. From the very birth of a human being the soul
progresses, the intellect grows and knowledge increases. When the
body dies the soul lives on. All the differing degrees of created
physical beings are limited, but the soul is limitless!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p6"></a>
In all religions the belief exists that the soul survives the death
of the body. Intercessions are sent up for the beloved dead, prayers
are said for their progress and for the forgiveness of their sins. If
the soul perished with the body all this would have no meaning.
Further, if it were not possible for the soul to advance towards
perfection after it had been released from the body, of what avail
are all these loving prayers, of devotion?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p7"></a>
We read in the sacred writings that “all good works are found
again.”<a href="#footnote-pt_en-29-1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now, if the
soul did not survive, this also would mean nothing!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p8"></a>
The very fact that our spiritual instinct, surely never given in
vain, prompts us to pray for the welfare of those, our loved ones,
who have passed out of the material world: does it not bear witness
to the continuance of their existence?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p9"></a>
In the world of spirit there is no retrogression. The world of
mortality is a world of contradictions, of opposites; motion being
compulsory everything must either go forward or retreat. In the realm
of spirit there is no retreat possible, all movement is bound to be
towards a perfect state. “Progress” is the expression of spirit
in the world of matter. The intelligence of man, his reasoning
powers, his knowledge, his scientific achievements, all these being
manifestations of the spirit, partake of the inevitable law of
spiritual progress and are, therefore, of necessity, immortal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p10"></a>
My hope for you is that you will progress in the world of spirit, as
well as in the world of matter; that your intelligence will develop,
your knowledge will augment, and your understanding be widened.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p11"></a>
You must ever press forward, never standing still; avoid stagnation,
the first step to a backward movement, to decay.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p12"></a>
The whole physical creation is perishable. These material bodies are
composed of atoms; when these atoms begin to separate decomposition
sets in, then comes what we call death. This composition of atoms,
which constitutes the body or mortal element of any created being, is
temporary. When the power of attraction, which holds these atoms
together, is withdrawn, the body, as such, ceases to exist.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p13"></a>
With the soul it is different. The soul is not a combination of
elements, it is not composed of many atoms, it is of one indivisible
substance and therefore eternal. It is entirely out of the order of
the physical creation; it is immortal!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p14"></a>
Scientific philosophy has demonstrated that a <i>simple</i> element
(“simple” meaning “not composed”) is indestructible, eternal.
The soul, not being a composition of elements, is, in character, as a
simple element, and therefore cannot cease to exist.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p15"></a>
The soul, being of that one indivisible substance, can suffer neither
disintegration nor destruction, therefore there is no reason for its
coming to an end. All things living show signs of their existence,
and it follows that these signs could not of themselves exist if that
which they express or to which they testify had no being. A thing
which does not exist, can, of course, give no sign of its existence.
The manifold signs of the existence of the spirit are forever before
us.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p16"></a>
The traces of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the influence of His Divine
Teaching, are present with us today, and are everlasting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p17"></a>
A nonexistent thing, it is agreed, cannot be seen by signs. In order
to write a man must exist—one who does not exist cannot write.
Writing is, in itself, a sign of the writer’s soul and
intelligence. The Sacred Writings (with ever the same Teaching) prove
the continuity of the spirit. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p18"></a>
Consider the aim of creation: is it possible that all is created to
evolve and develop through countless ages with this small goal in
view—a few years of a man’s life on earth? Is it not unthinkable
that this should be the final aim of existence?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p19"></a>
The mineral evolves till it is absorbed in the life of the plant, the
plant progresses till finally it loses its life in that of the
animal; the animal, in its turn, forming part of the food of man, is
absorbed into human life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p20"></a>
Thus, man is shown to be the sum of all creation, the superior of all
created beings, the goal to which countless ages of existence have
progressed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p21"></a>
At the best, man spends four-score years and ten in this world—a
short time indeed!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p22"></a>
Does a man cease to exist when he leaves the body? If his life comes
to an end, then all the previous evolution is useless, all has been
for nothing! Can one imagine that Creation has no greater aim than
this?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p23"></a>
The soul is eternal, immortal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p24"></a>
Materialists say, “Where is the soul? What is it? We cannot see it,
neither can we touch it.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p25"></a>
This is how we must answer them: However much the mineral may
progress, it cannot comprehend the vegetable world. Now, that lack of
comprehension does not prove the nonexistence of the plant!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p26"></a>
To however great a degree the plant may have evolved, it is unable to
understand the animal world; this ignorance is no proof that the
animal does not exist!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p27"></a>
The animal, be he never so highly developed, cannot imagine the
intelligence of man, neither can he realize the nature of his soul.
But, again, this does not prove that man is without intellect, or
without soul. It only demonstrates this, that one form of existence
is incapable of comprehending a form superior to itself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p28"></a>
This flower may be unconscious of such a being as man, but the fact
of its ignorance does not prevent the existence of humanity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p29"></a>
In the same way, if materialists do not believe in the existence of
the soul, their unbelief does not prove that there is no such realm
as the world of spirit. The very existence of man’s intelligence
proves his immortality; moreover, darkness proves the presence of
light, for without light there would be no shadow. Poverty proves the
existence of riches, for, without riches, how could we measure
poverty? Ignorance proves that knowledge exists, for without
knowledge how could there be ignorance?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p30"></a>
Therefore the idea of mortality presupposes the existence of
immortality—for if there were no Life Eternal, there would be no
way of measuring the life of this world!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p31"></a>
If the spirit were not immortal, how could the Manifestations of God
endure such terrible trials?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p32"></a>
Why did Christ Jesus suffer the fearful death on the cross?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p33"></a>
Why did Muḥammad bear persecutions?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p34"></a>
Why did the Báb make the supreme sacrifice and why did Bahá’u’lláh
pass the years of His life in prison?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p35"></a>
Why should all this suffering have been, if not to prove the
everlasting life of the spirit?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p36"></a>
Christ suffered, He accepted all His trials because of the
immortality of His spirit. If a man reflects he will understand the
spiritual significance of the law of progress; how all moves from the
inferior to the superior degree.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p37"></a>
It is only a man without intelligence who, after considering these
things, can imagine that the great scheme of creation should suddenly
cease to progress, that evolution should come to such an inadequate
end!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p38"></a>
Materialists who reason in this way, and contend that we are unable
to see the world of spirit, or to perceive the blessings of God, are
surely like the animals who have no understanding; having eyes they
see not, ears they have, but do not hear. And this lack of sight and
hearing is a proof of nothing but their own inferiority; of whom we
read in the Qur’án, “They are men who are blind and deaf to the
Spirit.” They do not use that great gift of God, the power of the
understanding, by which they might see with the eyes of the spirit,
hear with spiritual ears and also comprehend with a Divinely
enlightened heart.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p39"></a>
The inability of the materialistic mind to grasp the idea of the Life
Eternal is no proof of the nonexistence of that life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p40"></a>
The comprehension of that other life depends on our spiritual birth!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-29-p41"></a>
My prayer for you is that your spiritual faculties and aspirations
may daily increase, and that you will never allow the material senses
to veil from your eyes the glories of the Heavenly Illumination.

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-31-p2"></a>
The body is the physical or animal degree of man. From the bodily
point of view man is a sharer of the animal kingdom. The bodies alike
of men and animals are composed of elements held together by the law
of attraction.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-31-p3"></a>
Like the animal, man possesses the faculties of the senses, is
subject to heat, cold, hunger, thirst, etc.; unlike the animal, man
has a rational soul, the human intelligence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-31-p4"></a>
This intelligence of man is the intermediary between his body and his
spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-31-p5"></a>
When man allows the spirit, through his soul, to enlighten his
understanding, then does he contain all Creation; because man, being
the culmination of all that went before and thus superior to all
previous evolutions, contains all the lower world within himself.
Illumined by the spirit through the instrumentality of the soul,
man’s radiant intelligence makes him the crowning-point of
Creation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-31-p6"></a>
But on the other hand, when man does not open his mind and heart to
the blessing of the spirit, but turns his soul towards the material
side, towards the bodily part of his nature, then is he fallen from
his high place and he becomes inferior to the inhabitants of the
lower animal kingdom. In this case the man is in a sorry plight! For
if the spiritual qualities of the soul, open to the breath of the
Divine Spirit, are never used, they become atrophied, enfeebled, and
at last incapable; whilst the soul’s material qualities alone being
exercised, they become terribly powerful—and the unhappy, misguided
man, becomes more savage, more unjust, more vile, more cruel, more
malevolent than the lower animals themselves. All his aspirations and
desires being strengthened by the lower side of the soul’s nature,
he becomes more and more brutal, until his whole being is in no way
superior to that of the beasts that perish. Men such as this plan to
work evil, to hurt and to destroy; they are entirely without the
spirit of Divine compassion, for the celestial quality of the soul
has been dominated by that of the material. If, on the contrary, the
spiritual nature of the soul has been so strengthened that it holds
the material side in subjection, then does the man approach the
Divine; his humanity becomes so glorified that the virtues of the
Celestial Assembly are manifested in him; he radiates the Mercy of
God, he stimulates the spiritual progress of mankind, for he becomes
a lamp to show light on their path.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-31-p7"></a>
You perceive how the soul is the intermediary between the body and
the spirit. In like manner is this tree<a href="#footnote-pt_en-31-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
the intermediary between the seed and the fruit. When the fruit of
the tree appears and becomes ripe, then we know that the tree is
perfect; if the tree bore no fruit it would be merely a useless
growth, serving no purpose!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-31-p8"></a>
When a soul has in it the life of the spirit, then does it bring
forth good fruit and become a Divine tree. I wish you to try to
understand this example. I hope that the unspeakable goodness of God
will so strengthen you that the celestial quality of your soul, which
relates it to the spirit, will forever dominate the material side, so
entirely ruling the senses that your soul will approach the
perfections of the Heavenly Kingdom. May your faces, being
steadfastly set towards the Divine Light, become so luminous that all
your thoughts, words and actions will shine with the Spiritual
Radiance dominating your souls, so that in the gatherings of the
world you will show perfection in your life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-31-p9"></a>
Some men’s lives are solely occupied with the things of this world;
their minds are so circumscribed by exterior manners and traditional
interests that they are blind to any other realm of existence, to the
spiritual significance of all things! They think and dream of earthly
fame, of material progress. Sensuous delights and comfortable
surroundings bound their horizon, their highest ambitions center in
successes of worldly conditions and circumstances! They curb not
their lower propensities; they eat, drink, and sleep! Like the
animal, they have no thought beyond their own physical well-being. It
is true that these necessities must be dispatched. Life is a load
which must be carried on while we are on earth, but the cares of the
lower things of life should not be allowed to monopolize all the
thoughts and aspirations of a human being. The heart’s ambitions
should ascend to a more glorious goal, mental activity should rise to
higher levels! Men should hold in their souls the vision of celestial
perfection, and there prepare a dwelling-place for the inexhaustible
bounty of the Divine Spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-31-p10"></a>
Let your ambition be the achievement on earth of a Heavenly
civilization! I ask for you the supreme blessing, that you may be so
filled with the vitality of the Heavenly Spirit that you may be the
cause of life to the world.

From the beginning of the world until the present time each
“Manifestation”<a href="#footnote-pt_en-33-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
sent from God has been opposed by an embodiment of the “Powers of
Darkness.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p2"></a>
This dark power has always endeavored to extinguish the light.
Tyranny has ever sought to overcome justice. Ignorance has
persistently tried to trample knowledge underfoot. This has, from the
earliest ages, been the method of the material world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p3"></a>
In the time of Moses, Pharaoh set himself to prevent the Mosaic Light
being spread abroad.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p4"></a>
In the day of Christ, Annas and Caiaphas inflamed the Jewish people
against Him and the learned doctors of Israel joined together to
resist His Power. All sorts of calumnies were circulated against Him.
The Scribes and Pharisees conspired to make the people believe Him to
be a liar, an apostate, and a blasphemer. They spread these slanders
throughout the whole Eastern world against Christ, and caused Him to
be condemned to a shameful death!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p5"></a>
In the case of Muḥammad also, the learned doctors of His day
determined to extinguish the light of His influence. They tried by
the power of the sword to prevent the spread of His teaching.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p6"></a>
In spite of all their efforts the Sun of Truth shone forth from the
horizon. In every case the army of light vanquished the powers of
darkness on the battlefield of the world, and the radiance of the
Divine Teaching illumined the earth. Those who accepted the Teaching
and worked for the Cause of God became luminous stars in the sky of
humanity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p7"></a>
Now, in our own day, history repeats itself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p8"></a>
Those who would have men believe that religion is their own private
property once more bring their efforts to bear against the Sun of
Truth: they resist the Command of God; they invent calumnies, not
having arguments against it, neither proofs. They attack with masked
faces, not daring to come forth into the light of day.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p9"></a>
Our methods are different, we do not attack, neither calumniate; we
do not wish to dispute with them; we bring forth proofs and
arguments; we invite them to confute our statements. They cannot
answer us, but instead, they write all they can think of against the
Divine Messenger, Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p10"></a>
Do not let your hearts be troubled by these defamatory writings! Obey
the words of Bahá’u’lláh and answer them not. Rejoice, rather,
that even these falsehoods will result in the spread of the truth.
When these slanders appear inquiries are made, and those who inquire
are led into a knowledge of the Faith.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p11"></a>
If a man were to declare, “There is a lamp in the next room which
gives no light,” one hearer might be satisfied with his report, but
a wiser man goes into the room to judge for himself, and behold, when
he finds the light shining brilliantly in the lamp, he knows the
truth!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p12"></a>
Again, a man proclaims: “There lies a garden in which there are
trees with broken branches bearing no fruit, and the leaves thereof
are faded and yellow! In that garden, also, there are flowering
plants with no blooms, and rose bushes withered and dying—go not
into that garden!” A just man, hearing this account of the garden,
would not be content without seeing for himself whether it be true or
not. He, therefore, enters the garden, and behold, he finds it well
tilled; the branches of the trees are sturdy and strong, being also
loaded with the sweetest of ripe fruits amongst the luxuriance of
beautiful green leaves. The flowering plants are bright with
many-hued blossoms; the rose bushes are covered with fragrant and
lovely roses and all is verdant and well tended. When the glory of
the garden is spread out before the eyes of the just man, he praises
God that, through unworthy calumny, he has been led into a place of
such wondrous beauty!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p13"></a>
This is the result of the slanderer’s work: to be the cause of
guiding men to a discovery of the truth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p14"></a>
We know that all the falsehoods spread about Christ and His apostles
and all the books written against Him, only led the people to inquire
into His doctrine; then, having seen the beauty and inhaled the
fragrance, they walked evermore amidst the roses and the fruits of
that celestial garden.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p15"></a>
Therefore, I say unto you, spread the Divine Truth with all your
might that men’s intelligence may become enlightened; this is the
best answer to those who slander. I do not wish to speak of those
people nor to say anything ill of them—only to tell you that
slander is of no importance! 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p16"></a>
Clouds may veil the sun, but, be they never so dense, his rays will
penetrate! Nothing can prevent the radiance of the sun descending to
warm and vivify the Divine Garden.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p17"></a>
Nothing can prevent the fall of the rain from Heaven.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p18"></a>
Nothing can prevent the fulfillment of the Word of God!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p19"></a>
Therefore when you see books and papers written against the
Revelation, be not distressed, but take comfort in the assurance that
the cause will thereby gain strength.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p20"></a>
No one casts stones at a tree without fruit. No one tries to
extinguish a lamp without light!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p21"></a>
Regard the former times. Had the calumnies of Pharaoh any effect? He
affirmed that Moses was a murderer, that he had slain a man and
deserved to be executed! He also declared that Moses and Aaron were
fomenters of discord, that they tried to destroy the religion of
Egypt and therefore must be put to death. These words of Pharaoh were
vainly spoken. The light of Moses shone. The radiance of the Law of
God has encircled the world!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p22"></a>
When the Pharisees said of Christ that He had broken the Sabbath Day,
that He had defied the Law of Moses, that He had threatened to
destroy the Temple and the Holy City of Jerusalem, and that He
deserved to be crucified—We know that all these slanderous attacks
had no result in hindering the spread of the Gospel!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p23"></a>
The Sun of Christ shone brilliantly in the sky, and the breath of the
Holy Spirit wafted over the whole earth!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p24"></a>
And I say unto you that no calumny is able to prevail against the
Light of God; it can only result in causing it to be more universally
recognized. If a cause were of no significance, who would take the
trouble to work against it!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-33-p25"></a>
But always the greater the cause the more do enemies arise in larger
and larger numbers to attempt its overthrow! The brighter the light
the darker the shadow! Our part it is to act in accordance with the
teaching of Bahá’u’lláh in humility and firm steadfastness.

Ferocity and savagery are natural to animals, but men should show
forth the qualities of love and affection. God sent all His Prophets
into the world with one aim, to sow in the hearts of men love and
goodwill, and for this great purpose they were willing to suffer and
to die. All the sacred Books were written to lead and direct man into
the ways of love and unity; and yet, in spite of all this, we have
the sad spectacle of war and bloodshed in our midst.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-34-p2"></a>
When we look into the pages of history, past and present, we see the
black earth reddened by human blood. Men kill each other like the
savage wolves, and forget the laws of love and tolerance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-34-p3"></a>
Now this luminous age has come, bringing with it wonderful
civilization and material progress. Men’s intellects have widened,
their perceptions grown, but alas, in spite of all this, fresh blood
is being spilt day by day. Look at the present Turco-Italian war;
consider for a moment the fate of these unhappy people! How many have
been killed during this sad time? How many homes are ruined, wives
desolate, and children orphans! And what is to be gained in exchange
for all this anguish and heartache? Only a corner of the earth!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-34-p4"></a>
This all shows that material progress alone does not tend to uplift
man. On the contrary, the more he becomes immersed in material
progress, the more does his spirituality become obscured.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-34-p5"></a>
In times gone by progress on the material plane was not so rapid,
neither was there bloodshed in such profusion. In ancient warfare
there were no cannons, no guns, no dynamite, no shells, no torpedo
boats, no battleships, no submarines. Now, owing to material
civilization, we have all these inventions, and war goes from bad to
worse! Europe itself has become like one immense arsenal, full of
explosives, and may God prevent its ignition—for, should this
happen, the whole world would be involved.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-34-p6"></a>
I want to make you understand that <i>material</i> progress and
spiritual progress are two very different things, and that only if
material progress goes hand in hand with spirituality can any real
progress come about, and the Most Great Peace reign in the world. If
men followed the Holy Counsels and the Teachings of the Prophets, if
Divine Light shone in all hearts and men were really religious, we
should soon see peace on earth and the Kingdom of God among men. The
laws of God may be likened unto the soul and material progress unto
the body. If the body were not animated by the soul, it would cease
to exist. It is my earnest prayer that spirituality may ever grow and
increase in the world, so that customs may become enlightened and
peace and concord may be established.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-34-p7"></a>
War and rapine with their attendant cruelties are an abomination to
God, and bring their own punishment, for the God of love is also a
God of justice and each man must inevitably reap what he sows. Let us
try to understand the commands of the Most High and to order our
lives as He directs. True happiness depends on spiritual good and
having the heart ever open to receive the Divine Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-34-p8"></a>
If the heart turns away from the blessings God offers how can it hope
for happiness? If it does not put its hope and trust in God’s
Mercy, where can it find rest? Oh, trust in God! for His Bounty is
everlasting, and in His Blessings, for they are superb. Oh! put your
faith in the Almighty, for He faileth not and His goodness endureth
forever! His Sun giveth Light continually, and the Clouds of His
Mercy are full of the Waters of Compassion with which He waters the
hearts of all who trust in Him. His refreshing Breeze ever carries
healing in its wings to the parched souls of men! Is it wise to turn
away from such a loving Father, Who showers His blessings upon us,
and to choose rather to be slaves of matter?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-34-p9"></a>
God in His infinite goodness has exalted us to so much honor, and has
made us masters over the material world. Shall we then become her
slaves? Nay, rather let us claim our birthright, and strive to live
the life of the spiritual sons of God. The glorious Sun of Truth has
once again risen in the East. From the far horizon of Persia its
radiance is spreading far and wide, dispersing the dense clouds of
superstition. The light of the unity of mankind is beginning to
illumine the world, and soon the banner of Divine harmony and the
solidarity of nations will be flying high in the Heavens. Yea, the
breezes of the Holy Spirit will inspire the whole world!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-34-p10"></a>
Oh, peoples and nations! Arise and work and be happy! Gather together
under the tent of the unity of mankind!

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p1"></a>
In this world we are influenced by two sentiments, <i>Joy</i> and
<i>Pain.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p2"></a>
Joy gives us wings! In times of joy our strength is more vital, our
intellect keener, and our understanding less clouded. We seem better
able to cope with the world and to find our sphere of usefulness. But
when sadness visits us we become weak, our strength leaves us, our
comprehension is dim and our intelligence veiled. The actualities of
life seem to elude our grasp, the eyes of our spirits fail to
discover the sacred mysteries, and we become even as dead beings.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p3"></a>
There is no human being untouched by these two influences; but all
the sorrow and the grief that exist come from the world of matter—the
spiritual world bestows only the joy!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p4"></a>
If we suffer it is the outcome of material things, and all the trials
and troubles come from this world of illusion.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p5"></a>
For instance, a merchant may lose his trade and depression ensues. A
workman is dismissed and starvation stares him in the face. A farmer
has a bad harvest, anxiety fills his mind. A man builds a house which
is burnt to the ground and he is straightway homeless, ruined, and in
despair.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p6"></a>
All these examples are to show you that the trials which beset our
every step, all our sorrow, pain, shame and grief, are born in the
world of matter; whereas the spiritual Kingdom never causes sadness.
A man living with his thoughts in this Kingdom knows perpetual joy.
The ills all flesh is heir to do not pass him by, but they only touch
the surface of his life, the depths are calm and serene.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p7"></a>
Today, humanity is bowed down with trouble, sorrow and grief, no one
escapes; the world is wet with tears; but, thank God, the remedy is
at our doors. Let us turn our hearts away from the world of matter
and live in the spiritual world! It alone can give us freedom! If we
are hemmed in by difficulties we have only to call upon God, and by
His great Mercy we shall be helped. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p8"></a>
If sorrow and adversity visit us, let us turn our faces to the
Kingdom and heavenly consolation will be outpoured.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p9"></a>
If we are sick and in distress let us implore God’s healing, and He
will answer our prayer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p10"></a>
When our thoughts are filled with the bitterness of this world, let
us turn our eyes to the sweetness of God’s compassion and He will
send us heavenly calm! If we are imprisoned in the material world,
our spirit can soar into the Heavens and we shall be free indeed!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p11"></a>
When our days are drawing to a close let us think of the eternal
worlds, and we shall be full of joy!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p12"></a>
You see all round you proofs of the inadequacy of material things—how
joy, comfort, peace and consolation are not to be found in the
transitory things of the world. Is it not then foolishness to refuse
to seek these treasures where they may be found? The doors of the
spiritual Kingdom are open to all, and without is absolute darkness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p13"></a>
Thank God that you in this assembly have this knowledge, for in all
the sorrows of life you can obtain supreme consolation. If your days
on earth are numbered, you know that everlasting life awaits you. If
material anxiety envelops you in a dark cloud, spiritual radiance
lightens your path. Verily, those whose minds are illumined by the
Spirit of the Most High have supreme consolation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p14"></a>
I myself was in prison forty years—one year alone would have been
impossible to bear—nobody survived that imprisonment more than a
year! But, thank God, during all those forty years I was supremely
happy! Every day, on waking, it was like hearing good tidings, and
every night infinite joy was mine. Spirituality was my comfort, and
turning to God was my greatest joy. If this had not been so, do you
think it possible that I could have lived through those forty years
in prison?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p15"></a>
Thus, spirituality is the greatest of God’s gifts, and “Life
Everlasting” means “Turning to God.” May you, one and all,
increase daily in spirituality, may you be strengthened in all
goodness, may you be helped more and more by the Divine consolation,
be made free by the Holy Spirit of God, and may the power of the
Heavenly Kingdom live and work among you.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-35-p16"></a>
This is my earnest desire, and I pray to God to grant you this favor.

You should all be very happy and thankful to God for the great
privilege that is yours.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-36-p2"></a>
This is purely a spiritual meeting! Praise be to God, your hearts are
turned to Him, your souls are attracted to the Kingdom, you have
spiritual aspirations, and your thoughts soar above the world of
dust.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-36-p3"></a>
You belong to the world of purity, and are not content to live the
life of the animal, spending your days in eating, drinking, and
sleeping. You are indeed men! Your thoughts and ambitions are set to
acquire human perfection. You live to do good and to bring happiness
to others. Your greatest longing is to comfort those who mourn, to
strengthen the weak, and to be the cause of hope to the despairing
soul. Day and night your thoughts are turned to the Kingdom, and your
hearts are full of the Love of God.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-36-p4"></a>
Thus you know neither opposition, dislike, nor hatred, for every

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-36-p5"></a>
These are perfect human sentiments and virtues. If a man has none of
these, he had better cease to exist. If a lamp has ceased to give
light, it had better be destroyed. If a tree bear no fruit, it had
better be cut down, for it only cumbereth the ground.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-36-p6"></a>
Verily, it is better a thousand times for a man to die than to
continue living without virtue.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-36-p7"></a>
We have eyes wherewith to see, but if we do not use them how do they
profit us? We have ears wherewith to hear, but if we are deaf of what
use are they?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-36-p8"></a>
We have a tongue wherewith to praise God and proclaim the good
tidings, but if we are dumb how useless it is!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-36-p9"></a>
The All-Loving God created man to radiate the Divine light and to
illumine the world by his words, action and life. If he is without
virtue he becomes no better than a mere animal, and an animal devoid
of intelligence is a vile thing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-36-p10"></a>
The Heavenly Father gave the priceless gift of intelligence to man so
that he might become a spiritual light, piercing the darkness of
materiality, and bringing goodness and truth into the world. If ye
will follow earnestly the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, ye shall
indeed become the light of the world, the soul for the body of the
world, the comfort and help for humanity, and the source of salvation
for the whole universe. Strive therefore, with heart and soul, to
follow the precepts of the Blessed Perfection, and rest assured that
if ye succeed in living the life he marks out for you, Eternal Life
and everlasting joy in the Heavenly Kingdom will be yours, and
celestial sustenance will be sent to strengthen you all your days.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-36-p11"></a>
It is my heartfelt prayer that each one of you may attain to this
perfect joy!

I have just been told that there has been a terrible accident in this
country. A train has fallen into the river and at least twenty people
have been killed. This is going to be a matter for discussion in the
French Parliament today, and the Director of the State Railway will
be called upon to speak. He will be cross-examined as to the
condition of the railroad and as to what caused the accident, and
there will be a heated argument. I am filled with wonder and surprise
to notice what interest and excitement has been aroused throughout
the whole country on account of the death of twenty people, while
they remain cold and indifferent to the fact that thousands of
Italians, Turks, and Arabs are killed in Tripoli! The horror of this
wholesale slaughter has not disturbed the Government at all! Yet
these unfortunate people are human beings too.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-37-p2"></a>
Why is there so much interest and eager sympathy shown towards these
twenty individuals, while for five thousand persons there is none?
They are all men, they all belong to the family of mankind, but they
are of other lands and races. It is no concern of the disinterested
countries if these men are cut to pieces, this wholesale slaughter
does not affect them! How unjust, how cruel is this, how utterly
devoid of any good and true feeling! The people of these other lands
have children and wives, mothers, daughters, and little sons! In
these countries today there is hardly a house free from the sound of
bitter weeping, scarcely can one find a home untouched by the cruel
hand of war.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-37-p3"></a>
Alas! we see on all sides how cruel, prejudiced and unjust is man,

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-37-p4"></a>
If these people would love and help one another instead of being so
eager to destroy with sword and cannon, how much nobler would it be!
How much better if they would live like a flock of doves in peace and
harmony, instead of being like wolves and tearing each other to
pieces.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-37-p5"></a>
Why is man so hard of heart? It is because he does not yet know God.
If he had knowledge of God he could not act in direct opposition to
His laws; if he were spiritually minded such a line of conduct would
be impossible to him. If only the laws and precepts of the prophets
of God had been believed, understood and followed, wars would no
longer darken the face of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-37-p6"></a>
If man had even the rudiments of justice, such a state of things
would be impossible.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-37-p7"></a>
Therefore, I say unto you pray—pray and turn your faces to God,
that He, in His infinite compassion and mercy, may help and succor
these misguided ones. Pray that He will grant them spiritual
understanding and teach them tolerance and mercy, that the eyes of
their minds may be opened and that they may be endued with the gift
of the spirit. Then would peace and love walk hand in hand through
the lands, and these poor unhappy people might have rest.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-37-p8"></a>
Let us all strive night and day to help in the bringing about of

When Christ appeared He manifested Himself at Jerusalem. He called
men to the Kingdom of God, He invited them to Eternal Life and He
told them to acquire human perfections. The Light of Guidance was
shed forth by that radiant Star, and He at length gave His life in
sacrifice for humanity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-38-p2"></a>
All through His blessed life He suffered oppression and hardship, and
in spite of all this humanity was His enemy!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-38-p3"></a>
They denied Him, scorned Him, ill-treated Him and cursed Him. He was
not treated like a man—and yet in spite of all this He was the
embodiment of pity and of supreme goodness and love.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-38-p4"></a>
He loved all humanity, but they treated Him as an enemy and were
incapable of appreciating Him. They set no value on His words and
were not illumined by the flame of His love.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-38-p5"></a>
Later they realized who He was; that He was the Sacred and Divine
Light, and that His words held Eternal Life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-38-p6"></a>
His heart was full of love for all the world, His goodness was
destined to reach each one—and as they began to realize these
things, they repented—but He had been crucified!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-38-p7"></a>
It was not until many years after His ascension that they knew who He
was, and at the time of His ascension He had only a very few
disciples; only a comparatively small following believed His precepts
and followed His laws. The ignorant said, “Who is this individual;
He has only a few disciples!” But those who knew said: “He is the
Sun who will shine in the East and in the West, He is the
Manifestation who shall give life to the world.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-38-p8"></a>

Therefore, you who are in Europe, do not be discouraged because you
are few or because people think that your Cause is of no importance.
If few people come to your gatherings do not lose heart, and if you
are ridiculed and contradicted be not distressed, for the apostles of
Christ had the same to bear. They were reviled and persecuted, cursed
and ill-treated, but in the end they were victorious and their
enemies were found to be wrong.</p>

If history should repeat itself and all these same things should
happen to you, do not be saddened but be full of joy, and thank God
that you are called upon to suffer as holy men of old suffered. If
they oppose you be gentle with them, if they contradict be firm in
your faith, if they desert you and flee from before you, seek them
out and treat them kindly. Do harm to nobody; pray for all; try to
make your light shine in the world and let your banner fly high in
the Heavens. The beautiful perfume of your noble lives will permeate
everywhere. The light of truth kindled in your hearts will shine out
to the distant horizon!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-38-p11"></a>

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p2"></a>
All down the ages the prophets of God have been sent into the world
to serve the cause of truth—Moses brought the law of truth, and all
the prophets of Israel after him sought to spread it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p3"></a>
When Jesus came He lighted the flaming torch of truth, and carried it
aloft so that the whole world might be illumined thereby. After Him
came His chosen apostles, and they went far and wide, carrying the
light of their Master’s teaching into a dark world—and, in their
turn, passed on.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p4"></a>
Then came Muḥammad, who in His time and way spread the knowledge of
truth among a savage people; for this has always been the mission of
God’s elect.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p5"></a>
So, at last, when Bahá’u’lláh arose in Persia, this was His
most ardent desire, to rekindle the waning light of truth in all
lands. All the holy ones of God have tried with heart and soul to
spread the light of love and unity throughout the world, so that the
darkness of materiality might disappear and the light of spirituality
might shine forth among the children of men. Then would hate, slander
and murder disappear, and in their stead love, unity and peace would
reign.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p6"></a>
All the Manifestations of God came with the same purpose, and they
have all sought to lead men into the paths of virtue. Yet we, their
servants, still dispute among ourselves! Why is it thus? Why do we
not love one another and live in unity?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p7"></a>
It is because we have shut our eyes to the underlying principle of
all religions, that God is one, that He is the Father of us all, that
we are all immersed in the ocean of His mercy and sheltered and
protected by His loving care.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p8"></a>
The glorious Sun of Truth shines for all alike, the waters of Divine
Mercy immerse each one, and His Divine favor is bestowed on all His
children.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p9"></a>
This loving God desires peace for all His creatures—why, then, do
they spend their time in war?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p10"></a>
He loves and protects all His children—why do they forget Him?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p11"></a>
He bestows His Fatherly care on us all—why do we neglect our
brothers?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p12"></a>
Surely, when we realize how God loves and cares for us, we should so
order our lives that we may become more like Him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p13"></a>
God has created us, one and all—why do we act in opposition to His
wishes, when we are all His children, and love the same Father? All
these divisions we see on all sides, all these disputes and
opposition, are caused because men cling to <i>ritual</i> and outward
observances, and forget the simple, underlying truth. It is the
<i>outward practices</i> of religion that are so different, and it is
they that cause disputes and enmity—while the <i>reality</i> is
always the same, and one. The Reality is the Truth, and truth has no
division. Truth is God’s guidance, it is the light of the world, it
is love, it is mercy. These attributes of truth are also human
virtues inspired by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p14"></a>
So let us one and all hold fast to truth, and we shall be free
indeed!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p15"></a>
The day is coming when all the religions of the world will unite, for
in principle they are one already. There is no need for division,
seeing that it is only the outward forms that separate them. Among
the sons of men some souls are suffering through ignorance, let us
hasten to teach them; others are like children needing care and
education until they are grown, and some are sick—to these we must
carry Divine healing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p16"></a>
Whether ignorant, childish or sick, they must be loved and helped,
and not disliked because of their imperfection.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p17"></a>
Doctors of religion were instituted to bring spiritual healing to the
peoples and to be the cause of unity among the nations. If they
become the cause of division they had better not exist! A remedy is
given to cure a disease, but if it only succeeds in aggravating the
complaint, it is better to leave it alone. If religion is only to be
a cause of disunion it had better not exist.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p18"></a>
All the Divine Manifestations sent by God into the world would have
gone through their terrible hardships and sufferings for the single
hope of spreading Truth, unity and concord among men. Christ endured
a life of sorrow, pain and grief, to bring a perfect example of love
into the world—and in spite of this we continue to act in a
contrary spirit one towards the other!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p19"></a>
Love is the fundamental principle of God’s purpose for man, and He
has commanded us to love each other even as He loves us. All these
discords and disputes which we hear on all sides only tend to
increase materiality.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p20"></a>
The world for the most part is sunk in materialism, and the blessings
of the Holy Spirit are ignored. There is so little real spiritual
feeling, and the progress of the world is for the most part merely
material. Men are becoming like unto beasts that perish, for we know
that they have no spiritual feeling—they do not turn to God, they
have no religion! These things belong to man alone, and if he is
without them he is a prisoner of nature, and no whit better than an
animal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p21"></a>
How can man be content to lead only an animal existence when God has
made him so high a creature? All creation is made subject to the laws
of nature, but man has been able to conquer these laws. The sun, in
spite of its power and glory, is bound by the laws of nature, and
cannot change its course by so much as a hair’s breadth. The great
and mighty ocean is powerless to change the ebb and flow of its
tides—nothing can stand against nature’s laws but man!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p22"></a>
But to man God has given such wonderful power that he can guide,
control and overcome nature.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p23"></a>
The natural law for man is to walk on the earth, but he makes ships
and flies in the air! He is created to live on dry land, but he rides
on the sea and even travels under it! 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p24"></a>
He has learnt to control the power of electricity, and he takes it at
his will and imprisons it in a lamp! The human voice is made to speak
across short distances, but man’s power is such that he has made
instruments and can speak from East to West! All these examples show
you how man can govern nature, and how, as it were, he wrests a sword
from the hand of nature and uses it against herself. Seeing that man
has been created master of nature, how foolish it is of him to become
her slave! What ignorance and stupidity it is to worship and adore
nature, when God in His goodness has made us masters thereof. God’s
power is visible to all, yet men shut their eyes and see it not. The
Sun of Truth is shining in all His splendor, but man with fast shut
eyes cannot behold His glory! It is my earnest prayer to God that by
His Mercy and Loving Kindness you may all be united, and filled with
the utmost joy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p25"></a>
I beseech you, one and all, to add your prayers to mine to the end
that war and bloodshed may cease, and that love, friendship, peace
and unity may reign in the world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-39-p26"></a>
All down the ages we see how blood has stained the surface of the
earth; but now a ray of greater light has come, man’s intelligence
is greater, spirituality is beginning to grow, and a time is surely
coming when the religions of the world will be at peace. Let us leave
the discordant arguments concerning outward forms, and let us join
together to hasten forward the Divine Cause of unity, until all
humanity knows itself to be one family, joined together in love.

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p1"></a>
Since my arrival in Paris, I have been told of the Theosophical
Society, and I know that it is composed of honored and respected men.
You are men of intellect and thought, men with spiritual ideals, and
it is a great pleasure for me to be among you.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p2"></a>
Let us thank God who has drawn us together this evening. It gives me
great joy, for I see that you are seekers after truth. You are not
held in bondage by the chains of prejudice, and your greatest longing
is to know the truth. Truth may be likened to the sun! The sun is the
luminous body that disperses all shadows; in the same way does truth
scatter the shadows of our imagination. As the sun gives life to the
body of humanity so does truth give life to their souls. Truth is a
sun that rises from different points on the horizon.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p3"></a>
Sometimes the sun rises from the center of the horizon, then in
summer it rises farther north, in winter farther south—but it is
always the self-same sun, however different are the points of its
rising.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p4"></a>
In like manner truth is one, although its manifestations may be very
different. Some men have eyes and see. These worship the sun, no
matter from which point on the horizon it may dawn; and when the sun
has left the winter sky to appear in the summer one, they know how to
find it again. Others there are who worship only the spot from which
the sun arose, and when it arises in its glory from another place
they remain in contemplation before the spot of its former rising.
Alas! these men are deprived of the blessings of the sun. Those who
in truth adore the sun itself will recognize it from whatsoever
dawning-place it may appear, and will straightway turn their faces
towards its radiance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p5"></a>
We must adore the sun itself and not merely the place of its
appearance. In the same way men of enlightened heart worship truth on
whatever horizon it appears. They are not bound by personality, but
they follow the truth, and are able to recognize it no matter from
whence it may come. It is this same truth which helps humanity to
progress, which gives life to all created beings, for it is the Tree
of Life! 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p6"></a>
In His teaching Bahá’u’lláh gives us the explanation of truth,
and I wish to speak to you briefly about this, for I see that you are
capable of understanding.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p7"></a>
The first principle of Bahá’u’lláh is: <br><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.11in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>The Search for Truth</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p8"></a>
Man must cut himself free from all prejudice and from the result of
his own imagination, so that he may be able to search for truth
unhindered. Truth is one in all religions, and by means of it the
unity of the world can be realized.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p9"></a>
All the peoples have a fundamental belief in common. Being one, truth
cannot be divided, and the differences that appear to exist among the
nations only result from their attachment to prejudice. If only men
would search out truth, they would find themselves united.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p10"></a>
The second principle of Bahá’u’lláh is: <br><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.11in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>The Unity of Mankind</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p11"></a>
The one all-loving God bestows His divine Grace and Favor on all
mankind; one and all are servants of the Most High, and His Goodness,
Mercy and loving Kindness are showered upon all His creatures. The
glory of humanity is the heritage of each one.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p12"></a>
All men are the leaves and fruit of one same tree, they are all
branches of the tree of Adam, they all have the same origin. The same
rain has fallen upon them all, the same warm sun makes them grow,
they are all refreshed by the same breeze. The only differences that
exist and that keep them apart are these: there are the children who
need guidance, the ignorant to be instructed, the sick to be tended
and healed; thus, I say that the whole of humanity is enveloped by
the Mercy and Grace of God. As the Holy Writings tell us: All men are
equal before God. He is no respecter of persons.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p13"></a>
The third principle of Bahá’u’lláh is: <br><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.11in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>Religion should be the Cause of Love and Affection</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p14"></a>
Religion should unite all hearts and cause wars and disputes to
vanish from the face of the earth, give birth to spirituality, and
bring life and light to each heart. If religion becomes a cause of
dislike, hatred and division, it were better to be without it, and to
withdraw from such a religion would be a truly religious act. For it
is clear that the purpose of a remedy is to cure; but if the remedy
should only aggravate the complaint it had better be left alone. Any
religion which is not a cause of love and unity is no religion. All
the holy prophets were as doctors to the soul; they gave
prescriptions for the healing of mankind; thus any remedy that causes
disease does not come from the great and supreme Physician.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p15"></a>
The fourth principle of Bahá’u’lláh is: <br><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.11in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>The Unity of Religion and Science</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p16"></a>
We may think of science as one wing and religion as the other; a bird
needs two wings for flight, one alone would be useless. Any religion
that contradicts science or that is opposed to it, is only
ignorance—for ignorance is the opposite of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p17"></a>
Religion which consists only of rites and ceremonies of prejudice is
not the truth. Let us earnestly endeavor to be the means of uniting
religion and science.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p18"></a>
‘Alí, the son-in-law of Muḥammad, said: “That which is in
conformity with science is also in conformity with religion.”
Whatever the intelligence of man cannot understand, religion ought
not to accept. Religion and science walk hand in hand, and any
religion contrary to science is not the truth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p19"></a>
The fifth principle of Bahá’u’lláh is: <br><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.11in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>Prejudices of Religion, Race or Sect destroy the foundation of
Humanity</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p20"></a>
All the divisions in the world, hatred, war and bloodshed, are caused
by one or other of these prejudices.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p21"></a>
The whole world must be looked upon as one single country, all the
nations as one nation, all men as belonging to one race. Religions,
races, and nations are all divisions of man’s making only, and are
necessary only in his thought; before God there are neither Persians,
Arabs, French nor English; God is God for all, and to Him all
creation is one. We must obey God, and strive to follow Him by
leaving all our prejudices and bringing about peace on earth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p22"></a>
The sixth principle of Bahá’u’lláh is: <br><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.11in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>Equal opportunity of the means of Existence</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p23"></a>
Every human being has the right to live; they have a right to rest,
and to a certain amount of well-being. As a rich man is able to live
in his palace surrounded by luxury and the greatest comfort, so
should a poor man be able to have the necessaries of life. Nobody
should die of hunger; everybody should have sufficient clothing; one
man should not live in excess while another has no possible means of
existence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p24"></a>
Let us try with all the strength we have to bring about happier
conditions, so that no single soul may be destitute.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p25"></a>
The seventh principle of Bahá’u’lláh is: <br><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.11in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>The Equality of Men—equality before the Law</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p26"></a>
The <i>Law</i> must reign, and not the individual; thus will the
world become a place of beauty and true brotherhood will be realized.
Having attained solidarity, men will have found truth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p27"></a>
The eighth principle of Bahá’u’lláh is: <br><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.11in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>Universal Peace</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p28"></a>
A Supreme Tribunal shall be elected by the peoples and governments of
every nation, where members from each country and government shall
assemble in unity. All disputes shall be brought before this Court,
its mission being to prevent war.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p29"></a>
The ninth principle of Bahá’u’lláh is: <br><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.11in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>That Religion should not concern itself with Political Questions</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p30"></a>
Religion is concerned with things of the spirit, politics with things
of the world. Religion has to work with the world of thought, whilst
the field of politics lies with the world of external conditions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p31"></a>
It is the work of the clergy to educate the people, to instruct them,
to give them good advice and teaching so that they may progress
spiritually. With political questions they have nothing to do.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p32"></a>
The tenth principle of Bahá’u’lláh is: <br><br/>

</p>

Women have equal rights with men upon earth; in religion and society
they are a very important element. As long as women are prevented
from attaining their highest possibilities, so long will men be
unable to achieve the greatness which might be theirs.</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.11in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>The Power of the Holy Spirit, by which alone Spiritual Development
is achieved</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p35"></a>
It is only by the breath of the Holy Spirit that spiritual
development can come about. No matter how the material world may
progress, no matter how splendidly it may adorn itself, it can never
be anything but a lifeless body unless the soul is within, for it is
the soul that animates the body; the body alone has no real
significance. Deprived of the blessings of the Holy Spirit the
material body would be inert.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p36"></a>
Here are, very briefly explained, some of the principles of
Bahá’u’lláh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p37"></a>
In short, it behooves us all to be lovers of truth. Let us seek her
in every season and in every country, being careful never to attach
ourselves to personalities. Let us see the light wherever it shines,
and may we be enabled to recognize the light of truth no matter where
it may arise. Let us inhale the perfume of the rose from the midst of
thorns which surround it; let us drink the running water from every
pure spring.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p38"></a>
Since I arrived in Paris, it has given me much pleasure to meet such
Parisians as you are, for praise be to God, you are intelligent,
unprejudiced, and you long to know the truth. You have in your hearts
the love of humanity, and as far as you are able, you exert
yourselves in the cause of charitable work and in the bringing about
of unity; this is especially what Bahá’u’lláh desired.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p39"></a>
It is for this reason that I am so happy to be among you, and I pray
for you, that you may be receptacles for the Blessings of God, and
that you may be the means of spreading spirituality throughout this
country.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-40-p40"></a>

shall spiritual civilization be yours.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-41-p1"></a>
The first principle of the Teaching of Bahá’u’lláh is:</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.11in; margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>The Search after Truth</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-41-p2"></a>
If a man would succeed in his search after truth, he must, in the
first place, shut his eyes to all the traditional superstitions of
the past.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-41-p3"></a>
The Jews have traditional superstitions, the Buddhists and the
Zoroastrians are not free from them, neither are the Christians! All
religions have gradually become bound by tradition and dogma.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-41-p4"></a>
All consider themselves, respectively, the only guardians of the
truth, and that every other religion is composed of errors. They
themselves are right, all others are wrong! The Jews believe that
they are the only possessors of the truth and condemn all other
religions. The Christians affirm that their religion is the only true
one, that all others are false. Likewise the Buddhists and
Muḥammadans; all limit themselves. If all condemn one another,
where shall we search for truth? All contradicting one another, all
cannot be true. If each believe his particular religion to be the
only true one, he blinds his eyes to the truth in the others. If, for
instance, a Jew is bound by the external practice of the religion of
Israel, he does not permit himself to perceive that truth <i>can</i>
exist in any other religion; it must be <i>all</i> contained in his
own! 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-41-p5"></a>
We should, therefore, detach ourselves from the external forms and
practices of religion. We must realize that these forms and
practices, however beautiful, are but garments clothing the warm
heart and the living limbs of Divine truth. We must abandon the
prejudices of tradition if we would succeed in finding the truth at
the core of all religions. If a Zoroastrian believes that the Sun is
God, how can he be united to other religions? While idolaters believe
in their various idols, how can they understand the oneness of God?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-41-p6"></a>
It is, therefore, clear that in order to make any progress in the
search after truth we must relinquish superstition. If all seekers
would follow this principle they would obtain a clear vision of the
truth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-41-p7"></a>
If five people meet together to seek for truth, they must begin by
cutting themselves free from all their own special conditions and
renouncing all preconceived ideas. In order to find truth we must
give up our prejudices, our own small trivial notions; an open
receptive mind is essential. If our chalice is full of self, there is
no room in it for the water of life. The fact that we imagine
ourselves to be right and everybody else wrong is the greatest of all
obstacles in the path towards unity, and unity is necessary if we
would reach truth, for truth is <i>one.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-41-p8"></a>
Therefore it is imperative that we should renounce our own particular
prejudices and superstitions if we earnestly desire to seek the
truth. Unless we make a distinction in our minds between dogma,
superstition and prejudice on the one hand, and truth on the other,
we cannot succeed. When we are in earnest in our search for anything
we look for it everywhere. This principle we must carry out in our
search for truth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-41-p9"></a>
Science must be accepted. No one truth can contradict another truth.
Light is good in whatsoever lamp it is burning! A rose is beautiful
in whatsoever garden it may bloom! A star has the same radiance if it
shines from the East or from the West. Be free from prejudice, so
will you love the Sun of Truth from whatsoever point in the horizon
it may arise! You will realize that if the Divine light of truth
shone in Jesus Christ it also shone in Moses and in Buddha. The
earnest seeker will arrive at this truth. This is what is meant by
the “Search after Truth.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-41-p10"></a>
It means, also, that we must be willing to clear away all that we
have previously learned, all that would clog our steps on the way to
truth; we must not shrink if necessary from beginning our education
all over again. We must not allow our love for any one religion or
any one personality to so blind our eyes that we become fettered by
superstition! When we are freed from all these bonds, seeking with
liberated minds, then shall we be able to arrive at our goal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-41-p11"></a>
“Seek the truth, the truth shall make you free.” So shall we see
the truth in all religions, for truth is in all and truth is one!

Second Principle—The Unity of Mankind</b></font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p1"></a>
I&nbsp;spoke yesterday of the first principle of the Teaching of
Bahá’u’lláh, “The Search for Truth”; how it is necessary
for a man to put aside all in the nature of superstition, and every
tradition which would blind his eyes to the existence of truth in all
religions. He must not, while loving and clinging to one form of
religion, permit himself to detest all others. It is essential that
he search for truth in all religions, and, if his seeking be in
earnest, he will assuredly succeed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p2"></a>
Now the first discovery which we make in our “Search after Truth,”
will lead us to the second principle, which is the “Unity of
Mankind.” All men are servants of the One God. One God reigns over
all the nations of the world and has pleasure in all His children.
All men are of one family; the crown of humanity rests on the head of
every human being.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p3"></a>
In the eyes of the Creator all His children are equal; His goodness
is poured forth on all. He does not favor this nation nor that
nation, all alike are His creatures. This being so, why should we
make divisions, separating one race from another? Why should we
create barriers of superstition and tradition bringing discord and
hatred among the people?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p4"></a>
The only difference between members of the human family is that of
degree. Some are like children who are ignorant, and must be educated
until they arrive at maturity. Some are like the sick and must be
treated with tenderness and care. None are bad or evil! We must not
be repelled by these poor children. We must treat them with great
kindness, teaching the ignorant and tenderly nursing the sick.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p5"></a>
Consider: Unity is necessary to existence. Love is the very cause of
life; on the other hand, separation brings death. In the world of
material creation, for instance, all things owe their actual life to
unity. The elements which compose wood, mineral, or stone, are held
together by the law of attraction. If this law should cease for one
moment to operate these elements would not hold together, they would
fall apart, and the object would in that particular form cease to
exist. The law of attraction has brought together certain elements in
the form of this beautiful flower, but when that attraction is
withdrawn from this center the flower will decompose, and, as a
flower, cease to exist.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p6"></a>
So it is with the great body of humanity. The wonderful Law of
Attraction, Harmony and Unity, holds together this marvelous
Creation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p7"></a>
As with the whole, so with the parts; whether a flower or a human
body, when the attracting principle is withdrawn from it, the flower
or the man dies. It is therefore clear that attraction, harmony,
unity and Love, are the cause of life, whereas repulsion, discord,
hatred and separation bring death.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p8"></a>
We have seen that whatever brings division into the world of
existence causes death. Likewise in the world of the spirit does the
same law operate.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p9"></a>
Therefore should every servant of the One God be obedient to the law
of love, avoiding all hatred, discord, and strife. We find when we
observe nature, that the gentler animals group themselves together
into flocks and herds, whereas the savage, ferocious creatures, such
as the lion, the tiger, and the wolf, live in wild forests, apart
from civilization. Two wolves, or two lions, may live amicably
together; but a thousand lambs may share the same fold and a large
number of deer can form one herd. Two eagles can dwell in the same
place, but a thousand doves can gather into one habitation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p10"></a>
Man should, at least, be numbered among the gentler animals; but when
he becomes ferocious he is more cruel and malicious than the most
savage of the animal creation!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p11"></a>
Now Bahá’u’lláh has proclaimed the “Unity of the World of
Mankind.” All peoples and nations are of one family, the children
of one Father, and should be to one another as brothers and sisters!
I hope that you will endeavor in your lives to show forth and spread
this teaching.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-42-p12"></a>
Bahá’u’lláh said that we should love even our enemies and be to
them as friends. If all men were obedient to this principle, the
greatest unity and understanding would be established in the hearts
of mankind.

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p1"></a>
I have spoken to you of some of the principles of Bahá’u’lláh:
<i>The Search after Truth</i> and <i>The Unity of Mankind</i>. I will
now explain the <i>Fourth Principle</i>, which is <i>The Acceptance
of the Relation between Religion and Science</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p2"></a>
There is no contradiction between true religion and science. When a
religion is opposed to science it becomes mere superstition: that
which is contrary to knowledge is ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p3"></a>
How can a man believe to be a fact that which science has proved to
be impossible? If he believes in spite of his reason, it is rather
ignorant superstition than faith. The true principles of all
religions are in conformity with the teachings of science.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p4"></a>
The Unity of God is logical, and this idea is not antagonistic to the
conclusions arrived at by scientific study.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p5"></a>
All religions teach that we must do good, that we must be generous,
sincere, truthful, law-abiding, and faithful; all this is reasonable,
and logically the only way in which humanity can progress.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p6"></a>
All religious laws conform to reason, and are suited to the people
for whom they are framed, and for the age in which they are to be
obeyed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p7"></a>
Religion has two main parts:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.42in; margin-right: 0.42in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
(1) The Spiritual.<br>(2) The Practical.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p8"></a>
The spiritual part never changes. All the Manifestations of God and
His Prophets have taught the same truths and given the same spiritual
law. They all teach the one code of morality. There is no division in
the truth. The Sun has sent forth many rays to illumine human
intelligence, the light is always the same.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p9"></a>
The practical part of religion deals with exterior forms and
ceremonies, and with modes of punishment for certain offences. This
is the material side of the law, and guides the customs and manners
of the people.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p10"></a>
In the time of Moses, there were ten crimes punishable by death. When
Christ came this was changed; the old axiom “an eye for an eye, and
a tooth for a tooth” was converted into “Love your enemies, do
good to them that hate you,” the stern old law being changed into
one of love, mercy and forbearance!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p11"></a>
In the former days the punishment for theft was the cutting off of
the right hand; in our time this law could not be so applied. In this
age, a man who curses his father is allowed to live, when formerly he
would have been put to death. It is therefore evident that whilst the
spiritual law never alters, the practical rules must change their
application with the necessities of the time. The spiritual aspect of
religion is the greater, the more important of the two, and this is
the same for all time. It never changes! It is the same, yesterday,
today, and forever! “As it was the beginning, is now, and ever
shall be.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p12"></a>
Now, all questions of morality contained in the spiritual, immutable
law of every religion are logically right. If religion were contrary
to logical reason then it would cease to be a religion and be merely
a tradition. Religion and science are the two wings upon which man’s
intelligence can soar into the heights, with which the human soul can
progress. It is not possible to fly with one wing alone! Should a man
try to fly with the wing of religion alone he would quickly fall into
the quagmire of superstition, whilst on the other hand, with the wing
of science alone he would also make no progress, but fall into the
despairing slough of materialism. All religions of the present day
have fallen into superstitious practices, out of harmony alike with
the true principles of the teaching they represent and with the
scientific discoveries of the time. Many religious leaders have grown
to think that the importance of religion lies mainly in the adherence
to a collection of certain dogmas and the practice of rites and
ceremonies! Those whose souls they profess to cure are taught to
believe likewise, and these cling tenaciously to the outward forms,
confusing them with the inward truth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p13"></a>
Now, these forms and rituals differ in the various churches and
amongst the different sects, and even contradict one another; giving
rise to discord, hatred, and disunion. The outcome of all this
dissension is the belief of many cultured men that religion and
science are contradictory terms, that religion needs no powers of
reflection, and should in no wise be regulated by science, but must
of necessity be opposed, the one to the other. The unfortunate effect
of this is that science has drifted apart from religion, and religion
has become a mere blind and more or less apathetic following of the
precepts of certain religious teachers, who insist on their own
favorite dogmas being accepted even when they are contrary to
science. This is foolishness, for it is quite evident that science is
the light, and, being so, religion <i>truly</i> so-called does not
oppose knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p14"></a>
We are familiar with the phrases “Light and Darkness,” “Religion
and Science.” But the religion which does not walk hand in hand
with science is itself in the darkness of superstition and ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p15"></a>
Much of the discord and disunion of the world is created by these
man-made oppositions and contradictions. If religion were in harmony

Consider what it is that singles man out from among created beings,
and makes of him a creature apart. Is it not his reasoning power, his
intelligence? Shall he not make use of these in his study of
religion? I say unto you: weigh carefully in the balance of reason
and science everything that is presented to you as religion. If it
passes this test, then accept it, for it is truth! If, however, it
does not so conform, then reject it, for it is ignorance!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p17"></a>
Look around and see how the world of today is drowned in superstition
and outward forms!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p18"></a>
Some worship the product of their own imagination: they make for
themselves an imaginary God and adore this, when the creation of
their finite minds cannot be the Infinite Mighty Maker of all things
visible and invisible! Others worship the sun or trees, also stones!
In past ages there were those who adored the sea, the clouds, and
even clay!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p19"></a>
Today, men have grown into such adoring attachment to outward forms
and ceremonies that they dispute over this point of ritual or that
particular practice, until one hears on all sides of wearisome
arguments and unrest. There are individuals who have weak intellects
and their powers of reasoning have not developed, but the strength
and power of religion must not be doubted because of the incapacity
of these persons to understand.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p20"></a>
A small child cannot comprehend the laws that govern nature, but this
is on account of the immature intellect of that child; when he is
grown older and has been educated he too will understand the
everlasting truths. A child does not grasp the fact that the earth
revolves round the sun, but, when his intelligence is awakened, the
fact is clear and plain to him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p21"></a>
It is impossible for religion to be contrary to science, even though
some intellects are too weak or too immature to understand truth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p22"></a>
God made religion and science to be the measure, as it were, of our
understanding. Take heed that you neglect not such a wonderful power.
Weigh all things in this balance. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p23"></a>
To him who has the power of comprehension religion is like an open
book, but how can it be possible for a man devoid of reason and
intellectuality to understand the Divine Realities of God?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-44-p24"></a>
Put all your beliefs into harmony with science; there can be no
opposition, for truth is one. When religion, shorn of its
superstitions, traditions, and unintelligent dogmas, shows its
conformity with science, then will there be a great unifying,
cleansing force in the world which will sweep before it all wars,
disagreements, discords and struggles—and then will mankind be
united in the power of the Love of God.

All prejudices, whether of religion, race, politics or nation, must
be renounced, for these prejudices have caused the world’s
sickness. It is a grave malady which, unless arrested, is capable of
causing the destruction of the whole human race. Every ruinous war,
with its terrible bloodshed and misery, has been caused by one or
other of these prejudices.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p2"></a>
The deplorable wars going on in these days are caused by the
fanatical religious hatred of one people for another, or the
prejudices of race or color. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p3"></a>
Until all these barriers erected by prejudice are swept away, it is
not possible for humanity to be at peace. For this reason Bahá’u’lláh
has said, “These Prejudices are destructive to mankind.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p4"></a>
Contemplate first the prejudice of religion: consider the nations of
so-called religious people; if they were truly worshippers of God
they would obey His law which forbids them to kill one another.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p5"></a>
If priests of religion really adored the God of love and served the
Divine Light, they would teach their people to keep the chief
Commandment, “To be in love and charity with all men.” But we
find the contrary, for it is often the priests who encourage nations
to fight. Religious hatred is ever the most cruel!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p6"></a>
All religions teach that we should love one another; that we should
seek out our own shortcomings before we presume to condemn the faults
of others, that we must not consider ourselves superior to our
neighbors! We must be careful not to exalt ourselves lest we be
humiliated.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p7"></a>
Who are <i>we</i> that we should judge? How shall <i>we</i> know who,
in the sight of God, is the most upright man? God’s thoughts are
not like our thoughts! How many men who have seemed saint-like to
their friends have fallen into the greatest humiliation. Think of
Judas Iscariot; he began well, but remember his end! On the other
hand, Paul, the Apostle, was in his early life an enemy of Christ,
whilst later he became His most faithful servant. How then can we
flatter ourselves and despise others?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p8"></a>
Let us therefore be humble, without prejudices, preferring others’
good to our own! Let us never say, “I am a believer but he is an
infidel,” “I am near to God, whilst he is an outcast.” We can
never know what will be the final judgment! Therefore let us help all
who are in need of any kind of assistance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p9"></a>
Let us teach the ignorant, and take care of the young child until he
grows to maturity. When we find a person fallen into the depths of
misery or sin we must be kind to him, take him by the hand, help him
to regain his footing, his strength; we must guide him with love and
tenderness, treat him as a friend not as an enemy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p10"></a>
We have no right to look upon any of our fellow-mortals as evil.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p11"></a>
Concerning the prejudice of race: it is an illusion, a superstition
pure and simple! For God created us all of one race. There were no
differences in the beginning, for we are all descendants of Adam. In
the beginning, also, there were no limits and boundaries between the
different lands; no part of the earth belonged more to one people
than to another. In the sight of God there is no difference between
the various races. Why should man invent such a prejudice? How can we
uphold war caused by an illusion?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p12"></a>
God has not created men that they should destroy one another. All
races, tribes, sects and classes share equally in the Bounty of their
Heavenly Father.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p13"></a>
The only difference lies in the degree of faithfulness, of obedience
to the laws of God. There are some who are as lighted torches, there
are others who shine as stars in the sky of humanity. The lovers of
mankind, these are the superior men, of whatever nation, creed, or
color they may be. For it is they to whom God will say these blessed
words, “Well done, My good and faithful servants.” In that day He
will not ask, “Are you English, French, or perhaps Persian? Do you
come from the East, or from the West?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p14"></a>
The only division that is real is this: There are heavenly men and
earthly men; self-sacrificing servants of humanity in the love of the
Most High, bringing harmony and unity, teaching peace and goodwill to
men. On the other hand there are those selfish men, haters of their
brethren, in whose hearts prejudice has replaced loving kindness, and
whose influence breeds discord and strife.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p15"></a>
To which race or to which color belong these two divisions of men, to
the White, to the Yellow, to the Black, to the East or to the West,
to the North or to the South? If these are God’s divisions, why
should we invent others? Political prejudice is equally mischievous,
it is one of the greatest causes of bitter strife amongst the
children of men. There are people who find pleasure in breeding
discord, who constantly endeavor to goad their country into making
war upon other nations—and why? They think to advantage their own
country to the detriment of all others. They send armies to harass
and destroy the land, in order to become famous in the world, for the
joy of conquest. That it may be said: “Such a country has defeated
another, and brought it under the yoke of their stronger, more
superior rule.” This victory, bought at the price of much
bloodshed, is not lasting! The conqueror shall one day be conquered;
and the vanquished ones victorious! Remember the history of the past:
did not France conquer Germany more than once—then did not the
German nation overcome France?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p16"></a>
We learn also that France conquered England; then was the English
nation victorious over France!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p17"></a>
These glorious conquests are so ephemeral! Why attach so great
importance to them and to their fame, as to be willing to shed the
blood of the people for their attainment? Is any victory worth the
inevitable train of evils consequent upon human slaughter, the grief
and sorrow and ruin which must overwhelm so many homes of both
nations? For it is not possible that one country alone should suffer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p18"></a>
Oh! why will man, the disobedient child of God, who should be an
example of the power of the spiritual law, turn his face away from
the Divine Teaching and put all his effort into destruction and war?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-45-p19"></a>
My hope is that in this enlightened century the Divine Light of love
will shed its radiance over the whole world, seeking out the
responsive heart’s intelligence of every human being; that the
light of the Sun of Truth will lead politicians to shake off all the
claims of prejudice and superstition, and with freed minds to follow
the Policy of God: for Divine Politics are mighty, man’s politics
are feeble! God has created all the world, and bestows His Divine
Bounty upon every creature.</p>

One of the most important principles of the Teaching of Bahá’u’lláh
is:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p2"></a>
The right of every human being to the daily bread whereby they exist,
or the equalization of the means of livelihood.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p3"></a>
The arrangements of the circumstances of the people must be such that
poverty shall disappear, that everyone, as far as possible, according
to his rank and position, shall share in comfort and well-being.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p4"></a>
We see amongst us men who are overburdened with riches on the one
hand, and on the other those unfortunate ones who starve with
nothing; those who possess several stately palaces, and those who
have not where to lay their head. Some we find with numerous courses
of costly and dainty food; whilst others can scarce find sufficient
crusts to keep them alive. Whilst some are clothed in velvets, furs
and fine linen, others have insufficient, poor and thin garments with
which to protect them from the cold.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p5"></a>
This condition of affairs is wrong, and must be remedied. Now the
remedy must be carefully undertaken. It cannot be done by bringing to
pass absolute equality between men. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p6"></a>
Equality is a chimera! It is entirely impracticable! Even if equality
could be achieved it could not continue—and if its existence were
possible, the whole order of the world would be destroyed. The law of
order must always obtain in the world of humanity. Heaven has so
decreed in the creation of man.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p7"></a>
Some are full of intelligence, others have an ordinary amount of it,
and others again are devoid of intellect. In these three classes of
men there is order but not equality. How could it be possible that
wisdom and stupidity should be equal? Humanity, like a great army,
requires a general, captains, under-officers in their degree, and
soldiers, each with their own appointed duties. Degrees are
absolutely necessary to ensure an orderly organization. An army could
not be composed of generals alone, or of captains only, or of nothing
but soldiers without one in authority. The certain result of such a
plan would be that disorder and demoralization would overtake the
whole army.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p8"></a>
King Lycurgus, the philosopher, made a great plan to equalize the
subjects of Sparta; with self-sacrifice and wisdom was the experiment
begun. Then the king called the people of his kingdom, and made them
swear a great oath to maintain the same order of government if he
should leave the country, also that nothing should make them alter it
until his return. Having secured this oath, he left his kingdom of
Sparta and never returned. Lycurgus abandoned the situation,
renouncing his high position, thinking to achieve the permanent good
of his country by the equalization of the property and of the
conditions of life in his kingdom. All the self-sacrifice of the king
was in vain. The great experiment failed. After a time all was
destroyed; his carefully thought-out constitution came to an end.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p9"></a>
The futility of attempting such a scheme was shown and the
impossibility of attaining equal conditions of existence was
proclaimed in the ancient kingdom of Sparta. In our day any such
attempt would be equally doomed to failure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p10"></a>
Certainly, some being enormously rich and others lamentably poor, an
organization is necessary to control and improve this state of
affairs. It is important to limit riches, as it is also of importance
to limit poverty. Either extreme is not good. To be seated in the
mean<a href="#footnote-pt_en-46-1"><sup>1</sup></a> is most
desirable. If it be right for a capitalist to possess a large
fortune, it is equally just that his workman should have a sufficient
means of existence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p11"></a>
A financier with colossal wealth should not exist whilst near him is
a poor man in dire necessity. When we see poverty allowed to reach a
condition of starvation it is a sure sign that somewhere we shall
find tyranny. Men must bestir themselves in this matter, and no
longer delay in altering conditions which bring the misery of
grinding poverty to a very large number of the people. The rich must
give of their abundance, they must soften their hearts and cultivate
a compassionate intelligence, taking thought for those sad ones who
are suffering from lack of the very necessities of life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p12"></a>
There must be special laws made, dealing with these extremes of
riches and of want. The members of the Government should consider the
laws of God when they are framing plans for the ruling of the people.
The general rights of mankind must be guarded and preserved.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-46-p13"></a>
The government of the countries should conform to the Divine Law
which gives equal justice to all. This is the only way in which the
deplorable superfluity of great wealth and miserable, demoralizing,
degrading poverty can be abolished. Not until this is done will the
Law of God be obeyed.

One of the great steps towards universal peace would be the
establishment of a universal language. Bahá’u’lláh commands
that the servants of humanity should meet together, and either choose
a language which now exists, or form a new one. This was revealed in
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas forty years ago. It is there pointed out that the
question of diversity of tongues is a very difficult one. There are
more than eight hundred languages in the world, and no person could
acquire them all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-48-p3"></a>
The races of mankind are not isolated as in former days. Now, in
order to be in close relationship with all countries it is necessary
to be able to speak their tongues.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-48-p4"></a>
A universal language would make intercourse possible with every
nation. Thus it would be needful to know two languages only, the
mother tongue and the universal speech. The latter would enable a man
to communicate with any and every man in the world!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-48-p5"></a>
A third language would not be needed. To be able to talk with a
member of any race and country without requiring an interpreter, how
helpful and restful to all!</p>

Esperanto has been drawn up with this end in view: it is a fine
invention and a splendid piece of work, but it needs perfecting.
Esperanto as it stands is very difficult for some people.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-48-p7"></a>
An international Congress should be formed, consisting of delegates
from every nation in the world, Eastern as well as Western. This
Congress should form a language that could be acquired by all, and
every country would thereby reap great benefit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-48-p8"></a>
Until such a language is in use, the world will continue to feel the
vast need of this means of intercourse. Difference of speech is one
of the most fruitful causes of dislike and distrust that exists
between nations, which are kept apart by their inability to
understand each other’s language more than by any other reason.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-48-p9"></a>
If everybody could speak one language, how much more easy would it be
to serve humanity! 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-48-p10"></a>
Therefore appreciate “Esperanto,” for it is the beginning of the
carrying out of one of the most important of the Laws of Bahá’u’lláh,
and it must continue to be improved and perfected.

Ninth Principle—The Noninterference of Religion with Politics</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">4 Avenue de
Camoëns, Paris,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">November 17th</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p1"></a>
In the conduct of life, man is actuated by two main motives: “The
Hope for Reward” and “The Fear of Punishment.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p2"></a>
This hope and this fear must consequently be greatly taken into
account by those in authority who have important posts under
Government. Their business in life is to consult together for the
framing of laws, and to provide for their just administration.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p3"></a>
The tent of the order of the world is raised and established on the
two pillars of “Reward and Retribution.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p4"></a>
In despotic Governments carried on by men without Divine faith, where
no fear of spiritual retribution exists, the execution of the laws is
tyrannical and unjust.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p5"></a>
There is no greater prevention of oppression than these two
sentiments, hope and fear. They have both political and spiritual
consequences.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p6"></a>
If administrators of the law would take into consideration the
spiritual consequences of their decisions, and follow the guidance of
religion, “They would be Divine agents in the world of action, the
representatives of God for those who are on earth, and they would
defend, for the love of God, the interests of His servants as they
would defend their own.” If a governor realizes his responsibility,
and fears to defy the Divine Law, his judgments will be just. Above
all, if he believes that the consequences of his actions will follow
him beyond his earthly life, and that “as he sows so must he reap,”
such a man will surely avoid injustice and tyranny.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p7"></a>
Should an official, on the contrary, think that all responsibility
for his actions must end with his earthly life, knowing and believing
nothing of Divine favors and a spiritual kingdom of joy, he will lack
the incentive to just dealing, and the inspiration to destroy
oppression and unrighteousness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p8"></a>
When a ruler knows that his judgments will be weighed in a balance by
the Divine Judge, and that if he be not found wanting he will come
into the Celestial Kingdom and that the light of the Heavenly Bounty
will shine upon him, then will he surely act with justice and equity.
Behold how important it is that Ministers of State should be
enlightened by religion!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p9"></a>
With political questions the clergy, however, have nothing to do!
Religious matters should not be confused with politics in the present
state of the world (for their interests are not identical).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p10"></a>
Religion concerns matters of the heart, of the spirit, and of morals.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p11"></a>
Politics are occupied with the material things of life. Religious
teachers should not invade the realm of politics; they should concern
themselves with the spiritual education of the people; they should
ever give good counsel to men, trying to serve God and humankind;
they should endeavor to awaken spiritual aspiration, and strive to
enlarge the understanding and knowledge of humanity, to improve
morals, and to increase the love for justice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p12"></a>
This is in accordance with the Teaching of Bahá’u’lláh. In the
Gospel also it is written, “Render unto Caesar the things which are
Caesar’s, and unto God the things which are God’s.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p13"></a>
In Persia there are some amongst the important Ministers of State who
are religious, who are exemplary, who worship God, and who fear to
disobey His Laws, who judge justly and rule their people with Equity.
Other Governors there are in this land who have no fear of God before
their eyes, who think not of the consequences of their actions,
working for their own desires, and these have brought Persia into
great trouble and difficulty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p14"></a>
Oh, friends of God, be living examples of justice! So that by the
Mercy of God, the world may see in your actions that you manifest the
attributes of justice and mercy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p15"></a>
Justice is not limited, it is a universal quality. Its operation must
be carried out in all classes, from the highest to the lowest.
Justice must be sacred, and the rights of all the people must be
considered. Desire for others only that which you desire for
yourselves. Then shall we rejoice in the Sun of Justice, which shines
from the Horizon of God.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p16"></a>
Each man has been placed in a post of honor, which he must not
desert. A humble workman who commits an injustice is as much to blame
as a renowned tyrant. Thus we all have our choice between justice and
injustice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p17"></a>
I hope that each one of you will become just, and direct your
thoughts towards the unity of mankind; that you will never harm your
neighbors nor speak ill of anyone; that you will respect the rights
of all men, and be more concerned for the interests of others than
for your own. Thus will you become torches of Divine justice, acting
in accordance with the Teaching of Bahá’u’lláh, who, during His
life, bore innumerable trials and persecutions in order to show forth
to the world of mankind the virtues of the World of Divinity, making
it possible for you to realize the supremacy of the spirit, and to
rejoice in the Justice of God.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-49-p18"></a>
By His Mercy, the Divine Bounty will be showered upon you, and for
this I pray!

Tenth Principle—Equality of Sex</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">4 Avenue de
Camoëns, Paris,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">November 14th</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p1"></a>
The Tenth Principle of the teaching of Bahá’u’lláh is the
equality of the sexes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p2"></a>
God has created all creatures in couples. Man, beast, or vegetable,
all the things of these three kingdoms are of two sexes, and there is
absolute equality between them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p3"></a>
In the vegetable world there are male plants and female plants; they
have equal rights, and possess an equal share of the beauty of their
species; though indeed the tree that bears fruit might be said to be
superior to that which is unfruitful.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p4"></a>
In the animal kingdom we see that the male and the female have equal
rights; and that they each share the advantages of their kind.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p5"></a>
Now in the two lower kingdoms of nature we have seen that there is no
question of the superiority of one sex over the other. In the world
of humanity we find a great difference; the female sex is treated as
though inferior, and is not allowed equal rights and privileges. This
condition is due not to nature, but to education. In the Divine
Creation there is no such distinction. Neither sex is superior to the
other in the sight of God. Why then should one sex assert the
inferiority of the other, withholding just rights and privileges as
though God had given His authority for such a course of action? If
women received the same educational advantages as those of men, the
result would demonstrate the equality of capacity of both for
scholarship.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p6"></a>
In some respects woman is superior to man. She is more tenderhearted,
more receptive, her intuition is more intense.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p7"></a>
It is not to be denied that in various directions woman at present is
more backward than man, also that this temporary inferiority is due
to the lack of educational opportunity. In the necessity of life,
woman is more instinct with power than man, for to her he owes his
very existence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p8"></a>
If the mother is educated then her children will be well taught. When
the mother is wise, then will the children be led into the path of
wisdom. If the mother be religious she will show her children how
they should love God. If the mother is moral she guides her little
ones into the ways of uprightness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p9"></a>
It is clear therefore that the future generation depends on the
mothers of today. Is not this a vital responsibility for the woman?
Does she not require every possible advantage to equip her for such a
task?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p10"></a>
Therefore, surely, God is not pleased that so important an instrument
as woman should suffer from want of training in order to attain the
perfections desirable and necessary for her great life’s work!
Divine Justice demands that the rights of both sexes should be
equally respected since neither is superior to the other in the eyes
of Heaven. Dignity before God depends, not on sex, but on purity and
luminosity of heart. Human virtues belong equally to all!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p11"></a>
Woman must endeavor then to attain greater perfection, to be man’s
equal in every respect, to make progress in all in which she has been
backward, so that man will be compelled to acknowledge her equality
of capacity and attainment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p12"></a>
In Europe women have made greater progress than in the East, but
there is still much to be done! When students have arrived at the end
of their school term an examination takes place, and the result
thereof determines the knowledge and capacity of each student. So
will it be with woman; her actions will show her power, there will no
longer be any need to proclaim it by words.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p13"></a>
It is my hope that women of the East, as well as their Western
sisters, will progress rapidly until humanity shall reach perfection.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p14"></a>
God’s Bounty is for all and gives power for all progress. When men
own the equality of women there will be no need for them to struggle
for their rights! One of the principles then of Bahá’u’lláh is
the equality of sex.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-50-p15"></a>
Women must make the greatest effort to acquire spiritual power and to
increase in the virtue of wisdom and holiness until their
enlightenment and striving succeeds in bringing about the unity of
mankind. They must work with a burning enthusiasm to spread the
Teaching of Bahá’u’lláh among the peoples, so that the radiant
light of the Divine Bounty may envelop the souls of all the nations
of the world!

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p1"></a>
In the teaching of Bahá’u’lláh, it is written: “By the Power
of the Holy Spirit alone is man able to progress, for the power of
man is limited and the Divine Power is boundless.” The reading of
history brings us to the conclusion that all truly great men, the
benefactors of the human race, those who have moved men to love the
right and hate the wrong and who have caused real progress, all these
have been inspired by the force of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p2"></a>
The Prophets of God have not all graduated in the schools of learned
philosophy; indeed they were often men of humble birth, to all
appearance ignorant, unknown men of no importance in the eyes of the
world; sometimes even lacking the knowledge of reading and writing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p3"></a>
That which raised these great ones above men, and by which they were
able to become Teachers of the truth, was the power of the Holy
Spirit. Their influence on humanity, by virtue of this mighty
inspiration, was great and penetrating.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p4"></a>
The influence of the wisest philosophers, without this Spirit Divine,
has been comparatively unimportant, however extensive their learning
and deep their scholarship.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p5"></a>
The unusual intellects, for instance, of Plato, Aristotle, Pliny and
Socrates, have not influenced men so greatly that they have been
anxious to sacrifice their lives for their teachings; whilst some of
those simple men so moved humanity that thousands of men have become
willing martyrs to uphold their words; for these words were inspired
by the Divine Spirit of God! The prophets of Judah and Israel,
Elijah, Jeremiah, Isaiah and Ezekiel, were humble men, as were also
the apostles of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p6"></a>
Peter, the chief of the apostles, used to divide the proceeds of his
fishing into seven parts, and when, having taken one part for each
day’s use, he arrived at the seventh portion, he knew it was the
Sabbath day. Consider this! and then think of his future position; to
what glory he attained because the Holy Spirit wrought great works
through him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p7"></a>
We understand that the Holy Spirit is the energizing factor in the
life of man. Whosoever receives this power is able to influence all
with whom he comes into contact.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p8"></a>
The greatest philosophers without this Spirit are powerless, their
souls lifeless, their hearts dead! Unless the Holy Spirit breathes
into their souls, they can do no good work. No system of philosophy
has ever been able to change the manners and customs of a people for
the better. Learned philosophers, unenlightened by the Divine Spirit,
have often been men of inferior morality; they have not proclaimed in
their actions the reality of their beautiful phrases.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p9"></a>
The difference between spiritual philosophers and others is shown by
their lives. The Spiritual Teacher shows His belief in His own
teaching, by Himself <i>being</i> what He recommends to others.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p10"></a>
A humble man without learning, but filled with the Holy Spirit, is
more powerful than the most nobly-born profound scholar without that
inspiration. He who is educated by the Divine Spirit can, in his
time, lead others to receive the same Spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p11"></a>
I pray for you that you may be informed by the life of the Divine
Spirit, so that you may be the means of educating others. The life
and morals of a spiritual man are, in themselves, an education to
those who know him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p12"></a>
Think not of your own limitations, dwell only on the welfare of the
Kingdom of Glory. Consider the influence of Jesus Christ on His
apostles, then think of their effect upon the world. These simple men
were enabled by the power of the Holy Spirit to spread the glad
tidings!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p13"></a>
So may you all receive Divine assistance! No capacity is limited when
led by the Spirit of God!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p14"></a>
The earth of itself has no properties of life, it is barren and dry,
until fertilized by the sun and the rain; still the earth need not
bewail its own limitations.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p15"></a>
May you be given life! May the rain of the Divine Mercy and the
warmth of the Sun of Truth make your gardens fruitful, so that many
beautiful flowers of exquisite fragrance and love may blossom in
abundance. Turn your faces away from the contemplation of your own
finite selves and fix your eyes upon the Everlasting Radiance; then
will your souls receive in full measure the Divine Power of the
Spirit and the Blessings of the Infinite Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-51-p16"></a>
If you thus keep yourselves in readiness, you will become to the
world of humanity a burning flame, a star of guidance, and a fruitful
tree, changing all its darkness and woe into light and joy by the
shining of the Sun of Mercy and the infinite blessings of the Glad
Tidings.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-52-p3"></a>
You must endeavor always to live and act in direct obedience to the
teachings and laws of Bahá’u’lláh, so that every individual may
see in all the acts of your life that in word and in deed you are
followers of the Blessed Perfection.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-52-p4"></a>
Exert yourselves so that this glorious teaching may encircle the
globe, and that spirituality may be infused into the hearts of men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-52-p5"></a>
The breath of the Holy Spirit shall confirm you, and although many
will arise against you, they shall not prevail!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-52-p6"></a>
When the Lord Christ was crowned with thorns, He knew that all the
diadems of the world were at His feet. All earthly crowns, however
brilliant, powerful and resplendent, bowed in adoration before the
crown of thorns! It was from this sure and certain knowledge He
spoke, when He said: “All power is given unto Me, in Heaven and in
earth.”<a href="#footnote-pt_en-52-1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-52-p7"></a>
Now I say unto you, bear this on your hearts and in your minds.
Verily your light shall illumine the whole world, your spirituality
shall affect the heart of things. You shall in truth become the
lighted torches of the globe. Fear not, neither be dismayed, for your
light shall penetrate the densest darkness. This is the Promise of
God, which I give unto you. Rise! and serve the Power of God!

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p1"></a>
When I arrived in Paris some time ago for the first time, I looked
around me with much interest, and in my mind I likened this beautiful
city to a large garden.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p2"></a>
With loving care and much thought I examined the soil, and found it
to be very good and full of possibility for steadfast faith and firm
belief, for a seed of God’s love has been cast into the ground.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p3"></a>
Clouds of Heavenly Mercy showered their rain upon it, and the Sun of
Truth fell warmly upon the young seeds, and today one can see in your
midst the birth of belief. The seed cast into the ground has begun to
spring up, and day by day you will see it grow. The bounties of the
Kingdom of Bahá’u’lláh shall indeed bring forth a wondrous
harvest!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p4"></a>
Behold! I bring you glad and joyful tidings! Paris will become a
garden of roses! All kinds of beautiful flowers will spring up and
flourish in this garden, and the fame of their fragrance and beauty
will be spread in all lands. When I think of Paris in the future, I
seem to see her bathed in the light of the Holy Spirit! Verily, the
day is dawning when Paris will receive her illumination, and the
Goodness and Mercy of God will be visible to every living creature.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p5"></a>
Do not allow your minds to dwell on the present, but with eyes of
faith look into the future, for in truth the Spirit of God is working
in your midst.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p6"></a>
Since my arrival a few weeks ago, I can see the growth of
spirituality. At the beginning only a few souls came to me for Light,
but during my short sojourn among you the numbers have increased and
doubled. This is a promise for the future!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p7"></a>
When Christ was crucified and left this world, He had only eleven
disciples and a very few followers; but as He served the Cause of
truth, look today at the result of His life’s work! He has
illumined the world, and given life to dead humanity. After His
ascension little by little His Cause grew, the souls of His followers
became more and more luminous, and the exquisite perfume of their
saintly lives spread on all sides.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p8"></a>
Now today, thank God, a similar condition has begun in Paris. There
are many souls who have turned to the Kingdom of God, and who are
attracted to unity, love and truth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p9"></a>
Try so to work that the goodness and mercy of the Most Glorious may
enfold the whole of Paris. The Breath of the Holy Spirit will help
you, the Celestial Light of the Kingdom will shine in your hearts,
and the blessed angels of God from Heaven will bring you strength and
will succor you. Then thank God with all your hearts that you have
attained to this supreme benefit. A great part of the world is
plunged in sleep, but you have been awakened. Many are blind, but you
see!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p10"></a>
The call of the Kingdom is heard in your midst. Glory be to God, you
have been born again, you have been baptized by the fire of the Love
of God; you have been plunged in the Sea of Life and regenerated by
the Spirit of Love!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p11"></a>
Having received such favor be thankful unto God, and never doubt His
Goodness and Loving Kindness but have undying faith in the Bounties
of the Kingdom. Consort together in brotherly love, be ready to lay
down your lives one for the other, and not only for those who are
dear to you, but for all humanity. Look upon the whole human race as
members of one family, all children of God; and, in so doing, you
will see no difference between them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p12"></a>
Humanity may be likened to a tree. This tree has branches, leaves,
buds and fruit. Think of all men as being flowers, leaves or buds of
this tree, and try to help each and all to realize and enjoy God’s
blessings. God neglects none: He loves all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p13"></a>
The only real difference that exists between people is that they are
at various stages of development. Some are imperfect—these must be
brought to perfection. Some are asleep—they must be awakened; some
are negligent—they must be roused; but one and all are the children
of God. Love them all with your whole heart; no one is a stranger to
the other, all are friends. Tonight I come to say farewell to you—but
bear this in your minds, that although our bodies may be far apart,
in spirit we shall always be together.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p14"></a>
I bear you one and all in my heart, and will forget none of you—and
I hope that none of you will forget me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p15"></a>
I in the East, and you in the West, let us try with heart and soul
that unity may dwell in the world, that all the peoples may become
one people, and that the whole surface of the earth may be like one
country—for the Sun of Truth shines on all alike.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p16"></a>
All the Prophets of God came for love of this one great aim.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p17"></a>
Look how Abraham strove to bring faith and love among the people; how
Moses tried to unite the people by sound laws; how the Lord Christ
suffered unto death to bring the light of love and truth into a
darkened world; how Muḥammad sought to bring unity and peace
between the various uncivilized tribes among whom He dwelt. And last
of all, Bahá’u’lláh has suffered forty years for the same
cause—the single noble purpose of spreading love among the children
of men—and for the peace and unity of the world the Báb gave up
His life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p18"></a>
Thus, strive to follow the example of these Divine Beings, drink from
Their fountain, be illumined by Their Light, and to the world be as
symbols of the Mercy and Love of God. Be unto the world as rain and
clouds of mercy, as suns of truth; be a celestial army, and you shall
indeed conquer the city of hearts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p19"></a>
Be thankful unto God that Bahá’u’lláh has given us a firm and
solid foundation. He left no place for sadness in hearts, and the
writings of His sacred pen contain consolation for the whole world.
He had the words of truth, and anything that is contrary to His
teaching is false. The chief aim of all His work was to do away with
division.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p20"></a>
The testament of Bahá’u’lláh is a Rain of Goodness, a Sun of
Truth, Water of Life, the Holy Spirit. Thus open your hearts to
receive the full power of His Beauty, and I will pray for you all
that this joy may be yours.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p21"></a>
Now I say “Good-bye.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p22"></a>
This I say only to your outer selves; I do not say it to your souls,
for our souls are always together.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-53-p23"></a>
Be comforted, and rest assured that day and night I shall turn to the
Kingdom of the Most Glorious in supplication for you, that day by day
you may grow better and holier, nearer to God, and more and more
illumined by the radiance of His Love.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Sunday, January
12th, 1913</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p1"></a>
About one thousand years ago a society was formed in Persia called
the Society of the Friends, who gathered together for silent
communion with the Almighty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p2"></a>
They divided Divine philosophy into two parts: one kind is that of
which the knowledge can be acquired through lectures and study in
schools and colleges. The second kind of philosophy was that of the
Illuminati, or followers of the inner light. The schools of this
philosophy were held in silence. Meditating, and turning their faces
to the Source of Light, from that central Light the mysteries of the
Kingdom were reflected in the hearts of these people. All the Divine
problems were solved by this power of illumination.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p3"></a>
This Society of Friends increased greatly in Persia, and up to the
present time their societies exist. Many books and epistles were
written by their leaders. When they assemble in their meeting-house
they sit silently and contemplate; their leader opens with a certain
proposition, and says to the assembly “You must meditate on this
problem.” Then, freeing their minds from everything else, they sit
and reflect, and before long the answer is revealed to them. Many
abstruse divine questions are solved by this illumination. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p4"></a>
Some of the great questions unfolding from the rays of the Sun of
Reality upon the mind of man are: the problem of the reality of the
spirit of man; of the birth of the spirit; of its birth from this
world into the world of God; the question of the inner life of the
spirit and of its fate after its ascension from the body.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p5"></a>
They also meditate upon the scientific questions of the day, and
these are likewise solved.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p6"></a>
These people, who are called “Followers of the inner light,”
attain to a superlative degree of power, and are entirely freed from
blind dogmas and imitations. Men rely on the statements of these
people: by themselves—within themselves—they solve all mysteries.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p7"></a>
If they find a solution with the assistance of the inner light, they
accept it, and afterwards they declare it: otherwise they would
consider it a matter of blind imitation. They go so far as to reflect
upon the essential nature of the Divinity, of the Divine revelation,
of the manifestation of the Deity in this world. All the divine and
scientific questions are solved by them through the power of the
spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p8"></a>
Bahá’u’lláh says there is a sign (from God) in every
phenomenon: the sign of the intellect is contemplation and the sign
of contemplation is silence, because it is impossible for a man to do
two things at one time—he cannot both speak and meditate.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p9"></a>
It is an axiomatic fact that while you meditate you are speaking with
your own spirit. In that state of mind you put certain questions to
your spirit and the spirit answers: the light breaks forth and the
reality is revealed. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p10"></a>
You cannot apply the name “man” to any being void of this faculty
of meditation; without it he would be a mere animal, lower than the
beasts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p11"></a>
Through the faculty of meditation man attains to eternal life;
through it he receives the breath of the Holy Spirit—the bestowal
of the Spirit is given in reflection and meditation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p12"></a>
The spirit of man is itself informed and strengthened during
meditation; through it affairs of which man knew nothing are unfolded
before his view. Through it he receives Divine inspiration, through
it he receives heavenly food.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p13"></a>
Meditation is the key for opening the doors of mysteries. In that
state man abstracts himself: in that state man withdraws himself from
all outside objects; in that subjective mood he is immersed in the
ocean of spiritual life and can unfold the secrets of
things-in-themselves. To illustrate this, think of man as endowed
with two kinds of sight; when the power of insight is being used the
outward power of vision does not see.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p14"></a>
This faculty of meditation frees man from the animal nature, discerns
the reality of things, puts man in touch with God.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p15"></a>
This faculty brings forth from the invisible plane the sciences and
arts. Through the meditative faculty inventions are made possible,
colossal undertakings are carried out; through it governments can run
smoothly. Through this faculty man enters into the very Kingdom of
God.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p16"></a>
Nevertheless some thoughts are useless to man; they are like waves
moving in the sea without result. But if the faculty of meditation is
bathed in the inner light and characterized with divine attributes,
the results will be confirmed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p17"></a>
The meditative faculty is akin to the mirror; if you put it before
earthly objects it will reflect them. Therefore if the spirit of man
is contemplating earthly subjects he will be informed of these.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p18"></a>
But if you turn the mirror of your spirits heavenwards, the heavenly
constellations and the rays of the Sun of Reality will be reflected
in your hearts, and the virtues of the Kingdom will be obtained.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p19"></a>
Therefore let us keep this faculty rightly directed—turning it to
the heavenly Sun and not to earthly objects—so that we may discover
the secrets of the Kingdom, and comprehend the allegories of the
Bible and the mysteries of the spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-54-p20"></a>
May we indeed become mirrors reflecting the heavenly realities, and
may we become so pure as to reflect the stars of heaven.

imperfection from the womb of his earthly mother, so is he born into

thistles, so suffering and tribulation free man from the petty
affairs of this worldly life until he arrives at a state of complete
detachment. His attitude in this world will be that of divine
happiness. Man is, so to speak, unripe: the heat of the fire of
suffering will mature him. Look back to the times past and you will

dream one talks with a friend while the mouth is silent, so is it in

do this work?’ Such as this is conversation with the higher self.”</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-58-p1"></a>
What a power is love! It is the most wonderful, the greatest of all
living powers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-58-p2"></a>
Love gives life to the lifeless. Love lights a flame in the heart
that is cold. Love brings hope to the hopeless and gladdens the
hearts of the sorrowful.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-58-p3"></a>
In the world of existence there is indeed no greater power than the
power of love. When the heart of man is aglow with the flame of love,
he is ready to sacrifice all—even his life. In the Gospel it is
said God is love.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-58-p4"></a>
There are four kinds of love. The first is the love that flows from
God to man; it consists of the inexhaustible graces, the Divine
effulgence and heavenly illumination. Through this love the world of
being receives life. Through this love man is endowed with physical
existence, until, through the breath of the Holy Spirit—this same
love—he receives eternal life and becomes the image of the Living
God. This love is the origin of all the love in the world of
creation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-58-p5"></a>
The second is the love that flows from man to God. This is faith,
attraction to the Divine, enkindlement, progress, entrance into the
Kingdom of God, receiving the Bounties of God, illumination with the
lights of the Kingdom. This love is the origin of all philanthropy;
this love causes the hearts of men to reflect the rays of the Sun of
Reality.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-58-p6"></a>
The third is the love of God towards the Self or Identity of God.
This is the transfiguration of His Beauty, the reflection of Himself
in the mirror of His Creation. This is the reality of love, the
Ancient Love, the Eternal Love. Through one ray of this Love all
other love exists.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-58-p7"></a>
The fourth is the love of man for man. The love which exists between
the hearts of believers is prompted by the ideal of the unity of
spirits. This love is attained through the knowledge of God, so that
men see the Divine Love reflected in the heart. Each sees in the
other the Beauty of God reflected in the soul, and finding this point
of similarity, they are attracted to one another in love. This love
will make all men the waves of one sea, this love will make them all
the stars of one heaven and the fruits of one tree. This love will
bring the realization of true accord, the foundation of real unity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-58-p8"></a>
But the love which sometimes exists between friends is not (true)
love, because it is subject to transmutation; this is merely
fascination. As the breeze blows, the slender trees yield. If the
wind is in the East the tree leans to the West, and if the wind turns
to the West the tree leans to the East. This kind of love is
originated by the accidental conditions of life. This is not love, it
is merely acquaintanceship; it is subject to change.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-58-p9"></a>
Today you will see two souls apparently in close friendship; tomorrow
all this may be changed. Yesterday they were ready to die for one
another, today they shun one another’s society! This is not love;
it is the yielding of the hearts to the accidents of life. When that
which has caused this “love” to exist passes, the love passes
also; this is not in reality love.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-58-p10"></a>
Love is only of the four kinds that I have explained. (a) The love of
God towards the identity of God. Christ has said God is Love. (b) The
love of God for His children—for His servants. (c) The love of man
for God and (d) the love of man for man. These four kinds of love
originate from God. These are rays from the Sun of Reality; these are
the Breathings of the Holy Spirit; these are the Signs of the
Reality.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-59-p1"></a>
Thine eloquent and fluent letter was perused in a garden, under the
cool shade of a tree, while the gentle breeze was wafting. The means
of physical enjoyment was spread before the eyes and thy letter
became the cause of spiritual enjoyment. Truly, I say, it was not a
letter but a rose-garden adorned with hyacinths and flowers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-59-p2"></a>
It contained the sweet fragrance of paradise and the zephyr of Divine
Love blew from its roseate words.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-59-p3"></a>
As I have not ample time at my disposal, I will give herein a brief,
conclusive and comprehensive answer. It is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-59-p4"></a>
In this Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, the women go neck and neck
with the men. In no movement will they be left behind. Their rights
with men are equal in degree. They will enter all the administrative
branches of politics. They will attain in all such a degree as will
be considered the very highest station of the world of humanity and
will take part in all affairs. Rest ye assured. Do ye not look upon
the present conditions; in the not far distant future the world of
women will become all-refulgent and all-glorious, <i>For His Holiness
Bahá’u’lláh Hath Willed It so!</i> At the time of elections the
right to vote is the inalienable right of women, and the entrance of
women into all human departments is an irrefutable and
incontrovertible question. No soul can retard or prevent it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-59-p5"></a>
But there are certain matters, the participation in which is not
worthy of women. For example, at the time when the community is
taking up vigorous defensive measures against the attack of foes, the
women are exempt from military engagements. It may so happen that at
a given time warlike and savage tribes may furiously attack the body
politic with the intention of carrying on a wholesale slaughter of
its members; under such a circumstance defense is necessary, but it
is the duty of men to organize and execute such defensive measures
and not the women—because their hearts are tender and they cannot
endure the sight of the horror of carnage, even if it is for the sake
of defense. From such and similar undertakings the women are exempt.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-59-p6"></a>
As regards the constitution of the House of Justice, Bahá’u’lláh
addresses the men. He says: “O ye men of the House of Justice!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><a name="pt_en-59-p7"></a>
But when its members are to be elected, the right which belongs to
women, so far as their voting and their voice is concerned, is
indisputable. When the women attain to the ultimate degree of
progress, then, according to the exigency of the time and place and
their great capacity, they shall obtain extraordinary privileges. Be
ye confident on these accounts. His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh has
greatly strengthened the cause of women, and the rights and
privileges of women is one of the greatest principles of
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá. Rest ye assured! Erelong the days shall come
when the men addressing the women, shall say: <i>“Blessed are ye!
Blessed are ye! Verily ye are worthy of every gift. Verily ye deserve
to adorn your heads with the crown of everlasting glory, because in
sciences and arts, in virtues and perfections ye shall become equal
to man, and as regards tenderness of heart and the abundance of mercy
and sympathy ye are superior.”</i></p>
