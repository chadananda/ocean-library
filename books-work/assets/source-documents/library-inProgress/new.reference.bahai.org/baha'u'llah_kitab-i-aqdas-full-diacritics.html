<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In 1953 Shoghi
Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, included as one of the
goals of his Ten Year Plan the preparation of a Synopsis and
Codification of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas as an
essential prelude to its translation. He himself worked on the
codification, but had not finished it when he died in 1957. The task
was continued on the basis of his work, and the resulting volume was
released in 1973. That publication included, in addition to the
Synopsis and Codification itself and explanatory notes, a compilation
of the passages from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas which had already been
translated by Shoghi Effendi and published in various books. The
Synopsis and Codification covered the text of both the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
and the Questions and Answers which constitutes an appendix to the
Aqdas. In 1986 the Universal House of Justice decided that the time
had come when the preparation of an English translation of the
complete text of the Most Holy Book was both possible and essential
and made its accomplishment a goal of the Six Year Plan 1986–1992.
Its publication in English will be followed by translations in other
languages.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
It has been recognized that the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, being Sacred
Scripture, should be presented in a form which can be read with ease
and inspiration, uncluttered with the footnotes and index numbers
that are common in scholarly texts. Nonetheless, to assist the reader
in following the flow of the text and its changing themes, paragraph
divisions have been added—such divisions not being common in works
of Arabic literature—and these paragraphs have then been numbered
for ease of access and indexing, as well as for uniformity of
reference in all the languages in which the work will be published.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Following the text of the Aqdas is a brief compilation of Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh which are supplementary to the Most Holy Book, and
a translation of the Questions and Answers published here for the
first time.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Shoghi Effendi had stated that the English translation of the Aqdas
should be “copiously annotated.” The policy followed in preparing
the notes has been to concentrate on those points which might strike
a non-Arabic-speaking reader as obscure or which, for various
reasons, require elucidation or background information. They are not
intended to be a comprehensive commentary on the text beyond these
fundamental requirements.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The notes, which are placed following the Synopsis and Codification,
are numbered sequentially. Each is preceded by a quotation of the
passage to which it relates, and indicates the number of the
paragraph in which this appears. This facilitates cross-reference
between the text and the notes, while making it possible for readers
to study the notes without repeatedly consulting the text, if they so
prefer. It is hoped in this way to meet the needs of readers of a
wide range of backgrounds and interests.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The index provides a guide to subjects in all sections of the volume.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The significance and character of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the range of
subjects it contains have been graphically depicted by Shoghi Effendi
in his history of the first Bahá’í century entitled <i>God Passes
By</i>. As an assistance to the reader, these passages are provided
in the section that immediately follows the introduction. The
Synopsis and Codification, which is republished in this volume,
serves as another aid for obtaining an overview of the Book.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">This year, the
149th of the Bahá’í era, marks the Centenary of the Ascension of
Bahá’u’lláh, Bearer of the universal Revelation of God destined
to lead humanity to its collective coming of age. That this occasion
should be observed by a community of believers representing a
cross-section of the entire human race and established, in the course
of a century and a half, in the most remote corners of the globe, is
a token of the forces of unity released by Bahá’u’lláh’s
advent. A further testimony to the operation of these same forces can
be seen in the extent to which Bahá’u’lláh’s vision has
prefigured contemporary human experience in so many of its aspects.
It is a propitious moment for the publication of this first
authorized translation into English of the Mother Book of His
Revelation, His “Most Holy Book,” the Book in which He sets forth
the Laws of God for a Dispensation destined to endure for no less
than a thousand years.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Of the more than one hundred volumes comprising the sacred Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is of unique importance. <i>“To
build anew the whole world”</i> is the claim and challenge of His
Message, and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is the Charter of the future world
civilization that Bahá’u’lláh has come to raise up. Its
provisions rest squarely on the foundation established by past
religions, for, in the words of Bahá’u’lláh, <i>“This is the
changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future.”</i>
In this Revelation the concepts of the past are brought to a new
level of understanding, and the social laws, changed to suit the age
now dawning, are designed to carry humanity forward into a world
civilization the splendors of which can as yet be scarcely imagined.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In its affirmation of the validity of the great religions of the
past, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas reiterates those eternal truths enunciated
by all the Divine Messengers: the unity of God, love of one’s
neighbor, and the moral purpose of earthly life. At the same time it
removes those elements of past religious codes that now constitute
obstacles to the emerging unification of the world and the
reconstruction of human society.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The Law of God for this Dispensation addresses the needs of the
entire human family. There are laws in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas which are
directed primarily to the members of a specific section of humanity
and can be immediately understood by them but which, at first
reading, may be obscure to people of a different culture. Such, for
example, is the law prohibiting the confession of sins to a fellow
human being which, though understandable by those of Christian
background, may puzzle others. Many laws relate to those of past
Dispensations, especially the two most recent ones, those of Muḥammad
and the Báb embodied in the Qur’án and the Bayán. Nevertheless,
although certain ordinances of the Aqdas have such a focused
reference, they also have universal implications. Through His Law,
Bahá’u’lláh gradually unveils the significance of the new
levels of knowledge and behavior to which the peoples of the world
are being called. He embeds His precepts in a setting of spiritual
commentary, keeping ever before the mind of the reader the principle
that these laws, no matter the subject with which they deal, serve
the manifold purposes of bringing tranquillity to human society,
raising the standard of human behavior, increasing the range of human
understanding, and spiritualizing the life of each and all.
Throughout, it is the relationship of the individual soul to God and
the fulfillment of its spiritual destiny that is the ultimate aim of
the laws of religion. <i>“Think not,”</i> is Bahá’u’lláh’s
own assertion, <i>“that We have revealed unto you a mere code of
laws. Nay, rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers
of might and power.”</i> His Book of Laws is His <i>“weightiest
testimony unto all people, and the proof of the All-Merciful unto all
who are in heaven and all who are on earth.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
An introduction to the spiritual universe unveiled in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas would fail in its purpose if it did not acquaint the
reader with the interpretive and legislative institutions that
Bahá’u’lláh has indissolubly linked with the system of law thus
revealed. At the foundation of this guidance lies the unique role
which Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings—indeed the text of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas itself—confer on His eldest son, ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá.
This unique figure is at once the Exemplar of the pattern of life
taught by His Father, the divinely inspired authoritative Interpreter
of His Teachings and the Center and Pivot of the Covenant which the
Author of the Bahá’í Revelation made with all who recognize Him.
The twenty-nine years of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá’s ministry endowed
the Bahá’í world with a luminous body of commentary that opens
multiple vistas of understanding on His Father’s purpose.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In His Will and Testament ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá conferred the
mantle of Guardian of the Cause and infallible Interpreter of its
teachings upon His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, and confirmed the
authority and guarantee of divine guidance decreed by Bahá’u’lláh
for the Universal House of Justice on all matters <i>“which have
not outwardly been revealed in the Book.”</i> The Guardianship and
the Universal House of Justice can thus be seen to be, in the words
of Shoghi Effendi, the “Twin Successors” of Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá. They are the supreme institutions of the
Administrative Order which was founded and anticipated in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas and elaborated by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá in His Will.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
During the thirty-six years of his ministry, Shoghi Effendi raised up
the structure of elected Spiritual Assemblies—the Houses of Justice
referred to in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, now in their embryonic stage—and
with their collaboration initiated the systematic implementation of
the Divine Plan that ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá had laid out for the
diffusion of the Faith throughout the world. He also set in motion,
on the basis of the strong administrative structure that had been
established, the processes which were an essential preparation for
the election of the Universal House of Justice. This body, which came
into existence in April 1963, is elected through secret ballot and
plurality vote in a three-stage election by adult Bahá’ís
throughout the world. The revealed Word of Bahá’u’lláh,
together with the interpretations and expositions of the Center of
the Covenant and the Guardian of the Cause, constitute the binding
terms of reference of the Universal House of Justice and are its
bedrock foundation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
As to the laws themselves, a careful scrutiny discloses that they
govern three areas: the individual’s relationship to God, physical
and spiritual matters which benefit the individual directly, and
relations among individuals and between the individual and society.
They can be grouped under the following headings: prayer and fasting;
laws of personal status governing marriage, divorce and inheritance;
a range of other laws, ordinances and prohibitions, as well as
exhortations; and the abrogation of specific laws and ordinances of
previous Dispensations. A salient characteristic is their brevity.
They constitute the kernel of a vast range of law that will arise in
centuries to come. This elaboration of the law will be enacted by the
Universal House of Justice under the authority conferred upon it by
Bahá’u’lláh Himself. In one of His Tablets ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá
elucidates this principle:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>Those matters of major importance which constitute the foundation
of the Law of God are explicitly recorded in the Text, but subsidiary
laws are left to the House of Justice. The wisdom of this is that the
times never remain the same, for change is a necessary quality and an
essential attribute of this world, and of time and place. Therefore
the House of Justice will take action accordingly…</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>Briefly, this is the wisdom of referring the laws of society to
the House of Justice. In the religion of Islám, similarly, not every
ordinance was explicitly revealed; nay not a tenth part of a tenth
part was included in the Text; although all matters of major
importance were specifically referred to, there were undoubtedly
thousands of laws which were unspecified. These were devised by the
divines of a later age according to the laws of Islamic
jurisprudence, and individual divines made conflicting deductions
from the original revealed ordinances. All these were enforced. Today
this process of deduction is the right of the body of the House of
Justice, and the deductions and conclusions of individual learned men
have no authority, unless they are endorsed by the House of Justice.
The difference is precisely this, that from the conclusions and
endorsements of the body of the House of Justice whose members are
elected by and known to the worldwide Bahá’í community, no
differences will arise; whereas the conclusions of individual divines
and scholars would definitely lead to differences, and result in
schism, division, and dispersion. The oneness of the Word would be
destroyed, the unity of the Faith would disappear, and the edifice of
the Faith of God would be shaken.</i></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Although the Universal House of Justice is explicitly authorized to
change or repeal its own legislation as conditions change, thus
providing Bahá’í law with an essential element of flexibility, it
cannot abrogate or change any of the laws which are explicitly laid
down in the sacred Text.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The society for which certain of the laws of the Aqdas are designed
will come only gradually into being, and Bahá’u’lláh has
provided for the progressive application of Bahá’í law:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>Indeed, the laws of God are like unto the ocean and the children
of men as fish, did they but know it. However, in observing them one
must exercise tact and wisdom… Since most people are feeble and
far-removed from the purpose of God, therefore one must observe tact
and prudence under all conditions, so that nothing might happen that
could cause disturbance and dissension or raise clamor among the
heedless. Verily, His bounty hath surpassed the whole universe and
His bestowals encompassed all that dwell on earth. One must guide
mankind to the ocean of true understanding in a spirit of love and
tolerance. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas itself beareth eloquent testimony to
the loving providence of God.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The principle governing this progressive application was enunciated
in a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National
Spiritual Assembly in 1935:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The laws revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in the Aqdas are, whenever
practicable and not in direct conflict with the Civil Law of the
land, absolutely binding on every believer or Bahá’í institution
whether in the East or in the West. Certain … laws should be
regarded by all believers as universally and vitally applicable at
the present time. Others have been formulated in anticipation of a
state of society destined to emerge from the chaotic conditions that
prevail today… What has not been formulated in the Aqdas, in
addition to matters of detail and of secondary importance arising out
of the application of the laws already formulated by Bahá’u’lláh,
will have to be enacted by the Universal House of Justice. This body
can supplement but never invalidate or modify in the least degree
what has already been formulated by Bahá’u’lláh. Nor has the
Guardian any right whatsoever to lessen the binding effect much less
to abrogate the provisions of so fundamental and sacred a Book.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The number of laws binding on Bahá’ís is not increased by the
publication of this translation. When it is deemed timely, the Bahá’í
community will be advised which additional laws are binding upon
believers, and any guidance or supplementary legislation necessary
for their application will be provided.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In general, the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are stated succinctly. An
example of this conciseness can be seen in the fact that many are
expressed only as they apply to a man, but it is apparent from the
Guardian’s writings that, where Bahá’u’lláh has given a law
as between a man and a woman, it applies <i>mutatis mutandis</i>
between a woman and a man unless the context makes this impossible.
For example, the text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas forbids a man to marry
his father’s wife (i.e. his stepmother), and the Guardian has
indicated that likewise a woman is forbidden to marry her stepfather.
This understanding of the implications of the Law has far-reaching
effects in light of the fundamental Bahá’í principle of the
equality of the sexes, and should be borne in mind when the sacred
Text is studied. That men and women differ from one another in
certain characteristics and functions is an inescapable fact of
nature and makes possible their complementary roles in certain areas
of the life of society; but it is significant that ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá
has stated that in this Dispensation <i>“Equality of men and women,
except in some negligible instances, has been fully and categorically
announced.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Mention has already been made of the intimate relationship between
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Holy Books of previous Dispensations.
Especially close is the relationship to the Bayán, the Book of Laws
revealed by the Báb. It is elucidated in the following excerpts from
letters written on behalf of the Guardian:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Shoghi Effendi feels that the unity of the Bahá’í Revelation as
one complete whole embracing the Faith of the Báb should be
emphasized… The Faith of the Báb should not be divorced from that
of Bahá’u’lláh. Though the teachings of the Bayán have been
abrogated and superseded by the laws of the Aqdas, yet due to the
fact that the Báb considered Himself as the Forerunner of
Bahá’u’lláh, we would regard His Dispensation together with
that of Bahá’u’lláh as forming one entity, the former being
introductory to the advent of the latter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The Báb states that His laws are provisional and depend upon the
acceptance of the future Manifestation. This is why in the Book of
Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh sanctions some of the laws found in the
Bayán, modifies others and sets aside many.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Just as the Bayán had been revealed by the Báb at about the
midpoint of His Ministry, Bahá’u’lláh revealed the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas around 1873, some twenty years after He had received,
in the Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál of Ṭihrán, the intimation of His
Revelation. In one of His Tablets He indicates that even after its
revelation the Aqdas was withheld by Him for some time before it was
sent to the friends in Iran. Thereafter, as Shoghi Effendi has
related:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The formulation by Bahá’u’lláh, in His Kitáb-i-Aqdas, of the
fundamental laws of His Dispensation was followed, as His Mission
drew to a close, by the enunciation of certain precepts and
principles which lie at the very core of His Faith, by the
reaffirmation of truths He had previously proclaimed, by the
elaboration and elucidation of some of the laws He had already laid
down, by the revelation of further prophecies and warnings, and by
the establishment of subsidiary ordinances designed to supplement the
provisions of His Most Holy Book. These were recorded in unnumbered
Tablets, which He continued to reveal until the last days of His
earthly life…</p>

<br/>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Among such works is the Questions and Answers, a compilation made by
Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín, the most eminent of the transcribers of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings. Consisting of answers revealed by
Bahá’u’lláh to questions put to Him by various believers, it
constitutes an invaluable appendix to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. In 1978 the
most noteworthy of the other Tablets of this nature were published in
English as a compilation entitled <i>Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh
revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas</i>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Some years after the revelation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh
had manuscript copies sent to Bahá’ís in Iran, and in the year
1308 A.H. (1890–91 A.D.), towards the end of His life, He arranged
for the publication of the original Arabic text of the Book in
Bombay.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
A word should be said about the style of language in which the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas has been rendered into English. Bahá’u’lláh
enjoyed a superb mastery of Arabic, and preferred to use it in those
Tablets and other Writings where its precision of meaning was
particularly appropriate to the exposition of basic principle. Beyond
the choice of language itself, however, the style employed is of an
exalted and emotive character, immensely compelling, particularly to
those familiar with the great literary tradition out of which it
arose. In taking up his task of translation, Shoghi Effendi faced the
challenge of finding an English style which would not only faithfully
convey the exactness of the text’s meaning, but would also evoke in
the reader the spirit of meditative reverence which is a
distinguishing feature of response to the original. The form of
expression he selected, reminiscent of the style used by the
seventeenth-century translators of the Bible, captures the elevated
mode of Bahá’u’lláh’s Arabic, while remaining accessible to
the contemporary reader. His translations, moreover, are illumined by
his uniquely inspired understanding of the purport and implications
of the originals.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Although both Arabic and English are languages with rich vocabularies
and varied modes of expression, their forms differ widely from one
another. The Arabic of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is marked by intense
concentration and terseness of expression. It is a characteristic of
this style that if a connotation is obvious it should not be
explicitly stated. This presents a problem for a reader whose
cultural, religious and literary background is entirely different
from that of Arabic. A literal translation of a passage which is
clear in the Arabic could be obscure in English. It therefore becomes
necessary to include in the English translation of such passages that
element of the Arabic sentence which is obviously implicit in the
original. At the same time, it is vital to avoid extrapolating this
process to the point where it would add unjustifiably to the original
or limit its meaning. Striking the right balance between beauty and
clarity of expression on the one hand, and literalness on the other,
is one of the major issues with which the translators have had to
grapple and which has caused repeated reconsideration of the
rendering of certain passages. Another major issue is the legal
implication of certain Arabic terms which have a range of meanings
different from those of similar terms in English.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Sacred Scripture clearly requires especial care and faithfulness in
translation. This is supremely important in the case of a Book of
Laws, where it is vital that the reader not be misled or drawn into
fruitless disputation. As had been foreseen, the translation of the
Most Holy Book has been a work of the utmost difficulty, requiring
consultation with experts in many lands. Since some one-third of the
text had already been translated by Shoghi Effendi, it was necessary
to strive for three qualities in the translation of the remaining
passages: accuracy of meaning, beauty of English, and conformity of
style with that used by Shoghi Effendi.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
We are now satisfied that the translation has reached a point where
it represents an acceptable rendering of the original. Nevertheless,
it will undoubtedly give rise to questions and suggestions which may
shed further light on its content. We are profoundly grateful for the
assiduous and meticulous labors of the members of the Committees whom
we commissioned to prepare and review this translation of the Aqdas
and to compose the annotations. We are confident that this first
authorized English edition of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas will enable its
readers to obtain at least an inkling of the splendor of the Mother
Book of the Bahá’í Dispensation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Our world has entered the dark heart of an age of fundamental change
beyond anything in all of its tumultuous history. Its peoples, of
whatever race, nation, or religion, are being challenged to
subordinate all lesser loyalties and limiting identities to their
oneness as citizens of a single planetary homeland. In Bahá’u’lláh’s
words: <i>“the well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are
unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.”</i>
May the publication of this translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas lend a
fresh impulse to the realization of this universal vision, opening
vistas of a worldwide regeneration.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Unique and
stupendous as was this Proclamation, it proved to be but a prelude to
a still mightier revelation of the creative power of its Author, and
to what may well rank as the most signal act of His ministry—the
promulgation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Alluded to in the Kitáb-i-Íqán,
the principal repository of that Law which the Prophet Isaiah had
anticipated, and which the writer of the Apocalypse had described as
the <i>“new heaven”</i> and the <i>“new earth,”</i> as <i>“the
Tabernacle of God,”</i> as the <i>“Holy City,”</i> as the
<i>“Bride,”</i> the <i>“New Jerusalem coming down from God,”</i>
this <i>“Most Holy Book,”</i> whose provisions must remain
inviolate for no less than a thousand years, and whose system will
embrace the entire planet, may well be regarded as the brightest
emanation of the mind of Bahá’u’lláh, as the Mother Book of His
Dispensation, and the Charter of His New World Order.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Revealed soon after Bahá’u’lláh had been transferred to the
house of ‘Údí <u>Kh</u>ammár (circa 1873), at a time when He was
still encompassed by the tribulations that had afflicted Him, through
the acts committed by His enemies and the professed adherents of His
Faith, this Book, this treasury enshrining the priceless gems of His
Revelation, stands out, by virtue of the principles it inculcates,
the administrative institutions it ordains and the function with
which it invests the appointed Successor of its Author, unique and
incomparable among the world’s sacred Scriptures. For, unlike the
Old Testament and the Holy Books which preceded it, in which the
actual precepts uttered by the Prophet Himself are nonexistent;
unlike the Gospels, in which the few sayings attributed to Jesus
Christ afford no clear guidance regarding the future administration
of the affairs of His Faith; unlike even the Qur’án which, though
explicit in the laws and ordinances formulated by the Apostle of God,
is silent on the all-important subject of the succession, the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, revealed from first to last by the Author of the
Dispensation Himself, not only preserves for posterity the basic laws
and ordinances on which the fabric of His future World Order must
rest, but ordains, in addition to the function of interpretation
which it confers upon His Successor, the necessary institutions
through which the integrity and unity of His Faith can alone be
safeguarded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In this Charter of the future world civilization its Author—at once
the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Unifier and Redeemer of
mankind—announces to the kings of the earth the promulgation of the
<i>“Most Great Law”</i>; pronounces them to be His vassals;
proclaims Himself the <i>“King of Kings”</i>; disclaims any
intention of laying hands on their kingdoms; reserves for Himself the
right to <i>“seize and possess the hearts of men”</i>; warns the
world’s ecclesiastical leaders not to weigh the <i>“Book of God”</i>
with such standards as are current amongst them; and affirms that the
Book itself is the <i>“Unerring Balance”</i> established amongst
men. In it He formally ordains the institution of the <i>“House of
Justice,”</i> defines its functions, fixes its revenues, and
designates its members as the <i>“Men of Justice,”</i> the
<i>“Deputies of God,”</i> the <i>“Trustees of the
All-Merciful”</i>; alludes to the future Center of His Covenant,
and invests Him with the right of interpreting His holy Writ;
anticipates by implication the institution of Guardianship; bears
witness to the revolutionizing effect of His World Order; enunciates
the doctrine of the <i>“Most Great Infallibility”</i> of the
Manifestation of God; asserts this infallibility to be the inherent
and exclusive right of the Prophet; and rules out the possibility of
the appearance of another Manifestation ere the lapse of at least one
thousand years.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In this Book He, moreover, prescribes the obligatory prayers;
designates the time and period of fasting; prohibits congregational
prayer except for the dead; fixes the Qiblih; institutes the
Ḥuqúqu’lláh (Right of God); formulates the law of inheritance;
ordains the institution of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár;
establishes the Nineteen Day Feast, the Bahá’í festivals and the
Intercalary Days; abolishes the institution of priesthood; prohibits
slavery, asceticism, mendicancy, monasticism, penance, the use of
pulpits and the kissing of hands; prescribes monogamy; condemns
cruelty to animals, idleness and sloth, backbiting and calumny;
censures divorce; interdicts gambling, the use of opium, wine and
other intoxicating drinks; specifies the punishments for murder,
arson, adultery and theft; stresses the importance of marriage and
lays down its essential conditions; imposes the obligation of
engaging in some trade or profession, exalting such occupation to the
rank of worship; emphasizes the necessity of providing the means for
the education of children; and lays upon every person the duty of
writing a testament and of strict obedience to one’s government.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Apart from these provisions Bahá’u’lláh exhorts His followers
to consort, with amity and concord and without discrimination, with
the adherents of all religions; warns them to guard against
fanaticism, sedition, pride, dispute and contention; inculcates upon
them immaculate cleanliness, strict truthfulness, spotless chastity,
trustworthiness, hospitality, fidelity, courtesy, forbearance,
justice and fairness; counsels them to be <i>“even as the fingers
of one hand and the limbs of one body”</i>; calls upon them to
arise and serve His Cause; and assures them of His undoubted aid. He,
furthermore, dwells upon the instability of human affairs; declares
that true liberty consists in man’s submission to His commandments;
cautions them not to be indulgent in carrying out His statutes;
prescribes the twin inseparable duties of recognizing the <i>“Dayspring
of God’s Revelation”</i> and of observing all the ordinances
revealed by Him, neither of which, He affirms, is acceptable without
the other.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The significant summons issued to the Presidents of the Republics of
the American continent to seize their opportunity in the Day of God
and to champion the cause of justice; the injunction to the members
of parliaments throughout the world, urging the adoption of a
universal script and language; His warnings to William I, the
conqueror of Napoleon III; the reproof He administers to Francis
Joseph, the Emperor of Austria; His reference to <i>“the
lamentations of Berlin”</i> in His apostrophe to <i>“the banks of
the Rhine”</i>; His condemnation of <i>“the throne of tyranny”</i>
established in Constantinople, and His prediction of the extinction
of its <i>“outward splendor”</i> and of the tribulations destined
to overtake its inhabitants; the words of cheer and comfort He
addresses to His native city, assuring her that God had chosen her to
be <i>“the source of the joy of all mankind”</i>; His prophecy
that <i>“the voice of the heroes of </i><i><u>Kh</u></i><i>urásán”</i>
will be raised in glorification of their Lord; His assertion that men
<i>“endued with mighty valor”</i> will be raised up in Kirmán
who will make mention of Him; and finally, His magnanimous assurance
to a perfidious brother who had afflicted Him with such anguish, that
an <i>“ever-forgiving, all-bounteous”</i> God would forgive him
his iniquities were he only to repent—all these further enrich the
contents of a Book designated by its Author as <i>“the source of
true felicity,”</i> as the <i>“Unerring Balance,”</i> as the
<i>“Straight Path,”</i> and as the <i>“quickener of mankind.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The laws and ordinances that constitute the major theme of this Book,
Bahá’u’lláh, moreover, has specifically characterized as <i>“the
breath of life unto all created things,”</i> as <i>“the mightiest
stronghold,”</i> as the <i>“fruits”</i> of His <i>“Tree,”</i>
as <i>“the highest means for the maintenance of order in the world
and the security of its peoples,”</i> as <i>“the lamps of His
wisdom and loving-providence,”</i> as <i>“the sweet-smelling
savor of His garment,”</i> and the <i>“keys”</i> of His <i>“mercy”</i>
to His creatures. <i>“This Book,”</i> He Himself testifies, <i>“is
a heaven which We have adorned with the stars of Our commandments and
prohibitions.”</i> <i>“Blessed the man,”</i> He, moreover, has
stated, <i>“who will read it, and ponder the verses sent down in it
by God, the Lord of Power, the Almighty. Say, O men! Take hold of it
with the hand of resignation … By My life! It hath been sent down
in a manner that amazeth the minds of men. Verily, it is My
weightiest testimony unto all people, and the proof of the
All-Merciful unto all who are in heaven and all who are on earth.”</i>
And again: <i>“Blessed the palate that savoreth its sweetness, and
the perceiving eye that recognizeth that which is treasured therein,
and the understanding heart that comprehendeth its allusions and
mysteries. By God! Such is the majesty of what hath been revealed
therein, and so tremendous the revelation of its veiled allusions
that the loins of utterance shake when attempting their description.”</i>
And finally: <i>“In such a manner hath the Kitáb-i-Aqdas been
revealed that it attracteth and embraceth all the divinely appointed
Dispensations. Blessed those who peruse it! Blessed those who
apprehend it! Blessed those who meditate upon it! Blessed those who
ponder its meaning! So vast is its range that it hath encompassed all
men ere their recognition of it. Erelong will its sovereign power,
its pervasive influence and the greatness of its might be manifested
on earth.”</i></p>

O Pen of the Most High! Say: O people of the world! We have enjoined
upon you fasting during a brief period, and at its close have
designated for you Naw-Rúz as a feast. Thus hath the Daystar of
Utterance shone forth above the horizon of the Book as decreed by Him
Who is the Lord of the beginning and the end. Let the days in excess
of the months be placed before the month of fasting. We have ordained
that these, amid all nights and days, shall be the manifestations of
the letter Há, and thus they have not been bounded by the limits of
the year and its months. It behooveth the people of Bahá, throughout
these days, to provide good cheer for themselves, their kindred and,
beyond them, the poor and needy, and with joy and exultation to hail
and glorify their Lord, to sing His praise and magnify His Name; and
when they end—these days of giving that precede the season of
restraint—let them enter upon the Fast. Thus hath it been ordained
by Him Who is the Lord of all mankind. The traveler, the ailing,
those who are with child or giving suck, are not bound by the Fast;
they have been exempted by God as a token of His grace. He, verily,
is the Almighty, the Most Generous.</p>

We have allotted nine parts comprising five hundred and forty shares;
to the wife, eight parts comprising four hundred and eighty shares;

Thy Lord, the Creator of the Heavens, and tell of the time when He
Who is the Dayspring of Divine Unity purposed to direct His steps
towards the School of Transcendent Oneness; haply the pure in heart
may gain thereby a glimpse, be it as small as a needle’s eye, of
the mysteries of Thy Lord, the Almighty, the Omniscient, that lie
concealed behind the veils. Say: We, indeed, set foot within the

O people of God! That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is
upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are
the sources of life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a
new problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs
should be referred to the House of Justice that the members thereof
may act according to the needs and requirements of the time. They
that, for the sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the
recipients of divine inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. It is
incumbent upon all to be obedient unto them. All matters of State
should be referred to the House of Justice, but acts of worship must
be observed according to that which God hath revealed in His Book.</p>

O people of Bahá! Ye are the dawning-places of the love of God and
the daysprings of His loving-kindness. Defile not your tongues with
the cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against
that which is not seemly. Set forth that which ye possess. If it be
favorably received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain.
Leave that soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the
Self-Subsisting. Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and
strife. The hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in
the shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance

the fire of Whose love the whole world hath been set aflame! I
implore Thee by Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the whole
creation, not to withhold from me that which is with Thee, O Thou Who
rulest over all men! Thou seest, O my Lord, this stranger hastening
to his most exalted home beneath the canopy of Thy majesty and within
the precincts of Thy mercy; and this transgressor seeking the ocean
of Thy forgiveness; and this lowly one the court of Thy glory; and
this poor creature the orient of Thy wealth. Thine is the authority
to command whatsoever Thou willest. I bear witness that Thou art to
be praised in Thy doings, and to be obeyed in Thy behests, and to
remain unconstrained in Thy bidding.</p>

O Lord of all being and Possessor of all things visible and

hearest my groaning, and my wailing, and the lamentation of my heart.
By Thy might! My trespasses have kept me back from drawing nigh unto
Thee; and my sins have held me far from the court of Thy holiness.
Thy love, O my Lord, hath enriched me, and separation from Thee hath
destroyed me, and remoteness from Thee hath consumed me. I entreat
Thee by Thy footsteps in this wilderness, and by the words “Here am
I. Here am I” which Thy chosen Ones have uttered in this immensity,
and by the breaths of Thy Revelation, and the gentle winds of the
Dawn of Thy Manifestation, to ordain that I may gaze on Thy beauty
and observe whatsoever is in Thy Book.

<i><b>Question:</b></i><i> Should a man go on a journey without

<i>Answer:</i> Should he have omitted to fix a time for his return
despite being aware of the stipulation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in this
regard, his wife should wait for one full year, after which she shall

<i><b>Question:</b></i><i> Concerning the holy verse: “When We
heard the clamor of the children as yet unborn, We doubled their
share and decreased those of the rest.”</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>Answer:</i> According to the Book of God, the estate of the
deceased is divided into 2,520 shares, which number is the lowest
common multiple of all integers up to nine, and these shares are then
distributed into seven portions, each of which is allocated, as
mentioned in the Book, to a particular category of heirs. The
children, for example, are allotted nine blocks of 60 shares,
comprising 540 shares in all. The meaning of the statement “We
doubled their share” is thus that the children receive a further
nine blocks of 60 shares, entitling them to a total of 18 blocks all
told. The extra shares that they receive are deducted from the
portions of the other categories of heirs, so that, although it is
revealed, for instance, that the spouse is entitled to “eight parts
comprising four hundred and eighty shares,” which is the equivalent
of eight blocks of 60 shares, now, by virtue of this rearrangement,
one and a half blocks of shares, comprising 90 shares in all, have
been subtracted from the spouse’s portion and reallocated to the
children, and similarly in the case of the others. The result is that
the total amount subtracted is equivalent to the nine extra blocks of
shares allotted to the children.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>Answer:</i> The sacred verse sufficeth. He saith, exalted be His
Word: “Should the deceased leave no offspring, their share shall
revert to the House of Justice” etc. and “Should the deceased
leave offspring, but none of the other categories of heirs that have
been specified in the Book, they shall receive two-thirds of the
inheritance and the remaining third shall revert to the House of
Justice” etc. In other words, where there are no offspring, their
allotted portion of the inheritance reverteth to the House of
Justice; and where there are offspring but the other categories of
heirs are lacking, two-thirds of the inheritance pass to the
offspring, the remaining third reverting to the House of Justice.
This ruling hath both general and specific application, which is to
say that whenever any category of this latter class of heirs is
absent, two-thirds of their inheritance pass to the offspring and the

<i><b>Question:</b></i><i> Concerning the basic sum on which
Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable.</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>Answer:</i> The basic sum on which Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable is
nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold. In other words, when money to the
value of this sum hath been acquired, a payment of Ḥuqúq falleth
due. Likewise Ḥuqúq is payable when the value, not the number, of
other forms of property reacheth the prescribed amount. Ḥuqúqu’lláh
is payable no more than once. A person, for instance, who acquireth a
thousand mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold, and payeth the Ḥuqúq, is not
liable to make a further such payment on this sum, but only on what
accrueth to it through commerce, business and the like. When this
increase, namely the profit realized, reacheth the prescribed sum,
one must carry out what God hath decreed. Only when the principal
changeth hands is it once more subject to payment of Ḥuqúq, as it
was the first time. The Primal Point hath directed that Ḥuqúqu’lláh
must be paid on the value of whatsoever one possesseth; yet, in this
Most Mighty Dispensation, We have exempted the household furnishings,
that is such furnishings as are needed, and the residence itself.</p>

the owner hath not come to light, he may himself appropriate it; and
in the case of property discovered in an uninhabited area, the finder
should observe a three days’ wait, on the passing of which period,

<i>Answer:</i> If the teacher is not of the people of Bahá, he doth

<i>Answer:</i> Many Tablets were revealed and dispatched in their
original form without being checked and reviewed. Consequently, as
bidden, they were again read out in the Holy Presence, and brought
into conformity with the grammatical conventions of the people in
order to forestall the cavils of opponents of the Cause. Another
reason for this practice is that the new style inaugurated by the
Herald, may the souls of all else but Him be offered up for His sake,
was seen to be marked by substantial latitude in adherence to the
rules of grammar; sacred verses therefore were then revealed in a
style which is for the most part in conformity with current usage for
ease of understanding and concision of expression.</p>

another Tablet, these exalted words have been revealed:</i> O
Muḥammad! The Ancient of Days hath turned His countenance towards
thee, making mention of thee, and exhorting the people of God to
educate their children. Should a father neglect this most weighty
commandment laid down in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas by the Pen of the Eternal
King, he shall forfeit rights of fatherhood, and be accounted guilty
before God. Well is it with him who imprinteth on his heart the
admonitions of the Lord, and steadfastly cleaveth unto them. God, in
truth, enjoineth on His servants what shall assist and profit them,
and enable them to draw nigh unto Him. He is the Ordainer, the
Everlasting.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">106. He is God,
exalted be He, the Lord of majesty and power! The Prophets and Chosen
Ones have all been commissioned by the One True God, magnified be His
glory, to nurture the trees of human existence with the living waters
of uprightness and understanding, that there may appear from them
that which God hath deposited within their inmost selves. As may be
readily observed, each tree yieldeth a certain fruit, and a barren
tree is but fit for fire. The purpose of these Educators, in all they
said and taught, was to preserve man’s exalted station. Well is it
with him who in the Day of God hath laid fast hold upon His precepts
and hath not deviated from His true and fundamental Law. The fruits
that best befit the tree of human life are trustworthiness and
godliness, truthfulness and sincerity; but greater than all, after
recognition of the unity of God, praised and glorified be He, is
regard for the rights that are due to one’s parents. This teaching
hath been mentioned in all the Books of God, and reaffirmed by the
Most Exalted Pen. Consider that which the Merciful Lord hath revealed
in the Qur’án, exalted are His words: “Worship ye God, join with
Him no peer or likeness; and show forth kindliness and charity
towards your parents…” Observe how loving-kindness to one’s
parents hath been linked to recognition of the one true God! Happy
they who are endued with true wisdom and understanding, who see and
perceive, who read and understand, and who observe that which God
hath revealed in the Holy Books of old, and in this incomparable and
wondrous Tablet.</p>

				If antipathy or resentment develop on the part of either the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">This is an
allusion to the story of Joseph in the Qur’án and the Old
Testament, in which Joseph’s garment, brought by his brothers to
Jacob, their father, enabled Jacob to identify his beloved long-lost
son. The metaphor of the fragrant <i>“garment”</i> is frequently
used in the Bahá’í Writings to refer to the recognition of the
Manifestation of God and His Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Bahá’u’lláh, in one of His Tablets, describes Himself as the
<i>“Divine Joseph”</i> Who has been <i>“bartered away”</i> by
the heedless <i>“for the most paltry of prices.”</i> The Báb, in
the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, identifies Bahá’u’lláh as the <i>“true
Joseph”</i> and forecasts the ordeals that He would endure at the
hands of His treacherous brother (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-190">190</a>).
Likewise, Shoghi Effendi draws a parallel between the intense
jealousy which the preeminence of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá had aroused
in His half-brother, Mírzá Muḥammad-‘Alí, and the deadly envy
“which the superior excellence of Joseph had kindled in the hearts
of his brothers.”</p>

<a href="#ka_en-1-5">¶5</a></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The consumption of
wine and other intoxicants is prohibited in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (see
notes <a href="#ka_en-5-144">144</a> and <a href="#ka_en-5-170">170</a>).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Reference to the use of “wine” in an allegorical sense—such as
being the cause of spiritual ecstasy—is found, not only in the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, but in the Bible, in the Qur’án,
and in ancient Hindu traditions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
For example, in the Qur’án the righteous are promised that they
will be given to drink of the <i>“choice sealed wine.”</i> In His
Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh identifies the <i>“choice Wine”</i>
with His Revelation whose <i>“musk-laden fragrance”</i> has been
wafted <i>“upon all created things.”</i> He states that He has
<i>“unsealed”</i> this <i>“Wine,”</i> thereby disclosing
spiritual truths that were hitherto unknown, and enabling those who
quaff thereof to <i>“discern the splendors of the light of divine
unity”</i> and to <i>“grasp the essential purpose underlying the
Scriptures of God.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In one of His meditations, Bahá’u’lláh entreats God to supply
the believers with <i>“the choice Wine of Thy mercy, that it may
cause them to be forgetful of anyone except Thee, and to arise to
serve Thy Cause, and to be steadfast in their love for Thee.”</i></p>

<a href="#ka_en-1-6">¶6</a></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In Arabic, there
are several words for prayer. The word “ṣalát,” which appears
here in the original, refers to a particular category of prayers, the
recitation of which at specific times of the day is enjoined on the
believers. To differentiate this category of prayers from other
kinds, the word has been translated as <i>“obligatory prayer.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Bahá’u’lláh states that <i>“obligatory prayer and fasting
occupy an exalted station in the sight of God”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-93">93</a>).
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá affirms that such prayers are <i>“conducive
to humility and submissiveness, to setting one’s face towards God
and expressing devotion to Him,”</i> and that through these prayers
<i>“man holdeth communion with God, seeketh to draw near unto Him,
converseth with the true Beloved of his heart, and attaineth
spiritual stations.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The Obligatory Prayer (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-9">9</a>) referred
to in this verse has been superseded by the three Obligatory Prayers
later revealed by Bahá’u’lláh (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-63">63</a>).
The texts of the three prayers currently in use, together with
instructions regarding their recital, are to be found in this volume
in Some Texts Supplementary to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
A number of the items in Questions and Answers deal with aspects of
the three new Obligatory Prayers. Bahá’u’lláh clarifies that
the individual is permitted to choose any one of the three Obligatory
Prayers (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-65">65</a>). Other provisions are
elucidated in Questions and Answers, numbers <a href="#ka_en-3-66">66</a>,
<a href="#ka_en-3-67">67</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-81">81</a>, and <a href="#ka_en-3-82">82</a>.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The details of the law concerning obligatory prayer are summarized in

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">A rak‘ah is the
recitation of specifically revealed verses accompanied by a
prescribed set of genuflections and other movements.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The Obligatory Prayer originally enjoined by Bahá’u’lláh upon
His followers consisted of nine rak‘ahs. The precise nature of this
prayer and the specific instructions for its recitation are unknown,
as the prayer has been lost. (See note <a href="#ka_en-5-9">9</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In a Tablet commenting on the presently binding Obligatory Prayers,
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá indicates that <i>“in every word and
movement of the Obligatory Prayer there are allusions, mysteries and
a wisdom that man is unable to comprehend, and letters and scrolls
cannot contain.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Shoghi Effendi explains that the few simple directions given by
Bahá’u’lláh for the recital of certain prayers not only have a
spiritual significance but that they also help the individual “to
fully concentrate when praying and meditating.”</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Regarding the
definition of the words <i>“morning,”</i> <i>“noon”</i> and
<i>“evening,”</i> at which times the currently binding medium
Obligatory Prayer is to be recited, Bahá’u’lláh has stated that
these coincide with <i>“sunrise, noon and sunset”</i> (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-83">83</a>). He specifies that the <i>“allowable
times for Obligatory Prayers are from morning till noon, from noon
till sunset, and from sunset till two hours thereafter.”</i>
Further, ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá has stated that the morning
Obligatory Prayer may be said as early as dawn.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The definition of <i>“noon”</i> as the period <i>“from noon
till sunset”</i> applies to the recitation of the short Obligatory
Prayer as well as the medium one.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The requirements
for obligatory prayer called for in the Bábí and Islamic
Dispensations were more demanding than those for the performance of
the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak‘ahs that was
prescribed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-4">4</a>).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In the Bayán, the Báb prescribed an Obligatory Prayer consisting of
nineteen rak‘ahs which was to be performed once in a
twenty-four-hour period—from noon of one day to noon of the next.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The Muslim prayer is recited five times a day, namely, in the early
morning, at midday, in the afternoon and evening, and at night. While
the number of rak‘ahs varies according to the time of recitation, a

This passage is quoted by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas

of the Qiblih is a <i>“fixed requirement for the recitation of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Bahá’u’lláh
ordains His resting-place as the Qiblih after His passing. The Most
Holy Tomb is at Bahjí, ‘Akká. ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá describes
that Spot as the <i>“luminous Shrine,”</i> <i>“the place around

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The Prayer for the
Dead (see Some Texts Supplementary to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas) is the only
Bahá’í obligatory prayer which is to be recited in congregation;
it is to be recited by one believer while all present stand in
silence (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-19">19</a>). Bahá’u’lláh
has clarified that the Prayer for the Dead is required only when the
deceased is an adult (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-70">70</a>), that the
recital should precede the interment of the deceased, and that there
is no requirement to face the Qiblih when saying this prayer (Q&amp;A

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The passages that
form part of the Prayer for the Dead comprise the repetition of the
greeting “Alláh-u-Abhá” (God is the All-Glorious) six times,
each followed by nineteen repetitions of one of six specifically
revealed verses. These verses are identical with those in the Prayer
for the Dead revealed by the Báb in the Bayán. Bahá’u’lláh
added a supplication to precede these passages.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The exemption of
those who are weak due to illness or advanced age from offering the
Obligatory Prayers and from fasting is explained in Questions and
Answers. Bahá’u’lláh indicates that in <i>“time of ill health
it is not permissible to observe these obligations”</i> (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-93">93</a>). He defines old age, in this context,
as being from seventy (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-74">74</a>). In
answer to a question, Shoghi Effendi has clarified that people who
attain the age of seventy are exempt, whether or not they are weak.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The requirements

In the Arabic Bayán the Báb called upon the believers to lay their
foreheads on surfaces of crystal when prostrating. Similarly, in
Islám, certain restrictions are imposed with regard to the surface
on which Muslims are permitted to prostrate. Bahá’u’lláh
abrogates such restrictions and simply specifies <i>“any surface

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Ablutions are to
be performed by the believer in preparation for the offering of
obligatory prayer. They consist of washing the hands and face. If
water is unavailable, the repetition five times of the specifically

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Congregational
prayer, in the sense of formal obligatory prayer which is to be
recited in accordance with a prescribed ritual as, for example, is
the custom in Islám where Friday prayer in the mosque is led by an
imám, has been annulled in the Bahá’í Dispensation. The Prayer
for the Dead (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-10">10</a>) is the only
congregational prayer prescribed by Bahá’í law. It is to be
recited by one of those present while the remainder of the party
stands in silence; the reader has no special status. The congregation

Splendor and Beauty.”</i> This provision has its antecedent in the
Arabic Bayán, where a similar dispensation was granted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In some earlier religious Dispensations, women in their courses were
considered ritually unclean and were forbidden to observe the duties
of prayer and fasting. The concept of ritual uncleanness has been
abolished by Bahá’u’lláh (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-106">106</a>).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The Universal House of Justice has clarified that the provisions in
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas granting exemptions from certain duties and
responsibilities are, as the word indicates, exemptions and not
prohibitions. Any believer is, therefore, free to avail himself or
herself of an applicable exemption if he or she so wishes. However,
the House of Justice counsels that, in deciding whether to do so or
not, the believer should use wisdom and realize that Bahá’u’lláh
has granted these exemptions for good reason.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The prescribed exemption from obligatory prayer, originally related
to the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak‘ahs, is now

purpose of this holy tradition is to make mention of the stages of
God’s concealment and manifestation within the Embodiments of
Truth, They who are the Dawning-places of His All-Glorious Being. For
example, before the flame of the undying fire is lit and manifest, it
existeth by itself within itself in the hidden identity of the
universal Manifestations, and this is the stage of the “Hidden
Treasure.” And when the blessed Tree is kindled by itself within
itself, and that Divine fire burneth by its essence within its
essence, this is the stage of “I wished to be made known.” And
when it shineth forth from the Horizon of the universe with infinite
Divine Names and Attributes upon the contingent and placeless worlds,
this constituteth the emergence of a new and wondrous creation which
correspondeth to the stage of “Thus I called creation into being.”
And when the sanctified souls rend asunder the veils of all earthly
attachments and worldly conditions, and hasten to the stage of gazing
on the beauty of the Divine Presence and are honored by recognizing
the Manifestation and are able to witness the splendor of God’s

A summary of the detailed provisions concerning the law of fasting
and of the exemptions granted to certain categories of people is

The nineteen-day period of fasting coincides with the Bahá’í
month of ‘Alá’, usually 2–20 March, immediately after the
termination of the Intercalary Days (see notes <a href="#ka_en-5-27">27</a>
and <a href="#ka_en-5-147">147</a>), and is followed by the feast of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The Báb
introduced a new calendar, known now as the Badí‘ or Bahá’í
calendar (see notes <a href="#ka_en-5-27">27</a> and <a href="#ka_en-5-147">147</a>).
According to this calendar, a day is the period from sunset to
sunset. In the Bayán, the Báb ordained the month of ‘Alá’ to
be the month of fasting, decreed that the day of Naw-Rúz should mark
the termination of that period, and designated Naw-Rúz as the Day of
God. Bahá’u’lláh confirms the Badí‘ calendar wherein Naw-Rúz
is designated as a feast.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Naw-Rúz is the first day of the new year. It coincides with the
spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, which usually occurs on 21
March. Bahá’u’lláh explains that this feast day is to be
celebrated on whatever day the sun passes into the constellation of
Aries (i.e. the vernal equinox), even should this occur one minute
before sunset (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-35">35</a>). Hence Naw-Rúz
could fall on 20, 21, or 22 March, depending on the time of the
equinox.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Bahá’u’lláh has left the details of many laws to be filled in
by the Universal House of Justice. Among these are a number of
matters affecting the Bahá’í calendar. The Guardian has stated
that the implementation, worldwide, of the law concerning the timing
of Naw-Rúz will require the choice of a particular spot on earth
which will serve as the standard for the fixing of the time of the
spring equinox. He also indicated that the choice of this spot has
been left to the decision of the Universal House of Justice.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The Badí‘
calendar is based on the solar year of 365 days, 5 hours, and 50 odd
minutes. The year consists of 19 months of 19 days each (i.e. 361
days), with the addition of four extra days (five in a leap year).
The Báb did not specifically define the place for the intercalary
days in the new calendar. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas resolves this question
by assigning the <i>“excess”</i> days a fixed position in the
calendar immediately preceding the month of ‘Alá’, the period of
fasting. For further details see the section on the Bahá’í
calendar in <i>The Bahá’í World</i>, volume XVIII.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">“Alláh-u-Abhá”
is an Arabic phrase meaning “God the All-Glorious.” It is a form
of the Greatest Name of God (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-137">137</a>).
In Islám there is a tradition that among the many names of God, one
was the greatest; however, the identity of this Greatest Name was
hidden. Bahá’u’lláh has confirmed that the Greatest Name is
“Bahá.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The various derivatives of the word “Bahá” are also regarded as

The Greatest Name is the Name of Bahá’u’lláh. “Yá
Bahá’u’l-Abhá” is an invocation meaning: “O Thou Glory of
Glories!” “Alláh-u-Abhá” is a greeting which means: “God
the All-Glorious.” Both refer to Bahá’u’lláh. By Greatest
Name is meant that Bahá’u’lláh has appeared in God’s Greatest
Name, in other words, that He is the supreme Manifestation of God.</p>

women in their courses (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-20">20</a>).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The prescribed ablutions consist of washing the hands and the face in
preparation for prayer. In the case of the medium Obligatory Prayer,
this is accompanied by the recitation of certain verses (see Some
Texts Revealed by Bahá’u’lláh Supplementary to the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
That ablutions have a significance beyond washing may be seen from
the fact that even should one have bathed oneself immediately before

perform ablutions (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-18">18</a>).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
When no water is available for ablutions, a prescribed verse is to be

is accursed of Me.”</i> And again: <i>“O Son of Man! Breathe not
the sins of others so long as thou art thyself a sinner. Shouldst
thou transgress this command, accursed wouldst thou be, and to this I
bear witness.”</i> This strong admonition is further reiterated in
His last work, <i>“the Book of My Covenant”</i>: <i>“Verily I
say, the tongue is for mentioning what is good, defile it not with
unseemly talk. God hath forgiven what is past. Henceforward everyone
should utter that which is meet and seemly, and should refrain from
slander, abuse and whatever causeth sadness in men.”</i></p>

regarding the social function of wealth, and the consequent necessity
of avoiding its overaccumulation and concentration in a few

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The system of inheritance which provides for distribution of the
deceased’s estate among seven categories of heirs (children,
spouse, father, mother, brothers, sisters, and teachers) is based on
the provisions set out by the Báb in the Bayán. The major features
of the Bahá’í laws of inheritance in the case of intestacy are:</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">If the
	deceased is a father and his estate includes a personal residence,
	such residence passes to the eldest son (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-34">34</a>).</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">If the
	deceased has no male descendants, two-thirds of the residence pass
	to his female descendants and the remaining third passes to the
	House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-41">41</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-72">72</a>).
	See note <a href="#ka_en-5-42">42</a> concerning the levels of the
	institution of the House of Justice to which this law applies. (See
	also note <a href="#ka_en-5-44">44</a>.)</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The
	remainder of the estate is divided among the seven categories of
	heirs. For details of the number of shares to be received by each
	group, see Questions and Answers, number <a href="#ka_en-3-5">5</a>,
	and Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.3.a.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In case
	there is more than one heir in any category the share allotted to
	that class should be divided between them equally, be they male or
	female.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In cases
	where there is no issue, the share of the children reverts to the
	House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-7">7</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-41">41</a>).</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Should one
	leave offspring, but either part or all of the other categories of
	heirs be nonexistent, two-thirds of their shares revert to the
	offspring and one-third to the House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-7">7</a>).</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Should none
	of the specified categories exist, two-thirds of the estate revert
	to the nephews and nieces of the deceased. If these do not exist,
	the same shares revert to the aunts and uncles; lacking these, to
	their sons and daughters. In any case the remaining third reverts to
	the House of Justice.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Should one
	leave none of the aforementioned heirs, the entire estate reverts to
	the House of Justice.</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Bahá’u’lláh
	states that non-Bahá’ís have no right to inherit from their
	Bahá’í parents or relatives (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-34">34</a>).
	Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf indicates that this
	restriction applies “only to such cases when a Bahá’í dies
	without leaving a will and when, therefore, his property will have
	to be divided in accordance with the rules set forth in the Aqdas.
	Otherwise, a Bahá’í is free to bequeath his property to any
	person, irrespective of religion, provided however he leaves a will,
	specifying his wishes.” It is always possible, therefore, for a
	Bahá’í to provide for his or her non-Bahá’í partner,
	children or relatives by leaving a will.</p>

Answers amplifies the provisions of the law as it relates to the
shares of the inheritance allocated to the brothers and sisters of
the deceased. If the brother or sister is from the same father as the
deceased, he or she will inherit his or her full allotted share. If,
however, the brother or sister is from another father he or she will
inherit only two-thirds of the allotted share, the remaining
one-third reverting to the House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-6">6</a>).
Further, in the case where the deceased has full brothers or full
sisters among his heirs, half-brothers and half-sisters from the

The half-brothers and half-sisters will, of course, be due to receive

parts consisting of 540 shares. This allocation constituted less than

categories of heirs. He also outlines the precise intention of this

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In referring to
the House of Justice in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh does
not always explicitly distinguish between the Universal House of
Justice and the Local House of Justice, both of which institutions
are ordained in that Book. He usually refers simply to <i>“the
House of Justice,”</i> leaving open for later clarification the
level or levels of the whole institution to which each law would

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In a Tablet,
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá indicates that the residence and personal
clothing of a deceased man remain in the male line. They pass to the
eldest son and in the absence of the eldest son, they pass to the
second-eldest son, and so on. He explains that this provision is an
expression of the law of primogeniture, which has invariably been
upheld by the Law of God. In a Tablet to a follower of the Faith in
Persia He wrote: <i>“In all the Divine Dispensations the eldest son
hath been given extraordinary distinctions. Even the station of
prophethood hath been his birthright.”</i> With the distinctions
given to the eldest son, however, go concomitant duties. For example,
he has the moral responsibility, for the sake of God, to care for his
mother and also to consider the needs of the other heirs.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Bahá’u’lláh clarifies various aspects of this part of the law
of inheritance. He specifies that if there be more than one
residence, the principal and most important one passes to the male
offspring. The remaining residences will, together with the other
possessions of the deceased, have to be divided among the heirs (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-34">34</a>), and He indicates that in the absence
of male offspring, two-thirds of the principal residence and the
personal clothing of the deceased father will revert to the female
issue and one-third to the House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-72">72</a>).
Further, when the deceased is a woman, Bahá’u’lláh states that
all her used clothing is to be equally divided amongst her daughters.
Her unworn clothing, jewels and property must be divided among her
heirs, as well as her used clothing if she leaves no daughter (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-37">37</a>).</p>

The <i>“nine”</i> mentioned here is represented in the Arabic
text by the letter “Ṭá,” which is its equivalent in the abjad
notation (see Glossary). It is the first element of the Báb’s
division of inheritance, where He designates <i>“nine parts”</i>
as the share of the children. The significance of nine lies in its
being the numerical equivalent of the Greatest Name “Bahá,”
alluded to in the next part of this verse as <i>“the concealed and
manifest, the inviolable and unapproachably exalted Name.”</i> (See

Houses of Justice and outlines the method to be pursued for the
election of the Universal House of Justice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In the verse cited above, the reference is to the Local House of
Justice, an institution which is to be elected in a locality whenever
there are nine or more resident adult Bahá’ís. For this purpose,
the definition of adult was temporarily fixed at the age of 21 years
by the Guardian, who indicated it was open to change by the Universal
House of Justice in the future.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">

sense, the performance of a pilgrimage is more than simply visiting
these two Houses.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
After the passing of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá
designated the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh at Bahjí as a place of
pilgrimage. In a Tablet, He indicates that the <i>“Most Holy
Shrine, the Blessed House in Ba</i><i><u>gh</u></i><i>dád and the
venerated House of the Báb in </i><i><u>Sh</u></i><i>íráz”</i>
are <i>“consecrated to pilgrimage,”</i> and that it is
<i>“obligatory”</i> to visit these places <i>“if one can afford
it and is able to do so, and if no obstacle stands in one’s way.”</i>
No rites have been prescribed for pilgrimage to the Most Holy Shrine.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In the Bayán, the

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Bahá’u’lláh likewise exempts women from His pilgrimage
requirements. The Universal House of Justice has clarified that this
exemption is not a prohibition, and that women are free to perform
the pilgrimage.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">It is obligatory
for men and women to engage in a trade or profession. Bahá’u’lláh
exalts <i>“engagement in such work”</i> to the <i>“rank of
worship”</i> of God. The spiritual and practical significance of
this law, and the mutual responsibility of the individual and society
for its implementation are explained in a letter written on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
With reference to Bahá’u’lláh’s command concerning the
engagement of the believers in some sort of profession: the Teachings
are most emphatic on this matter, particularly the statement in the
Aqdas to this effect which makes it quite clear that idle people who
lack the desire to work can have no place in the new World Order. As
a corollary of this principle, Bahá’u’lláh further states that
mendicity should not only be discouraged but entirely wiped out from
the face of society. It is the duty of those who are in charge of the
organization of society to give every individual the opportunity of
acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of profession, and also
the means of utilizing such a talent, both for its own sake and for
the sake of earning the means of his livelihood. Every individual, no
matter how handicapped and limited he may be, is under the obligation
of engaging in some work or profession, for work, especially when
performed in the spirit of service, is according to Bahá’u’lláh
a form of worship. It has not only a utilitarian purpose, but has a
value in itself, because it draws us nearer to God, and enables us to
better grasp His purpose for us in this world. It is obvious,
therefore, that the inheritance of wealth cannot make anyone immune
from daily work.</p>

</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In one of His Tablets, ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá states that <i>“if a
person is incapable of earning a living, is stricken by dire poverty
or becometh helpless, then it is incumbent on the wealthy or the
Deputies to provide him with a monthly allowance for his
subsistence.… By ‘Deputies’ is meant the representatives of the
people, that is to say the members of the House of Justice.”</i>
(See also note <a href="#ka_en-5-162">162</a> on mendicancy.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In response to a question concerning whether Bahá’u’lláh’s
injunction requires a wife and mother, as well as her husband, to
work for a livelihood, the Universal House of Justice has explained
that Bahá’u’lláh’s directive is for the friends to be engaged
in an occupation which will profit themselves and others, and that
homemaking is a highly honorable and responsible work of fundamental
importance to society.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Concerning the retirement from work for individuals who have reached
a certain age, Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf
stated that “this is a matter on which the International House of
Justice will have to legislate as there are no provisions in the
Aqdas concerning it.”</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In a number of
earlier religious Dispensations and in certain cultures the kissing
of the hand of a religious figure or of a prominent person was
expected as a mark of reverence and deference to such persons and as

the kissing of hands and, in His Tablets, He also condemns such

forms of behavior that abase one individual in relation to another.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Bahá’u’lláh

a human being. Instead one should beg forgiveness from God. In the

The Universal House of Justice has also clarified that Bahá’u’lláh’s
prohibition concerning the confession of sins does not prevent an
individual from admitting transgressions in the course of
consultations held under the aegis of Bahá’í institutions.
Likewise, it does not preclude the possibility of seeking advice from
a close friend or of a professional counselor regarding such matters.</p>

constitute the prohibition of monasticism and asceticism. See the
Synopsis and Codification, section IV.D. 1.y.iii.-iv. In the Words of
Paradise Bahá’u’lláh amplifies these provisions. He states:
<i>“Living in seclusion or practicing asceticism is not acceptable
in the presence of God,”</i> and He calls upon those involved to
<i>“observe that which will cause joy and radiance.”</i> He
instructs those who have taken up <i>“their abodes in the caves of
the mountains”</i> or who have <i>“repaired to graveyards at
night”</i> to abandon these practices, and He enjoins them not to
deprive themselves of the <i>“bounties”</i> of this world which
have been created by God for humankind. And in the Tablet of
Bi<u>sh</u>árát, while acknowledging the <i>“pious deeds”</i>
of monks and priests, Bahá’u’lláh calls upon them to <i>“give
up the life of seclusion and direct their steps towards the open
world and busy themselves with that which will profit themselves and
others.”</i> He also grants them leave <i>“to enter into wedlock
that they may bring forth one who will make mention of God.”</i></p>

following the passing of Bahá’u’lláh (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-145">145</a>)
and of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá. Bahá’u’lláh, in the Book of His
Covenant, appointed ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, His eldest son, as the
Center of His Covenant and the Head of the Faith. ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá,
in His Will and Testament, appointed Shoghi Effendi, His eldest

spiritual and physical implications, such as elegance, gracefulness,
cleanliness, civility, politeness, gentleness, delicacy and
graciousness, as well as being subtle, refined, sanctified and pure.
In accordance with the context of the various passages where it
occurs in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, it has been translated either as
“refinement” or “cleanliness.”</p>

and asserts that <i>“whatever emanates from Them is identical with

mothers are the first educators of the new generation. If it is not
possible, therefore, for a family to educate all the children,

mothers, the benefits of knowledge can be most effectively and
rapidly diffused throughout society.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Although the term
translated here as adultery refers, in its broadest sense, to
unlawful sexual intercourse between either married or unmarried
individuals (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-36">36</a> for a definition
of the term), ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá has specified that the
punishment here prescribed is for sexual intercourse between persons
who are unmarried. He indicates that it remains for the Universal
House of Justice to determine the penalty for adultery committed by a
married individual. (See also Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-49">49</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In one of His Tablets, ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá refers to some of the
spiritual and social implications of the violation of the laws of
morality and, concerning the penalty here described, He indicates
that the aim of this law is to make clear to all that such an action
is shameful in the eyes of God and that, in the event that the
offense can be established and the fine imposed, the principal
purpose is the exposure of the offenders—that they are shamed and
disgraced in the eyes of society. He affirms that such exposure is in
itself the greatest punishment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The House of Justice referred to in this verse is presumably the
Local House of Justice, currently known as the Local Spiritual

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">A mi<u>th</u>qál
is a unit of weight. The weight of the traditional mi<u>th</u>qál
used in the Middle East is equivalent to 24 na<u>kh</u>uds. However,
the mi<u>th</u>qál used by the Bahá’ís consists of 19 na<u>kh</u>uds,
<i>“in accordance with the specification of the Bayán”</i> (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-23">23</a>). The weight of nine of these mi<u>th</u>qál
equals 32.775 grams or 1.05374 troy ounces.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In relation to the application of the fine, Bahá’u’lláh clearly
specifies that each succeeding fine is double the preceding one (Q&amp;A
<a href="#ka_en-3-23">23</a>); thus the fine imposed increases in
geometrical progression. The imposition of this fine is intended for
a future condition of society, at which time the law will be

Some of us may not be able to grasp the wisdom of this when it
disagrees with our own limited vision; but we must accept it, knowing
His Wisdom, His Mercy and His Justice are perfect and for the
salvation of the entire world. If a man were falsely condemned to

another Tablet, He underlines the importance of the individual’s
acting in such a way as to <i>“bring comfort to himself and to his
partner.”</i> ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, the authorized Interpreter
of the Bahá’í Writings, states that in the text of the Aqdas
monogamy is in effect enjoined. He elaborates this theme in a number
of Tablets, including the following:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid">

<p style="margin-left: 0.21in; margin-right: 0.21in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
<i>Know thou that polygamy is not permitted under the law of God, for
contentment with one wife hath been clearly stipulated. Taking a
second wife is made dependent upon equity and justice being upheld
between the two wives, under all conditions. However, observance of
justice and equity towards two wives is utterly impossible. The fact
that bigamy has been made dependent upon an impossible condition is
clear proof of its absolute prohibition. Therefore it is not
permissible for a man to have more than one wife.</i></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Polygamy is a very ancient practice among the majority of humanity.
The introduction of monogamy has been only gradually accomplished by
the Manifestations of God. Jesus, for example, did not prohibit
polygamy, but abolished divorce except in the case of fornication;
Muḥammad limited the number of wives to four, but making plurality
of wives contingent on justice, and reintroducing permission for
divorce; Bahá’u’lláh, Who was revealing His Teachings in the
milieu of a Muslim society, introduced the question of monogamy
gradually in accordance with the principles of wisdom and the
progressive unfoldment of His purpose. The fact that He left His
followers with an infallible Interpreter of His Writings enabled Him
to outwardly permit two wives in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas but uphold a
condition that enabled ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá to elucidate later
that the intention of the law was to enforce monogamy.</p>

emphasizes that the <i>“service”</i> referred to in this verse is
solely <i>“such as is performed by any other class of servants, be
they young or old, in exchange for wages”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-30">30</a>).
An employer has no sexual rights over his maid. She is <i>“free to
choose a husband at whatever time she pleaseth,”</i> for the
purchase of women is forbidden (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-30">30</a>).</p>

has to wait a considerable period of time before finding a spouse, or

fundamentally spiritual.</p>

The dowry is to be paid by the bridegroom to the bride. It is fixed
at 19 mi<u>th</u>qáls of pure gold for city dwellers, and 19
mi<u>th</u>qáls of silver for village dwellers (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-94">94</a>).
Bahá’u’lláh indicates that, if, at the time of the wedding, the
bridegroom is unable to pay the dowry in full, it is permissible for
him to issue a promissory note to the bride (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-39">39</a>).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
With the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh many familiar concepts,
customs and institutions are redefined and take on new meaning. One
of these is the dowry. The institution of dowry is a very ancient
practice in many cultures and takes many forms. In some countries it
is a payment made by the parents of the bride to the bridegroom; in
others it is a payment made by the bridegroom to the parents of the
bride, called a “bride-price.” In both such cases the amount is
often quite considerable. The law of Bahá’u’lláh abolishes all
such variants and converts the dowry into a symbolic act whereby the
bridegroom presents a gift of a certain limited value to the bride.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In the Tablet of
I<u>sh</u>ráqát Bahá’u’lláh, referring to the fact that the
Báb had made the laws of the Bayán subject to His sanction, states
that He put some of the Báb’s laws into effect <i>“by embodying
them in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in different words,”</i> while others He
set aside.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
With regard to the destruction of books, the Bayán commanded the
Báb’s followers to destroy all books except those that were
written in vindication of the Cause and Religion of God. Bahá’u’lláh
abrogates this specific law of the Bayán.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
As to the nature and severity of the laws of the Bayán, Shoghi
Effendi in a letter written on his behalf provides the following
comment:</p>

The severe laws and injunctions revealed by the Báb can be properly
appreciated and understood only when interpreted in the light of His
own statements regarding the nature, purpose and character of His own
Dispensation. As these statements clearly reveal, the Bábí
Dispensation was essentially in the nature of a religious and indeed
social revolution, and its duration had therefore to be short, but
full of tragic events, of sweeping and drastic reforms. Those drastic
measures enforced by the Báb and His followers were taken with the
view of undermining the very foundations of <u>Sh</u>í‘ih
orthodoxy, and thus paving the way for the coming of Bahá’u’lláh.
To assert the independence of the new Dispensation, and to prepare
also the ground for the approaching Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh,
the Báb had therefore to reveal very severe laws, even though most
of them were never enforced. But the mere fact that He revealed them
was in itself a proof of the independent character of His
Dispensation and was sufficient to create such widespread agitation,
and excite such opposition on the part of the clergy that led them to
cause His eventual martyrdom.</p>

establishes Ḥuqúqu’lláh, the Right of God, the offering of a
fixed portion of the value of the believer’s possessions. This
offering was made to Bahá’u’lláh as the Manifestation of God
and then, following His Ascension, to ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá as the
Center of the Covenant. In His Will and Testament, ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá
provided that the Ḥuqúqu’lláh was to be offered <i>“through
the Guardian of the Cause of God.”</i> There now being no Guardian,
it is offered through the Universal House of Justice as the Head of
the Faith. This fund is used for the promotion of the Faith of God
and its interests as well as for various philanthropic purposes. The
offering of the Ḥuqúqu’lláh is a spiritual obligation, the
fulfillment of which has been left to the conscience of each Bahá’í.
While the community is reminded of the requirements of the law of
Ḥuqúq, no believer may be approached individually to pay it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
A number of items in Questions and Answers further elaborate this
law. The payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh is based on the calculation of
the value of the individual’s possessions. If a person has
possessions equal in value to at least nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of
gold (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-8">8</a>), it is a spiritual
obligation to pay nineteen percent of the total amount, once only, as
Ḥuqúqu’lláh (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-89">89</a>). Thereafter,
whenever one’s income, after all expenses have been paid, increases
the value of one’s possessions by the amount of at least nineteen
mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold, one is to pay nineteen percent of this
increase, and so on for each further increase (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-8">8</a>,
<a href="#ka_en-3-90">90</a>).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Certain categories of possessions, such as one’s residence, are
exempt from the payment of Ḥuqúqu’lláh (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-8">8</a>,
<a href="#ka_en-3-42">42</a>, <a href="#ka_en-3-95">95</a>), and

Dispensation, the Bayán is the Mother Book, and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
is the Mother Book of the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh. Further,
the Guardian in a letter written on his behalf has stated that this
concept can also be used as a “collective term indicating the body
of the Teachings revealed by Bahá’u’lláh.” This term is also
used in a broader sense to signify the Divine Repository of
Revelation.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In several of His
Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh affirms the distinction between
allegorical verses, which are susceptible to interpretation, and
those verses that relate to such subjects as the laws and ordinances,
worship and religious observances, whose meanings are evident and
which demand compliance on the part of the believers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
As explained in notes <a href="#ka_en-5-145">145</a> and <a href="#ka_en-5-184">184</a>,
Bahá’u’lláh designated ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá, His eldest Son,
as His Successor and the Interpreter of His Teachings. ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá
in His turn appointed His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, to succeed
Him as interpreter of the holy Writ and Guardian of the Cause. The
interpretations of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá and Shoghi Effendi are
considered divinely guided and are binding on the Bahá’ís.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The existence of authoritative interpretations does not preclude the
individual from engaging in the study of the Teachings and thereby
arriving at a personal interpretation or understanding. A clear
distinction is, however, drawn in the Bahá’í Writings between
authoritative interpretation and the understanding that each
individual arrives at from a study of its Teachings. Individual
interpretations based on a person’s understanding of the Teachings
constitute the fruit of man’s rational power and may well
contribute to a greater comprehension of the Faith. Such views,
nevertheless, lack authority. In presenting their personal ideas,
individuals are cautioned not to discard the authority of the
revealed words, not to deny or contend with the authoritative
interpretation, and not to engage in controversy; rather they should
offer their thoughts as a contribution to knowledge, making it clear
that their views are merely their own.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Bahá’u’lláh
prohibits the use of the pools found in the traditional public
bathhouses of Persia. In these baths it was the custom for many
people to wash themselves in the same pool and for the water to be
changed at infrequent intervals. Consequently, the water was
discolored, befouled and unhygienic, and had a highly offensive
stench.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Most houses in
Persia used to have a pool in their courtyard which served as a
reservoir for water used for cleaning, washing and other domestic
purposes. Since the water in the pool was stagnant and was not
usually changed for weeks at a time, it tended to develop a very
unpleasant odor.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Marriage with
one’s stepmother is here explicitly prohibited. This prohibition
also applies to marrying one’s stepfather. Where Bahá’u’lláh

make this impossible.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá and Shoghi Effendi confirmed that, while
stepmothers are the only category of relatives mentioned in the text,
this does not mean that all other unions within a family are
permissible. Bahá’u’lláh states that it devolves upon the House
of Justice to legislate “concerning the legitimacy or otherwise of
marrying one’s relatives” (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-50">50</a>).
‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá has written that the more distant the blood
relationship between the couple the better, since such marriages
provide the basis for the physical well-being of humanity and are
conducive to fellowship among mankind.</p>

interpreted this reference as a prohibition on all homosexual

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The Bahá’í teachings on sexual morality center on marriage and
the family as the bedrock of the whole structure of human society and
are designed to protect and strengthen that divine institution.
Bahá’í law thus restricts permissible sexual intercourse to that
between a man and the woman to whom he is married.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">

No matter how devoted and fine the love may be between people of the
same sex, to let it find expression in sexual acts is wrong. To say
that it is ideal is no excuse. Immorality of every sort is really
forbidden by Bahá’u’lláh, and homosexual relationships He looks
upon as such, besides being against nature. To be afflicted this way
is a great burden to a conscientious soul. But through the advice and
help of doctors, through a strong and determined effort, and through
prayer, a soul can overcome this handicap.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">This passage
establishes four great festivals of the Bahá’í year. The two
designated by Bahá’u’lláh as <i>“the two Most Great
Festivals”</i> are, first, the Festival of Riḍván, which
commemorates Bahá’u’lláh’s Declaration of His Prophetic
Mission in the Garden of Riḍván in Ba<u>gh</u>dád during twelve
days in April/May 1863 and is referred to by Him as <i>“the King of
Festivals”</i> and, second, the Báb’s Declaration, which
occurred in May 1844 in <u>Sh</u>íráz. The first, ninth and twelfth
days of the Festival of Riḍván are Holy Days (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-1">1</a>),
as is the day of the Declaration of the Báb.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The <i>“two other Festivals”</i> are the anniversaries of the
births of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb. In the Muslim lunar
calendar these fall on consecutive days, the birth of Bahá’u’lláh
on the second day of the month of Muḥarram 1233 A.H. (12 November
1817), and the birth of the Báb on the first day of the same month
1235 A.H. (20 October 1819), respectively. They are thus referred to
as the “Twin Birthdays” and Bahá’u’lláh states that these
two days are accounted as one in the sight of God (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-2">2</a>).
He states that, should they fall within the month of fasting, the
command to fast shall not apply on those days (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-36">36</a>).
Given that the Bahá’í calendar (see notes <a href="#ka_en-5-26">26</a>
and <a href="#ka_en-5-147">147</a>) is a solar calendar, it remains
for the Universal House of Justice to determine whether the Twin Holy
Birthdays are to be celebrated on a solar or lunar basis.</p>

calendar the first month of the year and the first day of each month
are given the name “Bahá.” The day of Bahá of the month of Bahá
is thus the Bahá’í New Year, Naw-Rúz, which was ordained by the
Báb as a festival and is here confirmed by Bahá’u’lláh (see
notes <a href="#ka_en-5-26">26</a> and <a href="#ka_en-5-147">147</a>).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In addition to the seven Holy Days ordained in these passages of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the anniversary of the Martyrdom of the Báb was also
commemorated as a Holy Day in the lifetime of Bahá’u’lláh and,
as a corollary to this, ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá added the observance
of the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, making nine Holy Days in all.
Two other anniversaries which are observed, but on which work is not
suspended, are the Day of the Covenant and the anniversary of the
Passing of ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá. See the section on the Bahá’í

between the eighteenth and nineteenth months in order to adjust the
calendar to the solar year. The Báb named the months after certain
attributes of God. The Bahá’í New Year, Naw-Rúz, is
astronomically fixed, coinciding with the March equinox (see note
<a href="#ka_en-5-26">26</a>). For further details, including the
names of the days of the week and the months, see the section on the
Bahá’í calendar in <i>The Bahá’í World,</i> volume XVIII.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In the Bayán, the
Báb prescribed that the deceased should be interred in a coffin made
of crystal or polished stone. Shoghi Effendi, in a letter written on
his behalf, explained that the significance of this provision was to
show respect for the human body which “was once exalted by the
immortal soul of man.” 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In brief, the Bahá’í law for the burial of the dead states that
it is forbidden to carry the body for more than one hour’s journey
from the place of death; that the body should be wrapped in a shroud
of silk or cotton, and on its finger should be placed a ring bearing
the inscription <i>“I came forth from God, and return unto Him,
detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful,
the Compassionate”</i>; and that the coffin should be of crystal,
stone or hard fine wood. A specific Prayer for the Dead (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-10">10</a>)
is ordained, to be said before interment. As affirmed by ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá
and the Guardian, this law precludes cremation of the dead. The
formal prayer and the ring are meant to be used for those who have
attained the age of maturity, i.e. 15 years of age (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-70">70</a>).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
With regard to the material from which the coffin is to be made, the
spirit of the law is that coffins should be of as durable a material
as possible. Hence, the Universal House of Justice has explained
that, in addition to the materials specified in the Aqdas, there is
no objection to using the hardest wood available or concrete for the
casket. For the present, the Bahá’ís are left free to make their
own choices in this matter.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In the Bayán, the
Báb specified that the body of the deceased should be wrapped in
five sheets of silk or cotton. Bahá’u’lláh confirmed this
provision and added the stipulation that for <i>“those whose means
are limited a single sheet of either fabric will suffice.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
When asked whether the <i>“five sheets”</i> mentioned in the law
referred to “five full-length shrouds” or “five cloths which
were hitherto customarily used,” Bahá’u’lláh responded that
the intention is the <i>“use of five cloths”</i> (Q&amp;A <a href="#ka_en-3-56">56</a>).</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Concerning the way in which the body should be wrapped, there is
nothing in the Bahá’í Writings to define how the wrapping of the
body is to be done, either when <i>“five cloths”</i> are used or
only <i>“a single sheet.”</i> At present, the Bahá’ís are
free to use their judgment in the matter.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">The intention of
this command is to limit the duration of the journey to one hour’s
time, irrespective of the means of transport that are chosen to carry
the body to the burial site. Bahá’u’lláh affirms that the

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The place of death may be taken to encompass the city or town in
which the person passes away, and therefore the one hour’s journey
may be calculated from the city limits to the place of burial. The

explicitly held in abeyance by the Báb, and were subsequently
annulled by Bahá’u’lláh before they could come into effect.
Bahá’u’lláh, in quoting this law, points to the fact that, in
revealing it, the Báb had clearly anticipated the possibility that

torpor the clergy and the people, and to administer a sudden and
fatal blow to obsolete and corrupt institutions, it proclaimed,
through its drastic provisions, the advent of the anticipated Day,

Writings contain many passages that elucidate the nature of the
Manifestation and His relationship to God. Bahá’u’lláh
underlines the unique and transcendent nature of the Godhead. He
explains that <i>“since there can be no tie of direct intercourse
to bind the one True God with His creation”</i> God ordains that
<i>“in every age and dispensation a pure and stainless Soul be made
manifest in the kingdoms of earth and heaven.”</i> This <i>“mysterious
and ethereal Being,”</i> the Manifestation of God, has a human
nature which pertains to <i>“the world of matter”</i> and a
spiritual nature <i>“born of the substance of God Himself.”</i>
He is also endowed with a <i>“double station”</i>:</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Bahá’u’lláh
also affirms that, in the spiritual realm, there is an <i>“essential
unity”</i> between all the Manifestations of God. They all reveal
the <i>“Beauty of God,”</i> manifest His names and attributes,
and give utterance to His Revelation. In this regard, He states:</p>

<i>Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to declare: “I

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">While the
Manifestations reveal the names and attributes of God and are the
means by which humanity has access to the knowledge of God and His
Revelation, Shoghi Effendi states that the Manifestations should
“never … be identified with that invisible Reality, the Essence
of Divinity itself.” In relation to Bahá’u’lláh, the Guardian
wrote that the “human temple that has been the vehicle of so
overpowering a Revelation” is not to be identified with the
“Reality” of God.</p>

course the concept evolved into a form of alms tax which imposed the
obligation to give a fixed portion of certain categories of income,
beyond specified limits, for the relief of the poor, for various
charitable purposes, and to aid the Faith of God. The limit of
exemption varied for different commodities, as did the percentage
payable on the portion assessable.</p>

Bahá’u’lláh states that the Bahá’í law of Zakát follows

Since such issues as the limits for exemption, the categories of

mendicancy altogether. However, if a person is incapable of earning a
living, is stricken by dire poverty or becometh helpless, then it is
incumbent on the wealthy or the Deputies to provide him with a

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The prohibition against giving charity to people who beg does not

(where sermons are prohibited and only the words of Holy Scripture
may be read) the reader may stand or sit, and if necessary to be

reader or speaker to sit or stand, and to use a platform. In one of
His Tablets, when reiterating the prohibition of the use of pulpits

He states: <i>“Through this reversal He hath caused the exalted to

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">In his writings,
<u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í placed great emphasis on
the Arabic letter “Váv.” In <i>The Dawn-Breakers,</i> Nabíl
states that this letter “symbolized for the Báb the advent of a
new cycle of Divine Revelation, and has since been alluded to by
Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in such passages as <i>‘the
mystery of the Great Reversal’</i> and <i>‘the Sign of the
Sovereign.’</i>”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The name for the letter “Váv” consists of three letters: Váv,
Alif, Váv. According to the abjad reckoning, the numerical value of
each of these letters is 6, 1 and 6 respectively. Shoghi Effendi in a
letter written on his behalf to one of the believers in the East
provides an interpretation of this verse of the Aqdas. He states that
the <i>“Upright Alif”</i> refers to the advent of the Báb. The
first letter with its value of six, which comes before the Alif, is a
symbol of earlier Dispensations and Manifestations which predate the
Báb, while the third letter, which also has a numerical value of
six, stands for Bahá’u’lláh’s supreme Revelation which was
made manifest after the Alif.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Bahá’u’lláh
confirms an injunction contained in the Bayán which makes it
unlawful to carry arms, unless it is necessary to do so. With regard
to circumstances under which the bearing of arms might be <i>“essential”</i>
for an individual, ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá gives permission to a
believer for self-protection in a dangerous environment. Shoghi
Effendi in a letter written on his behalf has also indicated that, in
an emergency, when there is no legal force at hand to appeal to, a
Bahá’í is justified in defending his life. There are a number of
other situations in which weapons are needed and can be legitimately
used; for instance, in countries where people hunt for their food and
clothing, and in such sports as archery, marksmanship, and fencing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
On the societal level, the principle of collective security
enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh (see <i>Gleanings from the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh,</i> CXVII) and elaborated by Shoghi Effendi
(see the Guardian’s letters in <i>The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh</i>)
does not presuppose the abolition of the use of force, but prescribes
“a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice,” and
which provides for the existence of an international peacekeeping
force that “will safeguard the organic unity of the whole
commonwealth.” In the Tablet of Bi<u>sh</u>árát, Bahá’u’lláh
expresses the hope that <i>“weapons of war throughout the world may
be converted into instruments of reconstruction and that strife and
conflict may be removed from the midst of men.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
In another Tablet Bahá’u’lláh stresses the importance of

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Many rules about

desire to emulate the custom of the Prophet, also introduced a number
of restrictions with regard to the trim of the moustache and the
length of the beard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Bahá’u’lláh removed such limitations on one’s apparel and

in the Persian Bayán and praised as one who <i>“donned the robe of
discipleship.”</i> In <i>The Dawn-Breakers,</i> Nabíl describes
the unreserved acceptance of the Message by the “sifter of wheat”
and his zealous advocacy of the new Revelation. He joined the company
of the defenders of the Fort of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Ṭabarsí and
perished during that siege.</p>

cautions people <i>“of insight”</i> not to allow their
interpretations of the Holy Scriptures to prevent them from
recognizing the Manifestation of God. Followers of each religion have
tended to allow their devotion to its Founder to cause them to
perceive His Revelation as the final Word of God and to deny the
possibility of the appearance of any subsequent Prophet. This has
been the case of Judaism, Christianity and Islám. Bahá’u’lláh
denies the validity of this concept of finality both in relation to
past Dispensations and to His own. With regard to Muslims, He wrote
in the Kitáb-i-Íqán that the <i>“people of the Qur’án …
have allowed the words ‘Seal of the Prophets’ to veil their
eyes,”</i> <i>“to obscure their understanding, and deprive them
of the grace of all His manifold bounties.”</i> He affirms that
<i>“this theme hath … been a sore test unto all mankind,”</i>
and laments the fate of <i>“those who, clinging unto these words,
have disbelieved in Him Who is their true Revealer.”</i> The Báb
refers to this same theme when He warns: <i>“Let not names shut you
out as by a veil from Him Who is their Lord, even the name Prophet,
for such a name is but a creation of His utterance.”</i></p>

Muḥammad Karím <u>Kh</u>án-i-Kirmání (1810–circa 1873) was
the self-appointed leader of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í community
after the death of Siyyid Káẓim, who was the appointed successor
to <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í (see notes <a href="#ka_en-5-171">171</a>
and <a href="#ka_en-5-172">172</a>). He dedicated himself to the
promotion of the teachings of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad. The
opinions he expressed became the subject of controversy among his
supporters and opponents alike.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Regarded as one of the leading savants and prolific authors of his
age, he composed numerous books and epistles in the various fields of
learning that were cultivated in those times. He actively opposed
both the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, and used his treatises to attack
the Báb and His Teachings. In the Kitáb-i-Íqán, Bahá’u’lláh
condemns the tone and content of his writings and singles out for
criticism one of his works which contains negative allusions to the
Báb. Shoghi Effendi describes him as “inordinately ambitious and
hypocritical” and describes how he “at the special request of the
<u>Sh</u>áh had in a treatise viciously attacked the new Faith and
its doctrines.”</p>

In this holy cycle the <i>“learned”</i> are, on the one hand, the
Hands of the Cause of God, and, on the other, the teachers and
diffusers of His Teachings who do not rank as Hands, but who have
attained an eminent position in the teaching work. As to the <i>“rulers”</i>
they refer to the members of the Local, National and International

The Hands of the Cause of God were individuals appointed by
Bahá’u’lláh and charged with various duties, especially those
of protecting and propagating His Faith. In <i>Memorials of the
Faithful</i> ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá referred to other outstanding
believers as Hands of the Cause, and in His Will and Testament He
included a provision calling upon the Guardian of the Faith to
appoint Hands of the Cause at his discretion. Shoghi Effendi first
raised posthumously a number of the believers to the rank of Hands of
the Cause, and during the latter years of his life appointed a total
of 32 believers from all continents to this position. In the period
between the passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957 and the election of the
Universal House of Justice in 1963, the Hands of the Cause directed
the affairs of the Faith in their capacity as Chief Stewards of
Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic World Commonwealth (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-67">67</a>).
In November 1964, the Universal House of Justice determined that it
could not legislate to make it possible to appoint Hands of the
Cause. Instead, by a decision of the House of Justice in 1968, the
functions of the Hands of the Cause in relation to protecting and
propagating the Faith were extended into the future by the creation
of the Continental Boards of Counselors, and in 1973 through the
establishment of the International Teaching Center, which has its
seat in the Holy Land.</p>

the ones which immediately follow it, Bahá’u’lláh confronts one
of the reasons some of the Bábís rejected His claim to be the
Promised One of the Bayán. Their rejection was based on a Tablet
addressed by the Báb to “Him Who will be made manifest” on the
reverse side of which the Báb had written: <i>“May the glances of
Him Whom God shall make manifest illumine this letter at the primary
school.”</i> This Tablet is published in <i>Selections from the
Writings of the Báb.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
These Bábís maintained that, since Bahá’u’lláh was two years
older than the Báb, it was not possible for Him to receive this
Tablet <i>“at the primary school.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">Shoghi Effendi, in

<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The imperative “Be” in the original Arabic is the word “kun,”
consisting of the two letters “káf” and “nún.” They have
been translated by Shoghi Effendi in the above manner. This word has
been used in the Qur’án as God’s bidding calling creation into
being.</p>

gaze upon the Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and rendereth thanks unto

irrevocably ordained it in the Bayán.”</i> Shoghi Effendi
identifies this <i>“Order”</i> with the System Bahá’u’lláh
envisages in the Aqdas, in which He testifies to its revolutionizing
effect on the life of humanity and reveals the laws and principles
which govern its operation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
The features of the <i>“new World Order”</i> are delineated in
the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l&#8209;Bahá and in
the letters of Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice. The
institutions of the present-day Bahá’í Administrative Order,
which constitute the “structural basis” of Bahá’u’lláh’s
World Order, will mature and evolve into the Bahá’í World
Commonwealth. In this regard, Shoghi Effendi affirms that the
Administrative Order “will, as its component parts, its organic
institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigor, assert its
claim and demonstrate its capacity to be regarded not only as the
nucleus but the very pattern of the New World Order destined to
embrace in the fullness of time the whole of mankind.”</p>

the Báb to serve as a figurehead for the Bábí community pending
the imminent manifestation of the Promised One. At the instigation of
Siyyid Muḥammad-i-Iṣfahání (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-192">192</a>),
Mírzá Yaḥyá betrayed the trust of the Báb, claimed to be His
successor, and intrigued against Bahá’u’lláh, even attempting
to have Him murdered. When Bahá’u’lláh formally declared His
Mission to him in Adrianople, Mírzá Yaḥyá responded by going to
the length of putting forward his own claim to be the recipient of an
independent Revelation. His pretensions were eventually rejected by
all but a few, who became known as Azalís (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-177">177</a>).

himself (see note <a href="#ka_en-5-190">190</a>). Although he was an
adherent of Mírzá Yaḥyá, Siyyid Muḥammad was exiled with
Bahá’u’lláh to ‘Akká. He continued to agitate and plot

A fresh danger now clearly threatened the life of Bahá’u’lláh.
Though He Himself had stringently forbidden His followers, on several
occasions, both verbally and in writing, any retaliatory acts against
their tormentors, and had even sent back to Beirut an irresponsible
Arab convert, who had meditated avenging the wrongs suffered by his
beloved Leader, seven of the companions clandestinely sought out and

The consternation that seized an already oppressed community was
indescribable. Bahá’u’lláh’s indignation knew no bounds.
<i>“Were We,”</i> He thus voices His emotions, in a Tablet
revealed shortly after this act had been committed, <i>“to make
mention of what befell Us, the heavens would be rent asunder and the
mountains would crumble.”</i> <i>“My captivity,”</i> He wrote
on another occasion, <i>“cannot harm Me. That which can harm Me is
the conduct of those who love Me, who claim to be related to Me, and

envisage two stages in this process. The first stage is to consist of
the selection of an existing language or an invented one which would
then be taught in all the schools of the world as an auxiliary to the
mother tongues. The governments of the world through their
parliaments are called upon to effect this momentous enactment. The

Concerning the <i>“second”</i> sign which Bahá’u’lláh

states that Bahá’u’lláh, “…in His Most Holy Book, has
enjoined the selection of a single language and the adoption of a
common script for all on earth to use, an injunction which, when
carried out, would, as He Himself affirms in that Book, be one of the
signs of the <i>‘coming of age of the human race.’</i>” 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
Further insight into this process of mankind’s coming of age and
proceeding to maturity is provided by the following statement of
