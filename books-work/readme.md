## Books Work Process

New books go through several stages preparing them for import

### Book Prep

1. add raw books to the first folder (1. raw-notproofed) then clean up text in text editor, including:
   1. Replacing quotes with smart quotes
   2. Replacing double-dashes with M-dash
   3. Wrapping quotes in author-quote tags (in the case of central figures)
   4. Optionally adding paragraph and page markers
   
2. Use the "Ocean Tools" import command to format the text (moving it into the folder "2. formatted-notproofed"
    3. Run the Baha'i-proofing script and fix Baha'i terms
    4. Ensure we have audio-reading for all words in book
4. Move text to "3. terms-corrected"
    4. Print and proofread text.
5. Move text to "4. proofed-done"
    6. Use "Ocean Tools" build script to build "books-completed" version

### Publishing

1. Assign language librarians the task of creating text alignment files for this book
2. Begin building reading guides
3. Generate reader's PDF and send off for audio reading
