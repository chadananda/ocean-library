### Table Talks

The subjects of the great king are continually changing. Some pass away, but others come. Sometimes we see some of the countries rising, while others flourish. Thus it is with the reign of God.

There are many instances which prove the world to be muck older than 5,000 years.

For this reason the Báb and the Blessed Perfection said before the appearance of the First Adam, an hundred thousand Ads appeared upon the earth,
