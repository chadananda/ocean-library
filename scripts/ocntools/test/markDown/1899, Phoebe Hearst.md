Mr. Isaiah N. Bradford.
   Hubbard Minn.
   My dear Sir.  

Your letter of Oct. 24th, was duly received and I regret my inability to reply to it sooner. But I had left my California home when it arrive there, so it was forwarded to me here; however I take pleasure in answering your questions, as it gives me great happiness to enlighten any Truth seeker regarding the "Holy City" and the Blessed Master who dwells therein.
Although my stay in ‘Akká was very short, as I was there only three days, yet I assure you those three days were the most memorable days of my life. Still I feel incapable of describing them in the slightest degree.  

From a material standpoint everything was very simple and plain, but the spiritual atmosphere which pervaded the place and was manifested in the lives and actions among the Believers was truly wonderful and something I had never before experienced. One need but to see them to know that they are a Holy people, the Master I will not attempt to describe. I will only state that I believe with all my heart, that He is the Master and that my greatest blessing in this world – is that I have been privileged to be in His Presence and looked upon His sanctified and Glorious Face.  

His life is truly the Christ life and His whole being radiates purity and Holiness.  Without a doubt,  ‘Abbás Effendi is the "Messiah" of this day and generation, and we need not look for another.  

Hoping some you will find the joy that has come into my life from accepting the Truth as revealed in these great days.  

I am very
  sincerely yours,
  (Signed) Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst
