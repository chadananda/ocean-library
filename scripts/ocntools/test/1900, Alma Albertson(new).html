<p id='1'>The subjects of the great king are continually changing. Some pass away, but others come. Sometimes we see some of the countries rising, while others flourish. Thus it is with the reign of God. Sometime it is greater than at other times. Events are continually taking place in the world. One that occurred a thousand years ago is forgotten in one that is taking place today. Some events occur which take away the memory of all past incidents. The incidents which occurred previous to the coming of Adam have all vanished, because those which have occurred since have entirely erased them from the mind of man.</p>

<p id='2'>The Bab said: “The day of Adam is as compared with the Day of the Blessed Perfection, as a child in the womb of its mother beside a full grown and perfect man." He did not mean that the world was then in its infancy, it that the Bounties of God then poured out upon all the people of those days were so much less than those manifested in the days the Blessed Perfection. The day of Adam was as the rising of the sun; the Day of the Blessed Perfection as the Full noontime. The joy, fragrance and spirituality in the time of Moses compared with that in the day of Jesus was like a river compared to the sea. The Science of geology also proves the work is not so young. There are many instances which prove the world to be muck older than 5,000 years.</p>

<p id='3'>The Pyramids prove this. It takes thousands and thousands of years for each of the strata of the earth to be formed. Therefore it is impossible for the earth to be only five or seven thousand years old. Man reaches maturity in about fifteen years. Row is it possible for the whole contingent world to attain perfection in about 5,000 years? When God sees that the people are becoming agnostics He causes some incidents to occur which replace those of the past; that the people will return from their heedlessness and seek the center of these great events. For this reason the Bab and the Blessed Perfection said before the appearance of the First Adam, an hundred thousand Ads appeared upon the earth,</p>
